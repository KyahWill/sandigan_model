				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Tan Soo&nbsp; Huat,&nbsp; plaintiff,&nbsp; obtained&nbsp; a money&nbsp; judgment against Pedro F. Ongwico, defendant, in civil case No. 41907 of the Court of First Instance of Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issuance of a writ of execution the&nbsp; provincial&nbsp; sheriff of Tayabas levied on two parcels of land belonging to the defendant and sold them&nbsp; to Ignacio Uy&nbsp; Quimco,&nbsp; as the highest bidder&nbsp; for P2,487.65.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; section 463&nbsp; of the Code of Civil Procedure,&nbsp; certificates&nbsp; of sale&nbsp; dated September&nbsp; 13 and December 9,1933, were issued to the vendee, subject to the right of repurchase within one&nbsp; year as provided in the aforecited section and in sections 464 and 465 of the same Code.<br><br>The period for redemption expired and neither the judgment debtor nor any&nbsp; other person had repurchased the property.&nbsp; The purchaser having died, his judicial administrator, Monico Uy Yt, filed&nbsp; a motion in the case asking that the provincial sheriff be ordered to issue to him the final certificates of sale pursuant to&nbsp; section 466 of said Code and to place him in possession of the property.&nbsp; The defendant challenged the motion in writing alleging that the court was without jurisdiction over the subject matter involved therein.&nbsp; The latter,&nbsp; however, after trial, granted the motion&nbsp; and&nbsp; ordered the provincial sheriff to issue the final certificates of sale and to place&nbsp; the movant in possession&nbsp; of the property purchased by&nbsp; the deceased.&nbsp; Having presented a motion for reconsideration which was denied, the defendant brought this appeal.<br><br>Defendant's brief assigns two errors, namely, that the court went against the&nbsp; law in ordering&nbsp; the&nbsp; provincial sheriff to yield&nbsp; possession to&nbsp; the movant of the&nbsp; property purchased&nbsp; by his predecessor at the public sale, and&nbsp; in denying his motion for&nbsp; reconsideration.<br><br>Defendant insists that the court was without jurisdiction to order the sheriff to&nbsp; place the movant in possession&nbsp; of tile&nbsp; property&nbsp; sold.&nbsp; Without&nbsp; pointing out&nbsp; any applicable law, defendant&nbsp; cites American&nbsp; authorities to&nbsp; the&nbsp; effect that in the absence of any legal rule, the purchaser cannot go upon the&nbsp; real property purchased at a judicial sale, but&nbsp; should&nbsp; bring a separate action for the recovery&nbsp; of ownership or for ejectment, as the case may be.<br><br>In Pabico vs. Ong&nbsp; Pauco&nbsp; (43 Phil.,&nbsp; 572),&nbsp; Flores&nbsp; vs. Lim&nbsp; (50 Phil.,&nbsp; 738), and Powell vs. National Bank (54 Phil., 54), we have held, contrary to the ruling in Diaz vs. Azcune (31 Phil., 213),&nbsp; that in&nbsp; this jurisdiction the purchaser at a sheriff's sale of real property is not entitled to have&nbsp; possession thereof within&nbsp; the year fixed by law for its redemption; but this&nbsp; case is not applicable&nbsp; to the case at&nbsp; hand,&nbsp; because the period&nbsp; of redemption has&nbsp; already expired,&nbsp; and the movant is to be placed in possession after the issuance and delivery of the final certificates of sale.&nbsp; The form of the deed&nbsp; of sale found&nbsp; in section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure says in part that by&nbsp; virtue of said deed the purchaser is entitled to have and to hold the purchased property.&nbsp; The, in our opinion, means that the purchaser is entitled&nbsp; to go immediately upon the real property and that it is the sheriff's inescapable duty to place him in such possession.<br><br>There&nbsp; is&nbsp; no law in this jurisdiction&nbsp; whereby the purchaser at a sheriff's sale of&nbsp; real property is&nbsp; obliged to bring a separate and independent suit for possession after the one-year period for redemption has expired and after he has obtained the sheriff's final certificate of sale.&nbsp; There is neither legal ground nor reason of public policy precluding the&nbsp; court&nbsp; from ordering the&nbsp; sheriff in this case to yield possession of the property purchased at public auction where it appears&nbsp; that the judgment&nbsp; debtor is the one in possession&nbsp; thereof and no rights&nbsp; of third persons are&nbsp; involved.<br><br>In view of the&nbsp; fact that the period of redemption has expired,&nbsp; that the right to redeem has not been exercised, and that the judgment debtor, and not a third&nbsp; person, is in possession of the&nbsp; real property&nbsp; sold,&nbsp; we hold that the movant is entitled to the&nbsp; issuance of the deeds of sale and to the possession prayed&nbsp; for,&nbsp; not being obliged to bring a separate action for possession.<br><br>Being&nbsp; founded&nbsp; upon the same grounds which we held untenable,&nbsp; the court properly denied the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Wherefore, the appealed order is affirmed, with the costs in this instance to the&nbsp; defendant-appellant.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a,&nbsp; C.&nbsp; J.,&nbsp; Villa-Real,&nbsp; Abad&nbsp; Santos, Diaz,</i> and <i>Laurel, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
