				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The defendant is a domestic corporation organized in accordance with the laws 
of the Philippine Islands and engaged in the publication of a Chinese newspaper 
styled <em>Kong Li Po</em>. Its articles of incorporation and by-laws are in the 
usual form and provide for a board of directors and for other officers, among 
them a president whose duty it is to "sign all contracts and other instruments 
of writing." No special provision is made for a business or general manager. 
Some time during the year 1919 one C. C. Chen or T. C. Chen was appointed 
general business manager of the newspaper. During the month of December of that 
year he entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs by which the latter bound 
themselves to do the necessary printing for the newspaper for the sum of P580 
per month as alleged in the complaint. Under this agreement the plaintiffs 
worked for the defendant from January 1, 1920, until January 31, 1921, when they 
were discharged by the new manager, Tan Tian Hong, who had been appointed in the 
meantime, C. C. Chen having left for China. The letter of dismissal stated no 
special reasons for the discharge of the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs thereupon brought the present action alleging, among other 
things, in the complaint that their contract of employment was for a term of 
three years from the first day of January, 1920; that in the case of their 
discharge by the defendant without just cause before the expiration of the term 
of the contract, they were to receive full pay for the remaining portion of the 
term; that they had been so discharged without just cause and therefore asked 
judgment for damages in the sum of P20,880. In its amended answer the defendant 
denies generally and specifically the allegations of the complaint and sets up 
five special defenses and counterclaims. The first of these is to the effect 
that C. C. Chen, the person whose name appears to have been signed to the 
contract of employment was not authorized by the defendant to execute such a 
contract in its behalf. The second special defense and counterclaim is to the 
effect that during the month of January, 1921, the plaintiffs purposely delayed 
the issuance of defendant's newspaper on three separate and distinct occasions 
causing damage and injury to the defendant in the amount of P300. Under the 
third special defense and counterclaim it is alleged that the plaintiffs failed, 
neglected, and refused to prepare extra pages for the January 1, 1921, issue of 
the defendant's newspaper and thus compelled the defendant to secure the 
preparation of said extra pages by other persons at a cost of P110. In the 
fourth special defense and counterclaim the defendant alleged that the 
plaintiffs neglected and failed to correct errors in advertisements appearing in 
defendant's newspaper, although their attention was specifically called to such 
errors and they were requested to make the corrections, as a result of which 
certain advertisers withdrew their patronage from the paper and refused to pay 
for the advertisements, thus causing a loss to the defendant of P160.50. For its 
fifth special defense and counterclaim the defendant alleged that the plaintiffs 
neglected and refused to do certain job printing, such neglect and refusal 
causing injury and damage to the defendant in the sum of P150.</p>
<p>At the trial of the case the plaintiffs presented in evidence Exhibit A which 
purports to be a contract between Chen and the plaintiffs and which provides 
that in the event the plaintiffs should be discharged without cause before the 
expiration of the term of three years from January 1, 1920, they would be given 
full pay for the unexpired portion of the term "even if the said paper has to 
fall into bankruptcy." The contract is signed by the plaintiffs and also bears 
the signature "C. C. Chen, manager of Kong Li Po." The authenticity of the 
latter signature is questioned by the defendant, but the court below found that 
the evidence upon this point preponderated in favor of the plaintiffs and there 
appears to be no sufficient reason to disturb this finding.</p>
<p>The trial court further found that the contract had been impliedly ratified 
by the defendant and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of 
P13,340, with interest from the date of the filing of the complaint and the 
costs. From this judgment the defendant appeals to this court and makes eighteen 
assignments of error. The fourth and seventeenth assignments relate to 
defendant's special defenses and counterclaims; the sum and substance of the 
other assignments is that the contract on which the action is based was not 
signed by C. C. Chen; that, in any event, C. C. Chen had no power or authority 
to bind the defendant corporation by such contract; and that there was no 
ratification of the contract by the corporation.</p>
<p>Before entering upon a discussion of the questions raised by the assignments 
of error, we may draw attention to a matter which has not been mentioned either 
by counsel or by the court below, but which, to prevent misunderstanding, should 
be briefly explained: It is averred in the complaint that it is accompanied by a 
copy of the contract between the parties (Exhibit A) which copy, by the terms of 
the complaint, is made a part thereof. The copy is not set forth in the bill of 
exceptions and aside from said averment, there is no indication that the copy 
actually accompanied the complaint, but an examination of the record of the case 
in the Court of First Instance shows that a translation of the contract was 
attached to the complaint and served upon the defendant. As this translation may 
be considered a copy and as the defendant failed to deny its authenticity under 
oath, it will perhaps be said that under section 103 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure the omission to so deny it constitutes an admission of the genuineness 
and due execution of the document as well as of the agent's authority to bind 
the defendant. (Merchant <em>vs.</em> International Banking Corporation, 6 
Phil., 314.)</p>
<p>In ordinary circumstances that would be true. But this case appears to have 
been tried upon the theory that the rule did not apply; at least, it was wholly 
overlooked or disregarded by both parties. The plaintiffs at the beginning of 
the trial presented a number of witnesses to <em>prove the due execution of the 
document as well as the agent's authority; no objections were made to the 
defendant's evidence in refutation and no exceptions taken</em>; and the matter 
is not mentioned in the decision of the trial court.</p>
<p>The object of the rule is "to relieve a party of the trouble and expense of 
proving in the first instance an alleged fact, the existence or nonexistence of 
which is necessarily within the knowledge of the adverse party, and of the 
necessity (to his opponent's case) of establishing which such adverse party is 
notified by his opponent's pleading." (Nery Lim-Chingco <em>vs.</em> Terariray, 
5 Phil., at p. 124.)</p>
<p>The plaintiff may, of course, waive the rule and that is what he must be 
considered to have done in the present case by introducing evidence as to the 
execution of the document and failing to object to the defendant's evidence in 
refutation; all this evidence is now competent and the case must be decided 
thereupon. Moreover, the question as to the applicability of the rule is not 
even suggested in the briefs and is not properly before this court. In these 
circumstances it would, indeed, be grossly unfair to the defendant if this court 
should take up the question on its own motion and make it decisive of the case, 
and such is not the law. Nothing of what has here been said is in conflict with 
former decisions of this court; it will be found upon examination that in all 
cases where the applicability of the rule has been sustained the party invoking 
it has relied on it in the court below and conducted his case accordingly.</p>
<p>The principal question presented by the assignments of error is whether Chen 
had the power to bind the corporation by a contract of the character indicated. 
It is conceded that he had no express authority to do so, but the evidence is 
conclusive that he, at the time the contract was entered into, was in effect the 
general business manager of the newspaper Kong Li Po and that he, as such, had 
charge of the printing of the paper, and the plaintiffs maintain that he, as 
such general business manager, had implied authority to employ them on the terms 
stated and that the defendant corporation is bound by his action.</p>
<p>The general rule is that the power to bind a corporation by contract lies 
with its board of directors or trustees, but this power may either expressly or 
impliedly be delegated to other officers or agents of the corporation, and it is 
well settled that except where the authority of employing servants and agents is 
expressly vested in the board of directors or trustees, an officer or agent who 
has general control and management of the corporation's business, or a specific 
part thereof, may bind the corporation by the employment of such agents and 
employees as are usual and necessary in the conduct of such business. But the 
contracts of employment must be reasonable. (14a C. J., 431.)</p>
<p>In regard to the length of the term of employment, Corpus Juris says:</p>
<p>"In the absence of express limitations, a manager has authority to hire an 
employee for such a period as is customary or proper under the circumstances, 
such as for a year, for the season, or for two seasons. But unless he is either 
expressly authorized, or held out as having such authority, he cannot make a 
contract of employment for a long future period, such as for three years, 
although the contract is not rendered invalid by the mere fact that the 
employment extends beyond the term of the manager's own employment. * * *" (14a 
C. J., 431.)</p>
<p>From what has been said, there can be no doubt that Chen, as general manager 
of the <em>Kong Li Po,</em> had implied authority to bind the defendant 
corporation by a reasonable and usual contract of employment with the 
plaintiffs, but we do not think that the contract here in question can be so 
considered. Not only is the term of employment unusually long, but the 
conditions are otherwise so onerous to the defendant that the possibility of the 
corporation being thrown into insolvency thereby is expressly contemplated in 
the same contract. This fact in itself was, in our opinion, sufficient to put 
the plaintiffs upon inquiry as to the extent of the business manager's 
authority; they had not the right to presume that he or any other single officer 
or employee of the corporation had implied authority to enter into a contract of 
employment which might bring about its ruin.</p>
<p>Neither do we think that the contention that the corporation impliedly 
ratified the contract is supported by the evidence. The contention is based 
principally on the fact that Te Kim Hua, the president of the corporation for 
the year 1920, admitted on the witness stand that he saw the plaintiffs work as 
printers in the office of the newspaper. He denied, however, any knowledge of 
the existence of the contract and asserted that it was never presented neither 
to him nor to the board of directors. Before a contract can be ratified 
knowledge of its existence must, of course, be brought home to the parties who 
have authority to ratify it or circumstances must be shown from which such 
knowledge may be presumed. No such knowledge or circumstances have been shown 
here. That the president of the corporation saw the plaintiffs working in its 
office is of little significance; there were other printers working there at 
that time and as the president had nothing to do with their employment, it was 
hardly to be expected that he would inquire into the terms of their contracts. 
Moreover, a ratification by him would have been of no avail; in order to 
validate a contract, a ratification by the board of directors was necessary. The 
fact that the president was required by the by-laws to sign the documents 
evidencing contracts of the corporation, does not mean that he had power to make 
the contracts.</p>
<p>In his decision his Honor, the learned judge of the court below appears to 
have placed some weight on a notice inserted in the January 14th issue of the 
Kong Li Po by T. C. Chen and which, in translation, reads as follows: "To Whom 
It May Concern: Announcement is hereby given that hereafter all contracts, 
agreements and receipts are considered to be null and void unless duly signed by 
T. C. Chen, General Manager of this paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "Chen Yu Man</p></blockquote>
<p align="right"><em>"General Manager of this 
paper"</em></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>(The evidence shows that Chen Yu Man and T. G. Chen is one and the same 
person.)</p>
<p>His Honor evidently overestimated the importance of this notice. It was 
published nearly a month after the contract in question is alleged to have been 
entered into and can therefore not have been one of the circumstances which led 
the plaintiffs to think that Chen had authority to make the contract. It may 
further be observed that the notice confers no special powers, but is, in 
effect, only an assertion by Chen that he would recognize no contracts, 
agreements, and receipts not duly signed by him. It may be presumed that the 
contracts, agreements, and receipts were such as were ordinarily made in the 
course of the business of managing the newspaper. There is no evidence to show 
that the notice was ever brought to the attention of the officers of the 
defendant corporation.</p>
<p>The defendant's counterclaims have not been sufficiently established by the 
evidence.</p>
<p>The judgment appealed from is reversed and the defendant corporation is 
absolved from the complaint. No costs will be allowed. So 
ordered.</p><em>Johnson, Avancena</em>, and <em>Romualdez, JJ.</em>, concur.

<p align="center"><em>CONCURRING OPINION</em></p>
<p><strong>STREET, J.:</strong></p>
<p>I concur in the opinion of the court written by Mr. Justice Ostrand and wish 
to add an observation of my own on one or two points. In the first place I find 
nothing in the opinion of the court inconsistent with the decision in Ramirez 
<em>vs.</em> Orientalist Co. and Fernandez (38 Phil., 634). In that case we held 
that where a corporation wishes to raise the question as to the authority of an 
officer who has signed a contract purporting to bind the corporation, it should 
plead the lack of authority by way of special defense. In this case the 
defendant raised the point properly in its answer. This is something that was 
not done in the Ramirez case. Upon the issue thus presented the parties 
submitted their proof, and no notice was taken by any one of the failure of the 
defendant to verify its plea on this point by the oath of some proper officer. 
If the plaintiffs had raised a question as to the lack of the affidavit in the 
court below, as it might have done by objecting to testimony or moving to strike 
this special defense out of the answer, the oversight could have been corrected 
at once. On the contrary the parties proceeded on the mutual assumption that the 
point was properly raised, and the oversight should be ignored in this court. In 
the Ramirez case we held that the omission of the defendant to submit such 
special defense under oath might be cured by amendment even in this court, and 
we might here permit the amendment of the answer, if necessary to the 
administration of justice; but this step must be considered wholly superfluous 
in view of the course things have taken.</p>
<p>On the principal point in the case, namely, whether one C. C. Chen or T. C. 
Chen, who was running the <em>Kong Li Po,</em> had authority to bind the 
corporation to the plaintiffs by a contract for the term of three years, I find 
that the authorities fully support the proposition quoted in the opinion from 
Corpus Juris to the effect that a manager cannot make a contract of employment 
for a long period, such as for three years, unless expressly authorized or held 
out by the corporation as having such authority. The distinction here, as I see 
it, is not so much a distinction between the reasonable and the unreasonable as 
it is between the usual and unusual, or the ordinary and extraordinary. There 
must be a limit somewhere upon the authority of a manager with respect to the 
duration of contracts which he makes for the corporation, and my eye has fallen 
upon no decision in which a contract for the period of three years, or longer, 
has been upheld on the bare fact that the contract was made by a manager, though 
there are cases in which contracts for the period of only one year have been 
sustained.</p>
<p>As sustaining the position taken by the court, the following authorities will 
be found instructive: Laird <em>vs.</em> Michigan Lubricator Co. (17 L. R. A., 
177 [with note]) ; Caldwell <em>vs.</em> Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association 
(53 App. Div. [N. Y.], 245); Carney <em>vs.</em> New York Life Ins. Co. (162 N.. 
Y., 453; 49 L. R. A., 471 [with note]) ; Vogel <em>vs.</em> St. Louis Museum (8 
Mo. App., 587); Manross <em>vs.</em> Uncle Sam Oil Co. (88 Kan., 237; Anno. 
Cas., 1914B [with note]). In Gamacho <em>vs.</em> Hamilton Bank-Note &amp; 
Engraving Co. (37 N. Y. Supp.f 725), it was said:</p>"* * * In the absence of 
proof of what exact authority belongs to a person descriptively styled a 
'general manager there is no rule by which a court can be guided in determining 
what the powers of such an official really are, except such as the evidence in a 
particular case may furnish of what the person has done in the general course of 
the business of the corporation. That the words 'general manager' would import 
that the person bearing that title is a general executive officer for all the 
ordinary business of the corporation is all that may properly be inferred; and 
this would justify, in connection with proof of acts done, a conclusion that all 
ordinary contracts made by such an official are authorized by the corporation. 
But no presumption of law can be indulged in that, because a person acts as such 
a manager, he has the power to bind his principal to contracts of an 
extraordinary nature, and of such a character as would involve the corporation 
in enormous obligations and for long periods of time. If a general manager, 
simply by virtue of his being charged with the ordinary conduct of the business, 
would have the right to bind his principal to a contract for services for three 
years, involving the obligation to pay thousands of dollars of salary to an 
employee, why may not that power extend indefinitely, so that he may make 
contracts for all employees for indefinite periods, and thus assume to himself a 
power which it cannot be supposed was ever intended to be lodged in him? * * *"

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING OPINION</em></p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM, J.</strong>, with whom concurs<strong> VILLAMOR, J., 
</strong></p>
<p>It is to be regretted that the prevailing opinion either neglects entirely or 
merely makes passing mention of certain points and facts, which demonstrate 
completely the tenability of plaintiffs' action, and the correctness of the 
judgment rendered in their favor by Judge of First Instance M. V. del Rosario. 
To elucidate—</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The action was brought by certain printers on the Chinese newspaper Kong Li 
Po to recover on a written contract made a part of the complaint. The answer of 
the defendant made certain allegations, but failed to deny specifically under 
oath the genuineness and due execution of the instrument sued on. The resulting 
rule is as set forth in Merchant <em>vs.</em> International Banking Corporation 
([1906], 6 Phil., 314),.and many other cases, that failure by the defendant to 
deny under oath the execution of the instrument sued on, a copy of which is 
attached to the complaint, when such instrument purports to be signed by an 
agent of the defendant corporation, is an admission, not only of the genuineness 
of the signature, but also of the authority of the agent to sign it for the 
defendant and the power of the defendant to enter into such a contract, citing 
section 103 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Bausman <em>vs.</em> Credit 
Guarantee Co. ([1891], 47 Minn., 377), and Knight <em>vs.</em> Whitmore ([1899], 
125 Cal., 198). The case for the plaintiffs is thus premised on a written 
instrument which the defendant admits to be genuine, and as to which the 
defendant admits the authority of the agent to accomplish and the power of the 
defendant to make.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Not only is the foregoing true, but the defendant corporation held T. C. Chen 
out to the public as the business manager of the newspaper Kong Li Po and 
clothed him with apparent authority to bind the corporation. The president of 
the corporation admitted as much on the witness stand, while public announcement 
was made as follows:</p>
<p>'To Whom It May Concern: Announcement is hereby given that hereafter all 
contracts, agreements and receipts are considered to be null and void unless 
duly signed by T. C. Chen, General Manager of this paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="right">(Sgd.) "CHEN YU MAN</p></blockquote>
<p align="right">"<em>General Manager of this 
paper'</em></p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>The action of the business manager was thus ratified by his superior officers 
and they are now in estoppel to deny such ratification. As held in the case of 
Macke <em>vs.</em> Camps ([1907], 7 Phil., 553), one who clothes another with 
apparent authority as his agent and holds him out to the public as such, cannot 
be permitted to deny the authority of such person to act as his agent in good 
faith and in the honest belief that he is what he appears to be. Unless the 
contrary appears, the authority of an agent must be presumed to include all the 
necessary and usual means of carrying his agency into effect, citing section 
333, subsection 1, of the Code of Civil Procedure, and various cases. <em>See 
also</em> articles 1259, 1311, and 1313 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>The case of Ramirez <em>vs.</em> Orientalist Co. and Fernandez ([1918], 38 
Phil., 634, 641) is markedly similar to the instant one in the two respects here 
mentioned. In the opinion in the cited case. Mr. Justice Street, speaking for 
the court, said:</p>
<p>"As to the liability of the corporation a preliminary point of importance 
arises upon the pleadings. The action, as already stated, is based upon 
documents purporting to be signed by the Orientalist Company, and copies of the 
documents are set out in the complaint. It was therefore incumbent upon the 
corporation, if it desired to question the authority of Fernandez to bind it, to 
deny the due execu tion of said contracts under oath, as prescribed in section 
103 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>"No sworn answer denying the genuineness and due execution of the contracts 
in question or questioning the authority of Ramon J. Fernandez to bind the 
Orientalist Company was filed in this case; but evidence was admitted without 
objection from the plaintiff, tending to snow that Ramon J. Fernandez had no 
such authority. This evidence consisted of extracts from the minutes of the 
proceedings of the company's board of directors and also of extracts from the 
minutes of the proceedings of the company's stockholders, showing that the 
making of this contract had been under consideration in both bodies and that the 
authority to make the same had been withheld by the stockholders. It therefore 
becomes necessary for us to consider whether the admission resulting from the 
failure of the defendant company to deny the execution of the contracts under 
oath is binding upon it for all purposes of this lawsuit, or whether such 
failure should be considered a mere irregularity of procedure which was waived 
when the evidence referred to was admitted without objection from the plaintiff. 
The proper solution of this problem makes it necessary to consider carefully the 
principle underlying the provision above quoted.</p>
<p>"That the situation was one in which an answer under oath denying the 
authority of the agent should have been interposed, supposing that the company 
desired to contest this point, is not open to question."</p>
<p>Then after citing Merchant <em>vs.</em> International Banking Corporation, 
<em>supra,</em> and other cases approvingly, the writer of the opinion 
continued:</p>
<p>"The reason for the rule enunciated in the foregoing authorities will, we 
think, be readily appreciated. In dealing with corporations the public at large 
is bound to rely to a large extent upon outward appearances. If a man is found 
acting for a corporation with the external indicia of authority, any person, not 
having notice of want of authority, may usually rely upon those appearances; and 
if it be found that the directors had permitted the agent to exercise that 
authority and thereby held him out as a person competent to bind the 
corporation, or had acquiesced in a contract and retained the benefit supposed 
to have been conferred by it, the corporation will be bound, notwithstanding the 
actual authority may never have been granted. The public is not supposed nor 
required to know the transactions which happen around the table where the 
corporate board of directors or the stockholders are from time to time convoked. 
Whether a particular officer actually possesses the authority which he assumes 
to exercise is frequently known to very few, and the proof of it usually is not 
readily accessible to the stranger who deals with the corporation on the faith 
of the ostensible authority exercised by some of the corporate officers. It is 
therefore reasonable, in a case where an officer of a corporation has made a 
contract in its name, that the corporation should be required, if it denies his 
authority, to state such defense in its answer. By this means the plaintiff is 
apprised of the fact that the agent's authority is contested; and he is given an 
opportunity to adduce evidence showing either that the authority existed or that 
the contract was ratified and approved.</p>
<p>"We are of the opinion that the failure of the defendant corporation to make 
any issue in its answer with regard to the authority of Ramon J. Fernandez to 
bind it, and particularly its failure to deny specifically under oath the 
genuineness and due execution of the contracts sued upon, have the effect of 
eliminating the question of his authority from the case, considered as a matter 
of mere pleading.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>"We shall now consider the liability of the defendant company on the merits 
just as if that liability had been properly put in issue by a specific answer 
under oath denying the authority of Fernandez to bind it. Upon this question it 
must at the outset be premised that Ramon J. Fernandez, as treasurer, had no 
independent authority to bind the company by signing its name to the letters in 
question. It is declared in section 28 of the Corporation Law that corporate 
powers shall be exercised, and all corporate business conducted by the board of 
directors'; and this principle is recognized in the by-laws of the corporation 
in question which contain a provision declaring that the power to make contracts 
shall be vested in the board of directors. It is true that it is also declared 
in the same by-laws that the president shall have the power, and it shall be his 
duty, to sign contracts; but this has reference rather to the formality of 
reducing to proper form the contracts which are authorized by the board and is 
not intended to confer an independent power to make contracts binding on the 
corporation.</p>
<p align="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>"In passing upon the liability of a corporation in cases of this kind it is 
always well to keep in mind the situation as it presents itself to the third 
party with whom the contract is made. Naturally he can have little or no 
information as to what occurs in corporate meetings; and he must necessarily 
rely upon the external manifestations of corporate consent. The integrity of 
commercial transactions can only be maintained by holding the corporation 
strictly to the liability fixed upon it by its agents in accordance with law; 
and we would be sorry to announce a doctrine which would permit the property of 
a man in the City of Paris to be whisked out of his hands and carried into a 
remote quarter of the earth without recourse against the corporation whose name 
and authority had been used in the manner disclosed in this case. As already 
observed, it is familiar doctrine that if a corporation knowingly permits one of 
its officers, or any other agent, to do acts within the scope of an apparent 
authority, and thus holds him out to the public as possessing power to do those 
acts, the corporation will, as against any one who has in good faith dealt with 
the corporation through such agent, be estopped from denying his authority; and 
where it is said 'if the corporation permits' this means the same as 'if the 
thing is permitted by the directing power of the corporation.' "It being 
determined that the corporation is bound by the contracts in question, it 
remains to consider the character of the liability assumed by Ramon J. 
Fernandez, in affixing his personal signature to said contracts. * * *"</p>
</li><li>The court really decides the case in favor of the appellant on a legal point 
<em>which was not raised in the lower court, which was not assigned as an error 
in this court, and which was not argued in the brief of the appellant</em>. This 
point is that the contract of employment made by the business manager of Kong Li 
Po with the plaintiffs was unusually long and onerous and was not binding on the 
corporation. The legal rule so announced, while having much to commend it, 
abstractly, can only be applied in the Philippines to the instant case, 
concretely. Our understanding of the meager demand for technical employees on 
newspapers in the Philippines, and particularly for technical employees on 
Chinese newspapers, is that a contract extending over a period of three years 
and calling for the payment of a salary of P480 per month for three persons, 
which contract was entered into in a written instrument by the business manager 
of the paper, presumably under genuine power but at any rate under apparent 
power, and which contract was ratified by the officers of the corporation, is 
not invalid. To continue the quotation from volume 14a Corpus Juris, pages 431, 
432, where it stops in the prevailing opinion: The contract is not rendered 
invalid "where there is no abuse of the manager's authority and no fraud 
practiced, and where the contract is definite in terms, duly accepted, and the 
work entered upon." (McGuire <em>vs.</em> Old Sweet Springs Co. [1913], 73 W. 
Va., 321.) Volume 2, Thompson on Corporations, sections 1576 to 1583 can be read 
with profit.

<p>For three fundamental reasons, therefore, it is my firm opinion that the 
contract sued on should be held valid and enforcible and that as was done in the 
lower court, the plaintiff should obtain redress pursuant to this contract.</p>
<p>My vote is for straight affirmance.</p>
