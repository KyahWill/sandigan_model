				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case was prosecuted upon the following information:<br><blockquote>"That on or&nbsp; about the 2d day of January,&nbsp; 1936,&nbsp; in the City&nbsp; of Manila,&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Islands,&nbsp; the&nbsp; said&nbsp; accused&nbsp; did then&nbsp; and there willfully, unlawfully&nbsp; and feloniously, with intent of gain, with grave abuse of confidence, and without the consent of the owners thereof, who were then his&nbsp; housemates,&nbsp; take, steal and carry away the following personal property belonging to Lue Hok, to wit: <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="69%">One (1) undershirt colored dark green valued at.</td><td width="31%"><div align="right">1.35</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right"></div></td></tr><tr><td>The following personal property belonging to Kong Min, to wit: </td><td><div align="right"></div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="right"></div></td></tr><tr><td><p>One (1) pair of black leather shoes, valued at and the following personal property belonging to Ng Hook, to wit:</p></td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">3.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>One (1) leather belt, valued at.</td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">2.40</div></td></tr><tr><td>One (1) woolen pants strip black, valued at.</td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">1.75</div></td></tr><tr><td>One (1) pair of golden cuff-links, valued at</td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">.80</div></td></tr><tr><td>One (1) comb, valued at.</td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">10</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">One (1) leather wallet, valued at.containing:</td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">1.20</div></td></tr><tr><td>P7.47 in bills and coins of different denominations</td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">7.47</div></td></tr><tr><td>One (1) promissory note payable to Ng Hook with the amount of P900 Hongkong money.</td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">500.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>Two (2) pictures of Ng Hook and his son (no value) One (1) cedula (1935) of Ng Hook (no value) Eight (8) Chinese coins, all valued</td><td valign="bottom"> <div align="right">.04</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">________</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td valign="bottom"><div align="right">518.11 </div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote></blockquote>to the damage and prejudice of the&nbsp; said owners in the total&nbsp; sum of P518.11,&nbsp; Philippine currency.<br><blockquote>"That the said accused&nbsp; is a habitual delinquent having been&nbsp; convicted&nbsp; once of the&nbsp; crime&nbsp; of qualified&nbsp; theft, on January 31, 1935,&nbsp; and. once of theft on November 8, 1935, by virtue of final judgments rendered by competent courts, his last date of release being December 31, 1935."</blockquote>Having pleaded guilty to the charges in the former information, the appellant was sentenced, as author of the crime of qualified theft, to four years, two months and one day of <i>prision&nbsp; correctional</i> to indemnify the offended party in the sum of P511.86&nbsp; (not recovered),&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; corresponding subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and, being&nbsp; a habitual delinquent, also to the additional penalty of two years,&nbsp; four months and one day&nbsp; of <span style="font-style: italic;">prision correceional.</span><br><br>The defense contends in&nbsp; this instance that&nbsp; the crime charged&nbsp; is simple theft.&nbsp; This&nbsp; court finds that this contention is&nbsp; well taken.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; allegation in&nbsp; the information that the crime was committed with the qualifying circumstance of grave abuse of confidence, is a mere conclusion of law.&nbsp; The&nbsp; only fact alleged as constituting said circumstance is that the&nbsp; accused and&nbsp; the&nbsp; offended party&nbsp; were housemates when the&nbsp; crime was committed.&nbsp; While&nbsp; this fact constitutes&nbsp; a&nbsp; certain&nbsp; abuse&nbsp; of&nbsp; confidence,&nbsp; because living together under the same roof, although accidentally, engenders&nbsp; some&nbsp; confidence,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; necessarily grave, there being no allegation&nbsp; in the information&nbsp; of another relation, by reason&nbsp; of dependence,&nbsp; guardianship&nbsp; or vigilance,&nbsp; between the&nbsp; accused and the offended party, that might create a higher&nbsp; degree of confidence between them, which the accused could abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Decisions of the Supreme Court of Spain of January 19, 1882, and April&nbsp; 13, 1893.)<br><br>This court finds no merit in the allegation of the defense that the sum&nbsp; of P500,&nbsp; representing&nbsp; the amount of the promissory note stolen, should&nbsp; not be taken&nbsp; into consideration in determining the liability of the&nbsp; accused, on the ground that the promissory note is of no value.&nbsp; Said promissory note may not be of value to the appellant but it undoubtedly is of value to&nbsp; the offended party&nbsp; (U.&nbsp; S. vs. Wickershan, 20 Phil.,&nbsp; 440; and U. S. vs. Raboy, 25 Phil., 1), and this is sufficient to make the taking thereof constitute the crime of theft.<br><br>The lower&nbsp; court&nbsp; sentenced the appellant&nbsp; to&nbsp; indemnify the offended party in the sum&nbsp; of P511.86, which includes the sum of P500, amount of the promissory note.&nbsp; How- ever, it does not appear in the information that the offended party has been deprived of this amount, inasmuch, as after recovering the promissory note he could have&nbsp; obtained payment thereof,&nbsp; and even without the promissory note,&nbsp; it could have been&nbsp; paid him.&nbsp; Consequently there was&nbsp; no justification in sentencing the appellant to pay the sum of ?500 to the offended&nbsp; party, with no allegation&nbsp; in the information&nbsp; that the offended party was really deprived of said amount.<br><br>The crime charged being simple theft, it being understood that the principal penalty imposed upon&nbsp; the appellant&nbsp; is two years,&nbsp; eleven months and&nbsp; eleven days, and eliminating the order to pay the&nbsp; sum of P500 to the offended party from the decision, with&nbsp; reservation of the civil action in connection&nbsp;&nbsp; with said amount,&nbsp; the appealed sentence&nbsp; is affirmed&nbsp; in all other respect,&nbsp; with costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Villa-Real, Abad Santos, Imperial, Diaz,</i> and <i>Recto, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
