				<BR><STRONG>BUTTE, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">This case is before us on a petition for review of 
an order of the Public Service Commission entered December 21, 1932, 
granting to the Rural Transit Company, Ltd., a certificate of public 
convenience to operate a transportation service between I lagan in the 
Province of Isabela and Tuguegarao in the Province of Cagayan, and 
additional trips in its existing express service between Manila and 
Tuguegarao.
</p><p align="justify"> On June 4, 1932, the Rural Transit Company, Ltd., a 
Philippine corporation, filed with the Public Service Commission an 
application in which it is stated in substance that it is the holder of a
 certificate of public convenience to operate a passenger bus service 
between Manila and Tuguegarao; that it is the only operator of direct 
service between said points and the present authorized schedule of only 
one trip daily is not sufficient; that it will be also to the public 
convenience to grant the applicant a certificate for a new service 
between Tuguegarao and Ilagan.</p>
<p align="justify"> On July 22, 1932, the appellant, Red Line 
Transportation Company, filed an opposition to the said application 
alleging in substance that as to the service between Tuguegarao and 
Ilagan, the oppositor already holds a certificate of public convenience 
and is rendering adequate and satisfactory service; that the granting of
 the application of the Rural Transit Company, Ltd., would not serve 
public convenience but would constitute a ruinous competition for the 
oppositor over said route.</p>
<p align="justify"> After testimony was taken, the commission, on 
December 21, 1932, approved the application of the Rural Transit 
Company, Ltd., and ordered that the certificate of public convenience 
applied for be "issued to the applicant Rural Transit Company, Ltd.," 
with the condition, among others, that "all the other terms and 
conditions of the various certificates of public convenience of the 
herein applicant and herein incorporated are made a part hereof."</p>
<p align="justify"> On January 14, 1933, the oppositor Red Line 
Transportation Company filed a motion for rehearing and reconsideration 
in which it called the commission's attention to the fact that there was
 pending in the Court of First Instance of Manila case No. 42343, an 
application for the voluntary dissolution of the corporation, Rural 
Transit Company, Ltd. Said motion for reconsideration was1 set down for 
hearing on March 24, 1933. On March 23, 1933, the Rural Transit Company,
 Ltd., the applicant, filed a motion for postponement. This motion was 
verified by M. Olsen who swears "that he was the secretary of the Rural 
Transit Company, Ltd., in the above entitled case." Upon the hearing of 
the motion for reconsideration, the commission admitted without 
objection the following documents filed in said case No. 42343 in the 
Court of First Instance of Manila for the dissolution of the Rural 
Transit Company, Ltd., the petition for dissolution dated July 6, 1932, 
the decision of the said Court of First Instance of Manila, dated 
February 28, 1933, decreeing the dissolution of the Rural Transit 
Company, Ltd.</p>
<p align="justify"> At the trial of this case before the Public Service 
Commission an issue was raised as to who was the real party in interest 
making the application, whether the Rural Transit Company, Ltd., as 
appeared on the face of the application, or the Bachrach Motor Company, 
Inc., using the name of the Rural Transit Company, Ltd., as a trade 
name. The evidence given by the applicant's secretary, Olsen, is 
certainly very dubious and confusing, as may be seen from the following:</p>

  <p align="justify">"A. I do not know what the legal construction or 
relationship existing between the two.</p>

Bachrach Motor Company?</p>
  <p align="justify"> "A. I do not know. I have not given that phase of 
the matter much thought, as in previous occasion had not necessitated.</p>
  <p align="justify">"Judge. In filing this application, you filed it 
for the operator on that line? Is it not?</p>
  <p align="justify">"A. Yes, sir.</p>
  <p align="justify">'Judge. Who is that operator?</p>

  <p align="justify"> "Espeleta. The Rural Transit Company, Ltd., is a 
corporation duly established in accordance with the laws* of the 
Philippine Islands.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "Judge. According to the records of this 
commission the Bachrach Motor Company is the owner of the certificates 
and the Rural Transit Company, Ltd., is operating without any 
certificate.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "Judge. If you filed this application for the 
Rural Transit Company, Ltd., and afterwards it is found out that the 
Rural Transit Company, Ltd., is not an operator, everything will be 
turned down.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "Judge. My question was, when you filed this 
application you evidently made it for the operator ?</p>
  <p align="justify"> "A. Yes, sir.</p>
  <p align="justify">"Judge. Who was that operator you had in mind?</p>
  <p align="justify">"A. According to the status of the ownership of the
 certificates of the former Rural Transit Company, the operator was the 
operator authorized in case No. 23217 to whom all of the assets of the 
former Rural Transit Company were sold.</p>

doing business under the name of the Rural Transit Company, Ltd.?</p>
  <p align="justify"> "A. Yes, sir.</p>
  <p align="justify"> "LOCKWOOD. I move that this case be dismissed, 
your Honor, on the ground that this application was made in the name of 
one party but the real owner is another party.</p>
  <p align="justify">"Espeleta. We object to that petition.</p>
  <p align="justify">"Judge. I will have that in mind when I decide the 
case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">If I agree with you everything would be finished."</p>
<p align="justify"> The Bachrach Motor Company, Inc., entered no 
appearance and ostensibly took no part in the hearing of the application
 of the Rural Transit Company, Ltd. It may be a matter of some surprise 
that the commission did not on its own motion order the amendment of the
 application by substituting the Bachrach Motor Company, Inc., as the 
applicant. However, the hearing proceeded on the application as filed 
and the decision of December 21, 1932, was rendered in favor of the 
Rural Transit Company, Ltd., and the certificate ordered to be issued in
 its name, in the face of the evidence that the said corporation was not
 the real party in interest. In its said decision, the commission 
undertook to meet the objection by referring to its resolution of 
November 26, 1932, entered in another case. This resolution in case No. 
23217 concludes as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "Premises considered we hereby authorize the 
Bachrach Motor Co., Inc., to continue using the name of 'Rural Transit 
Co., Ltd.,' as its trade name in all the applications, motions or other 
petitions to be filed in this commission in connection with said 
business and that this authority is given retroactive effect as of the 
date of filing of the application in this case, to wit, April 28, 1930."</p>
  <p align="justify"> "We know of no law that empowers the Public 
Service Commission or any court in this jurisdiction to authorize one 
corporation to assume the name of another corporation as a trade name. 
Both the Rural Transit Company, Ltd., and the Bachrach Motor Co., Inc., 
are Philippine corporations and the very law of their creation and 
continued existence requires each to adopt and certify a distinctive 
name. The incorporators "constitute a body politic and corporate under 
the name stated in the certificate." (Section 11, Act No. 1459, as 
amended.) A corporation has the power "of succession by its corporate 
name." (Section 13, ibid.) The name of a corporation is therefore 
essential to its existence. It cannot change its name except in the 
manner provided by the statute. By that name alone is it authorized to 
transact business. The law gives a corporation no express or implied 
authority to assume another name that is unappropriated; still less that
 of another corporation, which is expressly set apart for it and 
protected by the law. If any corporation could assume at pleasure as an 
unregistered trade name the name of another corporation, this practice 
would result in confusion and open the door to frauds and evasions and 
difficulties of administration and supervision. The policy of the law as
 expressed in our corporation statute and the Code of Commerce is 
clearly against such a practice. (Cf. Scarsdale Pub. Co.Colonial Press 
vs. Carter, 116 New York Supplement, 731; Svenska Nat. F. I. C. <em>vs.</em>
 Swedish Nat. Assn., 205 Illinois (Appellate Courts], 428, 434.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The order of the commission of November 26, 1932. 
authorizing the Bachrach Motor Co., Incorporated, to assume the name of 
the Rural Transit Co., Ltd., likewise incorporated, as its trade name 
being void, and accepting the order of December 21, 1932, at its face as
 granting a certificate of public convenience to the applicant Rural 
Transit Co., Ltd., the said order last mentioned is set aside and 
vacated on the ground that the Rural Transit Company, Ltd., is not the 
real party in interest and its application was fictitious.</p>
<p align="justify"> In view of the dissolution of the Rural Transit 
Company, Ltd. by judicial decree of February 28, 1933, we do not see how
 we can assess costs against said respondent, Rural Transit Company, 
Ltd.</p>
