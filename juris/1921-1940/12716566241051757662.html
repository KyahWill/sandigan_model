				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Pedro Villaroman appeals to this court from the judgment of the 
Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, the dispositive part of which is as 
follows: 
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"For the foregoing reasons, the court hold that the land 
described in the complaint is the common and undivided property of the 
plaintiffs and defendants, and orders the partition thereof between them in the 
proportions set forth in the complaint, to wit: (a) Of the one-half belonging to 
Julia Mariano, (1) one-third to Manuel Valmonte, (2) onethird in equal parts to 
the children of the deceased Doroteo Valmonte, Engracio, Donata and Esperanza 
surnamed Valmonte, and (3) the one-third belonging to Marcelina Valmonte, 
divided equally between her two grandsons Ricardo, and Marcos surnamed 
Advincula; (b) of the one-half belonging to Buenaventura Valmonte, (1) 
one-seventh in equal parts to Ricardo and Marcos Advincula, (2) oneseventh in 
equal parts to Engracio, Donata, and Esperanza surnamed Valmonte, (3) 
one-seventh to Manuel Valmonte, (4) one-seventh to Dominga Valmonte; (5) 
one-seventh to Ignacia Valmonte, (6) one-seventh to Hipolito Valmonte and (7) 
one-seventh to Maria Valmonte: declaring the defendant Pedro Villaroman 
subrogated to the rights of the coowners who transferred them to him, namely, 
Manuel, Dominga, Ignacia, Hipolito and Maria Valmonte. It is further ordered 
that the defendant render an account of the income received by him from the land 
in question, from the year 1916 until the date of the rendition of said account, 
bringing to the estate for collation the amount of the net profit received by 
him from such portions of the lands not assigned to him, which amount shall be 
divided among the parties in the same proportions as the lands. Without special 
pronouncement as to costs." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In support of his appeal, the appellant assigns the following 
alleged errors as committed by the trial court in its judgment, to wit:<br></p><blockquote>"1. The trial court erred in finding that the defendant and appellant 
Pedro Villaroman has not been in possession of the land in question since the 
15th of July, 1914, as owner, continuously, peacefully, publicly; and adversely. 
<p></p>
<p align="justify">"2. The trial court also erred in holding that the certificate 
of title obtained by the defendant and appellant Pedro Villaroman under the Land 
Registration Law was not conclusive against the whole world, and that the same 
is no bar to an action for partition." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The preponderance of the evidence establishes the following 
points: </p>
<p align="justify">Buenaventura Valmonte and Julia Mariano were husband and wife, 
the latter having died first, leaving three sons named Marcelino, Doroteo and 
Manuel Valmonte. Buenaventura Valmonte contracted a second marriage with 
Celestina Marin by whom he had four children named Dominga, Ignacia, Hipolito 
and Maria Valmonte. Buenaventura Valmonte died in the year 1909, leaving a 
widow, Celestina Marin, and three children by the first marriage, named 
Marcelino, Doroteo and Manuel Valmonte, and four children by the second 
marriage, named Dominga, Ignacia, Hipolito and Maria Valmonte. His son Marcelino 
Valmonte by the first marriage, died leaving a son named Ambrosio Advincula. 
Doroteo Valmonte, his second son by the first marriage, died leaving a widow 
named Constancia Linsangan, and three children named Ernesto, Donata and 
Esperanza Valmonte, who are the herein plaintiffs. His father Buenaventura 
Valmonte and his two brothers Marcelino and Doroteo Valmonte, who having died, 
Manuel Valmonte, with his nephew Hipolito Valmonte, and his nieces Donata, 
Ignacia and Maria Valmonte sold the land the subject matter of the complaint, 
which was one of the several properties left by said Buenaventura Valmonte on 
his death to Pedro Villaroman on July 15, 1914, for the sum of P2,100, P1,100 
payable on the execution of the deed, and the remaining P1,000 in the month of 
December 1914 (Exhibit A). The purchaser Pedro Villaroman having defaulted in 
the payment of the sum of P600, the vendors instituted an action against him on 
February 14, 1926 for the recovery of said balance (Exhibit B). In his answer, 
after making a general and specific denial of the facts alleged in the 
complaint, Pedro Villaroman alleged by way of special defense that the reason 
why he had not paid the rest of the purchase price was that the vendors had 
assured him that they had inherited the land they sold to him from their father 
Doroteo Valmonte, but that it appeared later that the title was in the name of 
Pantaleon Valmonte. In view of the fact that Buenaventura Valmonte's 
grandchildren namely Engracio, Donata and Esperanza Valmonte (children of 
Doroteo Valmonte), and Ambrosio Advincula (son of Marcelino Valmonte), might 
have an interest in said land, he required the said vendors to obtain from said 
grandchildren a waiver of their rights. In order to clear all doubt the vendors 
and the purchaser entered into an agreement whereby the former bound themselves, 
to file a bond in the latter's favor for the sum of P2,100, the purchase price 
of the land in question within the period of five days, and the purchaser in 
turn bound himself to deliver to said vendors the sum of P600, the unpaid 
portion of the purchase price of the land, within the period of ten days, both 
submitting said agreement to the court and praying that judgment be rendered in 
accordance therewith. Engracio, Donata, and Esperanza Valmonte, with their 
mother Constancia Linsangan, appeared at the trial of the case and filed a 
motion alleging that they had an interest in the land sold, and that of the P600 
which is the subject matter of the complaint in this case, was the unpaid 
balance of the purchase price, the P500 rightfully belonging to them, being 
their share of inheritance, and giving their assent the sale provided they 
received said sum of P500, and they prayed the court to award them the same 
(Exhibit E). </p>
<p align="justify">Immediately after having acquired the land in question, Pedro 
Villaroman began to work and cultivate a portion thereof, and on October 
21, 1914, declared it for the purpose of paying the land tax (Exhibit 2), paying 
the corresponding land tax from that date up to the present. </p>
<p align="justify">Subsequently, Pedro Villaroman applied for the registration of 
said land and the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, after having heard the 
evidence presented by the applicant, on November 29, 1923, adjudicated said land 
to him and ordered its registration in his name. When said judgment became final 
the Chief of the Land Registration Office issued the proper decree of 
registration on May 20, 1926, and on the 25th of the same month the 
corresponding certificate was issued without any notation of an encumbrance.</p>
<p align="justify">While all this was taking place Ambrosio Advincula, son of 
Marcelino Valmonte and grandson of Buenaventura Valmonte, Was in America, having 
been absent from the Philippines since February 1913, his wife Dionisia Marin 
and his two minor sons Ricardo and Marcos Advincula, 14 and 12 years old, 
respectively, having been left here. No news was received from Ambrosio 
Advincula from the time he left until the year 1917, and since that date nothing 
has been known of his whereabouts up to the present date. </p>
<p align="justify">This action was commenced on January 7, 1925, with a notice of 
<span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> in the office of the registry of deeds, and the plaintiffs seek the 
following in this action: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"In view of the foregoing, the plaintiffs pray the honorable 
court: </p>
<p align="justify">"(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) To decree the partition of the land described above, with 
its fruits since the year 1916, at the rate of P4.80 for each <span style="font-style: italic;">cavan</span> of unhulled 
rice; </p>
<p align="justify">"(<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) That Dionisia Marin be appointed guardian <span style="font-style: italic;">ad litem</span> for her 
minor children Ricardo and Marcos Advincula; </p>
<p align="justify">"(<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) That defendant Pedro Villaroman and the other defendants 
pay, proportionately, the costs of the present action, ordering and granting 
likewise, any other just and equitable remedy it may deem proper." 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The appellees maintain that when Pedro Villaroman acquired the 
land in question by purchase from some of Buenaventura Valmonte's heirs, he was 
subrogated to the rights of said heirs, becoming coowner with the other coheirs 
who did not intervene in the sale. </p>
<p align="justify">We have seen that Pedro Villaroman bought all the land in 
question from Manuel, Dominga, Ignacia, Hipolito and Maria Valmonte, believing 
that these were the only persons with an interest therein and not only the 
portion belonging to the latter. In taking possession of the property sold, 
then, he did so not as coowner, but as the sole and exclusive owner. </p>
<p align="justify">As we have seen, the preponderance of the evidence shows that 
Pedro Villaroman took possession of the land when he acquired it by" purchase on 
July 15, 1914, having declared it for the land tax on October 21st, of the same 
year. The fact that upon being sued for the balance of the price, which amounted 
to P600, he answered that he was willing to pay said sum provided the vendors 
obtained a waiver of the rights of the grandchildren of Buenaventura Valmonte, 
of whose rights he was convinced, do not destroy the adverse nature of his 
possession as owner, for it was secured by a bond filed by the vendors. 
Moreover, the plaintiffs Engracio L. Valmonte, Donata L. Valmonte, and Esperanza 
B. Valmonte, with their mother Constancia Linsangan, in a motion filed with the 
court in that case, expressed their acquiescence in said sale provided they were 
given P500, of the P600 the unpaid balance of the purchase price, which 
represent their share of the inheritance, and prayed the court to award them 
said sum. In the absence of evidence to the contrary it is reasonable to suppose 
that the vendors gave the security required by Pedro Villaroman and that the 
latter paid the balance of the sale. It is likewise reasonable to suppose that 
the trial court granted the motion of the plaintiffs Engracio L. Valmonte, 
Donata L. Valmonte, and Esperanza B. Valmonte, Awarding them the P500 prayed 
for. <br><br>With respect to the plaintiffs Engracio L. Valmonte, Donata L. 
Valmonte, and Esperanza B. Valmonte, since they agreed to the sale, they cannot 
now allege that the same was made without their consent. </p>
<p align="justify">Regarding the minors Ricardo and Marcos Advincula, since there 
has been no word from their father since the year 1917 it is presumed that he 
died on December 31, 1924, that is, seven years after the receipt of the last 
news of him (Act No. 190, section 334, No. 24). If Pedro Villaroman began to 
possess the land in question on July 15, 1914, by July 15, 1924, or ten years 
thereafter, he acquired title thereto acquisitive by prescription, he having 
possessed it openly, continuously, adversely, and as owner, with no one 
interrupting said possession (Act No. 190, section 41), Upon the said date of 
July 15, 1924, when it is presumed that Ambrosio Advincula still lived, the 
latter's right of action to recover said possession and ownership of said land 
became extinguished (section 40, Act No. 190), and on December 31, 1924, when it 
is presumed he died, he no longer had any right of action to transmit to his 
heirs and, therefore, upon his presumed death the latter acquired no such right. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Briefly, then, it appears that Pedro Villaroman acquired the 
lands in question by purchase from some heirs, whom he believed to be the sole 
owners, and having entered upon the possession thereof, cultivating them 
publicly, adversely, continuously and without any interruption whatsoever for 
over ten years, the fact that after said sale he believed that other heirs 
existed does not destroy the adverse and proprietary nature of his possession as 
owner, all doubt as to the existence of other heirs having been removed by the 
vendors' having filed a bond to secure the sale, and it does not prevent Pedro 
Villaroman from acquiring by prescription, through said possession, the title to 
any portion of the land in which the coheirs that did not intervene in the sale, 
might have. </p>
<p align="justify">Moreover, as Pedro Villaroman applied for the registration of 
said land in his name and the proper decree of registration was issued on May 
20, 1926, and recorded on the 25th of the same month and year, in his name, and 
since it does not appear that the said decree was issued through fraud, it 
cannot be revised, notwithstanding the fact that one year has not yet elapsed 
since its issuance, because section 38 of Act No. 496 only allows such revision 
when it was procured by fraud—neither absence nor minority being a ground 
therefor. </p>
<p align="justify">The notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> filed by the plaintiffs with the 
registrar of deeds in the present case cannot affect the decree of registration 
issued in favor of Pedro Villaroman upon the lands in question, since its object 
is to protect the rights which the plaintiffs might have in the aforesaid lands, 
against third persons (section 401, Act No. 190), and it does not relieve them 
from the necessity of objecting to the application for registration filed by 
Pedro Villaroman on the same lands some two years previous to the filing and 
recording of said notice of <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> for the protection of their rights. </p>
<p align="justify">Wherefore, the judgment appealed from is reversed and the 
defendant-appellant Pedro Villaroman is absolved from the complaint, which is 
hereby dismissed, with costs against the appellees. </p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Ostrand,</span> 
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Romualdez, JJ.</span>, concur. </div>
