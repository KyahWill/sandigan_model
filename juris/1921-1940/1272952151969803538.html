				<H3>ANTONIO MEDINA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. MADERERA DEL NORTE DE CATANDUANES, INC., DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VILLA-REAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal taken by the "Maderera del  Norte de Catanduanes, Inc.," from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of  Albay, ordering it to pay  plaintiff Antonio Medina P4,301.90, with legal interest from  the time of the filing of the complaint until fully paid and the costs. In support of its appeal, the appellant assigns the following alleged  error  as  committed by the trial  court in  its judgment, to wit: The trial court erred in sustaining the plaintiff's demurrer, ordering the dismissal of the defendant's counterclaim and that it be stricken out.<br><br>The first question to decide is whether the claim for damages occasioned by an attachment can be made in the form of a counterclaim in the principal suit,  or must be made in an independent action, after final judgment is rendered in the case in which the writ of attachment was issued, declaring it wrongful and without sufficient cause.<br><br>In the case of Raymundo vs. Carpio (33 Phil., 395), this court said the  following:<br><br><blockquote>"It would seem that the proper practice to be followed in cases where  it is desired to obtain  damages by reason of the wrongful issuance of an attachment in favor of plaintiff that an issue should  be tendered on the subject by the defendant in his answer  in the main cause.  Such a tender would present the question squarely in  that court,  and the parties having offered their evidence on the  subject,  the trial court could dispose of it along with the principal action. It is not necessary that the defendant wait until it is determined by a final decision in the main action that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in order to present the questions of his  right to damages.  All questions  which  are  material to the main action or which  are incidental thereto but depending thereon should be presented and litigated at the same time with the main action,  so as to avoid  the necessity of  subsequent  litigation and consequent loss  of time and money."<br></blockquote><br>It will be seen that in accordance with the opinion in the above cited cause, the claim  for  damages  caused by  the wrongful issuance and levy of preliminary attachment without sufficient cause, may  be made in the form of a counterclaim in the  principal  action.<br><br>The second question to be determined is whether or not the facts alleged in the answer are  sufficient to constitute a counterclaim.<br><br>Defendant's counterclaim consists in the following:<br><br><blockquote>"And as counterclaim against the plaintiff, the defendant alleges:<br><br>"1. That the  preliminary attachment issued against the property specified in the complaint  at the instance of the plaintiff, was issued without just cause or any justification therefor;<br><br>"2. That due to the said attachment levied on the defendant's property it has sustained damages by reason of the paralyzation of  its business caused thereby and the loss of prestige in its reputation and commercial standing amounting  to P20,000."<br></blockquote><br>Section 427 of the Code of Civil  Procedure provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Sec. 427. <i>Obligation for Damages in  Case of Attachment.</i>—Before the order is made, the party applying for it, or some person on his behalf,  must execute to the defendant an obligation in an amount to be fixed by the judge, or justice  of the peace, and  with sufficient surety  to  be approved by him, which obligation shall be for a sum not less than two hundred dollars, and not exceeding the amount claimed by the plaintiff, that the plaintiff will pay all the costs which may be adjudged to the defendant, and  all damages which he may sustain by reason of the attachment, if the same shall finally be adjudged  to have been wrongful or without sufficient cause."<br></blockquote><br>It follows from the above  quoted legal provision that an attachment debtor is entitled to indemnity for damages caused by an attachment that is "wrongful" and  "without sufficient cause."<br><br>In the counterclaim  of  the defendant company  above quoted it says "that  the preliminary attachment issued  on the property of the defendant  at the instance of the plaintiff,  was issued without just  cause or  any  justification therefor."  This last phrase is undoubtedly equivalent to the phrase "wrongful or without sufficient cause" as  used De la Riva vs. Escobar and Bank of the Philippine Islands in the law,  and is an allegation sufficient to constitute a counterclaim.<br><br><blockquote>"*   *   *   it has been considered,  however, that a general allegation that the attachment was  'wrongfully' sued out is sufficient, whether redress is  sought  by an  action on the bond or by  a plea in reconvention in the attachment suit;   *   *   *" (6 C. J.,  517.)</blockquote><br>Summarizing, the claim for damages caused by the levy of a preliminary attachment may be made by a counterclaim in the same  suit in which it was issued, and the general allegation that the  preliminary attachment was issued without just  cause or any justification therefor is sufficient to constitute a counterclaim.<br><br>Wherefore the judgment appealed  from is reversed,  as well as the order  sustaining  the  demurrer and dismissing the counterclaim, and it is hereby ordered that the record be  remanded to the  court below, which shall admit the counterclaim and proceed  to hold the proper  trial, without special finding as to costs.  So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Avanceña,  C.J., Johnson, Street, </span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Romualdez, JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><br>MALCOLM, VILLAMOR, OSTRAND, and JOHNS, JJ., dissenting:<br><br>We agree  with the action taken by the trial judge sustaining the  demurrer of the plaintiff to  the countercomplaint of the defendant, and accordingly vote to affirm the judgment.</div>
