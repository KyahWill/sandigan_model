				<H3>AFIFE ABDO CHEYBAN GORAYEB, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT, VS. NAD JIB TANNUS HASHIM ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>This action is brought to set aside a number of conveyances of real and 
personal property alleged to have been made for the purpose of defrauding the 
plaintiff of her rights.</p>
<p>It appears from the evidence that on the 8th day of February, 1906, the 
plaintiff and the defendant Nadjib Tannus Hashim were legally married in Syria. 
About three months after the marriage they came to the Philippine Islands and 
established their residence in Manila. In the year 1910 the plaintiff went on a 
visit to Syria returning to this country about eight months later. She again 
went to Syria in 1914. She contends that the journey was necessary for her 
health but it appears that she had considerable trouble in obtaining her 
husband's consent thereto. He maintains that when she left the understanding 
between them was that she would not return, and in corroboration of this 
statement has shown that he, on April 18, 1914, published a notice in the Syrian 
newspaper <em>Lisan-Ul-Hal</em>l to the effect that his wife had separated from 
him and warning the public that he would not be responsible for her debts.</p>
<p>The plaintiff asserts that she always-intended to return; that while she was 
in Syria the Turkish Possessions became involved in the World War and that she 
therefore was unable to get back to Manila until in the month of May, 1920. On 
her return the defendant N. T. Hashim refused to receive her in his house and 
she appears to have been living in the house of one of her cousins ever 
since.</p>
<p>In the month of June, 1920, shortly after the plaintiffs return to the 
Philippines, the defendant N. T. Hashim executed conveyances of practically all 
of his property to several of his relatives, the other defendants herein, and 
the plaintiff now seeks to have these conveyances set aside. The property 
conveyed is alleged to be worth over a half a million pesos, but need not here 
be described in detail. The court below found that the conveyances were 
fraudulent only as to the following described pieces of real estate and held the 
transfers of the rest of the property valid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(<em>a</em>) Two building lots on Rizal Avenue opposite the Grand Opera 
House and designated as lots Nos. 1 and 2 of block No. 8 of the San Lazaro 
Estate and measuring 730 square meters each. One of the lots was bought by N. T. 
Hashim from the Government in 1914 for P6,720 and the other was bought in 1915 
for P4,240. On June 12,1920, N. T. Hashim transferred the lots to A. T. Hashim 
for the alleged consideration of P15,000 each.</p>
<p>"(<em>b</em>) Lot No. 2, block No. 2212 of the same estate, bought by N. T. 
Hashim from the Government in 1915, for the sum of P2,560. There is a house on 
the lot which is designated as house No. 1001 Calle Oroquieta. The lot and house 
were transferred to A. T. Hashim on October 14, 1920, the consideration named 
being W,000 for the whole property."</p></blockquote>
<p>In an exhaustive and well prepared decision the court below annulled the 
transfers of these properties and ordered that certified copies of the 
dispositive part of the decision be filed by the clerk of the Court of First 
Instance with the register of deeds of Manila and with the Director of Lands. No 
special provision was made for the administration of the property. From this 
decision all of the parties appeal.</p>
<p>There can be no question that upon the evidence presented the trial court was 
warranted in annulling the transfers of the real estate above described and its 
findings upon this point must therefore be affirmed.</p>
<p>The judgment of the court below has the effect of turning the property 
fraudulently conveyed back to the conjugal partnership, leaving the 
administration thereof in the hands of the husband. It appears, however, from 
the record that before instituting the present action the plaintiff on November 
12, 1920, brought an action against the defendant N. T. Hashim for a separate 
maintenance allowance. The trial court granted her an allowance <em>pendente 
lite</em> of P1,000 per month, and afterwards a permanent allowance of P500 per 
month. The defendant husband failed to make payment and a writ of execution was 
issued. The writ was returned unsatisfied and supplementary proceedings were had 
under Chapter 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Thereafter an alias writ of 
execution was issued and levied upon all the rights and interest of the husband 
in the house and lot above described under (<em>b</em>) and such rights and 
interest were sold to the plaintiff on June 13, 1921, and a sheriff's deed was 
executed therefore on the 30th day of November, 1923. Subsequently a writ of 
execution was issued for other due and unpaid installments of the maintenance 
allowance, which execution was levied Upon all of the defendant husband's rights 
and interest in the two lots above described under (<em>a</em>), and the 
property was sold to the plaintiff on December 12,1923. The period of redemption 
from these sales having now expired, the legal title to the property sold has 
become vested in the plaintiff, subject to such preexisting debts as may be 
properly charge able against the conjugal partnership. (30 C. J., 1095 and 
authorities there cited; 30 Cyc, 477.)</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the defendant husband has, by his acts, virtually 
abdicated as administrator of the wife's property, she must be given the 
administration thereof. <br><br>The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with the 
modification that the plaintiff be declared the sole owner of the property, the 
conveyance of which to the defendant A. T. Hashim was declared fraudulent, and 
that she be given the administration of said property. No costs will be allowed 
in this instance. So ordered.</p>
<p><em>Street, Malcolm, Villamor, Johns,</em> and <em>Romualdez, JJ.</em>, 
concur.</p>
