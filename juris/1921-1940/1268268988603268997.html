				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In this original action&nbsp; arising from&nbsp; an election&nbsp; contest with reference to the office of third member of the provincial board of Albay, it is prayed that a writ of prohibition be issued against&nbsp; the&nbsp; respondent judge requiring&nbsp; him to desist and&nbsp; refrain from having his order of July 11, 1931, executed or enforced.<br><br>It appears from the complaint and the answer: (1) That the petitioner filed a motion of protest in the Court of First Instance of Albay&nbsp; contesting the election of the respondent Francisco Perfecto, upon the grounds alleged therein;&nbsp; (2) that the respondent Judge of the Court of First Instance of Albay entered an order on July 11, 1931, requiring the petitioner to give&nbsp; two kinds of bond in order that proper proceedings might be&nbsp; taken&nbsp; on his&nbsp; motion&nbsp; of protest: A personal bond for P3,000&nbsp; and a cash bond of P2,000 to be deposited with the provincial treasurer of Albay&nbsp; within the time specified in the order.&nbsp; These sums were later changed so that the cash bond was for&nbsp; P1,500 and the personal bond for P3,500.<br><br>The petitioner invoked&nbsp; section 482 of the Election Law in support&nbsp; of his contention.&nbsp; The respondent judge bases his action upon the same section and also upon section 479 as lately amended by Act No. 3699.&nbsp; Section 482 provides:<br><blockquote>"<i>Bond or cash deposit&nbsp; required of contestants.</i>—Before the court shall entertain any such contest or counter-contest or admit an appeal, the party filing the contest, counter-contest, or appeal shall give bond in an amount fixed by the court with two sureties&nbsp; satisfactory to it, conditioned that he will pay all expenses&nbsp; and costs incident to such motion or appeal, or shall deposit cash in court in lieu of such bond.&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *"</blockquote>This section,&nbsp; it should be observed, is preceded&nbsp; by the heading, "Bond or cash deposit required&nbsp; of&nbsp; contestants," which apparently indicates&nbsp; that the court&nbsp; taking cognizance&nbsp; of the&nbsp; election contest may require the contestant either to give a bond or to make a cash deposit.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the petitioner contends that the right to choose between giving a personal bond and depositing a sum of money&nbsp; in lieu thereof is granted only to the contestant or appellant.&nbsp; If there be any conflict between the heading of the&nbsp; section under question and the body, it must be settled according to the canons of statutory construction.&nbsp; Black on Interpretation of Laws, page 181, says:&nbsp; "Headings prefixed to the titles, chapters, and&nbsp; sections of&nbsp; a statute or code may be consulted in aid of the interpretation, in case of doubt or ambiguity; but inferences drawn&nbsp; from such headings are entitled to very little weight, and they can never control the plain terms of&nbsp; the&nbsp; enacting clauses."&nbsp; In a&nbsp; case in Kansas (Griffith vs. Carter, 8&nbsp; Kan., 565), it is said that when a statute is divided into separate subjects or articles, having appropriate&nbsp; headings,&nbsp; it must be presumed and held that the provisions of each&nbsp; article are controlling upon the&nbsp; subject&nbsp; thereof&nbsp; and&nbsp; operate as a general&nbsp; rule for settling such&nbsp; questions as&nbsp; are embraced therein.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the rule accepted by&nbsp; most of the&nbsp; authorities is that if the chapter or&nbsp; section heading&nbsp; has been inserted merely for convenience of reference, and not as an integral part of the statute, it&nbsp; should not be allowed to&nbsp; control the interpretation.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Union Steamship Co. vs. Melbourne Harbour Trust Comm'rs., L.&nbsp; R. 9 App. Cas., 365.)<br><br>Applying this rule to the case at bar,&nbsp; it will be seen that the present section provides that before the court entertain any contest&nbsp; or counter-contest&nbsp; or admits an appeal, the party filing the contest, counter-contest or appeal shall give bond with two sureties to the satisfaction of the court, or deposit cash in court in lieu of such bond.&nbsp; The contending parties differ in this that while the respondent judge holds that the court may require either a bond or a cash deposit, the petitioner maintains that it is to him&nbsp; alone the choice is given to file a personal bond or to make a cash deposit in lieu thereof,&nbsp; inviting our attention to the opinion&nbsp; of the Attorney-General&nbsp; dated August 21, 1928,&nbsp; on the interpretation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the aforesaid section 482 of the Election Law. The Attorney-General was of the opinion that in election contests the contestant had to give a personal&nbsp; bond in the amount fixed by the court with two&nbsp; sureties&nbsp; satisfactory to it,&nbsp; and that since he was under this alternative&nbsp; obligation, according to article 1132 of the Civil Code,&nbsp; he was entitled to choose one or the other of the alternatives. We hold that&nbsp; the court may only require a personal bond, and that the contestant may make a cash deposit in&nbsp; lieu thereof.<br><br>We shall now see how the court has demanded two kinds of bond of the&nbsp; petitioner by means of the order dated July 11, 1931.&nbsp;&nbsp; It reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"The bond to be given by the petitioner within five days hereafter with solvent sureties satisfactory to this court is hereby&nbsp; fixed at five thousand&nbsp; pesos&nbsp; (P5,000) whereof P3,000 shall be in the form of a personal bond, and&nbsp; P2,000 in cash to be deposited by the petitioner with the provincial treasurer within the time given.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both bonds shall answer for the costs and&nbsp; expenses arising from this contest.&nbsp; The P2,000 cash&nbsp; shall be applied to the payment of the first costs&nbsp; of transportation and the daily allowances of such municipal treasurers, and municipal, provincial, and&nbsp; insular employees as may be cited to appear before the court in connection with this contest,&nbsp; and the commissioners' fees of those whom the court may appoint."</blockquote>Although this order provides that&nbsp; of the P5,000 bond, P3,000 shall be in the form of a personal bond, and&nbsp; P2,000 in cash (or as subsequently altered, P3,500 shall be in the form of a personal bond, and P1,500 in cash); nevertheless, the amount of P1,500 in cash does&nbsp; not coincide with the legal definition of a bond,&nbsp; inasmuch as&nbsp; it is intended to defray the initial expenses arising from&nbsp; the contest.&nbsp; In reality, this sum of money is an advance given by the contestant to defray the required expenses for the expedition of the contest.&nbsp; Formerly the provincial treasury paid these expenses in the first&nbsp; instance, but section&nbsp; 479 of the Election Law which so provided, was amended by Act No. 3699, relieving the provincial treasury of this obligation, thereby implying that in&nbsp; election cases the contestant is to supply whatever may be necessary for the prompt despatch of his protest.<br><br>There is no question as to the court's discretionary power to demand of a contestant a certain sum&nbsp; of money in advance to meet the initial&nbsp; expenses arising from the contest, such as the production of ballot boxes in court,&nbsp; etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true that&nbsp; the bond obliges the contestant or his sureties to pay&nbsp; all the costs arising from&nbsp; the contest, should he&nbsp; be defeated, but the bond is not to be executed until the&nbsp; final determination of the protest.&nbsp; And it is well known that certain services are required in the course of election contests which must be paid for immediately,&nbsp; because it would be unjust to delay their&nbsp; payment&nbsp; until the termination of the contest.<br><br>Considering the order&nbsp; of July 11, 1931, in this sense, we believe that although it&nbsp; does not adhere&nbsp; strictly to legal technical phraseology, there is in&nbsp; it no excess of jurisdiction or abuse of judicial&nbsp; discretion to be rectified by means of the&nbsp; writ applied for.<br><br>Wherefore, the petition must be and is hereby denied, without special pronouncement of costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ordered.<br><br><i>Avanceña, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Ostrand, Romualdez, Villa-Real,</i> and&nbsp; <i>Imperial,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
