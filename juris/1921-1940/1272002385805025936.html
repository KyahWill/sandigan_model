				G.R. No. 30004, December 29, 1928</h4>
				<H3>FILOMENA MARTINEZ, PETITIONER, VS. PEDRO CONCEPCION, JUDGE OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, EL COLEGIO DE LA INMACULADA CONCEPCION DE LA CONCORDIA AND THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF CAVITE, RESPONDENTS.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a certiorari proceeding originally instituted in this 
court seeking to have an order issue to the respondent Judge Pedro Concepcion 
directing him to forward to this court the record in case No. 25961 of the Court 
of First Instance of Manila, entitled Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion de la 
Concordia vs. Jose Martinez, for review; that the proper order issue to all the 
respondents enjoining them from taking any steps relative to the continuation of 
the attachment and sale of the petitioner's property at public auction until 
this court has rendered judgment, and annulling the writ of execution issued in 
said case. Wherefore, the petitioner prays as ancillary relief, that an 
injunction be issued; (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) To Judge Pedro Concepcion directing him to vacate his 
writ of execution of April 11, 1928, against the sureties in said civil case No. 
25961; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) to the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion de la Concordia, its 
agents, attorneys, representatives and mandataries, and any other persons who 
might aid and represent it, restraining them from asking for the execution of 
any judgment rendered by the respondent Judge against the petitioner; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) to 
the provincial sheriff of Cavite or his deputies to refrain from taking any 
action with reference to the attachment of the herein petitioner's property, and 
to suspend the public auction sale of said property announced for July 13, 1928, 
at 9 a. m., at Cavite, Cavite, granting the petitioner any other just and 
equitable remedy. 
<p align="justify">On July 12, 1928, the writ of injunction applied for was issued 
by a member of this court and on the 26th day of the same month and year the 
respondents filed an answer praying for the dismissal of the action and that the 
petitioner be sentenced not only to pay the costs of this action, but also to 
reimburse the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion de la Concordia for all 
expenses occasioned by the fact that the auction was not held on July 14, 1928. 
</p>
<p align="justify">Counsel for the petitioner replied to this answer on July 31, 
1928. </p>
<p align="justify">Having set the day, oral argument was had on the case on July 
31, 1928. </p>
<p align="justify">In a petition presented on August 6, 1928, the respondents 
through counsel insisted upon, their prayer for dismissal, giving as a reason 
the fact that the defendant in said civil case No. 25961 took an appeal, which, 
according to said lawyer, confirms his contention that the certiorari is not the 
proper remedy, but the appeal. </p>
<p align="justify">On August 11, 1928, counsel for the petitioner filed an 
opposition to the petition for dismissal formulated by the attorney for the 
respondents. </p>
<p align="justify">The facts pertinent to the case are as follows: </p>
<p align="justify">On May 22, 1924, the herein petitioner Filomena Martinez 
subscribed a bond in the sum of P1,000 for the dissolution of the preliminary 
attachment ordered in said civil case No. 25961 of the Court of First Instance 
of Manila. </p>
<p align="justify">On October 29,1925, said cause was dismissed for failure of the 
plaintiff to prosecute, the lower court issuing the following order: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Neither party having taken any steps in the prosecution of 
this case from October 21, 1924, to date. </p>
<p align="justify">"It is hereby ordered that the same be dismissed without 
special pronouncement as to costs, and without prejudice to reinstating the 
action by the payment of the proper docketing fee. </p>
<p align="justify">"So ordered." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On November 7, 1925, the party plaintiff prayed that said 
dismissal of the case be set aside. </p>
<p align="justify">On November 14, 1925, the lower court decided the petition by 
an order which, literally, is as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Having heard the petition presented by the attorney for the 
plaintiff praying that the order of dismissal issued in this case be set aside, 
it is hereby denied unless the proper docketing fee be paid to the clerk.</p>
<p align="justify">"So ordered."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On December 28, 1925, the parties in said civil case, No. 
25961, filed the following stipulation with the trial court: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Come now the parties in the above-entitled case and 
respectfully submit the present stipulation as follows, to wit: </p>
<p align="justify">"That this case be ordered reinstated, setting aside the order 
of dismissal, and just as soon as this stipulation is approved the plaintiff 
shall pay the proper docketing fee to the clerk of this court. </p>
<p align="justify">"Manila, December 28, 1926 (should be 1925). </p>
<p style="text-align: right;">"J. R. SERRA<br></p><p style="text-align: right;">"<span style="font-style: italic;">438 Rizal Ave., Manila</span> </p><div style="text-align: right;">

<p align="justify">"<span style="font-style: italic;">Attorney for the defendant</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">should be plaintiff</span>)" 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On January 22, 1926, the trial court issued the following 
order: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"In accordance with the foregoing stipulation of the parties, 
the order of dismissal shall be set aside as soon as the proper fee is paid to 
the clerk of the court." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On February 4, 1926, the plaintiff, alleging payment of the 
proper fee, asked that the order of dismissal of the case be set aside. </p>
<p align="justify">On February 6, 1926, the trial court granted the petition 
issuing an order which reads: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The fee of the clerk of this case having been paid again, and, 
in accordance with the petition of the attorney for the plaintiff, the order of 
dismissal of October 29th of last year is hereby set aside." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">A trial having been had and judgment rendered against the 
defendant, the latter appealed therefrom to this court, which, deciding the 
appeal, on October 7, 1927, sentenced the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum 
of P717.10 with legal interest and costs. Then the order of execution having 
issued, it was found that the defendant was insolvent, for which reason, upon 
petition of the plaintiff Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion de la Concordia, 
the trial court on April 11, 1928 ordered the issuance of a writ of execution 
against the defendant's sureties, the said defendant's automobile, which had 
been attached, having disappeared, the release of which from the attachment was 
ordered because said sureties furnished a bond.</p>
<p align="justify">Steps were taken to comply with the last writ of execution, 
announcing the public auction sale of some realty belonging to the herein 
petitioner, one of the said sureties. </p>
<p align="justify">But the latter, believing her rights to be injured and alleging 
that the respondent Judge of First Instance had no authority to order the 
execution of such judgment against the aforesaid sureties, and in doing so had 
exceeded its jurisdiction, instituted the present certiorari proceedings. </p>
<p align="justify">The question presented for our consideration is whether or not 
the bond given by the aforementioned sureties continued in effect in spite of 
the dismissal of the case ordered by the Court of First Instance on October 29, 
1925, said dismissal not being imputable to said sureties, and the latter not 
having taken any part in the stipulation by and between the parties on December 
28, 1925, agreeing to a reinstatement of the case. </p>
<p align="justify">It should be observed that the order of November 14, 1925, 
issued before the dismissal ordered on October 29, 1925, became final, 
substantially modified said order of October 29th, the order of November 14th 
having the effect, although indirectly, of setting aside the dismissal upon 
payment of the docketing fee. The setting aside of the order of dismissal having 
been thus conditionally granted, the case continued to subsist although the 
proceedings therein were suspended while the condition imposed for the payment 
of the said fees was not fulfilled, for which the court had fixed no period. 
</p>
<p align="justify">It is to be observed, moreover, that the dismissal ordered on 
October 29, 1925, could not have the effect of terminating the case while it was 
not entered on the docket of the court as required in the last part of 
subsection 4 of section 127 of the Code of Civil Procedure. And it does not 
appear that such entry was made. At any rate, said order of dismissal, as we 
have said, was duly modified before it became final. </p>
<p align="justify">Consequently, by virtue of the order of November 14, 1925, the 
case, strictly speaking, was not dismissed but simply suspended, that is, to use 
the English juridical phraseology, there was a "stay" of the proceedings. Such 
suspension or "stay" is within the discretion of the courts and may be granted 
for several causes. </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"A stay of proceedings is a matter so largely within the 
discretion of the court that no attempt seems to have been made specifically to 
enumerate the grounds authorizing it. Stays have been most frequently granted 
upon the ground of another action pending, and as a means of enforcing the 
payment of costs, but various other grounds have been recognized." (1 C. J., 
1161, 1162.) </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">And in the footnote of the text cited, among the grounds for 
such suspension or stay is the one which the trial court took into consideration 
in the case before us, that is, the lack of the prosecution of the case for a 
long time. Such footnote, in its pertinent part, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) <span style="font-style: italic;">Grounds authorizing stay</span>.—(1) * * * (2) where an 
unreasonable length of time has been allowed to elapse after the institution of 
the action without taking any steps therein. (Bryan vs. Zimmerly, 16 Pa. Co., 
564.)'" </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The condition of payment of said fee did not necessarily 
signify the renewal of an action already dismissed, but was a sanction or 
penally imposed on the plaintiff for failure to take any steps in the 
proceeding. Such penal conditions in these cases may be imposed by the courts. 
It may be seen from the part cited from Corpus Juris (vol. 1, pp. 1161, 1162) 
that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Stays have been most frequently granted upon the ground of 
another action pending, and<span style="font-style: italic;"> as a means of enforcing the payment of costs</span>, etc." 
(Italics ours.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">For this reason, from the time the order of November 14, 1925, 
was issued, the original case remained in such a state of abeyance pending the 
payment of the fee. That <span style="font-style: italic;">status quo</span> could not, for the reasons stated, be 
considered anything more than a mere stay of proceedings, and the court that 
issued said orders thus understood it, when on January 22, 1926, in the face of 
the stipulation of the parties that the case be reinstated (not that the action 
be renewed, in the phraseology of the order of October 29, 1925, later 
modified), it reiterated its order of November 14, 1925, absolutely promising to 
sat aside the dismissal as soon as the proper fee was paid. As may be seen from 
the copy of said order of January 22nd above quoted, its text, among other 
things, says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"* * * the order of dismissal shall be set aside as soon as the 
proper fee is paid to the clerk of the court." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">And, indeed, when the said fee was paid the court, by its order 
of February 6, 1926, set aside "the order of dismissal of October 29th of last 
year." And it should be noted, in confirmation of the conclusion that by the 
last-named order the case was only reinstated and was not renewed, that there was 
no new complaint, nor any new summons, nor new allegations, and the case 
continued from the stage of the proceeding where it was left off by the stay. 
</p>
<p align="justify">The fact that the sureties did not participate in the agreement 
to reinstate the case, is, in our opinion, of no importance. That agreement was 
not to <span style="font-style: italic;">renew</span> a case already finally dismissed, but only to <span style="font-style: italic;">reinstate</span> a case 
conditionally suspended. </p>
<p align="justify">During that stay of the case it is clear that the bond given by 
the herein petitioner, and the scope and effects of which are discussed in the 
present proceedings, continued and still continues to remain in full force and 
effect. </p>
<p align="justify">It follows from this that the herein petitioner, by virtue of 
such bond given by her, is still bound under the provisions of section 440 of 
the Code of Civil Procedure, the respondent judge not having acted without or in 
excess of his jurisdiction in ordering the execution of the aforesaid judgment 
against the sureties in view of the insolvency of the principal obligor, the 
defendant in said case. </p>
<p align="justify">For the foregoing, the petition for certiorari filed herein 
must be, as it hereby is, denied, with costs against the petitioner, setting 
aside the preliminary injunction herein issued. So ordered. </p>

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING</strong></p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM, J., with whom concurs VILLA-REAL, J.:</strong></p>
<p align="justify">No one could quarrel particularly with the statement of facts 
made in the majority decision. It is only as to the deductions drawn from those 
facts that I am totally unable to agree. Also there is a void in so far as the 
facts connect up with the law. </p>
<p align="justify">As mentioned in the majority decision, case No. 25961 of the 
Court of First Instance of Manila, entitled Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion 
de la Concordia vs. Jose Martinez, was dismissed on October 29, 1925, for the 
failure of the parties to prosecute the action for more than a year "sin 
perjuicio de poder <span style="font-style: italic;">renovarse</span> la accion mediante el pago de los derechos de 
registro correspondiente." What was the effect of this dismissal? It meant that 
the parties and the entire cause of action were out of court for every purpose 
other than to carry the order into effect or to vacate or modify the same; in so 
far as the particular action was concerned, it was the same as a judgment for 
the defendant on the merits. </p>
<p align="justify">There followed the order of dismissal, another order dated 
November 14, 1925, denying the motion by the plaintiff which asked for the 
reinstatement of the case, a stipulation of the parties dated December 28, 1925, 
for the reinstatement of the case, and an order confirming the reinstatement 
dated February 6, 1926. In other words, from October 29, 1925, when the case was 
dismissed until February 6, 1926, when the case was reinstated, more than three 
months had elapsed. What was the effect of this delay? It meant that while it 
was competent for the court in the exercise of ita discretion to reinstate the 
case by consent during the same term, as this language is used in the United 
States but which signifies, in the Philippines, before the judgment became 
final, it was not within the jurisdiction of the court to do so after the 
judgment became final. In the case of Veluz vs. Justice of the Peace of Sariaya 
([1921], 42 Phil., 557), after defining a judgment of nonsuit, this court 
remarked: "Of course, after the judgment becomes final, the court loses all 
control to change, alter, or modify the same, except for the purpose of 
correcting clerical errors." </p>
<p align="justify">It is also to be noted that the right to renew the action 
contemplated the payment of a new registration fee. What was the effect of this 
proviso? The outward indicia of a new action is invariably the satisfaction of 
the filing fee. </p>
<p align="justify">Again in all of the statements which have been made, it will 
not escape notice that no mention at all has been made of the signers to 
defendant's bond for the dissolution of the attachment in the original action. 
What was the effect of this? It meant that a principle of natural justice was 
neglected when the stipulation was entered into by the parties and approved by 
the court without the conformity of the bondsmen and without giving them notice 
of any sort. </p>
<p align="justify">An analysis of the salient facts is now known to us. How about 
the law? In dismissing the action, the Judge of First Instance was acting in 
corformity with section 127 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This section 
provides that "An action may be dismissed, with costs to the defendant, in the 
following cases: * * * 3. By the court, when the plaintiff fails, for an 
unreasonable length of time, to prosecute his action. <span style="font-style: italic;">In either of these three 
cases a dismissal of the action shall not be a bar to another action for the 
same cause</span>; * * *." (<span style="font-style: italic;">Italics provided</span>.) It is difficult indeed to give to the 
phrase "bar to another action" any other meaning than "bar to another action." 
In this connection it is the rule that whatever destroys the attachment, and 
surely the dismissal of the action has this effect, will destroy liability on 
the bond. Among other cases, that was the holding of this court in the decision 
in Hi Caiji vs. Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co. ([1927], 50 Phil., 
592), written by Justice Johnson for a unanimous court of nine members.</p>
<p align="justify">The Philippine law on the subject of the dismissal of actions 
was derived from the laws of California. In the early case of Dowling vs. Polack 
([1861], 18 Cal., 625), it was the holding, that a judgment dismissing a suit 
is, in effect, a final judgment in favor of defendant; and, although it may not 
preclude the plaintiff from bringing a new suit, still for all purposes 
connected with the proceedings in the particular action, the rights of the 
parties are affected by it in the same manner as if there had been an 
adjudication upon the merits. But particular attention is invited to the later 
decision coming from the Supreme Court of California in the case of Hamilton vs. 
Bell ([1898], 123 Cal., 93), which, on both facts and law, is on all fours with 
the present proceeding. It was there said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"HAYNES, C.—The question for decision arises out of the 
following facts: In May, 1891, the 'Auburn Opera House and Pavilion Association' 
brought suit against George M. Hill to recover the sum of one thousand dollars, 
claimed to be due upon contract, and caused a writ of attachment to be issued 
therein under which money and other property was attached. On September 22, 
1891, on the application of the defendant in said action, the court fixed the 
amount of the bond or undertaking for the redelivery of the attached property at 
fifteen hundred dollars, and the defendants in this action became the sureties 
on such bond, and the attached property was released and delivered to the 
defendant. In November, 1891, the cause came on for trial, and at the conclusion 
of plaintiffs evidence the court granted defendant's motion for a nonsuit. From 
that judgment and an order denying a new trial the plaintiff appealed, and this 
court, on March 9, 1893, reversed said judgment and order. (32 Pac. Rep., 587.) 
On January 9, 1895, said cause was again tried, and the plaintiff had judgment 
for the full amount of its claim and interest. Thereafter, in September, 1895, 
execution was issued thereon, and was returned wholly unsatisfied; and on 
November 25, 1895, said Auburn Opera House and Pavilion Association assigned to 
George W. Hamilton, the plaintiff in this action, its said judgment and said 
redelivery bond, and said Hamilton, after due demand for the delivery of said 
property, or payment of its value, brought this action against the sureties on 
said bond, and obtained judgment against them, and this appeal is from that 
judgment and an order denying a new trial. </p>
<p align="justify">"Appellants contend that the judgment of nonsuit entered 
against the plaintiff in the action in which the attachment was issued operated 
to discharge them from all liability upon said bond which was given to release 
the property attached in that case. </p>
<p align="justify">"Respondent's contention is, in effect, that the judgment of 
nonsuit having been reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial, and having 
obtained a judgment upon such new trial it was a judgment recovered 'in the 
action' in which the undertaking was given, and that therefore the defendants 
are liable upon the undertaking.</p>
<p align="justify">"But while it is true that the judgment rendered upon the 
second trial was rendered in the same action, it does not follow that the 
liability of the sureties upon said undertaking continued until the second 
judgment was rendered. Indeed, it is quite clear that it did not. </p>
<p align="justify">"The fact that in the case at bar the appellants gave an 
undertaking for the redelivery of the property to the sheriff in case the opera 
house association should recover judgment against the defendant in that action, 
or would pay the value of the property so released, does not affect the 
question. The dissolution of the attachment by the judgment of nonsuit 
discharged the obligation of the sureties upon the bond. (Drake on Attachments, 
secs. 341 <span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>, and cases there cited.) * * *. </p>
<p align="justify">"We advise that the judgment and order appealed from be 
reversed.</p>
<p align="justify">"<span style="font-style: italic;">Belcher, C</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Britt, C</span>, concurred. </p>
<p align="justify">"For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment 
and order appealed from are reversed. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"GAROUTTE, J., VAN FLEET, J., HARRISON, J." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">We thus find the prevailing decision resting on the proposition 
that the court (1) may disregard the effect of the dismissal of an action, (2) 
may disregard the finality of the judgment on a dismissal of an action after the 
passing of the statutory period, (3) may disregard the payment of a filing fee 
as indicative of a new action, (4) may disregard due process of law by holding a 
party bound without notice and without hearing, (5) may disregard the exact 
language of the controlling law, and (6) may disregard decisions interpreting 
and enforcing that law found both in this jurisdiction and in the jurisdiction 
from which the law was taken. To such a proposition I cannot bring myself to 
give assent, and so am forced to dissent and to vote in favor of granting the 
writ of <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> and of prohibiting the trial judge from attempting to proceed 
further to enforce an illegal order. </p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-style: italic;">Petition denied</span>.</p></div><p></p>
