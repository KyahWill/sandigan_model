				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>OSTRAND, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an&nbsp; appeal by the Insular Collector&nbsp; of&nbsp; Customs from a judgment of the Court of First Instance of Manila ordering the refund to the appellee of the sum of P3,871.34 collected from it as customs duties on 10,000 cases of kerosene imported from the United&nbsp; States. The case was tried upon the following stipulation&nbsp; of facts:<br><blockquote> "Now come the&nbsp; parties&nbsp; plaintiff and&nbsp; defendant in&nbsp; this case and&nbsp; submit to the court the following stipulation of facts,&nbsp; together&nbsp; with the exhibits attached hereto for&nbsp; the decision&nbsp; of this case, by virtue of the appeal taken by Wise &amp; Co. from the decision rendered by the Insular Collector of Customs&nbsp; on a protest,&nbsp; No. 12276,&nbsp; presented by said Wise &amp; Co. of Manila against the assessment, collection and payment of duty upon 10,000 cases of petroleum imported by said Wise &amp; Co.&nbsp; from the United States of America.&nbsp; The&nbsp; facts stipulated are as follows: <br><br>"1. That&nbsp; the plaintiff is a corporation&nbsp; duly organized under the laws of the&nbsp; Philippine Islands, with its principal office on&nbsp; Calle Juan Luna, City&nbsp; of Manila;&nbsp; and&nbsp; that&nbsp; the defendant is the Insular Collector of Customs, who at the same time acts&nbsp; as collector of customs for the port of Manila;<br><br>"2. That&nbsp; in or about the month of October, 1921, and prior to said date, Wise &amp; Co. was the representative in the P. I. of the Texas Co., engaged among other things, in the importation&nbsp; of petroleum, oil, gasoline and derivatives of mineral oil for their distribution and sale in the P. I.;<br><br>"3. That the petroleum imported by the&nbsp; Texas Co. into the City of Manila is&nbsp; known by the name of petroleum Torre brand;<br><br>"4. That in or about the month of August, 1921, the Texas Co. shipped for Shanghai, consigned&nbsp; to Wise &amp; Co., as managing agent of the Texas Co., 10,000 cases of petroleum <i>Torre</i> brand;<br><br>"5. That said shipment was made from Port Arthur, Texas, leaving said port&nbsp; on board the steamer&nbsp; England Maru, the route of which ended at Shanghai, China, and was transhipped at Shanghai to the vessel <i>Coaxet</i> bound for Manila, having arrived at this port on October 17, 1921; "6. That said shipment was protected by&nbsp; two bills of lading, one from&nbsp; Port&nbsp; Arthur, Texas to Shanghai, China (Exhibit A);&nbsp; and the other from Shanghai, China to Manila&nbsp; (Exhibit&nbsp; B);<br><br>"7. That the bill of lading from&nbsp; Port Arthur, Texas, contains&nbsp; the following:<br><br>" To be sent from Shanghai, China to Manila, P. I. at the risk and&nbsp; cost of the consignee.<br><br>" 'In transit from Port Arthur, Texas, to Manila, P. I., via Shanghai,&nbsp; China<br><br>"8. That the delivery to the Collector of Customs of the bill of lading by the vessel Coaxet from Shanghai to Manila, was made thru a letter dated February 28, 1922&nbsp; (Exhibit B) to which an affidavit&nbsp; (Exhibit C) was attached;<br><br>"9. That when&nbsp; the 10,000 cases of petroleum arrived at the port of Manila, the Collector of Customs held that said petroleum was subject to&nbsp; the payment of import duties and exacted from the plaintiff Wise &amp; Co. the payment of the sum of P3,871.34, as such duties for said 10,000 cases of petroleum;<br><br>"10. That the plaintiff Wise &amp; Co. for the purpose of avoiding surcharges and fines in the payment of said duties paid the aforesaid amount of P3,871.34 under protest, alleging itself to be protected&nbsp; by section 12 of the Tariff Law of the Philippines of 1909, as amended by the Tariff Law of the United States of October 3, 1913;<br><br>"11. That the protest having been submitted to the Insular Collector of Customs, the latter, on January 30, 1923, rendered a decision in his capacity as administrator of the port of Manila, denying&nbsp; and overruling the&nbsp; protest presented by Wise &amp; Co.;<br><br>"12. That the Insular Collector of Customs has refused and&nbsp; still refuses to refund to Wise &amp; Co. the amount of P3,871.84 paid by the latter under protest as import duties on the said 10,000&nbsp; cases of petroleum.<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="50%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="50%"><div align="center">(Sgd.)&nbsp; "Antonio M.

I.), Inc., in claiming exemption from duty in the Philippines.<br><br>"Finally it may&nbsp; be stated that these 10,000 cases <i>Torre</i> brand kerosene oil were shipped from Port Arthur, Texas, to&nbsp; be delivered only at Manila and nowhere else.&nbsp; This oil&nbsp; was never in any way destined for China or a China market.&nbsp; The&nbsp; brand is neither known nor registered in China, and the name itself shows it to have been destined to a Spanish speaking&nbsp; country.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of an emergency and for no other reason was this cargo shipped from Port Arthur, Texas, to Manila via Shanghai.<br><br>"I hereby certify that the above is true in every detail to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td> <td colspan="2"><div align="center">(Sgd.)&nbsp; "E.

Paragraph 7 of the stipulation states that the bill of lading contained the following clauses: "To be sent&nbsp; from Shanghai, China, to Manila, Philippine Islands, at the risk and expense of&nbsp; the consignee" and "In transit from Port Arthur, Texas, to Manila, Philippine Islands, via Shanghai, China."&nbsp;&nbsp; It would therefore seem that the bill of lading imposed on the carrier the obligation not to land the goods in Shanghai but to tranship them to Manila, though&nbsp; the carriage from Shanghai&nbsp; to Manila would be&nbsp; at&nbsp; the&nbsp; consignee's risk and expense. To cover&nbsp; this risk and expense another bill of lading was made out for the transportation from Shanghai to Manila, but this would not necessarily change the character of the first or original bill of lading as essentially&nbsp; a "through" bill.<br><br>But be this as it may, the purpose of requiring a through bill of lading for imports for which free entry in the Philippines&nbsp; is claimed, is&nbsp; very evidently to prevent the entry of merchandise at way ports and the commingling of it with merchandise of a foreign territory before its reshipment to its ultimate destination.&nbsp; From this point of view both the shipment and the bill of lading in the present&nbsp; case was in sufficient compliance with at least the spirit of the law if not with its letter.<br><br>The judgment appealed from is affirmed without costs.<br><br>So ordered.<br><br><i>Malcolm,&nbsp; Avancena, Villamor,</i> and<i> Romualdez, JJ., </i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%"><br><br><center> D I S S E N T I N G : </center><br><br><b>JOHNSON, <i>J., </i></b><br><br>The decision in this case violates two provisions of the law.&nbsp; First,&nbsp; the&nbsp; bill was not a "through bill of lading." Otherwise, there would have been no occasion&nbsp; for the second "bill of lading."&nbsp; Second, it was not a "direct shipment" to Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a transhipment at Shanghai.&nbsp;&nbsp; The law requires that the merchandise must be by "direct shipment" and by a "through bill of lading."&nbsp; Neither of said conditions was&nbsp; complied&nbsp; with.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="60%"><br><div align="center"><br></div><div align="center">D I S S E N T I N G :<br></div><br><br><b>STREET,<i> J., </i></b><br><br>As stated in the opinion of the court, the point in&nbsp; controversy in this case arises under the United States Tariff Act of 1913, which, among other things, expressly declares that the right of free admission into the Philippine Islands of articles&nbsp; of the growth, product, or the manufacture of the United States is expressly "conditioned upon the direct shipment thereof, under&nbsp; a through bill of lading, from the country of&nbsp; origin&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; country of destination."&nbsp;&nbsp; The words used in&nbsp; this provision of the Tariff Law were apparently carefully weighed by Congress, and the manifest purpose was to discriminate in favor of direct lines established&nbsp; between the&nbsp; United&nbsp; States and the&nbsp; Philippines.<br><br>This was in furtherance of&nbsp; a design on the&nbsp; part&nbsp; of&nbsp; the American Congress to promote the upbuilding of an American merchant marine.&nbsp; The words "direct shipment," in the passage from which I have quoted, were, I think, used in strict contradistinction to transshipment; and it is&nbsp; admitted that the cargo in question was transshipped at Shanghai, China, from&nbsp; the England Maru to the Coaxett which brought it on to Manila.<br><br>Furthermore, the bill&nbsp; of lading upon which the cargo was embarked at Port Arthur, Texas,&nbsp; obligated the first steamer&nbsp; (<i>England Maru</i>)&nbsp; to convey the merchandise to Shanghai only, and an entirely new bill of lading was there issued to cover the shipment to Manila.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unimportant that the cargo was transferred at Shanghai from the <i>England Maru</i> to the <i> Coaxet, </i>without having been disembarked and mingled with the commerce of China; nor&nbsp; is it&nbsp; important that the&nbsp; original bill of lading&nbsp; had indorsed upon its face a few words of shipping instructions to the effect that the merchandise was to be sent from Shanghai&nbsp; to Manila at the risk and expense of the consignee.&nbsp; In fact this indorsement shows that the obligation of the <i>England Maru</i> terminated at Shanghai and this circumstance corroborates the conclusion that the bill of lading was not a through bill of lading.<br><br>These considerations are too clear to me to permit of argument,&nbsp; and I cannot accept the&nbsp; conclusion of the court which concedes to this merchandise the right of free entry into the port of Manila.&nbsp; The opinion written&nbsp; by Mr. Justice Ostrand says that while the&nbsp; bill of lading issued at Port Arthur is not in the form of the usual&nbsp; through&nbsp; bill of lading, it is "a through bill of lading in its legal effect."<br><br>Conformably with this idea any foreign bottom, not pertaining to established lines between the United States&nbsp; and the Philippine Islands, is free to bring&nbsp; American cargo to any Asiatic port for transshipment to the Philippine Islands; and the same may be entered duty free in our ports in&nbsp; direct&nbsp; contravention of the United States Tariff Act, provided a few words are indorsed on the bill of lading to show that the cargo is to be&nbsp; transshipped&nbsp; at such Asiatic port to the Philippine&nbsp; Islands "at the risk and expense of the consignee."&nbsp;&nbsp; From this&nbsp; conclusion I record&nbsp; my disagreement, and I&nbsp; am&nbsp; of the opinion that the judgment should be reversed.<br></div>
