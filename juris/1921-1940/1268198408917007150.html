				G.R. No. 40368, September 23, 1933</h4>
				<H3>ANACLETO PIIT ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. VICENTE B. DE LARA, JUSTICE OF THE PEACE OF CAGAYAN, ORIENTAL MISAMIS, AND CLEOFE VELEZ, ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE INTESTATE ESTATE OF RAMON NERI SAN JOSE, RESPONDENTS.

<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>HULL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This
is an original action for a writ of certiorari, praying that the writ
of preliminary injunction issued by the respondent justice of the peace
against the petitioners be declared null and void, on the ground that
the same was issued in excess of his jurisdiction.
  <p> Our
jurisdiction in this case is concurrent with that of the Court of First
Instance of Oriental Misamis, and no showing is made why application
for the writ prayed for should not have been submitted to that court.
There are many reasons why all errors committed by justices of the
peace should be corrected by the Courts of First Instance, under whose
supervision such inferior courts function.</p>
  <p> As the writ of
certiorari is not one of right but lies within our judicial discretion,
we will decline to entertain applications such as here presented unless
the case is shown to be exceptional and our action in the first
instance necessary in the furtherance of justice.</p>
  <p>    <em>Malcolm, Villa-Real, Abad Santos</em>, and<em> Imperial, JJ</em>., concur. </p>
