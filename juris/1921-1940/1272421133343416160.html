defendant and appellant questions the clause in the promissory note
sued on reading "and a further sum equal to 10 per cent of the total
amount due as and for expenses of collection for attorney's fees
whether actually incurred or not," as in contravention of the Usury
Law. The full text of the said note is as follows:
  <blockquote>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
      <tbody><tr>
        <td width="73%">"P15,000.00</td>

    </tbody></table>
    <p>"On
or before the 19th day of November, 1921, or on thirty (30) days
written demand notice, for value received, I promise to pay to Harry
Bridge, at Manila, P. I., the sum of fifteen thousand pesos (P15,000)
with interest thereon at the rate of twelve per cent (12%) per annum.
If not paid when due after thirty days written demand notice, this note
shall bear interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum until paid;
and a further sum equal to 10 per cent of the total amount due as and
for expenses of collection for attorney's fees whether actually
incurred or not and in addition to all costs as provided for in the
Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
    <p>"This note is secured by real-estate mortgage of even date.</p>

Stipulations in negotiable instruments for the payment of collection
and attorney's fees are not forbidden by law in this jurisdiction. The
lender may without violating the Usury Law provide in a note for an
attorney's fee to cover the cost of collection. This has been
definitely held in a long line of cases both here and elsewhere.
(Bachrach <i>vs.</i> Golingco [1918], 39 Phil., 138; Bachrach Garage and Taxicab Co. <i>vs.</i> Golingco [1919], 39 Phil., 912; Laureano <i>vs.</i> Kilayco and Lizares de Kilayco [1915], 32 Phil., 194; Warrington <i>vs.</i> De la Rama [1923], 46 Phil., 881; Lloyd <i>vs.</i> Scott [1830], 4 Peters, 205; Fowler <i>vs.</i> Equitable Trust Co. [1891], 141 U. S., 411; Williams <i>vs.</i> Flowers [1889], 90 Ala., 136; Peyser <i>vs.</i> Cole [1883], 11 Ore., 39; Dorsey <i>vs.</i> Wolff [1892], 142 Ill., 589; Gambril <i>vs.</i> Doe <em>Ex dem</em>. Rose [1846], 44 Am. Dec, 760; Weatherby <i>vs.</i> Smith [1870], 30 Iowa, 131; Columbian Building and Loan Association <i>vs.</i>
Rice [1904], 68 S. C, 236; 1 Ann. Cas., 239.) The purpose of a
stipulation in a note for reasonable attorney's fees is not to give the
lender a larger compensation for the loan than the law allows, but is
to safeguard the lender against future loss or damage by being
compelled to retain counsel to institute judicial proceedings to
collect his debt.</p>
  <p> The only difference between the provision
of the promissory note here complained of and the provisions of the
promissory notes in any of the above-cited cases is that the note
before us contains these additional words: "whether actually incurred
or not." But this clause is merely descriptive in nature—is in reality
merely sur-plusage. The idea of the parties was to provide for a
penalty to cover expenses of collection. That such expenses were
actually incurred in this case, is disclosed by the obvious fact that
the case is now before the appellate court for decision. Whether the
creditor could enforce the penalty where expenses of collection and
attorney's fees were not actually incurred, is questionable, but does
not affect the result in this case.</p>
  <p> The judgment of the
trial court in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant,
whereby the latter was condemned and ordered to pay to the former the
sum of fifteen thousand pesos (P15,000), with interest at 12 per cent
per annum beginning with May 19, 1923, and continuing until the
complete payment of the debt, together with 10 per cent of fifteen
thousand pesos (P15,000) to cover the penal clause, and in case of
nonpayment of the same within three months from the date of the
decision, providing for the sale of the land described in the mortgage
in accordance with law, is affirmed in all of its parts, it being
understood that the three-month period above mentioned shall begin to
run from the date when this judgment becomes final. With the costs of
this instance against the appellant, it is so ordered.</p>
  <p>    <i>Avanceña, C. J., Street, Ostrand, Johns, Romualdez</i>, and <i>Villa-Real, JJ</i>., concur.<br> 
    <i> Johnson, J.</i>, did not take part. </p>
