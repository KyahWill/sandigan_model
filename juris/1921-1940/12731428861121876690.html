				<BR><STRONG>AVANCEÃ‘A, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This action  was brought to compel the defendants to sell the land described in the third paragraph of the complaint to the plaintiffs.  The judgment appealed from absolved the defendants from the complaint.<br><br>On May 24, 1889, Gregorio Ramos and his  wife Vicenta Fajardo sold the land in question to the spouses Pastor ViIlarica and Leonor Reyes, with the right to repurchase for the exercise of which no term was fixed.  About the year 1903 Vicenta  Fajardo having obtained the consent of the spouses  Villarica  and Reyes to repurchase this land, redeemed it with money  supplied by Francisco Icasiano.  That year Fajardo sold the same land to Francisco Icasiano, also with  the right to repurchase  for the  period  of fourteen years, charging Icasiano with the duty of drawing up the proper document.  This document, however, was not drawn up until after Fajardo's death, which was done shortly after. But before his death, Fajardo executed a will on October 18, 1903, the third and fourth clauses of which are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"I leave at present  a fishery belonging exclusively to me located at the place known  as 'Malapad na Balot' in the barrio of San  Nicolas  of this town of Bulacan, which I sold to Mr. Francisco  Icasiano for the sum of five thousand pesos, local currency, with the condition that either I or my heirs shall be  entitled to repurchase it from the said Mr. Icasiano or his heirs within the period of ten years.  The proper document of  sale of this fishery has not as yet been drawn up, but I have long since delivered the documents I had concerning the said fishery to the aforementioned Mr. Icasiano.<br><br>"Mr.  Francisco Icasiano has already turned over to me the said amount of five thousand pesos, local currency, the price of the sale of  the said fishery, but we have also laid down the condition that should I need it, I could take one thousand pesos,  local currency, in which case the period is to be extended to fourteen years.  My aforesaid children will be at liberty to  accept said condition to extend the period to fourteen years for the said sum of one thousand pesos, local currency, from Mr.  Icasiano, in case  of  my death."</blockquote><br>This will was introduced by the plaintiffs as evidence, and they contend that it  expresses the true transaction between Fa jar do and Icasiano.<br><br>After Fajardo's death, certain  differences arose between his heirs and Francisco Icasiano  in regard to the right to repurchase this  land, as a consequence of which Icasiano executed the document Exhibit 5 on  August 5, 1905, recognizing the right of Fajardo's heirs to repurchase the land after fourteen years.<br><br>Subsequently,  on August 19, 1918, Icasiano conveyed his rights to  said land to Nieves  Ramos  and Ramon Meneses.  The principal  question involved in this appeal  is whether or not the plaintiffs, as Fajardo's heirs, are still entitled to repurchase the land.<br><br>Plaintiffs contend  that defendants' obligation to sell them the land arises from a contract of a  promise to sell.  To this end, they argue that their right to repurchase by virtue of Exhibit D, of August 3, 1905, was agreed upon after the sale of the land by Fajardo to Icasiano on October 18,1903, and that therefore it cannot be treated as a right reserved by the vendor to himself at the sale, which is the conventional redemption defined in article 1507 of the Civil Code. But, this right of the plaintiffs to repurchase recognized by Icasiano in Exhibit D is the same one that Fajardo reserved to himself in selling the land to Icasiano in 1903.  The purpose of Exhibit D, in 1905, was not to extinguish this right of redemption agreed upon in 1903, but simply to modify its exercise, so that it was not to  be exercised until after fourteen years, instead of within fourteen years, as was the case before.  An  agreement to repurchase becomes a promise to sell when made after  the  sale, because  when the sale is made without such an agreement,  the purchaser acquires the thing sold absolutely,  and if he  afterwards grants the vendor the right to repurchase, it is  a new contract entered into by the purchaser, as absolute  owner already of the object.  In that case the vendor has not reserved to himself the right to repurchase.  But, in the present case, Icasiano never acquired, not even for a moment, the absolute ownership of the land, inasmuch as when  he bought it from Fajardo, the latter reserved to himself the right to repurchase it which right was never extinguished, but was only modified as to the manner of its exercise in the transaction between Icasiano and Fajardo's heirs.   Hence, juridically the transaction between the appellants and  appellees is a sale with a right to  repurchase, the exercise of which has been suspended for fourteen years.  This  is exactly the same case  as that of Santos  vs. Heirs of Crisostomo and Tiongson (41 Phil., 342).   That case dealt with a sale with right to repurchase, wherein it was stipulated that the thing sold could not be  repurchased until after ten years.  The court, examining the effects of this  stipulation, said:<br><br><blockquote>"When the stipulation in question is examined, it will be discovered that the intention of the parties was to suppress the exercise of the right of repurchase for, the full period of ten years from the date of the contract and, inferentially, to allow the  exercise of that  right after  the expiration of ten years.  In the second paragraph of article 1508 of the Civil Code it is in effect  provided that if there  should be an agreement with respect to the time of repurchase, the period, shall not exceed ten years.  The  stipulation under consideration offends  against this provision in two particulars,  namely,  (1)  in providing that the right to repurchase  may be  exercised  after  ten years  shall  have elapsed, and (2) in prohibiting the exercise of the same right during the whole period when, according to the statute, it might be lawfully exercised.<br><br>"The stipulation is, therefore, illicit; and the result is that the right of repurchase  could  in  fact, under  the  second paragraph of article 1508 of the Civil Code, have been exercised in this case at any time after the making of the contract and prior to the expiration  of  ten years.  The law must here control over the revealed intention of the parties.<br><br>"In what has been said we do not mean to  declare that the parties to a contract of sale with <i>pacto de retro</i> cannot under any conditions lawfully suspend the  exercise of the right of repurchase.   Doubtless they  may do  so, provided there remains an appreciable space of time for the exercise of the right within  the  limitation allowed by law.   For instance, if it were provided that repurchase should not be effected before five nor after ten years from the date of the contract, we see no reason for supposing the stipulation to be unlawful,  it is different where the parties  attempt totally to suppress the right during the whole period when it might lawfully be exercised."<br></blockquote><br>According to the doctrine laid down in that case, the appellants are no longer entitled to repurchase the land because the period fixed by  article 1508 of  the Civil  Code for the exercise of this right has already elapsed, the provisions of Exhibit D notwithstanding.<br><br>The appellants assign other errors with reference to rulings of the  lower court, preventing them from  introducing evidence to  establish  their contention regarding the  real facts of the case.  As our decision is based on the  same facts upon which rests the appellants' contention, there is no reason to consider these errors.<br><br>The appellants also assign other errors which should have importance  only in case the judgment appealed from is reversed,  and  in view of the conclusion at  which we have arrived, we abstain from considering them.<br><br>The judgment  appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellants.  So ordered.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Johnson,  Street, Malcolm,  Villamor, Johns, Romualdez, </span>and  <span style="font-style: italic;">Villa-Real, JJ.,</span> concur.</div>
