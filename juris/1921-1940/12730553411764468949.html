				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MALCOLM, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the Court of First Instance of Manila, Consolacion Infante and Emeterio 
Ramos were charged with the crime of adultery by Manuel Artigas, jr., the 
offended party. After first pleading not guilty on arraignment, later when the 
case was called for trial the accused asked permission to withdraw their plea of 
not guilty and substitute therefor the plea of guilty. Thereupon, the trial 
judge sentenced each of them to two years, four months, and one day of 
imprisonment, <em>prision correccional,</em> with the accessory penalties 
prescribed by law, and to pay one-half of the costs. The appeal taken by 
Consolacion Infante from this judgment is without merit, for obviously the 
appellate court cannot go into the question of whether or not the plea was made 
on the assurance given by her attorney that she would only be sentenced to the 
minimum penalty which she believed would not exceed six months. (Fiscal of 
Manila <em>vs.</em> Del Rosario [1928], 52 Phil., 20.)
<p>In this court, after the case had been submitted, a motion to dismiss was 
filed on behalf of the appellant predicated on an affidavit executed by Manuel 
Artigas, jr., in which he pardoned his guilty spouse for her infidelity. But 
this attempted pardon cannot prosper for two reasons. The second paragraph of 
article 344 of the Revised Penal Code which is in question reads: The offended 
party cannot institute criminal prosecution without including both the guilty 
parties, if they are both alive, nor, in any case, if he shall have consented or 
pardoned the offenders." This provision means that the pardon afforded the 
offenders must come before the institution of the criminal prosecution, and 
means, further, that both the offenders must be pardoned by the offended party. 
To elucidate further, article 435 of the old Penal Code provided: "The husband 
may at any time remit the penalty imposed upon his wife. In such case the 
penalty imposed upon the wife's paramour shall also be deemed to be remitted." 
These provisions of the old Penal Code became inoperative after the passage of 
Act No. 1773, section 2 which had the effect of repealing the same. The Revised 
Penal Code thereafter expressly repealed the old Penal Code, and in so doing did 
not have the effect of reviving any of its provisions which were not in force. 
But with the incorporation of the second paragraph of article 344, the pardon 
given by the offended party again constitutes a bar to the prosecution for 
adultery. Once more, however, it must be emphasized that this pardon must come 
before the institution of the criminal prosecution and must be for both 
offenders to be effectiveâ€”circumstances which do not concur in this case.</p>
<p>The crime committed falls under article 333 of the Revised Penal Code. There 
being present a mitigating circumstance of a plea of guilty, the penalty should 
be imposed in the minimum degree. This happens to be the penalty which was meted 
out under the old Penal Code for this appellant.</p>
<p>Judgment affirmed, with the costs of this instance against the appellant, and 
the motion for dismissal-denied. </p>
<p><em>Villamor, Ostrand, Abad Santos,</em> and <em>Butte, JJ.,</em> concur.</p>
