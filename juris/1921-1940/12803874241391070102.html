				<H3>ROSENDO R. LLAMAS ET AL., PLAINTIFFS AND APPELLEES, VS. GONZALO ABAYA ET AL., DEFENDANTS. JOAQUIN A. ELEAZAR, APPELLANT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>IMPERIAL, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify"> In civil case No. 5872 of the Court of First 
Instance of Laguna between the same parties, judgment was rendered 
giving preference to the entire credit of the plaintiffs and declaring 
it preferential to that of the defendant Eleazar, and ordering Gonzalo 
Abaya to pay to the Llamas brothers the sum of P14,457.38, as principal,
 with accrued interest thereon at 12 per cent per annum until November 
30, 1931, plus compound interest on said sum from December 1, 1931, 
until fully paid, also P1,500 as attorney's fees, with costs; and 
directing, in case of failure of the debtor within ninety (90) days to 
deposit said amount or to pay it to the plaintiffs, that the mortgaged 
property be sold in conformity with the law.
</p><p align="justify"> Eleazar appealed from that part of the judgment 
which gave preference to the entire credit of the plaintiffs, claiming 
that said preference was only for the amount of P5,933.30.</p>
<p align="justify"> On appeal (G. R. No. 37824)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  this court entered judgment as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> "In view of the foregoing, said part of the 
appealed judgment is reversed and it is declared that the preference 
enjoyed by the plaintiffs-appellees is only for the amount of P5,933.30,
 with the stipulated interest thereon and the penalty, with the costs of
 this instance against said appellees. So ordered."</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> On November 28, 1932, prior to the promulgation of 
the above decision of this court, Joaquin Eleazar wrote the letter 
Exhibit A to the plaintiffs tendering payment of the sum of P5,933.30 
with the accrued interest thereon, and stating therein that he formally 
made the offer in order to avoid payment of the stipulated interest 
subsequent to the date of his letter. The plaintiffs ignored said 
letter.</p>
<p align="justify"> On December 18, 1933, after the decision of this 
court had been promulgated, Joaquin Eleazar deposited said sum of 
P5,933.30 with the clerk of court, at the disposal of the plaintiffs. On
 the following day the plaintiffs filed a motion alleging that their 
credit to date amounted to P12,066.60 and praying that a writ of 
execution for said amount be issued and that in the meantime they be 
authorized to receive from the clerk of court the amount deposited by 
Eleazar. The court granted the latter relief and the plaintiffs received
 said sum of money from the clerk of court.</p>
<p align="justify"> Joaquin Eleazar opposed the motion for the issuance 
of a writ of execution for the sum stated therein and in his written 
opposition maintained that he was bound to pay interest only up to 
November 28, 1932, the date on which he made a formal tender of payment 
of the principal and accrued interest up to that date, and that it was 
possible that subsequent to the date of their acquisition of the 
mortgage, Abaya might have made payment to them on account of the 
stipulated interest, for which reason he prayed that said plaintiffs be 
required to specify what interest they had actually received from Abaya 
from said date.</p>
<p align="justify"> After the hearing of said motion, the court entered 
its resolution dated January 24, 1934, declaring that the stipulated 
interest to which the plaintiffs are entitled is at the rate of 9 per 
cent per annum from March 6, 1929, the date on which they acquired the 
mortgage from the Philippine National Bank, up to December 18, 1933, the
 date on which Eleazar deposited the sum of P5,933.30 with the clerk of 
court; that said interest is compound and should be computed 
semi-annually in accordance with the contract; that the principal and 
interest so computed should bear interest at the said rate from December
 19, 1933, until fully paid, and that the plaintiffs are likewise 
entitled to collect, by way of penalty, 10 per cent of the principal and
 compound interest thereon, until fully paid.</p>
<p align="justify"> The foregoing resolution was properly excepted to 
and from it this appeal was taken.</p>
<p align="justify"> The defendant Eleazar contends that the plaintiffs 
are entitled to collect interest at 9 per cent per annum only up to 
November 28, 1932, the date on which he made a written tender of payment
 of the principal and interest thereon which might result from a 
liquidation; that the court should have required the plaintiffs to 
furnish the information requested by him relative to the interest that 
Abaya might have paid subsequent to the date on which they acquired the 
mortgage from the Philippine National Bank, and that the stipulated 
penalty should consist in only 10 per cent of the principal and accrued 
interest thereon up to the date of the filing of the complaint.</p>
<p align="justify"> The stipulated interest should accrue, and be 
payable, up to the date on which the principal is paid. The reason for 
this is that the written tender of payment did not have the effect of 
suspending the interest and its accumulation in accordance with the 
provisions of article 1176 of the Civil Code. Neither did the tender of 
payment produce the effects stated in section 347 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, it appearing that Eleazar on that occasion failed to tender 
any definite sum by way of interest or penalty representing attorney's 
fees.</p>
<p align="justify"> The defendant's contention that he was entitled to a
 liquidation of the interest in order to determine the amount which 
Abaya had paid in that concept to the plaintiffs from the date on which 
they acquired the mortgage, is unfounded. He already had the information
 which he sought to obtain a long time ago, in view of the fact that it 
had already been alleged in the complaint that Abaya had failed to pay 
accrued interest from January 1, 1930, to November 30, 1931. In the 
dispositive part of the court's decision entered on April 26, 1932, it 
was likewise ordered that Abaya should pay the interest which he failed 
to pay up to November 30, 1931, plus accrued interest from December 1st 
of said year, until fully paid. Therefore, from these data, Eleazar 
should have already known that Abaya had failed to pay any sum by way of
 stipulated interest from January 1, 1930.</p>
<p align="justify"> As regards attorney's fees, there is nothing in the 
record in support of Eleazar's contention. The meaning of the phrase 
"then unpaid" cannot be confined, as claimed, to the principal and 
compound interest thereon accruing up to the date of the filing of the 
complaint. The verbal adjective "unpaid", used therein, refers to the 
principal and unpaid interest thereon and cannot be so construed as to 
limit the penalty to. the date on which the action was brought.</p>
<p align="justify"> Wherefore, finding that the appealed resolution is 
in accordance with law, the same is affirmed in all its parts, with the 
costs of this instance against the appellant. So ordered.</p>
