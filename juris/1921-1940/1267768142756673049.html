				<BR><STRONG>ROMUALDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This action was instituted for the purpose of having a certain deed of sale with&nbsp; right of redemption executed by the plaintiff in favor of the defendant, quoted in the&nbsp; complaint, declared by the&nbsp; court as failing to express the real intention&nbsp; of the parties,&nbsp; it being, in reality, a&nbsp; mortgage deed, praying, therefore, for the cancellation of the certificate of title which,&nbsp; by virtue of said sale and the subsequent consolidation, was issued to the defendant, and that the latter be sentenced to pay the costs.<br><br>In addition to a specific denial of certain paragraphs of the complaint, the defendant sets up a special defense alleging that the contract was a real and true sale in accordance with the genuine and free will and purpose of the parties, the plaintiff having&nbsp; actually received&nbsp; the&nbsp; sale&nbsp; price of P20,000; that the period of redemption had elapsed without having&nbsp; made use of the right of redemption, and, consequently, a transfer certificate of title was issued in favor of the defendant without any protest from the plaintiff.&nbsp;&nbsp; The defendant, in&nbsp; addition, interposes a&nbsp; cross-complaint&nbsp; on account of the plaintiff's refusal to deliver the possession of the property sold,&nbsp; with damages suffered,&nbsp; by reason of such refusal, amounting to P2,000 per annum from February&nbsp; 25, 1927.&nbsp; Upon these allegations,&nbsp; the defendant asks for the dismissal of the&nbsp; complaint, and that the contract of sale in question be declared a real contract of sale, and the defendant's title to the property sold absolute and irrevocable.&nbsp; The defendant also asked that&nbsp; in&nbsp; order to avoid greater and&nbsp; irreparable damages, the possession of the property be delivered to him before the trial of the case upon its merits, unless the plaintiff furnish a bond in his favor to answer for damages already sustained and in the future.<br><br>The court heard the parties upon the last petition and with their acquiescence ordered the&nbsp; plaintiff to furnish a bond in favor&nbsp; of the&nbsp; defendant in the amount of P8,000 for the non-issuance of the writ of possession applied for by the defendant, and&nbsp; the&nbsp; plaintiff having failed to furnish such bond,&nbsp; the aforesaid&nbsp; writ was issued, delivering the possession of the land&nbsp; in question to the defendant.<br><br>Later on the defendant was&nbsp; permitted to add to his answer another special defense to the effect that the&nbsp; question here raised is <i>res&nbsp; judicata.</i><br><br>Some time later, by agreement of&nbsp; the parties, the&nbsp; court appointed a commissioner to count&nbsp; the coconut trees on the land.<br><br>After trial of the case, the Court of First Instance of Batangas rendered judgment absolving the defendant from the complaint.<br><br>The plaintiff has appealed from&nbsp; this judgment, making the following assignments of error:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The trial court erred in holding that the document presented by the plaintiff marked as Exhibit E constituted a sale with right of redemption and&nbsp; not as a mere mortgage deed.<br></li><li>The trial court also erred in not&nbsp; holding that the plaintiff-appellant signed&nbsp; and executed&nbsp; said Exhibit E, on the understanding&nbsp; that it was to&nbsp; be&nbsp; considered&nbsp; by the parties thereto as a mere mortgage&nbsp; deed.<br></li><li>The&nbsp; trial court&nbsp; likewise erred&nbsp; in giving greater weight and credit to the testimony given by the witnesses for the defendant than to the evidence submitted by the plaintiff.<br></li><li>The trial court finally erred&nbsp; in rendering judgment in favor of the defendant-appellee Primitivo Kalaw,&nbsp; and against the plaintiff-appellant&nbsp; Tomasa Masongsong."</li></ol></blockquote>The facts cited by the party appellant as indicating&nbsp; that the contract entered into&nbsp; was one of mortgage and not of sale with the right to repurchase, cannot be considered as sufficiently proved.&nbsp; On the contrary, the record&nbsp; shows that there are facts established by a preponderance of evidence, aside from the deed&nbsp; of&nbsp; sale itself,&nbsp; Exhibit E, which corroborate the literal text of said deed and which must prevail&nbsp; unless destroyed&nbsp; by evidence of&nbsp; sufficient weight and force, for the facts stated&nbsp; in a document are presumed to&nbsp; be true.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Asido vs. Guzman, 37 Phil., 652; Mendezona vs.&nbsp; Philippine Sugar Estates Development Co., and De Garay, 41 Phil., 475.)<br><br>With regard to the&nbsp; sale price, considering the circumstances of the case, particularly the report of the commissioner appointed&nbsp; by the court below to count the coconut trees on the land&nbsp; while it was still in the&nbsp; plaintiff's possession, we agree with the court below in considering that it is not inadequate.<br><br>Finding no reason in the record to depart from the conclusions set forth in the judgment appealed from, we hereby affirm it&nbsp; in its entirety, with costs against the plaintiff. So ordered.<br><br><i>Avance√±a, C. J., Johnson, Street, Malcolm, Villamor,</i> and <i>Ostrand, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br>JOHNS, <i>J.</i>:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">I&nbsp; dissent.</div></div>
