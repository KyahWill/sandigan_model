				<BR><STRONG>VILLAMOR, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">By a public document Exhibit A, dated January 17, 1921, the 
plaintiff sold two parcels of land to the defendant for the lump sum of P47,000, 
payable in installments.
<p align="justify">The conditions of the payment were: P5,000 at the time of 
signing the contract Exhibit A; P20,000 upon delivery by the vendor to the 
purchaser of the Torrens title to the first parcel described in the deed of 
sale, P10,000 upon delivery by the vendor to the purchaser of Torrens title to 
the second parcel; and lastly the sum of P12,000 one year after the delivery of 
the Torrens title to the second parcel. </p>
<p align="justify">The vendee paid P5,000 to the vendor when the contract was 
signed. The vendor delivered the Torrens title to the first parcel to the vendee 
who, pursuant to the agreement, paid him P20,000. In the month of March 1921, 
Torrens title to the second parcel was issued and forthwith delivered by the 
vendor to the vendee who, however, failed to pay the P10,000 da agreed, neither 
did she pay the remaining Pl2,000 one year after having received the Torrens 
title to the second parcel. </p>
<p align="justify">The plaintiff here claims the sum of P22,000, with legal 
interest from the month of April 1921 on the sum of P10,000, and from April 1922 
on the sum of P12,000, until full payment of the amounts claimed. </p>
<p align="justify">The defendant admits that she purchased the two parcels of land 
referred to by the plaintiff, by virtue of the deed of sale Exhibit A, but 
alleges in defense: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) That the plaintiff knowing that the second parcel of 
land he sold had an area of 60 hectares, by misrepresentation lead the defendant 
to believe that said second parcel contained 98 hectares, and thus made it 
appear in the deed of sale and induced the vendee to bind herself to pay the 
price of P47,000 for the two parcels of land, which he represented contained an 
area of no less than 200 hectares, to which price the defendant would not have 
bound herself had she known that the real area of the second parcel was 60 
hectares, and, consequently, she is entitled to a reduction in the price of the 
two parcels in proportion to the area lacking, that is, that the price be 
reduced to P38,000; (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) that the defendant, in addition to the amounts 
acknowledged by the plaintiff, had paid other sums amounting to P4,000; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) 
that the defendant never refused to pay the justly reduced price, but the 
plaintiff refused to receive the just amount of the debt.</p>
<p align="justify">And by way of cross-complaint, the defendant prays that she be 
indemnified in the sum of P15,000 for damages sustained by her by reason of the 
malicious filing of the instant complaint. </p>
<p align="justify">The plaintiff, replying to the amended answer, alleges that the 
contract of sale in question was made only for the lump sum of P47,000, and not 
at the rate of so much per hectare, and that the defendant's claim for alleged 
damages has prescribed. </p>
<p align="justify">The lower court, having minutely analyzed the evidence adduced 
by the parties held that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant gave any 
importance to the area of the land in consenting to the contract in question, 
and that there having been no fraud when the parties agreed to the lump sum for 
the two parcels of land described in the deed Exhibit A, following article 1471 
of the Civil Code, ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of P19,300 
with legal interest at 8 per cent per annum from April 30, 1921 on the sum of 
P7,300, and from April 30, 1922, on the sum of P12,000. And finally dismissed 
the defendant's cross-complaint, without special pronouncement as to costs. </p>
<p align="justify">A motion for a new trial having been denied, this case was 
brought up to this court through the proper bill of exceptions. </p>
<p align="justify">The appellant alleges that the trial court erred in not 
considering that the plaintiff induced the defendant by deceit, to pay him the 
stipulated price for the two parcels he sold, stating falsely in the deed of 
sale that the second of said parcels had an area of 98 hectares when he knew 
that in reality it only had about 60 hectares more or less, or at least, if such 
deceit was not practised that there was a mistake on the part of Maria Gay in 
believing that said second parcel contained 98 hectares. </p>
<p align="justify">As a question of fact the trial court found from the evidence 
adduced by the parties, that the plaintiff had not practised any deception in 
agreeing with the defendant upon the sale of the two parcels of land described 
in Exhibit A. We concur with the trial court in this conclusion. It appears of 
record that before the execution of the contract Exhibit A, the defendant went 
over the plaintiffs land and made her own calculations as to the area of said 
two parcels. But this is not all. The plaintiff delivered to the defendant the 
documents covering the land he was trying to sell. As to the first parcel there 
is no question whatever and the defendant's contention is limited solely to the 
actual area of the second parcel. The defendant had document Exhibit 4 in her 
possession which is the deed by which the plaintiff acquired the land from the 
original owner, Crispulo Beramo, in which document it appears that the area of 
the second parcel is about 70 hectares. It was the defendant who intrusted the 
drawing of the deed of sale Exhibit A to her attorney and notary, Hontiveros, 
and it is to be presumed that both she and the lawyer who drew the document 
Exhibit A, had read the contents of the document Exhibit 4. The plaintiff 
declares that he signed the document between 5 and 7 in the afternoon of that 
day and he did not pay any attention to the area of the second parcel, probably 
in the belief that in the drawing of the document the data concerning the area 
of the land had been taken from the said Exhibit 4. The defendant testified that 
she received from the plaintiff a note or piece of paper containing the data to 
be inserted in the contract Exhibit A. The plaintiff denies this and said note 
or piece of paper was not presented at the trial. We are of opinion that this 
testimony of the defendant's is unimportant, because, in reality, if the 
plaintiff had delivered Exhibit 4 to the defendant, there was no need to deliver 
to her another note to indicate the area of the second parcel which already 
appeared in the said Exhibit 4. </p>
<p align="justify">If, notwithstanding the fact that it appeared in Exhibit 4 that 
the area of the second parcel was, approximately, 70 hectares, the defendant, 
however, stated in said document Exhibit A that said second parcel contained 98 
hectares as was admitted by him in his interviews with the plaintiff in the 
months of April and June, 1924, then she has no right to claim from the 
plaintiff the shortage in area of the second parcel. Furthermore, there is no 
evidence of record that the plaintiff made false representation to the defendant 
as to the area of said second parcel, and even if he did make such false 
representations as are now imputed to him by the defendant, the latter accepted 
such representations at her own risk and she is the only one responsible for the 
consequences of her inexcusable credulousness. In the case of Songco vs. Sellner 
(37 Phil., 254), the court said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The law allows considerable latitude to seller's statements, 
or dealer's talk; and experience teaches that it is exceedingly risky to accept 
it at its face value.</p>
<p align="justify">"Assertions concerning the property which is the subject of a 
contract of sale, or in regard to its qualities and characteristics, are the 
usual and ordinary means used by sellers to obtain a high price and are always 
understood as affording to buyers no ground for omitting to make inquiries. A 
man who relies upon such an affirmation made by a person whose interest might so 
readily prompt him to exaggerate the value of his property does so at his peril, 
and must take the consequences of his own imprudence."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The defendant had ample opportunity to appraise herself of the 
condition of the land which she purchased, and the plaintiff did nothing to 
prevent her from making such investigation as she deemed fit, and, as was said 
in Songco vs. Sellner, <span style="font-style: italic;">supra</span>, when the purchaser proceeds to make investigations 
by himself, and the vendor does nothing to prevent such investigation from being 
as complete as the former might wish, the purchaser cannot later allege that the 
vendor made false representations to him. (National Cash Register Co. vs. 
Townsend, 137 N. C., 652; 70 L. R. A., 349; Williamson vs. Holt, 147 N. C., 515.) 
The same doctrine has been sustained by the courts; of the United States in the 
following cases, among others: "Misrepresentations by a vendor of real property 
with reference to its area are not actionable, where a correct description of 
the property was given in the deed and recorded chain of title, which the 
purchaser's agent undertook to investigate and report upon, and the vendor made 
no effort to prevent a full investigation," (Shappirio vs. Goldberg, 48 Law. 
ed., 419.) "One who contracts for the purchase of real estate in reliance on the 
representations and statements of the vendor as to its character and value, but 
after he has visited and examined it for himself, and has had the means and 
opportunity of verifying such statements, cannot avoid the contract on the 
ground that they were false or exaggerated," (Brown vs. Smith, 109 Fed., 
26.)</p>
<p align="justify">That the defendant knew that the area of the second parcel was 
only about 70 hectares is shown by the fact that she received the document 
Exhibit 4 before the execution of the contract Exhibit A, as also Exhibit E-3 on 
September 30, 1920; which is the notification of the day for the trial of the 
application for registration of said parcel, wherein it appears that it had an 
area of 60 hectares more or less, and by the fact that she received from the 
plaintiff in the month of June 1924 the copy of the plans of the two parcels, 
wherein appear their respective areas; and yet, in spite of all this, she did 
not complain of the difference in the area of said second parcel until the year 
1926. Moreover, the record contains several of the defendant's letters to the 
plaintiff in the years 1921 to 1925, in which said defendant acknowledges her 
debt, and confining herself to petitioning for extensions of time within which 
to make payment for the reasons given therein. But in none of these letters is 
there any allusion to such lack of area, nor did she complain to the plaintiff 
of the supposed deceit of which she believes she is a victim. All of which, in 
our opinion, shows that no such deceit was practised, as the trial court rightly 
found.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the alleged error to the effect that the trial court 
failed to order the reduction from the price due on the second parcel as stated 
in the contract of sale Exhibit A, the proportional price of the area lacking, 
we are of the opinion that said error has no legal ground. </p>
<p align="justify">It appears that by the contract Exhibit A, the parties agreed 
to the sale of two parcels of land, the first one containing 102 hectares, 67 
ares and 32 centares, and the second one containing about 98 hectares, for the 
lump sum of P47,000 payable partly in cash and partly in installments. Said two 
parcels are defined by means of the boundaries given in the instrument. 
Therefore, the case falls within the provision of article 1471 of the Civil 
Code, which reads as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"ART. 1471. In case of the sale of real estate for a lump sum 
and not at the rate of a specified price for each unit of measure, there shall 
be no increase or decrease of the price even if the area be found to be more or 
less than that stated in the contract. </p>
<p align="justify">"The same rule shall apply when two or more estates are sold 
for a single price; but, if in addition to a statement of the boundaries, which 
is indispensable in every conveyance of real estate, the area of the estate 
should be designated in the contract, the vendor shall be obliged to deliver all 
that is included within such boundaries, even should it exceed the area 
specified in the contract; and should he not be able to do so, he shall suffer a 
reduction of the price in proportion to what is lacking of the area, unless the 
contract be annulled by reason of the vendee's refusal to accept anything other 
than that which was stipulated." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The plaintiff contends that, in accordance with the first 
paragraph of this article, the defendant has no right to ask for the reduction 
of the price, whatever may be the area of the two parcels of land sold to her. 
On the other hand, the defendant contends that, according to paragraph 2 of the 
same article of the Civil Code, she has a right to ask for a reduction of the 
price due on the second parcel, in proportion to the area lacking. </p>
<p align="justify">In his comments on the article cited, Manresa says, among other 
things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"* * * If the sale was made for a price per unit of measure or 
number, the consideration of the contract with respect to the vendee, is the 
number of such units, or, if you wish, the thing purchased as determined by the 
stipulated number of units. But if, on the other hand, the sale was made for a 
lump sum, the consideration of the contract is the object sold, independently of 
its number or measure, the thing as determined by the stipulated boundaries, 
which has been called in law a <span style="font-style: italic;">determinate</span> object. </p>
<p align="justify">"This difference in consideration between the two cases implies 
a distinct regulation of the obligation to deliver the object, because, for an 
acquittance delivery must be made in accordance with the agreement of the 
parties, and the performance of the agreement must show the confirmation, in 
fact, of the consideration which induces each of the parties to enter into the 
contract.</p>
<p align="justify">"From all this, it follows that the provisions of article 1471 
concerning the delivery of <span style="font-style: italic;">determinate objects</span> had to be materially different 
from those governing the delivery of things sold for a price per unit of measure 
or number. Let us examine it, and for the sake of greater clearness, let us 
expound it as we understand it.</p>
<p align="justify">"With respect to the delivery of determinate objects two cases 
may arise, either the determinate object is delivered as stipulated, that is, 
delivering <span style="font-style: italic;">everything</span> included within the boundaries, inasmuch as it is the 
entirety thereof that distinguishes the <span style="font-style: italic;">determinate object</span>; or that such 
entirety is impaired in the delivery by failing to deliver to the purchaser 
something included within the boundaries. These are the two cases for which the 
Code has provided although, in our opinion, it has not been sufficiently 
explicit in expressing the distinction; hence, at first sight, the article seems 
somewhat difficult to understand. </p>
<p align="justify">"The first paragraph and the first clause of the second 
paragraph of article 1471 deal with the first of said cases; that is where 
everything included within the boundaries as set forth in the contract has been 
delivered. The Code goes on to consider the case where a definite area or number 
has been expressed in the contract, and enunciates the rule to be followed when, 
after delivery, the area included within said boundaries is found not to 
coincide with the aforesaid content or number. Said rule may be thus stated: 
Whether or not the object of sale be one realty for a lump sum, or two or more 
for a single price also a lump sum, and, consequently, not for so much per unit 
of measure or number, there shall be no increase or decrease in the price even 
if the area be found to be more or less than that stated in the contract. </p>
<p align="justify">"Thus understood the reason for the regulation is clear and no 
doubts can arise from its application. It is concerned with <span style="font-style: italic;">determinate objects</span>. 
The consideration of the contract, and the thing to be delivered is a 
<span style="font-style: italic;">determinate object</span>, and not the number of units it contains. The price is 
determined with relation to it; hence, its greater or lesser area cannot 
influence the increase or decrease of the price agreed upon. We have just 
learned the reason for the regulation, bearing in mind that the Code has rightly 
considered an object as determinate for the purposes now treated, when it is a 
single realty as when it is two or more, so long as they are sold for a single 
price constituting a lump sum and not for a specified amount per unit of measure 
or number. </p>
<p align="justify">"We have stated that the second possible case in the delivery 
of determinate objects is that in which, on account of circumstances of diverse 
possible origins, everything included within the boundaries is not delivered. 
</p>
<p align="justify">"We have indicated about that where everything included within 
the boundaries is delivered there can be no increase or decrease in price, no 
matter whether the area be more or less than that given in the contract. From 
this a very important consequence follows, to wit: That if the vendor is bound 
to deliver a determinate object, he is bound to deliver all of it, that is, 
everything within its boundaries, even though these contain a greater area than 
that stated in the contract, and that from the moment he fails to do so, either 
because he cannot, or because, ignoring the meaning of the contract, he alleges 
that it contains a greater area than that stipulated, the contract is partially 
unfulfilled and it is but just that certain actions be available to the vendee 
for the protection of his right.</p>
<p align="justify">"The rule in the latter case is found in the second paragraph 
of article 1471, with the exception of the first clause which refers to the 
former hypothesis. This rule may be stated as follows: Whether or not the object 
of the sale be one realty for a lump sum, or two or more for a single price also 
a lump sum, and, consequently not at the rate of a specified price for each unit 
of measure or number, the vendor shall be bound to deliver everything that is 
included within the boundaries stated, although it may exceed the area or number 
expressed in the contract; in case he cannot deliver it, the purchaser shall 
have the right either to reduce the price proportionately to what is lacking of 
the area or number, or to rescind the contract at his option. </p>
<p align="justify">"Comprehending the meaning of a sale of a determinate object, 
it is easily understood how, in cases wherein by virtue of the rule enunciated, 
the vendor has to deliver a greater area than that expressed in the contract, 
there is, strictly speaking, no excess of area, inasmuch as one may always 
properly ask, excess with respect to what?. With respect to the area appearing 
in the deed, it will be answered. But as this area was not taken into account in 
entering into the contract inasmuch as the parties made neither the amount of 
the price, nor the efficacy of the contract to depend on the number of its 
units; since that area was written in to fulfill a formal requisite demanded by 
the present rules upon the drawing of public instruments, but not as a condition 
essential to the contract, which, if it were not true, would not be consummated, 
it results in the long run, that this detail of the written recital, with 
respect to which the excess is to be estimated, is so negligible, so 
inconsistent, so haphazard, and in the vast majority of cases so wide of the 
mark, that it is impossible to calculate the excess; and considering the nature 
of a contract of sale of a definite object, it cannot be strictly held that 
there is any excess at all. </p>
<p align="justify">"If everything within the stipulated boundaries is not 
delivered, then the determinate object which was the consideration of the 
contract for the vendee, is not delivered; hence his power to nullify it. 
However, it might be (and this he alone can say), that although he has not 
received the object, according to the stipulated terms, it suits him; hence his 
power to carry the contract into effect with the just decrease in price referred 
to in the article under comment.</p>
<p align="justify">"The manner in which the matter covered by this article was 
distributed in its two paragraphs contributes to making it difficult to 
understand. The rule might have been clearly stated had the first clause of the 
second paragraph been included in the first paragraph, the latter to end with 
the words: 'The same rule shall apply when two or more estates are sold for a 
single price,' And if by constituting an independent paragraph, with the rest of 
the second paragraph, it were made to appear more expressly that the rule of the 
second paragraph thus drawn referred to all the cases of paragraph one, as we 
have expounded, namely, to the case of a sale of one single estate and that of 
two or more for one single price, the rule would have been clearer.</p>
<p align="justify">"In our opinion, this would have better answered what we deem 
to be the indubitable intention of the legislator.</p>
<p align="justify">"Some eminent commentators construe the last part of article 
1471 in a different way. To them the phrase and should he not be able to do so" 
as applied to the vendor, does not mean as apparently it does 'should he not be 
able to deliver all that is included within the boundaries stated,' but this 
other thing, namely, that if by reason of the fact that a less area is included 
within the boundaries than that expressed in the contract, it is not possible 
for the vendor to comply therewith according to its literal sense, he must 
suffer either the effects of the nullity of the contract or a reduction of the 
price proportionately to what may be lacking of the area or number. It is added 
as a ground for this solution that if the vendor fulfills the obligation, as 
stated in the article, by delivering what is not included within the boundaries, 
there can never be any case of proportionate reduction of the price on account 
of shortage of area, because he does not give less who delivers all that he 
bound himself to.</p>
<p align="justify">"According to this opinion, which we believe erroneous, if 
within the boundaries of the property sold, there is included more area than 
that expressed in the title deeds, nothing can be claimed by the vendor who 
loses the value of that excess, but if there is less area, then he loses also 
because either the price is reduced or the contract is annulled. This theory 
would be anomalous in case of sale of properties in bulk, but, especially, would 
work a gross injustice which the legislator never intended. </p>
<p align="justify">"There is no such thing. So long as the vendor can deliver, and 
for that reason, delivers all the land included within the boundaries assigned 
to the property, there can be no claim whatsoever either on his part, although 
the area may be found to be much greater than what was expressed, nor on the 
part of the purchaser although that area may be in reality much smaller. But as 
he sold everything within the boundaries and this is all the purchaser has paid, 
or must pay for whether much or little, if afterwards it is found that he cannot 
deliver all, because, for instance, a part, a building, a valley, various pieces 
of land, a glen, etc., are not his, there is no sale of a determinate object, 
there is no longer a sale of the object agreed upon, and the solution given by 
the article is then just and logical: Either the contract is annulled or the 
price is reduced proportionately." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">We have quoted from Manresa's Commentaries at length for a 
better understanding of the doctrine on the matter, inasmuch as the contending 
counsel have inserted in their respective briefs only such portions of said 
commentaries as relate to their respective contentions.</p>
<p align="justify">It may be seen from a careful reading of the commentaries on 
said article 1471, that the great author distinguishes between the two cases 
dealt with in article 1471, and formulates the proper rules for each. In the 
delivery of a determinate object, says the author, two cases may arise: either 
the determinate object is delivered as stipulated, that is, delivering 
everything included within the boundaries, inasmuch as it is the entirety 
thereof that distinguishes the <span style="font-style: italic;">determinate object</span>; or that such entirety is 
impaired in the delivery by failing to deliver to the purchaser something 
included within the boundaries. For the first case, Manresa gives the following 
rule: "Whether or not the object of the sale be one realty for a lump sum, or 
two or" more for a single price also a lump sum, and, consequently, not for so 
much per unit of measure or number, there shall be no increase or decrease in 
the price even if the area be found to be more or less than that stated in the 
contract." And for the second case, this other: "Whether or not the object of 
the sale be one realty for a lump sum, or two or more for a single price also a 
lump sum, and, consequently, not at the rate of a specified price for each unit 
of measure or number, the vendor shall be bound to deliver everything that is 
included within the boundaries stated, although it may exceed the area or number 
expressed in the contract; in case he cannot deliver it, the purchaser shall 
have the right either to reduce the price proportionately to what is lacking of 
the area or number, or to rescind the contract, at his option."</p>
<p align="justify">Considering the facts of the present controversy, it seems 
clear to us that the rule formulated for the second paragraph of article 1471 is 
inapplicable in the instant case inasmuch as all the land included within the 
boundaries of the two parcels sold has been delivered in its entirety to the 
vendee. There is no division of the land enclosed within the boundaries of the 
properties sold; the determinate object which is the subject matter of the 
contract has been delivered by the vendor in its entirety as he obligated 
himself to do. Therefore, there is no right to complain either on the part of 
the vendor, even if there be a greater area than that stated in the deed, or on 
the part of the vendee, though the area of the second parcel be really much 
smaller. (Irureta Goyena vs. Tambunting, 1 Phil., 490.)</p>
<p align="justify">With regard to the damages prayed for by the defendant, the 
lower court finally dismissed the cross-complaint without special pronouncement 
as to costs. And according to the decision of the Supreme Court of Spain of 
1897, a judgment absolving a party from a claim of damages against him, who has 
not contravened his obligations, does not violate articles 1101 and 1108 of the 
Civil Code. </p>
<p align="justify">With respect to the question of interest, the lower court 
likewise held that, as the defendant had not paid the sum of P7,300 on April 
30, 1921, when the plaintiff had delivered the certificate of title, she was in 
default from that date and also from the date of one year thereafter, with 
respect to the sum of P12,000, constituting the last period of the obligation. 
We are of the opinion that the lower court has committed no error which should 
be corrected by this court. </p>
<p align="justify">The judgment appealed from being in accordance with the law, it 
should be as it is hereby, affirmed, with costs against the appellant. So 
ordered. </p>
