				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Assailed in this ordinary appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> is the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated May 23, 2018 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09073 which affirmed the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated August 1, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court of Tabaco City, Branch 18 (RTC) in Criminal Case Nos. T-5869 and T-5870, finding accused-appellant Jocel Bañares De Dios @ "Tata" (accused-appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Sections 5 and 11, Article II of Republic Act No. (RA) 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>This case stemmed from two (2) Informations<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> filed before the RTC charging accused-appellant of Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs, respectively. The prosecution alleged that on June 5, 2014, members of the Tabaco City Police Station, together with the confidential informant, successfully implemented a buy-bust operation against accused-appellant, during which one (1) heat-sealed plastic sachet containing 0.024 gram of white crystalline substance was recovered from him. Upon further search, the police officer was able to seize a pouch containing two (2) more heat-sealed plastic sachets of suspected <i>shabu</i> from accused-appellant's possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Immediately thereafter, the police officer conducted the marking, inventory, and photography of the seized items in the presence of media representative Rodel B. Brotamonte (Brotamonte), Department of Justice (DOJ) representative Romulo B. Barbacena (Barbacena), Barangay Official Elmer U. Gascon (Gascon), and accused­ appellant at the place of apprehension.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The seized items were then brought to the crime laboratory,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> where after examination, tested positive for <i>methamphetamine hydrochloride</i>, a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In his defense, accused-appellant denied the charges against him, claiming, instead, that during that time, he was at Riosa St., Tabaco City waiting for a pedicab, when Police Officer (PO) 3 Benedict Codia (PO3 Codia) suddenly placed his arms around accused-appellant's shoulders and handcuffed him. Thereafter, accused-appellant was brought to the police station, where PO1 Chona Cea allegedly handed to PO3 Codia a paper wrapped in a P500.00-bill with three (3) sachets of <i>shabu</i> inside. He claimed that the said items were planted and that his arrest was ill-motivated, having been arrested by PO3 Codia for theft only to be released later for lack of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated August 1, 2016, the RTC found accused­ appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violations of Sections 5 and 11, Article II of RA 9165, and accordingly, sentenced him as follows: (<i>a</i>) in Criminal Case No. T-5869, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment, and a fine in the amount of P500,000.00; and (<i>b</i>) in Criminal Case No. T-5870, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of twelve (12) years and one (1) day, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, as maximum, and a fine in the amount of P300,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It ruled that the prosecution was able to establish by clear and convincing evidence all the elements of the crimes charged. It gave credence to the clear and convincing testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, and hence, should prevail over accused-appellant's uncorroborated and self-serving defenses of denial and frame-up.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Aggrieved, accused-appellant appealed to the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated May 23, 2018, the CA affirmed <i>in toto</i> the RTC ruling. It found that the prosecution was able to successfully establish all the elements necessary to convict accused-appellant of the crimes charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Hence, this appeal seeking that accused-appellant's conviction be overturned.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The appeal is without merit.<br><br>The elements of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 are: (<i>a</i>) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (<i>b</i>) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment; while the elements of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 are: (<i>a</i>) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (<i>b</i>) such possession was not authorized by law; and (<i>c</i>) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Here, the courts <i>a quo</i> correctly found that accused-appellant committed the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs, as the records clearly show that he was caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i> selling <i>shabu</i> to the poseur-buyer, PO3 Codia, during a legitimate buy-bust operation conducted by the members of the Tabaco City Police Station. Similarly, the courts <i>a quo</i> also correctly ruled that accused-appellant committed the crime of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs as he freely and consciously possessed plastic sachets containing <i>shabu</i> when he was arrested. Since there is no indication that the said courts overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case, the Court finds no reason to deviate from their factual findings. In this regard, it should be noted that the trial court is in the best position to assess and determine the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Further, the Court notes that the buy-bust team had sufficiently complied with the chain of custody rule under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165.<br><br>As a general rule, it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Failing to prove the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i> renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and hence, warrants an acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>To establish the identity of the dangerous drugs with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires, <i>inter alia</i>, that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The law further requires that the said inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (<i>a</i>) if <b>prior</b> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> a representative from the media <u><i>and</i></u> the DOJ, and any elected public official;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> or (<i>b</i>) if <b>after</b> the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <u><i>or</i></u> the media.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In this case, it is glaring from the records that after accused-appellant was arrested, the buy-bust team immediately took custody of the seized plastic sachets, and conducted the marking, inventory, and photography of the seized items in the presence of Media Representative Brotamonte, DOJ Representative Barbacena, Barangay Official Gascon, and accused-appellant at the place of arrest,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> in conformity with the witness requirement under RA 9165. PO3 Codia then personally delivered all the evidence seized to Forensic Chemist Police. Senior Inspector Wilfredo I. Pabustan, Jr., who performed the necessary tests thereon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In view of the foregoing, the Court holds that there is sufficient compliance with the chain of custody rule, and thus, the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i> have been properly preserved. Perforce, accused-appellant's conviction must stand.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>. The Decision dated May 23, 2018 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 09073 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.

Resurreccion</i>, 618 Phil. 520, 532 [2009]) Hence, the failure to immediately mark the confiscated items at the place of arrest neither renders them inadmissible in evidence nor impairs the integrity of the seized drugs, as the conduct of marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team is sufficient compliance with the rules on chain of custody. (See <i>People v. Tumulak</i>, 791 Phil. 148, 160-161 [2016]; and <i>People v.
