B-01591 and B-01592, finding Diosdado Jagdon, Jr. (accused-appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of Rape and Acts of Lasciviousness. The CA sentenced accused-appellant to the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> for the crime of Rape and modified his sentence for the crime of Acts of Lasciviousness to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its minimum period, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years, six (6) months and twenty-one (21) days of <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period, as maximum. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Proceedings Before the Trial Court </b> </p><p align="left"><b>The Charges</b> </p><p> Two separate <i>Informations</i> for Rape and Acts of Lasciviousness were filed against accused-appellant involving two minors, <i>viz</i>.: </p><blockquote> <p><u>Criminal Case No. B-01591</u></p> <p> That sometime in the third week of January, 2003 at noon, in <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span> Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, with lewd design, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with [AAA],<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> a 9 year old minor, against her will and consent. </p> <p>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p> <p><u>Criminal Case No. B-01592</u></p> <p> That sometime in the third week of January 2003, in the evening, in <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously with lewd design, lick the [genitalia] of [BBB], a 6 [year] old girl, against her will and consent.</p> <p> CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> On arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to both charges. Joint trial ensued. </p><p> <b>The Prosecution's Version</b> </p><p> Accused-appellant was the live-in partner of the aunt of AAA's father, who happened to be their neighbor. One afternoon in the later part of January 2003, nine (9)-year-old AAA was just near her home in <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span> when accused-appellant suddenly brought her inside a pigpen. There, accused-appellant started licking AAA's vagina then proceeded to insert his penis into her vagina. He continued with this motion for several times. AAA struggled and experienced pain during the penetration with accused-appellant proving too strong for her. After satisfying his bestial desires, accused-appellant gave AAA some cash and told her not to tell anyone about what happened.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> This incident was witnessed by AAA's younger sister, BBB, who was then on the road across the pigpen. BBB saw accused-appellant sitting inside the pigpen licking AAA's genitals while the latter was standing. Thereafter, she saw accused-appellant exit the pigpen. Her sister also left and joined a group of children who were playing nearby.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p>Around the same week in January 2003, while six (6)-year-old BBB was playing alone outside their house, accused-appellant called her and instructed her to go inside. While inside the house, with the front door open, accused-appellant made BBB lie on a bed. He removed her skirt and underwear. He started licking BBB's vagina and inserted his finger into it. Thereafter, accused-appellant gave her P3.00 and told her not to tell her mother about what happened.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p>Sometime in February 2003, due to an argument AAA and BBB had, BBB went and told their mother, CCC, that AAA had been having sex with accused-appellant. AAA was brought to a local government hospital to undergo a medical examination. In her provisional medical certificate, the examining doctor found indications suggestive of sexual abuse. This was confirmed by Dr. Naomi Poca<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Dr. Poca) of Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p>AAA disclosed that the incident in the pigpen witnessed by her sister was not an isolated one. Accused-appellant had been sexually ravishing her for quite some time. This usually occurs inside the pigpen, her house, accused-appellant's house or at a nearby banana grove. After each incident, accused-appellant would usually give her money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> <b>The Defense's Version</b> </p><p> Accused-appellant admitted that AAA was only nine (9) years old at the time of the rape incident and that BBB is younger than AAA, but he denied authorship of the crimes committed against the two minor victims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He claimed that when the rape incident happened, he was at his workplace in <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span>.

B-01591 and B-01592, is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS. Accused-Appellant DIOSDADO JAGDON JR. is found GUILTY of the crime of rape against AAA, and is sentenced to the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. He is ordered to pay AAA the amounts of Seventy Five Thousand Pesos (Php 75,000.00) as civil indemnity.

Fifteen Thousand Pesos (PhP 15,000.00) as exemplary damages and Fifteen Thousand Pesos (PhP 15,000.00) as fine.</p> <p> All awards of damages are subjected to legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) [<em>per annum</em>] from the date of finality of this decision until fully paid.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The CA held that AAA's testimony, coupled with her declaration of her minority at the time of the rape incident, as well as accused-appellant's open admission of such during trial, elucidates with sufficiency all the elements for the charge of rape — sexual copulation by accused-appellant with a girl below 12 years of age.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p> It further held that all the elements of the crime of acts of lasciviousness were duly proven by accused-appellant's act of intentionally inserting his finger into BBB's vagina and licking the same. Such conduct definitely exhibits accused-appellant's intent to abuse, degrade, and harass BBB's person and extract arousal or sexual gratification.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The Present Appeal</b> </p><p>Accused-appellant now seeks affirmative relief from this Court and prays anew for his acquittal. In compliance with Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated January 10, 2019, accused-appellant manifested that in lieu of supplemental briefs, he is adopting his brief filed before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) manifested that it will no longer file a supplemental brief since all the issues raised by accused-appellant have already been sufficiently addressed in its plaintiff-appellee's brief likewise filed before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>Issue</b> </p><p> The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA erred in affirming accused-appellant's conviction for the crimes of Rape and Acts of Lasciviousness.</p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling</b> </p><p> The instant appeal lacks merit. Modifications, however, as to the nomenclature of the crime in Criminal Case No. B-01591 for Rape and nomenclature of the crime and award of damages in Criminal Case No. B-01592 for Acts of Lasciviousness are in order. </p><p> At the outset, <em>We</em> stress that assessment of the credibility of witnesses is a task most properly within the domain of trial courts. Factual findings of the trial court carry great weight and respect due to the unique opportunity afforded to them to observe the witnesses when placed on the stand. Consequently, appellate courts will not overturn the factual findings of the trial court in the absence of facts or circumstances of weight and substance that would affect the result of the case. This rule finds an even more stringent application where the said findings are sustained by the CA, as in the instant case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><table width="30%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><b><i>Criminal Case No. B-01591 - Statutory Rape.</i></b> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Rape is defined and penalized under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Republic Act No. (RA) 8353,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <i>viz</i>.: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 266-A.

Clearly, the charge was for Statutory Rape under Article 266-A (1) (d) of the RPC. </p><p> Statutory rape is committed by sexual intercourse with a woman below 12 years of age regardless of her consent, or the lack of it, to the sexual act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p> The elements necessary in every prosecution for statutory rape are: (1) the offended party is under 12 years of age; and (2) the accused had carnal knowledge of the victim, regardless of whether there was force, threat, or intimidation or grave abuse of authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Proof of force, intimidation or consent is unnecessary as they are not elements of statutory rape, considering that the absence of free consent is conclusively presumed when the victim is below the age of 12.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p> Here, both these elements are present in this case. </p><p> <i>The element of age.</i> </p><p> In statutory rape cases, the best evidence to prove the age of the offended party is the latter's birth certificate. But in certain cases, the Court admits of exceptions. In <i>People v. Pruna</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> this Court have set guidelines in appreciating age, either as an element of the crime or as a qualifying circumstance, among which: </p><blockquote> <p> 4. In the absence of a certificate of live birth, authentic document, or the testimony of the victim's mother or relatives concerning the victim's age, <b>the complainant's testimony will suffice provided that it is expressly and clearly admitted by the accused</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Here, the prosecution failed to present and offer in evidence AAA's birth certificate. Nonetheless, AAA testified as to her minority at the time of the rape incident, while accused-appellant expressly admitted that AAA was only nine (9) years old at that time, <i>viz</i>.: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify"><strong>Q:</strong></div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify"><strong>Will you agree with me that at the time of the incident, the age of [AAA] is 9 years old? </strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><strong>A:</strong></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><strong>Yes.</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">And you will agree with me that [AAA] has a younger sister named [BBB].</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><strong>Q:</strong></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><strong>And [BBB] is younger than [AAA]? </strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"><strong>A:</strong></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><strong>Yes.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>The prosecution may have been unable to present AAA's birth certificate or other authentic document such as a baptismal certificate during trial, however, such failure to present relevant evidence will not deter this Court from upholding that statutory rape was indeed committed by accused-appellant because he himself admitted in his testimony in open court that AAA was only nine (9) years old at the time of the rape incident. In the Court's view, this admission from accused-appellant, taken with the testimony of AAA, sufficiently proved that AAA was under 12 years of age at the time of the rape incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p> <p> <i>The element of carnal knowledge.</i> </p><p> Both the RTC and the CA gave credence to AAA's testimony. She was able to fully and sufficiently establish the fact that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of her. As correctly found by the CA, AAA was categorical in detailing her harrowing experiences in the hands of accused-appellant, even under the pain of a grueling cross-examination. Her testimony that accused-appellant inserted his penis into, and licked her vagina, was straightforward. Significantly, AAA's Provisional Medical Certificate states "<i>Medical Evaluation (sic) suggestive of sexual abuse</i>," which medical finding was affirmed and confirmed by Dr. Poca of Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p><p> <i>We</i> find that the prosecution, through AAA's categorical and straightforward testimony, was able to sufficiently establish mat accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA.

During the last incident accused-appellant inserted his penis into her vagina, fully satisfying the element of carnal knowledge in statutory rape. </p> <p> Moreover, records disclose that AAA cried and refused to answer when she was asked "<i>Can you tell us what did the accused do to you?</i>" during her direct examination. The hearing was even reset because of her crying. Such spontaneous emotional outburst strengthens her credibility. This Court has held that the crying of the victim during her testimony is evidence of the credibility of the rape charge with the verity born out of human nature and experience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p><p> In <i>People v. Ronquillo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the Court discussed: </p><blockquote> <p> This Court has held time and again that testimonies of rape victims who are young and immature deserve full credence, considering that no young woman, especially of tender age, would concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private parts, and thereafter pervert herself by being subject to a public trial, if she was not motivated solely by the desire to obtain justice for the wrong committed against her. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth. It is highly improbable that a girl of tender years, one not yet exposed to the ways of the world, would impute to any man a crime so serious as rape if what she claims is not true.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In a bid to exonerate himself from the statutory rape charge, accused-appellant challenges the testimony of AAA that he raped her in the pigpen, a place which was open to the view of their neighbors. He posits that it is quite mind-boggling that a rapist would just attack his victim without even thinking of the possibility that he can easily be caught by the people around.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p> To further his chance for exoneration, accused-appellant also point to the testimony of AAA's sister, BBB, that AAA immediately joined and played with the children in the area after the alleged rape incident. He argues that it is inconceivable for anyone to still be able to play with others after an unusual and harrowing experience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> Lastly, accused-appellant relies heavily on BBB's testimony that she saw accused-appellant merely kissing her sister's vagina while accused-appellant was sitting and her sister standing. He maintains that assuming that an incident indeed transpired between accused-appellant and AAA, the same does not constitute rape because BBB testified that accused-appellant was merely kissing AAA's vagina.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> Accused-appellant's arguments failed to persuade. </p><p> <i>For one</i>, as explained in <i>People v. Agudo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> this Court has long found and held that: </p><blockquote> <p> Rapists are not deterred from committing the odious act of sexual abuse by the mere presence of people nearby or even family members; rape is committed not exclusively in seclusion. Several cases instruct [Us] that lust is no respecter of time or place and rape defies constraint of time and space.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, the fact that the subject rape incident happened in a place which was open to the view of their neighbors does not negate the fact that accused-appellant indeed raped AAA. </p><p> <i>For another</i>, the fact that AAA immediately joined and played with the children in the area after the rape incident does not run counter to AAA's claim that she was ravished by accused-appellant. <i>We</i> note AAA's testimony that she was ravished by accused-appellant several times and the rape incident subject of this instant case only pertains to the last one, which may have produced lesser pain on the part of AAA compared to the first few incidents. Too, although the conduct of the victim immediately following the alleged sexual assault is of utmost importance as it tends to establish the truth or falsity of the charge, it is, however, inaccurate to say that there is a typical reaction or norm of behavior among rape victims. The workings of the human mind and body when placed under emotional stress are unpredictable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> In <i>People v.

Not every victim can be expected to act with reason or conformably with the usual expectation of mankind. Certainly, it is unfair to expect and demand a rational reaction or a standard behavioral response from AAA, who was confronted with such startling and traumatic experience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Still for another</i>, as correctly found by the CA, the alleged inconsistency between the testimony of AAA that accused-appellant inserted the tip of his penis into her vagina while inside the pigpen, and that of her sister BBB, who narrated that she only saw accused-appellant sitting down, licking AAA's vagina while the latter was standing near him, is not fatal to the finding of guilt of accused-appellant. BBB's testimony itself reveals that she did not actually see accused-appellant and her sister enter the pigpen nor did she testify that she saw the whole occurrence. <i>We</i> agree with the CA's finding that the fact that BBB witnessed a portion of it - one which did not include the penetration of her sister's genitals, does not negate the fact that accused-appellant indeed sexually ravished AAA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p> <i>We</i> note however that although AAA testified and established that she was ravished by accused-appellant several times, the latter can only be convicted of one count of statutory rape since the information filed against him in Criminal Case No. B-01591 charges him of only one count </p><table width="30%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><i><b>Criminal Case No. B-01592 - Acts of Lasciviousness. </b></i></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> When acts of lasciviousness is committed against a child under 12 years old, the designation of the crime committed shall be Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5 (b) of RA 7610.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Meanwhile, Section 5 (b) of RA 7610<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> provides that when the victim of Acts of Lasciviousness is under 12 years of age, the offender shall be prosecuted under the RPC, provided that the penalty for lascivious conduct shall be <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p> Acts of Lasciviousness under the RPC has the following elements: (1) that the offender commits any act of lasciviousness or lewdness; (2) that it is done by using force or intimidation, or when the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or when the offended party is under 12 years of age; and (3) that the offended party is another person of either sex.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></p><p> Both the RTC and the CA gave credence to BBB's straightforward and candid testimony.

Accused-appellant, however, cannot be convicted of Sexual Assault because the information (Criminal Case No. B-01592) charged him with Acts of Lasciviousness only. </p> <p> Sexual assault is a crime undoubtedly greater than Acts of Lasciviousness.

Notably, however, accused-appellant failed to present any clear and convincing proof that AAA, BBB, and their family were moved by hatred or revenge.
