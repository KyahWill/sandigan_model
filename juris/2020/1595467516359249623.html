Puentevella (respondents).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The complaint alleges that to enable NAPOCOR to construct and maintain its Kabankalan-Maricalum 138KV Transmission Line Island Grid Project, a project for public purpose, it is both necessary and urgent to acquire easement of right of way over portions of parcels of land, particularly Lot Numbers 2746 and 1316, owned and possessed by the respondents, consisting of more or less a total area of 54,060 square meters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> After depositing the amount of P258,000.00 with the Philippine National Bank, Kabankalan Branch (PNB-Kabankalan), representing the provisional and assessed value of the property affected, NAPOCOR was placed in possession of the subject properties on August 3, 1999.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> Due to the need to include Lot 2747 and its improvements, considering NAPOCOR has also taken possession of the property, NAPOCOR was directed to amend its complaint on March 10, 2000.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Thus, the Amended Complaint included Lot 2747 and increased the total area for expropriation to more or less 60,526.50 sq. meters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> In an Order dated April 29, 2003, the RTC dismissed the case without prejudice, for failure to prosecute for an unreasonable length of time, which was reconsidered and set aside on October 15, 2003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> It then constituted a Board of Commissioners to determine the just compensation for the affected properties, which submitted its report on October 25, 2007.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> Eventually, on May 26, 2011, the RTC rendered its Decision ordering the expropriation of the lands in question.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In determining just compensation, the RTC took into account and gave weight to the empirical data provided by Department of Finance Department Order No. 60-97, which assigned zonal values for 1997.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It also considered the fact that the lots were planted with sugarcane despite its residential classification, as well as the extent of disturbance that the expropriation would cause to the respondents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> As disposed: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, premises considered, in the interest of justice, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of [NAPOCOR] as follows: </p> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">An order of expropriation is hereby issued declaring xxx NAPOCOR to have the lawful right to take the properties of the [respondents] as alleged in the amended complaint particularly in Lot(s) No. 1316 with an affected area of 16,560 sq. meters, more or less; Lot Nos. 2746 (717-A) with an affected area of 37,500 sq. meters more or less and Lot No. 2747 (717-B) with an affected area of 6,466.50 more or less, as shown by the respective sketch plans for the areas affected as annexed to the complaint, for the purpose of the operation of [NAPOCOR's] Kabankalan-Maricalum 138 KV Transmission Island Grid Project.

The May 26, 2011 Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), 6<sup>th</sup> Judicial Region, Branch 61 of Kabankalan City, in Civil Case No. 861 is <b>AFFIRMED, with MODIFICATION</b>, in that paragraph (c) thereof should read: </p> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">(c)</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">the amount of [P]258,000.00 earlier deposited with the Philippine National Bank shall be deducted from the total amount of just compensation of the subject properties and thus the remaining balance to be paid by [NAPOCOR] to [respondents] as just compensation shall be P18,661,113.75 with <b>legal interest of 12% per annum</b> <u>from the time of the filing of the complaint until fully paid</u>. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Undeterred, NAPOCOR filed this petition, raising the lone issue of whether or not: </p><blockquote> <p> The amount of just compensation awarded to respondents should be based on the prevailing price and character of the property at the time [of] filing of the Complaint for eminent domain [in] 1998.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> NAPOCOR submits that the court a quo erred by considering the improvements on the property as of 2006 in fixing the amount of just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> On the other hand, respondents argue that NAPOCOR misleads us by contending that the RTC erroneously determined just compensation which the RTC based on established factors affecting the value of the properties in 1998 conformably with Rule 67 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p> Upon careful review of the petition, we find no need to remand this case for a re-determination of just compensation.</p><p> As correctly noted by the CA-Cebu City, the RTC properly ascertained the value and character of the property as of the time of the filing of the complaint (the year 1998), pursuant to the appropriate period under the Rules of Court and jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The appellate court observed that the trial court did not consider the improvements on the subject properties as of 2006, which is certainly not the proper period for the correct determination of just compensation in this case. The assailed decision partly reads: </p><blockquote> <p> Though the trial court made mention of the observations of the Commissioners, particularly the improvements had on the subject properties, after the year 1998 or after the filing of the original expropriation complaint thereon; a closer scrutiny of the ratiocinations of the trial court reveals, that it did not take into consideration these improvements in determining just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> "Factual findings of the trial and appellate courts will not be disturbed by this Court unless they are grounded entirely on speculations, surmises, or conjectures, among others."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> NAPOCOR's submission raises a new factual allegation. As a rule, this Court is not a trier of facts. Only questions of law distinctly set forth in the petition ought to be raised before this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The petition now refers to a particular period - that is, the year 2006 - on which allegedly, the trial court erroneously based its determination. This strains the Court to review the evidence. We, however, find no valid ground that would warrant a reversal of the factual findings of the appellate court or any reasonable basis to treat this case as an exception. </p><p> In the first place, the allegation does not hold. NAPOCOR either misconstrues the ruling of the appellate court or makes it appear that in determining just compensation, the courts <i>a quo</i> recognized the improvements in the year 2006. As alleged in NAPOCOR's petition: </p><blockquote> <p> The trial court fixed the assailed amount of just compensation of the subject properties taking into consideration the fact that there were existing improvements within the vicinity of these properties. xxx This ruling was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, ruling that <u>the values proposed by respondents were "based on a comparative analysis of the fair market value of the properties' peripheral area in the year 2006."</u> </p> <p> It is respectfully submitted that the courts<i> a quo</i> erred in considering said improvements as of the year 2006 in fixing the amount of just compensation. (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The portion of the decision from which the quoted phrase was lifted reveals that the statement refers to respondents' proposal, which the court <i>a quo</i> expressly did not take into account because it was "based on generalities" and "not hinged upon the relevant period." The relevant portion, in fact, reads: </p><blockquote> <p> From the foregoing, it is therefore beyond cavil that <u>the amounts arrived at by the court deserve more merit, than the figures proposed by either [NAPOCOR or respondents]</u> before it. It is worth mentioning that the values proposed by [NAPOCOR] in the complaint were solely based on the tax declarations of the subject properties issued in 1996. <u>The values proposed by [respondents] were, on the other hand, "based on a comparative analysis of the fair market value of the properties' peripheral area in the year 2006</u>." While [NAPOCOR's] tax declaration, cannot, by and of itself, be an absolute substitute to just compensation. <u>The comparative analysis of [respondents] is to Us plainly based on generalities and not hinged upon the relevant period</u>. (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> A complete textual reading does not in any way show that the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, adopted respondents' proposal in arriving at the fair market value of the subject properties. The RTC properly based its valuation on the year 1998, and not 2006. It plainly arrived at the disputed amount independently, after considering the commissioners' report and both parties' respective proposals. </p><p> Having addressed the RTC's ascertainment of the value and character of the properties, we now tackle the interest rate imposed on the amount to be paid to the respondents. It is settled that "the difference in the amount between the final amount as adjudged by the court and the initial payment made by the government - which is part and parcel of the just compensation due to the property owner - should earn legal interest as a forbearance of money."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Here, the amount deposited by NAPOCOR with PNB-Kabankalan constitutes the initial payment that was accordingly deducted by the RTC from the final amount adjudged as just compensation. </p><p> To recall, in the RTC's May 26, 2011 Decision, it ordered the payment of legal interest on the balance of the just compensation computed from the taking of possession of the properties until fully paid. When the CA-Cebu City sustained the RTC's valuation of the properties, it specified the legal interest as 12% per annum, still computed from taking of possession until fully paid. However, in the CA-Cebu City's subsequent resolution on reconsideration, it modified the reckoning period to commence from the time of the filing of the complaint until fully paid. It appears that the reckoning point in Rule 67 for the valuation of expropriated property was similarly applied by the appellate court to the interest rate imposable on the just compensation. </p><p> In <i>Republic v. Macabagdal</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> we had occasion to point out that accrual of legal interest should begin "<i>not</i> from the date of the filing of the complaint but from the date of the issuance of the Writ of Possession xxx, since it is from this date that the fact of the deprivation of property can be established." </p><p> In <i>Evergreen Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the filing of the expropriation complaint also preceded the actual taking of the property and we ruled that "the just compensation shall be appraised as of [the date of filing of the complaint]," and clarified that "no interest shall accrue as the government did not take possession of the subject premises." We then held that the legal interest, on the difference between the final amount adjudged by the Court and the initial payment made, shall accrue from when the government was able to take possession of the property. Here, it was established that the amount deposited by NAPOCOR with PNB-Kabankalan caused it to be placed in possession of the expropriated properties on August 3, 1999. Hence, it is from this date that legal interest should begin to run. </p><p> As to the applicable interest rate specified by the CA-Cebu City as 12% p.a., this is applicable only until June 30, 2013, in line with <i>Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways v. Spouses Tecson</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which upheld the applicability of Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas-Monetary Board Circular No. 799, Series of 2013 to forbearances of money in expropriation cases. Accordingly, the applicable legal interest is 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until the finality of this resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Thereafter, the total amount due shall earn legal interest of 6% per annum from finality of the Court's resolution until full payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated October 29, 2014 and Resolution dated April 8, 2016 of the Court of Appeals-Cebu City in CA-G.R. CV No. 04256 are <b>AFFIRMED subject to the MODIFICATION</b> imposing legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum on the difference between the total amount of just compensation and the initial deposit, which is PhP18,661,113.75, computed from August 3, 1999 until June 30, 2013. Thereafter, the remaining balance of the just compensation shall earn legal interest of 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until the finality of this resolution.
