SKI was held liable for the payment of additional costs incurred by reason of the delay in the performance of its obligation. However, it awarded SKI the cost of rebars, formworks, safety equipment and repairs it had made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In finding SKI liable, the Arbitral Tribunal reasoned out that: (1) the agreed commitments under various construction programs were not met;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (2) the notes from the project meetings and Wyeth's letters raising causes of delays were not disputed and some were even acknowledged by SKI;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and (3) while SKI's delays were justified, they failed to raise a timely objection to Wyeth's Variation Order indicating that the problems they encountered had no time impact to the project's completion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The Arbitral Tribunal further held that SKI is not entitled to an extension of time as its justifications were afterthoughts to escape its liability for the delays. Lastly, its failure to assert its entitlement to damages within the period allowed under the contract barred it from claiming them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal held that Wyeth, as project owner, had a wide latitude in exercising its prerogative to terminate the contract and that the termination was valid because SKI could further prejudice the completion of the project should it be given another chance to discharge its contractual obligations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal awarded SKI its valid claims, specifically: (1) the value of rebars considering that Wyeth had already agreed to SKI's entitlement to this; (2) the value of safety harness used by Wyeth; (3) the cost of repair of the damaged tower crane; and (4) the value of the damaged tower crane collar.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>However, the Arbitral Tribunal denied SKI's following claims: (1) the additional labor costs to catch up with the works as it was SKI who caused the delay;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (2) the additional costs due to change in the formworks system because it was SKI's contractual obligation to supply them;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (3) the cost for complying with additional safety requirements because SKI failed to observe the strict safety requirements stipulated in the contract;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and (4) the additional cost for a Load Moment Indicator (LMI) which aids in inspecting and certifying the worthiness of the crane.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal also denied for lack of merit the other claims of SKI considering that the termination of the contract was valid: <br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Additional overhead expenses from March 2008 to December 2008</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Loss of profit for undue termination</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Loss of profit for deleted items</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4)</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Standby cost of equipment, formworks, crane, Generator set and other materials; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(5)</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Moral and exemplary damages</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>On the other hand, the Arbitral Tribunal found the need to evaluate Wyeth's counterclaims, considering that it far exceed the value of the contract sum of the project in dispute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Particularly, it held that Wyeth's claim of payment to various contractors in the amount of P167,588,306.67 is questionable since the total contract sum is P214,944,802.30 and P108,326,018.64 was already paid to SKI, leaving only P106,618,783.70 or 49.60% of the total contract sum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal held that while Wyeth suffered pecuniary loss, the evidence it submitted were not clear and convincing as to establish actual damages. Hence, the Tribunal applied Article 2224 of the Civil Code<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and the parties' agreement on liquidated damages<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> as measure for temperate damages. It awarded Wyeth temperate damages amounting to P24,280,000.00, the maximum amount permitted under the contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal held that Wyeth failed to present clear and convincing evidence on the scope, details, costing and reasonableness of some of their claims, specifically: (1) costs incurred for labor and materials; (2) additional cost of labor; (3) payment to various contractors; (4) rectification works; (5) additional cost to retain the site establishment; and (6) payment to other contractors. However, it found Wyeth's claim of payment to various suppliers in the amount of P6,852,678.71 as valid and undisputed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal further held that the unrecouped down payment is deemed included in Wyeth's "global" or excess claim after lumping all the cost it allegedly incurred (including all payments to SKI as well as all other contractors/suppliers) less the contract price, and granted the unrecouped amount of P42,293,679.02 in addition to the Temperate Damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal ruled that the cost of arbitration should be equally shouldered by SKI and Wyeth, Mapfre should shoulder its own costs, and no party may recover attorney's fees from each other.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> It further held Mapfre jointly and severally liable with SKI, on its: (1) Advance Payment Bond, for the unrecouped down payment; (2) Payment Bond; and (3) Performance Bond equal to the Temperate Damages awarded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The Arbitral Tribunal held that the right to file claim on the Payment Bond is not "time-barred" and the referral to arbitration is based on the agreement between Wyeth and Mapfre, without objection from SKI.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Lastly, it held that Mapfre should be indemnified by SKI in case it is made to pay Wyeth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The Award's dispositive portion read:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, AWARD is hereby made as follows:<br><br><b>A. <u>FOR CLAIMANT<br></u></b>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="25%">1.

Finality of Awards. — The arbitral award shall be binding upon the parties. It shall be final and inappealable except on questions of law which shall be appealable to the Supreme Court.<br></blockquote>In keeping with the Construction Industry Arbitration Law, any appeal from the Commission's arbitral tribunals must remain limited to questions of law. Its rationale is explained in <i>Hi-Precision Steel Center, Inc. v. Lim Kim Steel Builders, Inc.</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup><br><blockquote>Section 19 [of Executive Order No. 1008] makes it crystal clear that questions of fact cannot be raised in proceedings before the Supreme Court — which is not a trier of facts — in respect of an arbitral award rendered under the aegis of the CIAC. Consideration of the animating purpose of voluntary arbitration in general, and arbitration under the aegis of the CIAC in particular, requires us to apply rigorously the above principle embodied in Section 19 that the Arbitral Tribunal's findings of fact shall be final and unappealable.<br><br>Voluntary arbitration involves the reference of a dispute to an impartial body, the members of which are chosen by the parties themselves, which parties freely consent in advance to abide by the arbitral award issued after proceedings where both parties had the opportunity to be heard. The basic objective is to provide a speedy and inexpensive method of settling disputes by allowing the parties to avoid the formalities, delay, expense and aggravation which commonly accompany ordinary litigation, especially litigation which goes through the entire hierarchy of courts. Executive Order No. 1008 created an arbitration facility to which the construction industry in the Philippines can have recourse. The Executive Order was enacted to encourage the early and expeditious settlement of disputes in the construction industry, a public policy the implementation of which is necessary and important for the realization of national development goals.<br><br>Aware of the objective of voluntary arbitration in the labor field, in the construction industry, and in any other area for that matter, the Court will not assist one or the other or even both parties in any effort to subvert or defeat that objective for their private purposes. The Court will not review the factual findings of an arbitral tribunal upon the artful allegation that such body had "misapprehended the facts" and will not pass upon issues which are, at bottom, issues of fact, no matter how cleverly disguised they might be as ''legal questions." The parties here had recourse to arbitration and chose the arbitrators themselves; they must have had confidence in such arbitrators. The Court will not, therefore, permit the parties to relitigate before it the issues of facts previously presented and argued before the Arbitral Tribunal, save only where a very clear showing is made that, in reaching its factual conclusions, the Arbitral Tribunal committed an error so egregious and hurtful to one party as to constitute a grave abuse of discretion resulting in lack or loss of jurisdiction. Prototypical examples would be factual conclusions of the Tribunal which resulted in deprivation of one or the other party of a fair opportunity to present its position before the Arbitral Tribunal, and an award obtained through fraud or the corruption of arbitrators. Any other, more relaxed, rule would result in setting at naught the basic objective of a voluntary arbitration and would reduce arbitration to a largely inutile institution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The general rule then is that the awards of the Arbitral Tribunal may be appealed only on pure questions of law, and its factual findings should be respected and upheld. Since the Construction Industry Arbitration Law does not provide when an arbitral award may be vacated, we can glean the exceptions from <i>Spouses David v. Construction Industry and Arbitration Commission</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup><br><blockquote>We reiterate the rule that factual findings of construction arbitrators are final and conclusive and not reviewable by this Court on appeal, except when the petitioner proves affirmatively that: (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or of any of them; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; (4) one or more of the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under Section nine of Republic Act No. 876 and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially prejudiced; or (5) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Accordingly, there is a need to determine whether the issues raised by petitioner involve questions of law or fact.

The CIAC Arbitral Tribunal perused each of the parties' voluminous pieces of evidence. Its members personally heard, observed, tested, and propounded questions to each of the witnesses. Having been constituted solely and precisely for the purpose of resolving the dispute between ACI and CECON for 19 months, the CIAC Arbitral Tribunal devoted itself to no other task than resolving that controversy. This Court has the benefit neither of the CIAC Arbitral Tribunal's technical competence nor of its irreplaceable experience of hearing the case, scrutinizing every piece of evidence, and probing the witnesses.<br><br>True, the inhibition that impels this Court admits of exceptions enabling it to embark on its own factual inquiry. Yet, none of these exceptions, which are all anchored on considerations of the CIAC Arbitral Tribunal's integrity and not merely on mistake, doubt, or conflict, is availing.<br><br>This Court finds no basis for casting aspersions on the integrity of the CIAC Arbitral Tribunal. There does not appear to have been an undisclosed disqualification for any of its three (3) members or proof of any prejudicial misdemeanor. There is nothing to sustain an allegation that the parties' voluntarily selected arbitrators were corrupt, fraudulent, manifestly partial, or otherwise abusive. From all indications, it appears that the CIAC Arbitral Tribunal extended every possible opportunity for each of the parties to not only plead their case but also to arrive at a mutually beneficial settlement. This Court has ruled, precisely, that the arbitrators acted in keeping with their lawful competencies.
