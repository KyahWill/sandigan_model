				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the Court is a petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking to reverse and set aside the July 28, 2016 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and April 20, 2017 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 05150, which reversed and set aside the September 26, 2013 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 35, Iloilo City (RTC). <p> On August 27, 1998, respondent Cristeta Abaldonado (Abaldonado) obtained a P700,000.00 loan from petitioner Samuel Ang (Ang). The loan was subject to a compounded interest rate of four percent per month, with another four percent compounded interest as penalty in case of delay in the payment of the obligation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The loan was secured by a Real Estate Mortgage<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (REM) over Lot 334-C registered in Abaldonado's name under Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-125491. </p><p> Unfortunately, Abaldonado failed to pay several installments of the loan. Thus, on July 18, 2001, she received a Demand Letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> from Ang requiring her to pay her total indebtedness amounting to P2,543,807.64, otherwise, he would be constrained to initiate foreclosure proceedings. Ang's demand fell on deaf ears and he was constrained to file a Petition for Extrajudicial Foreclosure of REM on August 16, 2002. </p><p> However, the intended foreclosure proceedings did not push through due to a case filed by Abaldonado's children against her and Ang. The said case sought to nullify the Extrajudicial Adjudication with Waiver of Rights allegedly executed by Abaldonado's children as well as the REM between Ang and Abaldonado. Abaldonado's children claimed that as a result of their mother's forgery of the waiver of interest, she made it appear that they were surrendering their right to the subject property they inherited from their deceased father in her favor. Nevertheless, the case filed by Abaldonado's children was eventually dismissed without prejudice for lack of interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> Subsequently, on December 1, 2005, Ang assigned his mortgage rights to petitioner Fontaine Bleau Finance and Realty Corporation (Fontaine Bleau), a domestic corporation of which Ang is the president. Another Petition for Extrajudicial Foreclosure was filed this time by Fontaine Bleau as the assignee of the REM. On March 28, 2006, a public bidding for the mortgaged property was conducted where Fontaine Bleau emerged as the winning bidder. On June 18, 2007 a Final Deed of Sale was executed in its favor and it was able to consolidate its title to the property - TCT No. T-161718 was issued in its name on October 2, 2007.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p> On June 18, 2010, Abaldonado filed a Complaint for Declaration of Nullity of Foreclosure Proceedings, Annulment of Interest Rate, Accounting and Damages against petitioners. She lamented that the interest rate under the REM was unconscionable and iniquitous. Abaldonado asserted that the debt should be deemed as without such interest stipulation, and the REM and the subsequent foreclosure proceeding should be declared void <i>ab initio</i>. </p><p> <i>RTC Decision</i> </p><p> In its September 26, 2013 Decision, the RTC dismissed Abaldonado's complaint. The trial court ruled that the stipulated interest and penalty in the REM must be equitably reduced for being excessive, iniquitous and unconscionable. It, however, explained that the nullity of the interest and its reduction do not affect the terms of the REM, and that the REM between Abaldonado and Fontaine Bleau and the foreclosure proceedings are left unaffected. </p><p> Nevertheless, the RTC found that Abaldonado was guilty of laches because she slept on her right when she failed to raise at the earliest opportunity the validity of the REM and of the stipulated interest. The trial court observed that Abaldonado questioned the loan and the REM only after twelve years from its execution, almost eleven years from the notice of demand, and almost six years from the initiation of the foreclosure proceedings. It opined that Abaldonado could have assailed the interest or filed an action to annul the REM from the moment she received the demand letter or when Fontaine Bleau had commenced the foreclosure proceedings. The RTC added that Abaldonado could have also questioned the loan and the REM in the case filed against her by her children. The trial court highlighted that while petitioners tried to amicably settle the matter, Abaldonado failed to take specific steps to challenge the exorbitant stipulated interest. The RTC disposed:</p><p> </p><blockquote> WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the complaint is hereby DISMISSED. For the failure of the defendants to support their counterclaim , the same is likewise ordered dismissed. <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p></blockquote> <p> Aggrieved, petitioners appealed to the CA. </p><p> <i>CA Decision</i> </p><p> In its July 28, 2016 Decision, the CA reversed and set aside the RTC decision. The appellate court agreed with Abaldonado that the four percent interest and penalty were iniquitous and unconscionable. It, however, clarified that in usurious loans, the entire obligation does not become void as the unpaid principal debt remains valid with only the stipulation on the interest rate void. The CA further explained that the foreclosure proceedings were null and void because the usurious interest and penalty imposed on the obligation prevented Abaldonado from settling her debt at the correct amount without the iniquitous interest. The appellate court expounded that as a consequence of the nullity of the foreclosure proceedings, the ensuing registration of the foreclosure sale cannot transfer any rights or vest title over the mortgaged property to Fontaine Bleau. It, however, stressed that this was without prejudice to Fontaine Bleau's right to recover the principal loan with the appropriate interest and to initiate all appropriate actions against Abaldonado in the event of her failure to pay the same. </p><p> Further, the CA disagreed that Abaldonado's complaint should be dismissed on account of laches. The appellate court elaborated that not all elements of laches were present highlighting that according to Ang's testimony itself, Abaldonado exerted many efforts to settle or redeem her property after the institution of the foreclosure proceedings. In addition, it pointed out that the element of injury was lacking considering that petitioners failed to prove any injury they would suffer if Abaldonado's action for nullification of foreclosure proceedings is not dismissed. Thus, it ruled: </p><p> </p><blockquote> WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 35, Iloilo City, in Civil Case No. 10-30556, dated September 26, 2013, is SET ASIDE.

They clarify that based on Ang's testimony, it was he who repeatedly offered to Abaldonado's children the chance to redeem the property and that Abaldonado had not participated in any attempt to amicably settle the loan obligation. Petitioners assail that Abaldonado had foreclosed her right to redeem the mortgaged property on account of her failure to tender the redemption price or to file the corresponding legal action to fix the redemption price. They insist that Abaldonado should have opposed the public auction or consigned the redemption price to establish her good faith in redeeming the property and then simultaneously file a case to fix the redemption price. On the other hand, petitioners lament that the CA erred in imposing an interest rate of six percent commencing on July 18, 2001 because the prevailing legal interest rate at the time the parties entered into the loan was twelve percent. They likewise assert that penalty charges, by way of liquidated damages, should be imposed on account of Abaldonado's neglect and delay in the payment of her loan obligations. </p><p> In her Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated July 31, 2018, Abaldonado countered that petitioners' petition for review on<i> certiorari </i>should be denied as it raises questions of fact. She averred that the findings of the CA are supported by evidence and that it correctly ruled that laches was inapplicable in the present controversy. Abaldonado also claimed that she has not foreclosed the right to redeem the mortgaged property as she was not given the opportunity to settle her debt at the correct amount in view of the usurious interest imposed. Finally, she posited that the CA correctly reduced the usurious interest to six percent per annum reckoned from July 18, 2001 until the satisfaction of the loan. </p><p> In their Reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated January 7, 2019, petitioners stated that the present petition falls under the exceptions to the rule that only questions of law may be raised in petitions for review on <i>certiorari.</i> They highlighted that findings of the CA that Abaldonado had exerted efforts to settle her claim was against the evidence on record. Petitioners reiterated that Abaldonado had foreclosed her right to redeem the property and that the CA erred in reckoning the six percent interest rate from July 18, 2001. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> The petition is meritorious. </p><p> As a general rule, only questions of law may be entertained in petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> In <i>Far Eastern Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the Court differentiated questions of law from questions of fact, to wit: </p><p> </p><blockquote> A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, its resolution must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants, but must rely solely on what the law provides on the given set of facts. <b>If the facts are disputed or if the issues require an examination of the evidence, the question posed is one of fact.</b> The test, therefore, is not the appellation given to a question by the party raising it, but whether the appellate court can resolve the issue without examining or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is a question of fact. (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote> <p> However, the said rule admits of several exceptions where questions of fact may be raised in the said petition. The Court takes cognizance of questions of fact in the following scenarios: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises, or conjectures; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Where there is a grave abuse of discretion; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(4)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(5)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">When the findings of fact are conflicting;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(6)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">When the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(7)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">The findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(8)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(9)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(10)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">The finding of fact of the Court of Appeals is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on record.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>The present petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> involves questions of fact since the determination of whether Abaldonado was guilty of laches requires the examination and evaluation of the evidence on record. Nevertheless, the said petition, though raising questions of fact, is cognizable by the Court as one of the recognized exceptions to the general rule is when the CA and trial courts have diverging findings of fact and when there is a misapprehension opined the contrary and saw that she had exerted diligent effort in protecting her rights. </p> <table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Unreasonable delay in asserting one's rights amounts to laches</i></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Laches is the failure or neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which, by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Essentially, it is present in cases of unreasonable neglect to protect one's rights giving rise to the presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned or declined to assert it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In <i>Heirs of Anacleto B.

However, contrary to the CA's assessment, the evidence on record does not negate the presence of laches. Rather, it actually supports the finding thereof. </p><p> The testimony of petitioners' witnesses shows that Abaldonado never participated in the negotiations concerning her loan obligation with petitioners, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> Direct testimony of Samuel Ang </p> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">Q:</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">You testified that you did not strictly follow the rate of interest stipulated in the terms and conditions in the Real Estate Mortgage? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A:</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, during our hearing in Branch 26, I offered 1.8 million to Cristeta Abaldonado as redemption and it was relayed by Atty.

It must be remembered that the law protects the vigilant and not those who slumber on their rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p> <p> Abaldonado's neglect or inactivity amounted to laches which precluded her from questioning the mortgage contract and the subsequent foreclosure proceedings. Abaldonado never questioned the rates imposed from the time the loan was contracted until after the foreclosure sale was finalized. It is worth emphasizing that petitioners had already filed a first extrajudicial foreclosure complaint but did not push through due to a case filed by Abaldonado's children against her and Ang. At this juncture, she could have readily challenged the mortgage contract and petitioners' attempt to foreclose the property. Yet, Abaldonado remained silent and did not impugn the validity of the mortgage contract on account of the interest rates imposed. </p><p> Again, petitioners filed another complaint for extrajudicial foreclosure against Abaldonado. Even then, she did not assail the validity of the mortgage contract obligation nor contest the foreclosure proceedings. Rather, Abaldonado waited until a Final Deed of Sale was issued before she sprung into action. In sum, she only questioned the mortgage contract after 12 years from the loan was contracted and three years after Fontaine Bleau obtained a Final Deed of Sale. </p><p> Further, Abaldonado's inaction led petitioners to believe that she would not challenge the interest rates they had fully agreed upon. It is too late in the day for her to seek refuge from the courts after the long time she slumbered on her rights. In <i>Spouses Carpo v. Chua</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the Court had likewise denied relief to the party for belatedly questioning the validity of the mortgage contract, to wit: </p><p> </p><blockquote> The RTC had likewise concluded that petitioners were barred by laches from assailing the validity of the real estate mortgage. We wholeheartedly agree. If indeed petitioners unwillingly gave their consent to the agreement, they should have rai sed this issue as earl y as in the foreclosure proceedings. It was only when the writ of possession was issued did petitioners challenge the stipulations in the loan contract in their action for annulment of mortgage. Evidently, petitioners slept on their rights. The Court of Appeals succinctly made the following observations: </blockquote> <p> </p><blockquote> <blockquote> In all these proceedings starting from the foreclosure, followed by the issuance of a provisional certificate of sale; then the definite certificate of sale; then the issuance of TCT No. 29338 in favor of the defendants and finally the petition for the issuance of the writ of possession in favor of the defendants, there is no showing that plaintiffs questioned the validity of these proceedings. It was only after the issuance of the writ of possession in favor of the defendants, that plaintiffs allegedly tendered to the defendants the amount of P260,000.00 which the defendants refused. In all these proceedings, why d id plaintiffs sleep on their rights? </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Just like the debtor-mortgagor in the above-mentioned case, Abaldonado sat idly by while petitioners instituted foreclosure proceedings over the mortgaged property. Also, just like in the said case, she assailed the mortgage contract only after the title over the property was transferred to the winning bidder during the public auction for the mortgaged property. </p><p> Further, the negotiations between petitioners and Abaldonado's children for an amicable settlement do not detract from the fact that Abaldonado had slept on her rights. The evidence presented by both parties established that Abaldonado never actually participated in the negotiation for a possible settlement. She did not communicate personally or through other means with petitioners as the latter were only able to talk to her children. In addition, there was no proof that Abaldonado had authorized her children to act in her behalf. Neither was there any showing that her children represented her interest in the attempt to arrive at a settlement. In fact, Abaldonado's children had even filed a case against her claiming that their signature in the Extrajudicial Adjudication with Waiver of Rights, where they purportedly waived their right to the subject property their inherited from their father in her favor, was a forgery. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
