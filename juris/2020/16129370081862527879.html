It further denied receipt of payment from NPC of the amount P301,350.50 and averred that the mere issuance by the latter of a disbursement voucher did not necessarily constitute payment of the total loan obligation unless tender of payment, in the form of cash or check, had been made by NPC to DBP.<br><br>On August 11, 1999, NPC filed its Answer<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> alleging that it already paid DBP the amount P301,350.50 as per Disbursement Voucher No. P4-2-0-85-11-3449 dated November 12, 1986 and Check No. 117684 issued in the name of DBP.<br><br>On May 19, 2000, the trial court ordered the joint trial of Misc.

Neither can DBP claim interest pursuant to the stipulation in the mortgage instrument stating that the vendee and vendor shall be jointly and severally liable for the said mortgage obligations including payment of interest because said provision applies only when the mortgagor conveys or encumbers the mortgaged properties without the written consent, of the mortgagee, which circumstance is not present in this case since DBP consented to the sale of the two mortgaged properties.<br><br>Also, DBP cannot claim interest by reason. of delayed payment because it failed to present evidence that it extrajudicially demanded for the payment of the principal amount and its corresponding interest prior to NPC's tender of payment of the amount of P301,350.50. Hence, petitioner DBP's appeal was denied.<br><br>The appeal of the heirs of Julieta was likewise denied by the CA for their failure to assail the ruling of the RTC regarding the validity and legality of the extrajudicial foreclosure of the parcel of land covered by TCT No. T-8127.<br><br>On January 18, 2011, petitioner DBP filed a Motion for Reconsideration but it was denied by the CA in its March 25, 2011 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Petition.<br><br><center><u><b>Issues</b></u><br></center><br>The issues presented for Our resolution are as follows:<br><blockquote>1. Is respondent NPC liable to pay the total amount of P902,674,79?; and<br><br>2. Is respondent NPC liable to pay interest and penalty charges?<br></blockquote><div align="center"><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></div><br>At the outset, we state that the issue regarding the validity of the foreclosure by DBP of the REM over TCT No. T-8127 has already been settled for failure of the heirs of Danico to file an appeal. It is settled that no affirmative relief can be granted to those parties who did not appeal.<br><br>DBP claims that there are two separate and distinct obligations, namely: (a) Contract Mortgage Receivable (CMR) agricultural account in the total amount of P393,353.97 as of December 31, 1985 as per Deed of Absolute Sale of Registered Land dated September 9, 1985; and (b) original loan account in the total amount of P509,320.82 as of April 30, 1985 arising from the Deed of Absolute Sale of a Portion of Registered Land dated September 9, 1985. The CMR agricultural account pertains to the repurchase of TCT No. T-19241 (originally TCT No. T-8127) by the Spouses Danico from petitioner DBP in the Deed of Conditional Sale dated October 10, 1985 while the original loan account pertains to the unforeclosed properties of the Spouses Danico by virtue of their original agricultural loan dated April 22, 1977. Thus, the total amount of obligation of the Spouses Danico to DBP is P902,674.79 excluding accrued interests and default charges.<br><br>DBP contends that as of December 31, 1985, the outstanding obligation of the Spouses Danico in their CMR agricultural account was P393,353.97, which amount ought to be paid in order for the mortgage to be cancelled and for TCT No. T-3278 to be released. However, respondent NPC belatedly paid only the amount of P92,003.47 as per Official Receipt No. 2205487 on November 17, 1986 instead of December 31, 1985 as per the Deed of Sale. The remaining amount of P301,350.50 was tendered and consigned with the RTC Clerk of Court as reflected in the lower court's Order dated June 28, 2001. DBP argues that the failure of the Spouses Danico and respondent NPC to comply with their obligation to pay the total amount of P393,353.97 on or before December 31, 1985 entitles DBP to claim interest and penalty charges.<br><br>Furthermore, DBP argues that the outstanding balance on the original loan obligation on the unforeclosed properties of the Spouses Danico was P509,520.82 as of April 30, 1985, which amount has not yet been paid. In the Deed of Sale dated September 9, 1985, the sale consideration for a portion of Lot No. 857 covered by TCT No. T-3278 was P242,644.50. The parties admitted that Lot No. 857 was mortgaged with DBP in the total amount of P509,320.82, which amount ought be paid first for the mortgage to be cancelled and the title to be released.<br><br>Based on the foregoing, DBP claims that the Spouses Danico had two separate and distinct loan obligations as shown in the two Statements of Accounts dated December 31, 1985 and April 30, 1985. Hence, DBP claims that the judgment award in the amount of P301,350.50 is insufficient to fully settle the total obligation in the amount of P902,674.79.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>DBP maintains that its right to collect interests, penalty and other bank charges is anchored on the contract of agricultural loan and promissory note executed by the Spouses Danico on April 22, 1977. It claims that its conformity to the two Deeds of Sale did not in any way amend, modify nor divest it of its right to demand and collect interests and penalty charges when the NPC defaulted on its obligations as per the two Deeds of Sale.<br><br>Moreover, DBP argues that the Spouses Danico and the NPC were both aware of the stipulation in the Deed of Mortgage that:<br><blockquote>The Mortgagor shall not sell, dispose of, mortgage, nor in any manner encumber the mortgage property without the written consent of the Mortgagee. If in spite of this stipulation the property is sold, the Vendee shall assume the mortgage in the terms and conditions under which it is constituted it being understood that the assumption by the Vendee shall not release the Vendor of his obligation to the Mortgagee; on the contrary, both Vendor and Vendee shall be jointly and severally liable for said mortgage obligation. In case a second mortgage of other involuntary encumbrance is constituted, the second Mortgagee or junior encumbrances shall recognize the existing mortgage in favor of the Mortgagee as first lien and shall further agree, promise and bind himself to recognize and consider the extension of any term of said mortgage by the Mortgagee in favor of the Mortgagor or a new mortgage covering the same property to be executed by said Mortgagor in favor of the Mortgages as first and superior encumbrance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>DBP further argues that since NPC and the Spouses Danico failed to comply with the two Deeds of Sale by delivering the proceeds of the sale and applying the same on their loan accounts, DBP's consent to the Deeds of Sale is deemed not to have been given which renders the above-quoted provision instantly applicable to the present case. As a result, both NPC as vendee, and the Spouses Danico as vendors, shall be jointly and severally liable for the mortgage obligation including interests and penalty charges for default payment.<br><br>On the other hand, NPC contends that the Deed of Sale involving the land covered by OCT No. P-1439 provides no stipulation as to the payment of interest which renders DBP's claim for interest without legal basis Moreover, NPC argues that DBP cannot invoke the applicability of the Deed of Mortgage to collect interest because the two deeds of sale between NPC and the Spouses Danico were executed with the express conformity of DBP as stipulated therein. Thus, petitioner DBP cannot now impugn the deeds of sale which it willingly consented to.<br><br>Moreover, NPC claims that from the moment petitioner DBP gave its consent, the latter is bound to fulfill what was expressly stipulated and its consequences.

The deed of sale further stipulates that after paying the tenants, real property tax and capital gains tax, the remaining amount from the proceeds of the sale, that is, P511,290.00, shall be remitted to DBP in payment for the Spouses Danico's obligation as per the Statement of Account as of December 31, 1985. The first deed of sale also mentioned that the balance of the proceeds of the sale of Lot No. 861 which is covered by OCT No. P-1439 shall be applied to the remaining balance of Daniel Danico's loan secured by his other parcel of land, that is, a portion of Lot No. 857 covered by TCT No. T-3278, which is likewise purchased and acquired by respondent NPC.

It further provides that the balance of the proceeds in the first deed of sale shall be applied to this mortgage loan as per Statement of Account as of April 30, 1985, that is, P509,320.82. Any remaining unpaid amount shall be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of a portion of Lot No. 857, that is, P242,644.50.

Contrary to the ruling of the CA, the two deeds of sale are clear and unambiguous as to the existence of the two statements of account. In fact, both the Spouses Danico and the NPC adhered and agreed to the terms, conditions and stipulations embodied in the two deeds of sale knowing fully well the existence of the two statements of account.<br><br>Article 1370 of the Civil Code provides that if the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulation shall control.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> If, indeed, the stipulations in the said two deeds of sale did not express the true intention of the parties, both the Spouses Danico and the NPC could have filed the corresponding action for reformation of the contract. But they did not do so. Besides, both deeds of sale had been executed on the same day, that is, on September 9, 1985. Thus, the parties knew at the time of their execution the existence of the two Statements of Account as stipulated in the contracts. They cannot now impugn the existence of Statement of Account as of April 30, 1985 when the words of both contracts are clear and readily understandable. The contract is the law between the parties. Thus, it should be interpreted according to their literal meaning and should not be interpreted beyond their obvious intendment.<br><br>This is notwithstanding the fact that DBP only referred to the Statement of Account as of December 31, 1985 in its Certification dated February 24, 1987 which states that it would only release the original copy of OCT No. P-1439 upon payment of the sale proceeds of the said property in the amount of P301,350.50. Even though the said Certification did not mention the Statement of Account as of April 30, 1985, it cannot be assumed from the said omission that the obligation of the Spouses Danico and the NPC pertained only to the Statement of Account as of December 31, 1985. It bears stressing that DBP simply mentioned the Statement of Account as of December 31, 1985 as it pertained to the release of OCT No. P-1439 which is the subject of the first deed of sale. As to the second deed of sale covered by TCT No. T-3278, the title is still with petitioner DBP as per Letter dated December 4, 1997 sent by petitioner DBP to respondent NPC.<br><br>Also, it is worth noting that in the Disbursement Voucher No. P4-2-0-85-11-3449 dated November 12, 1986, the proceeds of the sale of Lot No. 861 covered by OCT No. P-1439 (first deed of sale) were distributed in the following manner:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%">Sale Consideration of Lot No. 861</td><td width="10%"> <div align="right">P 511,290.00</div></td><td width="65%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>(OCT No. P-1439)</td><td><div align="right"></div><br></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Less:</td><td><div align="right"></div><br></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="justify">a) Daniel Danico (Capital Gain Tax, Documentary Stamp Tax and Certification Fee)</div></td><td><div align="right">P 96,319.50</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>b) Various Heirs of V.

This amount of P301,350.50 had already been consigned by respondent NPC with the RTC Clerk of Court, Branch 9, Malaybalay City per the June 28, 2001 Order of the RTC.<br><br>However, the records are bereft of any evidence as to what happened to the second deed of sale. The only fact proven is that out of the proceeds of the second deed of sale in the total amount of P242,644.50, P92,003.47 had been paid and applied to the Spouses Danico's obligation in the total amount of P393,353.97 as per Statement of Account as of December 31, 1985. The records is silent as to the whereabouts of the remaining amount of P150,641.03. In fact, NPC persistently insisted that their only obligation to DBP is the amount of P393,353.97 as shown in the Statement of Account as of December 31, 1985. No other evidence was submitted to prove that respondent NPC paid the remaining consideration of the second deed of sale in the total amount of P150,641.03 to either petitioner DBP or the Spouses Danico.<br><br>Nonetheless, NPC cannot be held liable for the total amount of P509,320.82 as per Statement of Account as of April 30, 1985. Its obligation is only up the extent of the selling price of the two lots. The two deeds of sale are clear that NPC's obligation pertains only to the purchase of Lot No. 861 covered by OCT No. P-1439 and Lot No. 857-B covered by TCT No. T-3278, to wit:<br><blockquote><i>First Deed of Sale</i><br><br>I, DANIEL DANICO, x x x married to JULIETA LUBOS DANICO, x x x <u><b>for and in consideration of the sum of FIVE HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY PESOS ONLY (P511,290.00),</b></u> Philippine Currency, x x x do hereby SELL, TRANSFER AND CONVEY unto the said NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION, x x x that certain parcel of land belonging to me x x x with <u><b>TCT No. P-1439</b></u> (sic) x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]<br><br><i>Second Deed of Sale</i><br><br>I, DANIEL DANICO, x x x married to JULIETA LUBOS DANICO, x x x <u><b>for and in consideration of the sum of TWO HUNDRED FOURTY TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FOURTY FOUR PESOS &amp; 50/100 ONLY (P<u>242,644.50</u>)</b></u>, x x x do hereby SELL, TRANSFER AND CONVEY unto the said NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION, x x x that certain parcel of land x x x with <u><b>TCT No. T-3278</b></u> x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>Under the deeds of sale, the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to the outstanding loan obligation of the Spouses Danico. However, NPC cannot be held liable in case the proceeds of the sale of the subject properties are insufficient to satisfy the total loan obligation of Spouses Danico.<br><br>The two deeds of sale very clearly indicate that NPC did not expressly assume the obligations of the Spouses Danico under the agricultural loan dated April 22, 1977 and the Deed of Conditional Sale dated October 10, 1985. It merely intended to purchase and acquire the two subject lots of the Spouses Danico which happened to be mortgaged with the DBP. In fact, DBP signified its approval and conformity to the said deeds of sale, to wit:<br><blockquote><i>First Deed of Sale</i><br><br>That the herein <u><b>DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES</b></u>, x x x <u><b>shall signify its conformity in this Deed of Absolute Sale of Registered Land</b></u> and hereby consents to the annotation of this instrument in the said TCT No. P-1439, and shall also conform and consent to the issuance of a new TCT in the name of the NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION upon full payment of the purchase price;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]<br><br><i>Second Deed of Sale</i><br><br>That the herein <u><b>DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES</b></u>, x x x <u><b>shall signify its conformity in this Deed of Absolute Sale of a Portion of Registered Land</b></u> and hereby consent to the annotation of this instrument in the said TCT No. T-3278; upon full payment of the purchase price;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>Nowhere is it stated in the said deeds of sale that respondent NPC assumed the total obligation of the Spouses Danico. Hence, based on the foregoing, respondent NPC is liable to pay DBP only the following amounts: (a) P301,350.50 out of the proceeds of the first deed of sale in the fulfillment of the obligation of the Spouses Danico in the total amount of P393,353.97 as per Statement of Account as of December 31, 1985; and (b) P150,641.03 out of the proceeds of the second deed of sale in the fulfillment of the Spouses Danico's obligation in the total amount of P509,320.82 as per Statement of Account as of April 30, 1985.<br><br><b><i>Is NPC liable to pay Interest?</i></b><br><br>As to respondent NPC's liability to pay interest, Article 1956 of the Civil Code states that no interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing. As can be gleaned from the foregoing provision, payment of monetary interest is allowed only if: (1) there was an express stipulation for the payment of interest; and (2) the agreement for the payment of interest was reduced in writing. The concurrence of the two conditions is required for the payment of monetary interest. Thus, We have held that collection of interest without any stipulation therefor in writing is prohibited by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, it is clearly apparent that the two deeds of sale do not contain any stipulation as to the payment of monetary interest. Contrary to the contention of petitioner DBP, the stipulation as to interest in the original agricultural loan dated April 22, 1977 and the Deed of Conditional Sale dated October 10, 1985 are not applicable to NPC as the latter is not privy to the said contracts. DBP also approved and agreed with the terms and conditions of the two deeds of sale which make the below-quoted provisions of the mortgage instrument inapplicable as NPC's purchase of the two mortgaged properties were made with petitioner DBP's written consent, to wit:<br><blockquote><u><b>The Mortgagor shall not sell, dispose of, mortgage, nor in any manner encumber the mortgage property without the written consent of the Mortgagee. If in spite of this stipulation the property is sold, the Vendee shall assume the mortgage in the terms and conditions under which it is constituted it being understood that the assumption by the Vendee shall not release the Vendor of his obligation to the Mortgagee; on the contrary, both Vendor and Vendee shall be jointly and severally liable for said mortgage obligation.</b></u> In case a second mortgage of other involuntary encumbrance is constituted, the second Mortgagee or junior encumbrances shall recognize the existing mortgage in favor of the Mortgagee as first lien and shall further agree, promise and bind himself to recognize and consider the extension of any term of said mortgage by the Mortgagee in favor of the Mortgagor or a new mortgage covering the same property to be executed by said Mortgagor in favor of the Mortgagee as first and superior encumbrance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>Moreover, the two deeds of sale contain no provision that NPC expressly assumed the loan obligation of the Spouses Danico. As correctly ruled by the CA:<br><blockquote>Also, We agree with the OSG that DBP could neither claim interest from NPC by reason of the provision/stipulation in the mortgage instrument between the spouses Danico and DBP that the vendee and vendor shall be jointly and severally liable for the said mortgage obligations including payment of interest because said provision applies only when the mortgagor conveys or encumbers the mortgaged properties without the written consent of the mortgagee, which circumstance is not obtaining in the instant case since DBP signified its consent to the sale of the two mortgaged properties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>As to DBP's claim for interest by reason of NPC's delay in the payment of the purchase price of the two deeds of sale, We hold that the interest accrues only from the time judicial or extrajudicial demand is made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> However, a thorough review of the records would reveal that petitioner DBP failed to make any extrajudicial demand for the payment of the purchase of price of the two deeds of sale. Again, as correctly observed by the appellate court:<br><blockquote>Moreover, DBP can neither claim interest by reason of delayed payment, since it failed to present evidence that it made any extrajudicial demand upon NPC for the payment of the principal amount and interest prior to the tender of payment of the balance of P301,350.50 by NPC. <u><b>Verily, the DBP Certifications dated 24 February 1987 and 22 June 1999 cannot, in any way, be construed as demand letters as said certifications did not demand that NPC should pay the remaining balance but merely acknowledged that it has not yet received the balance of P310,350.50 (sic). Also, DBP's letters to NPC's Regional Manager dated 4 December 1997 and 25 March 1999 did not demand for payment, rather, said letters merely asked for "clarification" on the transactions regarding the sale of the parcels of land covered by OCT No. P-1439 and TCT No. T-3278.</b></u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>Although petitioner DBP judicially demanded payment through its Answer with Counterclaim and Crossclaim, the consequent tender of payment and consignation on June 28, 2001 by NPC in the total amount of P301,350.50 suspends the accrual of interest as to the payment of the purchase price of the first deed of sale. Nonetheless, NPC is liable to pay compensatory interest of twelve percent (12%) per <i>annum</i> from the time of its judicial demand, <i>i.e.</i> the filing of its Answer with Counterclaim and Crossclaim on July 13, 1999 until the date of its consignment of P301,350.50 on June 28, 2001.<br><br>However, as to the remaining amount of P150,641.03 which is a part of the purchase price of the second deed of sale, the same shall earn 12% legal interest per <i>annum</i> to be computed from the time of DBP's judicial demand on July 13, 1999 until June 30, 2013 and six percent (6%) legal interest per <i>annum</i> from July 1, 2013 until the judgment becomes final as per the guidelines laid down in the case of <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v.
