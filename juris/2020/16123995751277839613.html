After termination of the pre-trial, trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>Around 8:00 p.m. on April 19, 2008, accused-appellant's twelve (12)-year-old son AAA was at home with his mother DDD and his four (4) siblings. AAA and his sister EEE were playing a game of "<i>dama</i>" when the heavily drunk accused-appellant arrived from a wedding celebration. He hurled words at EEE, such as "<i>Putang-ina mo, putang-ina n'yo isama n'yo na ang inyong ina sa Maynila at gawin n'yo ng pagerper.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> To avoid scolding, EEE and AAA ignored their father's rants. However, accused-appellant approached AAA, berated him, and boxed him which caused his mouth to bleed and loosened his teeth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> DDD, who was doing laundry at that time, heard the commotion and rushed to the scene to pacify accused-appellant. EEE then instructed AAA to go to their other brother and report the incident to the police.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Prior to the incident, or around lunchtime in May 2003, accused-appellant asked his then ten (10)-year-old daughter BBB to accompany him to get firewood near the irrigation canal. On their way home, he ordered BBB to lie down on the banana leaf. Terrified, BBB obeyed him. He then took off his pants and removed BBB's lower garments. He went on top of her, told her to remain silent, and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. Afterwards, he instructed her to dress, and warned her not to tell anybody about the incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In the evening of March 18, 2008, fourteen (14)-year-old CCC was sleeping with her three (3)-year-old nephew when her drunk father entered the room. He lay beside her and touched her vagina. Overcame with fear, she was unable to shout for help from her brothers who were sleeping in another room. The following night, March 19, 2008, she asked her brother FFF to sleep with her and their nephew. However, accused-appellant was undeterred and repeated his reprehensible acts, and was even smiling. FFF witnessed the incident but was also helpless. The following morning, or on March 20,2008, CCC went to the house of a barangay councilor to report her father. Unfortunately, the said councilor failed to help her. She also called her mother DDD, urging her to return home, but the latter was unable to return since her brother was still under treatment at a mental hospital. That night, accused-appellant lay beside her and fondled her breasts and vagina. He also embraced her and placed his legs between her legs. He only left when she started to cry.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, accused-appellant admitted that he and DDD have fourteen (14) children, including AAA, BBB, CCC, EEE and FFF. However, he fervently denied the accusations of his children. Unlike the portrayal of the prosecution, he was close to AAA, and took care of BBB and CCC when they were studying. It was only when CCC returned after five (5) years in Manila with her sister that she started the allegations against him. He claimed that it was EEE who filed the cases against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On October 29, 2013, the RTC found accused-appellant guilty on all the charges against him, the <i>fallo</i> of the Joint Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><ol> <li>In Criminal Case No. CR-08-9135, this Court finds the accused [ZZZ] <u><b><i>GUILTY</i></b></u> beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime charged against him in the aforequoted Information and in default of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, hereby sentences him to suffer an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment ranging from <b><i>SIX (6) MONTHS AND ONE (1) DAY OF PRISION CORRECCIONAL AS MINIMUM TO SIX(6) YEARS AND ONE (1) DAY OF PRISION MAYOR AS MAXIMUM</i> and to pay the FINE of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS ([P]100,000.00);</b><br><br></li><li>In Criminal Case No. CR-08-9136, this Court finds the accused [ZZZ] <u><b><i>GUILTY</i></b></u> beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime charged against him in the aforequoted Information and in default of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, hereby sentences him to suffer the straight penalty of imprisonment for <b><i>THREE (3) MONTHS OF ARRESTO MAYOR IN ITS MEDIUM PERIOD</i> and to pay the FINE of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS ([P]100,000.00)[;]</b><br><br></li><li>In Criminal Case No. C[R]-08-9180, this Court finds the accused [ZZZ] <u><b><i>GUILTY</i></b></u> beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime charged against him in the aforequoted Information and appreciating his relationship with the private complainant as an aggravating circumstance and in default of any mitigating circumstances, hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <b><u><i>RECLUSION PERPETUA</i></u>, WITHOUT ELIGIBILITY FOR PAROLE</b>, and to <b>PAY</b> the private complainant the amount of [P]20,000.00 as civil indemnity, [P]15,000.00 as moral damages, [P]15,000.00 as exemplary damages, [P]15,000.00 as fine, and to pay the costs;<br><br></li><li>In Criminal Case No. C[R]-08-9183, this Court finds the accused [ZZZ] <u><b><i>GUILTY</i></b></u> beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime charged against him in the aforequoted Information and appreciating his relationship with the private complainant as an aggravating circumstance and in default of any mitigating circumstances, hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <b><u><i>RECLUSION PERPETUA</i></u>, WITHOUT ELIGIBILITY FOR PAROLE</b>, and to <b>PAY</b> the private complainant the amount of [P]20,000.00 as civil indemnity, [P]15,000.00 as moral damages, [P]15,000.00 as exemplary damages, [P]15,000.00 as fine, and to pay the costs;<br><br></li><li>In Criminal Case No. C[R]-08-9184, this Court finds the accused [ZZZ] <u><b><i>GUILTY</i></b></u> beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime charged against him in the aforequoted Information and appreciating his relationship with the private complainant as an aggravating circumstance and in default of any mitigating circumstances, hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <b><u><i>RECLUSION PERPETUA</i></u>.

CR-08-9135 and CR-08-9136 that AAA positively identified accused-appellant as the one who berated and boxed him on the face. His mother and his sister corroborated the same. The incident caused physical injury, as well as mental or emotional anguish, public ridicule or humiliation, on AAA's person.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In Criminal Case No. CR-08-9180, BBB's categorical identification of the perpetrator and straightforward narration established that accused-appellant, through force, threat or intimidation, had carnal knowledge of his minor daughter. It is unthinkable for a daughter to accuse her own father, submit herself for examination of her most intimate parts, put her life to public scrutiny and expose herself, along with her family, to shame, pity or ridicule not just for a simple offense but for a crime so serious that could mean the death sentence to the very person to whom she owes her life, had she really not been aggrieved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It did not fault BBB for her failure to recall the exact date of the commission of the crime since the precise time is not an essential element of the crime. The relationship and the victim's minority were considered in the imposition of the penalty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> As to Criminal Case Nos. CR-08-9183, CR-08-9184 and CR-08-9185, the prosecution proved all the elements of the offense. <i>First</i>, the touching of the breasts and vagina, and embracing while placing his legs between CCC's legs to sexually arouse himself are lascivious conducts which accused-appellant committed against his daughter. <i>Second</i>, he coerced his daughter to engage in the lascivious conduct. <i>Third</i>, the Certificate of Live Birth clearly established that CCC was only fourteen (14) years old<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> at the time of the offense. There was no proof that she was motivated to fabricate a story of sexual abuse against her own father. The RTC considered their relationship in imposing the maximum penalty provided. For his part, accused-appellant only offered denial without presenting any other evidence.<br><br>On appeal, the CA affirmed with modification the Joint Decision of the RTC. The decretal portion of the Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Joint Decision of the RTC in Criminal [Case Nos.] CR-08-9135, CR-08-9136, CR-08-9180, CR-08-9183, CR-08-9184 and CR-08-9185 are hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b>. Consistent with <i>People v. J[u]gueta</i>, where the penalty imposed is <i><i>reclusion perpetua</i></i>, civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages should be [P]75,000.00 for each item and all monetary awards shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this judgment.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphases in the original; citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The CA agreed with the RTC that BBB's narration of her ordeal in the hands of accused-appellant was straightforward and unequivocal. All the elements of rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code (<i>RPC</i>) were established. Actual force or intimidation need not be employed in incestuous rape of a minor, as in this case, because the moral and physical dominion of the father is sufficient to cow the victim to submit to his nefarious desires.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The CA also agreed with the RTC that all the elements of sexual abuse were present. On three occasions, accused-appellant touched CCC's breasts and vagina. As her father, he exercised moral ascendancy over CCC to engage in his lewdness. CCC's testimony and her Birth Certificate established that she was below eighteen (18) years old at that time. The prosecution also proved, through the clear and convincing testimonies of AAA, his mother and his sister, that AAA suffered since childhood repeated verbal and physical abuse from accused-appellant, and that he dreaded being near his father. AAA suffered injury in the April 19, 2008 incident, as supported by their testimonies and a medical certificate.<br><br>The Court gave due course to accused-appellant's appeal from the November 28, 2016 Decision of the CA. It required the parties to submit their respective supplemental briefs, if they so desired. In its Manifestation and Motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated November 6, 2017, the Office of the Solicitor General informed the Court that it adopts its Brief for the Plaintiff-Appellee dated April 6, 2015 for purpose of the appeal. Similarly, accused-appellant indicated that he adopts his Brief<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated November 28, 2014 for the same adequately discussed all matters pertinent to his defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant claims that the absence of physical proof that he actually mauled AAA casts serious doubt to the prosecution's version of events. He insists that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses should not be considered due to their ill will against him. The Court should consider that BBB did not deny that she never repelled his supposed nefarious advances. The trial court relied heavily on the weakness of his defense and not on the strength of the prosecution's evidence.<br><br>The appeal is devoid of merit.<br><br>It is settled that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review, and it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment, whether they are assigned or unassigned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Guided by the foregoing, the Court deems it proper to modify accused-appellant's conviction of Rape, three (3) counts of Acts of Lasciviousness, in relation to R.A. No. 7610, to Qualified Rape, and three (3) counts of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610, as will be explained hereunder.<br><br>Article 266-A (1) (a), in relation to Article 266-B (1), of the RPC provides:<br><blockquote>Article 266-A. <i>Rape: When And How Committed</i>. — Rape is Committed:<br><br>1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>a) Through force, threat, or intimidation;<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>Article 266-B. <i>Penalty</i>. — Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by <i><i>reclusion perpetua</i></i>.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:<br><br>1) When the <b>victim is under eighteen (18) years of age</b> and the <b>offender is a parent</b> ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim[.] (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The elements of qualified rape are: (1) sexual congress; (2) with a woman; (3) done by force and without consent; (4) the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age at the time of the rape; and (5) the offender is a parent (whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> or is an ascendant, step­parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or is the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.

Settled is the rule that the trial court's evaluation and conclusion on the credibility of witnesses in rape cases are generally accorded great weight and respect, and at times even finality, and that its findings are binding and conclusive on the appellate court, unless there is a clear showing that they were reached arbitrarily or it appears from the records that certain facts or circumstances of weight, substance or value were overlooked, misapprehended or misappreciated by the lower court and which, if properly considered, would alter the result of the case. Having seen and heard the witnesses themselves and observed their behavior and manner of testifying, the trial courts stand in a much better position to decide the question of credibility. Indeed, trial court judges are in the best position to assess whether the witness is telling a truth or a lie as they have the direct and singular opportunity to observe the facial expression, gesture and tone of voice of the witness while testifying.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The Court disagrees with accused-appellant's claim that the testimonies of the witnesses should be discarded because of harbored ill feelings. Family resentment, revenge or feuds have never swayed us from giving full credence to the testimony of a complainant for rape, especially a minor who remained steadfast and unyielding throughout the direct and cross-examination that she was sexually abused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> No daughter, especially a minor like BBB in this case, would impute a serious crime of rape against her own biological father, unless she was impelled by a desire to vindicate her honor, aware as she is that her action or decision must necessarily subject herself and her family to the burden of trial and public humiliation, if the same were untrue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> An incestuous sexual assault is a psycho-social deviance that inflicts a stigma, not only on the victim but also on the whole family.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>We note that based on her testimony and her birth certificate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> presented, BBB was only ten (10) years old when the rape was committed against her in May 2003, since she was born on <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span>. However, it appears that the allegation in the Information and the decision of the trial court mentioned that she was sixteen (16) years old at that time. Accused-appellant cannot be convicted of statutory rape since BBB's correct age was not properly alleged in the Information. Otherwise, he would be deprived of his right to be informed of the charge lodged against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Nevertheless, the prosecution still established beyond doubt that she was under eighteen (18) years old at the commission of the crime. From the foregoing, as well as the fact that BBB's minority and her relationship with accused-appellant were not only alleged in the Information but also proven during the trial, this Court finds it proper to upgrade his conviction in Criminal Case No. CR-08-9180 to Qualified Rape.<br><br>Anent the penalty imposed, the RTC is correct in imposing the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole. The penalty for qualified rape, if at all, the qualification of "without eligibility for parole," may be applied to qualify <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in order to <i>emphasize</i> that accused-appellant should have been sentenced to suffer the death penalty had it not been for R.A. No. 9346.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In view of prevailing jurisprudence, the civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages awarded to BBB should be increased to P100,000.00 each, with legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until full payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Similarly, in Criminal Case Nos.

Caoili</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> is instructive on the proper designation of the offense in case lascivious conduct is committed, thus:<br><blockquote>Accordingly, for the guidance of public prosecutors and the courts, the Court takes this opportunity to prescribe the following guidelines in designating or charging the proper offense in case lascivious conduct is committed under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, and in determining the imposable penalty:<br><br>1. The age of die victim is taken into consideration in designating or charging the offense, and in determining the imposable penalty.<br><br>2. If the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the nomenclature of the crime should be "Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610." Pursuant to the second <i>proviso</i> in Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, the imposable penalty is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period.<br><br>3. If the <b>victim is exactly twelve (12) years of age, or more than twelve (12) but below eighteen (18) years of age</b>, or is eighteen (18) years old or older but is unable to fully take care of herself/himself or protect herself/himself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition, the crime should be designated as "<b>Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610</b>," and the imposable penalty is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>The evidence confirms that CCC was fourteen (14) years old at the commission of the offense. The acts of touching and fondling of CCC's breasts and touching of her vagina undeniably amounted to "lascivious conducts." Thus, there is a need to modify the nomenclature of the crime charged to "Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610."<br><br>Since the perpetrator is CCC's father, and such alternative circumstance of relationship was alleged in the Information, and proven and even admitted by accused-appellant during trial, the same should be considered as an aggravating circumstance for the purpose of increasing the period of the imposable penalty. There being no mitigating circumstance to offset the said alternative aggravating circumstance, the penalty provided shall be imposed in its maximum period, <i>i.e., reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> This is in consonance with Section 31 (c) of R.A. No. 7610 which expressly provides that the penalty shall be imposed in its maximum period when the perpetrator is, <i>inter alia</i>, the parent of the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>There is no need to qualify the sentence of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> with the phrase "without eligibility for parole," as held by the RTC and affirmed by the CA. This is pursuant to A.M. No. 15-08-02-SC<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> in cases where the death penalty is not warranted, such as in the instant case, it being understood that convicted persons penalized with an indivisible penalty are not eligible for parole. Thus, accused-appellant is sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count of Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of R. A. No. 7610. The award of civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages when the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is imposed is P75,000.00 each.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Therefore, the amount of damages awarded in Criminal Case Nos. CR-08-9183 and CR-08-9184 should be increased to P75,000.00 each, and the exemplary damages in Criminal Case No. CR-08-9185 to P75,000.00. Accused-appellant is ordered to pay a fine in the amount of P15,000.00, pursuant to Section 31 (f), Article XII of R.A. No. 7610. Also, the amount of damages awarded shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) <i>per annum</i> from the finality of this Decision until said amounts are fully paid.<br><br>Lastly, this Court, likewise, sustains the ruling in Criminal Case Nos. CR-08-9135 and CR-08-9136 finding accused-appellant guilty of violations of Section 5 (a) and (i) of R.A. No. 9262. The trial court observed that the berating and mauling incident not only caused physical injury to AAA but also mental anguish and humiliation. By his own account, he was distressed and hurt by accused-appellant's acts, which started when he was young. Contrary to accused-appellant's claim, the prosecution presented AAA's medical certificate showing that he suffered hematoma on his right upper lip. This corroborated with the testimonies of the witnesses that AAA sustained physical injury from the incident. It has long been established that this Court is not a trier of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> As discussed, factual findings of the RTC are conclusive and binding on this Court when affirmed by the CA.<br><br>As to the appropriate penalties, Section 6 of R.A.

(Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>The Court affirms the penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. CR-08-9136. However, the Court deems it proper to modify the penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. CR-08-9135. As aforementioned, R.A. No. 9262 imposes the penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> for violation of Section 5 (i) thereof. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term of the indeterminate penalty shall be taken from the penalty next lower in degree, <i>i.e., prision correccional</i>, or anywhere from six (6) months and one (1) day to six (6) years. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances attending the commission of the crime, the maximum term shall be the medium period of the penalty provided by the law, which is eight (8) years and one (1) day to ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Therefore, accused-appellant should suffer the indeterminate penalty of six (6) months and one (1) day of <i>prision correccional</i>, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i>, as maximum.<br><br>This Court also notes that both the RTC and the CA failed to require accused-appellant to undergo psychological counseling or treatment.

The element of the victim being EPSOSA - <i>a separate and distinct element</i> - must first be both alleged and proved before a conviction under Section 5(b), RA 7610 may be reached.<br><br>Specifically, in order to impose the higher penalty provided in Section 5(b) as compared to Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353, it must be <b>alleged</b> and <b>proved</b> that the child - (1) for money, profit, or any other consideration or (2) due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group - indulges in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Informations only alleged that the victim was his 14-year-old daughter, but it did not allege that she was EPSOSA.
