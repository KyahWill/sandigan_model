Survivors of such cruelty must not be blamed for any action, or lack thereof, that they take when suddenly forced to respond to a threat. Rapist are rapists, and their acts must never be attributed to the victims.<br><br>For this Court's resolution is an appeal of the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Regional Trial Court's Joint Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> convicting Leo Ibañez y Morales (Ibañez) of four counts of qualified rape.<br><br>In four separate pieces of Information, Ibañez was charged with four counts of qualified rape committed on AAA, penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code. The first Information reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 25<sup>th</sup> day of April, 2003, in the Municipality of <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxx</span>, Negros Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with the use of a knife, a deadly weapon, through force, threat and intimidation, taking advantage of his moral ascendancy and with the attendant special qualifying circumstance of relationship and minority, the accused being the uncle, thus, a relative by affinity within the third civil degree of herein victim who was under eighteen (18) years of age, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of one [AAA], a minor, 17 years old, against her will, in her own dwelling, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The other pieces of Information were similarly worded except for the varying dates for each of the crimes charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>When arraigned, Ibañez pleaded not guilty to the crimes charged. Thus, trial ensued. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The prosecution, through witnesses AAA, Dr. Jocelyn Gayares (Dr. Gayares), and Dr. Raymund Antonio Maguad (Dr. Maguad),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> narrated the following:<br><br>One afternoon in March 2003, while AAA was in her house in <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span>, Negros Occidental, Ibañez came in and asked her where her father was. When AAA told him that her father was not home, Ibañez grabbed her and pointed a knife at her. He then kissed her, groped her breasts, and shoved her into a bedroom. He undressed himself, inserted his penis into AAA's vagina, and made a "push-and-pull movement."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> After satisfying his savage desires at AAA's expense, Ibañez threatened to kill her if she told her parents of what had transpired.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Similarly, at around 5:00 p.m. on April 12, 2003, Ibañez came again and asked where AAA's parents were. When he found out that she was alone, he pointed a knife at her, brought her into her bedroom, and forcefully inserted his penis into her vagina. The same thing happened again at around 5:00 p.m. on April 25, 2003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The fourth alleged incident happened on May 11, 2003. At 7:00 p.m., Ibañez entered AAA's house when she was alone and began kissing her, only to pause when AAA's friend came into the house. While AAA and her friend watched a television show, Ibañez slept on the sofa, but not before making sure that AAA would not tell on him. By 9:00 p.m., despite AAA's pleas, her friend left. AAA woke Ibañez up and told him to go home, but upon waking up, Ibañez started kissing her again. AAA attempted to flee, but she slipped and fell. Ibañez then went on top of her and sexually abused her for the fourth time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Three days later, AAA went to the municipal health office to be examined by Dr. Agustus Ceasar J. Tan. However, the physician died shortly after, and Dr. Maguad testified on his report. Dr. Maguad reported that AAA "had old hymenal lacerations on her external genitalia at the three and nine o'clock position" which may have been caused by a blunt object like a penis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Solely testifying for his defense, Ibañez denied raping AAA, whom he admitted to be his niece through marriage.

[W]ill you kindly narrate to us from the very beginning how [the rape] transpired?<br>A: On that afternoon. Leo Ibañez went to our house and inquired where my Papa and Mama was [sic], I answered "I don't know", they left" [sic] and then he came near me and pulled me and pointed a knife at me.<br><br>....<br><br>Q: After he pulled you and pointed a knife at your side, what happened next?<br>A: He pointed a knife at my side pulling me towards the house. He kissed my lips and his hands mashed different parts of my body going towards the bed. He held tightly both my hands and his left hand while his right hand pulling [sic] my pants and panty.<br><br>Q: What happened next?<br>A: Then he pushed me to the bed and he placed himself on top of me.<br><br>Q: What else happened?<br>A: He was wearing blue shorts and he also removed his shorts while on top of me.<br><br>Q: After he removed his shorts, what did he do?<br>A: Then he inserted his penis into my vagina and done [sic] the push-and-pull motion.<br><br>Q: Was he able to enter your vagina?<br>A: Yes, it penetrated me and I felt pain.<br><br>Q: After doing the push-and-pull inside your vagina, what happened next?<br>A: When he penetrated me I shouted "agoy".<br><br>....<br><br>Q: What were you doing at that time on April 12, 2003 at about 5:00 to 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon?<br>A: I was arranging my clothes inside our house when the accused called up and asked the whereabouts of my parents....<br><br>....<br><br>Q: While he was kissing and continued mashing [sic] the different parts of your body, what else happened?<br>A: He told me to go to the bed and he continued kissing me ... and then he undressed himself and he let me lie down and he placed himself on top of me and continued mashing the different parts of my body and pointing to me the knife.<br><br>....<br><br>Q: After licking your vagina with his tongue, what else happened?<br>A: He kissed my lips and he inserted his penis into my vagina, Sir.<br><br>....<br><br>Q: Can you recall when the third one happened? The second was on April 12, 2003, when was the third one?<br>A: April 25, 2003.<br><br>....<br><br>Q: What happened in your house when your parents were no longer there?<br>A: I placed the water in our kitchen and Leo Ibañez was already there sitting in our bamboo set, then he warned me not to tell my parents about the things he had been doing to me, Sir.<br><br>....<br><br>Q: What else happened?<br>A: He was on top of me, undressing me and he also undressed himself, Sir.<br><br>Q: After he had undressed himself, what did you do while on top of you?

Sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>As the trial court found, AAA's consistent and categorical testimony suffices to convict accused-appellant. In rape cases, conviction or acquittal may solely depend on the private complainants' credibility, as only they can testify on its occurrence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>AAA's testimony was also bolstered by the medical finding of hymenal lacerations, which corroborated her narration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In <i>People v. Quintos</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> this Court has held:<br><br><blockquote>The presence of lacerations is not an element of the crime of rape. This court previously characterized the presence or absence of lacerations as a "trivial or inconsequential [matter] that does not alter the essential fact of the commission of rape." The presence of lacerations is, therefore, not necessary to sustain a conviction. An accused may be found guilty of rape regardless of the existence or inexistence of lacerations. The absence of lacerations is not a sufficient defense.<br><br>However, the presence of lacerations may be used to sustain conviction of an accused by corroborating testimonies of abuse and documents showing trauma upon the victim's genitals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Against AAA's detailed and categorical testimony, accused-appellant interposed the defenses of denial and frame-up, which are inherently weak defenses. These are "self-serving negative evidence which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Moreover, accused-appellant alleged inconsistencies in AAA's testimony that only point to collateral and trivial matters. These neither taint AAA's credibility nor dispute the commission of rape. In <i>People v. Corpuz</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The discrepancies pertaining to "minor details and not in actuality touching upon the central fact of the crime" do not prejudice AAA's credibility. Thus, "[i]nstead of weakening [her] testimonies, such inconsistencies tend to strengthen [her] credibility because they discount the possibility of their being rehearsed,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Finally, AAA's alleged lack of resistance cannot in any way negate accused-appellant's commission of rape. This Court has previously clarified in Quintos:<br><br><blockquote>[R]esistance is not an element of the crime of rape. It need not be shown by the prosecution. Neither is it necessary to convict an accused. The main element of rape is "lack of consent."<br><br>"Consent," "resistance," and "absence of resistance" are different things. Consent implies agreement and voluntariness. It implies willfulness. Similarly, resistance is an act of will. However, it implies the opposite of consent. It implies disagreement.<br><br>Meanwhile, absence of resistance only implies passivity. It may be a product of one's will. It may imply consent. <i>However, it may also be the product of force, intimidation, manipulation, and other external forces.</i><br><br>Thus, when a person resists another's sexual advances, it would not be presumptuous to say that that person does not consent to any sexual activity with the other. That resistance may establish lack of consent. Sexual congress with a person who expressed her resistance by words or deeds constitutes force either physically or psychologically through threat or intimidation. It is rape.<br><br>Lack of resistance may sometimes imply consent. However, that is not always the case. While it may imply consent, there are circumstances that may render a person unable to express her resistance to another's sexual advances. Thus, when a person has carnal knowledge with another person who does not show any resistance, it does not always mean that that person consented to such act. Lack of resistance does not negate rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>That accused-appellant is AAA's uncle presupposes that he exercises moral ascendancy or influence over her. Further, he repeatedly pointed a knife at her and threatened to kill her if she told anybody of his dastardly acts. Such influence and use of force naturally rendered AAA unable to resist.<br><br>In any case, survivors of such cruelty in the hands of their relatives—or any person for that matter—must not be blamed for any action, or lack thereof, that they take when suddenly forced to respond to a threat. People differ in how they address danger. There is no blueprint on how a victim should act when violated. There is no certainty as to how one would react. What is certain, however, is that a person who forces sexual congress on another is a rapist. Rapists' acts must never be attributed to their victims.<br><br>Contrary to accused-appellant's attempt at exculpation, it does not matter whether AAA attempted to flee or take every chance to escape whenever he found her alone. A victim's failure to resist another person's vigorous advances does not equate to consenting to sexual abuse. What is truly contrary to human experience is how a victim would "[expose] himself/herself again"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> to violence and invite a rapist to his/her house, as he insisted—which, as the facts bear out, AAA certainly did not.<br><br>For all these, accused-appellant's guilt for the four counts of qualified rape has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. In view of Republic Act No. 9346, the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole was correctly imposed by the Regional Trial Court for each count. The Court of Appeals likewise rightfully increased the civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in each count to P100,000.00 each, in line with current jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
