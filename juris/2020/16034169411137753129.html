Trial on the merits ensued.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br><br>As narrated in the Assailed Decision, the prosecution presented the following version of the facts:<br><blockquote>On [March 20, 2014], the intelligence operatives of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Iriga City held a briefing in preparation for a buy-­bust operation against [Lopez]. His identity was confirmed by a confidential asset. PO1 Jonard Buenaflor was designated to act as a poseur-buyer and tasked to use [PhP]2,000.00 as marked money consisting of four five hundred peso bills during the operation.<br><br>The police asset informed PO1 Buenaflor that [Lopez] would meet them in front of Trinidad Building, Tantiado Hardware at San Francisco, Iriga City. As they waited for [Lopez], the back-up operatives positioned themselves in the area. [Lopez] arrived on a motorcycle and proceeded to ask the informant how much they would be buying. PO1 Buenaflor then handed P2,000.00 to [Lopez]. In turn, the latter gave him a small heat-sealed transparent sachet containing crystalline substance which the poseur-buyer suspected as shabu.<br><br>PO1 Buenaflor performed the pre-arranged signal by removing his cap to indicate a positive buy-bust operation. He arrested [Lopez], while the back-up operatives rushed to the scene. Representatives from the Department of Justice (DOJ), the media, and a Barangay Councilor were also called to serve as witnesses to the body search, marking and photographing of seized items. When they arrived, PO1 Buenaflor marked the plastic sachet "JBB 22 3-30-14." Meanwhile, PO3 Ric Reginales [(PO3 Reginales)] searched the person of [Lopez] and recovered from him the following items: (1) buy-bust money, (2) cellphone, (3) lighter, (4) twenty-peso bill, and (5) coins.<br><br>Thereafter, the operatives headed to the police station with [Lopez]. The Inventory/Confiscation Receipt was prepared by PO2 Joel Tabangan and signed by the DOJ representative Doris Viñas (Viñas), media representative Gloria Bongais (Bongais), and <i>Barangay Kagawad</i> Ramer Samantela (Samantela). On the other hand, PO2 Roger Tuyay drafted the requests for laboratory examination and drug test.<br><br>PO1 Buenaflor delivered the seized plastic sachet and [Lopez] to the provincial crime laboratory for examination. Based on the Chemistry Report No. D-109-2014 and Chemistry Report No. DTC-081-2014 prepared by the forensic chemist Police Senior Inspector (PSI) Jun Malong, the contents of the plastic sachet and [Lopez's] urine tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>The defense's version of the facts, as culled from the Assailed Decision, is as follows:<br><blockquote>On [March 30, 2014], [Lopez] just came from a gas station where he met a certain Rico Murillo who gave him P2,000.00. He was instructed by the latter to give the same to a person who he knew went by the name Engineer Tubig. He then rode his motorcycle and went on his way only to be flagged down by PO1 Buenaflor upon reaching Tantiado Hardware. When he inquired what his violation was, the police officer told him to hold the money, but ordered him to stay put. In addition to that, PO1 Buenaflor collected the keys of his motorcycle. After some time, about five to six policemen arrived at the scene.<br><br>When Viñas and Bongais showed up, the police officers took photographs of [Lopez], whereas, the money he was holding was placed on the road. He was also frisked, but the police officers found nothing in his person. However, he saw one police officer in civilian clothes take a plastic sachet from his own pocket which he revealed to Viñas and Bongais.<br><br>After [Lopez's] arrest, he was taken to the police station where he was photographed with the plastic sachet and the money. Later, he was brought to the crime laboratory. He was provided with water to drink which tasted unpleasant. Nevertheless, he still drank it since the police officers needed his urine sample.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><div align="center"><b>The Ruling of the RTC</b><br></div><br>In its Judgment, the RTC found Lopez guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged.

The dispositive portion of the Assailed Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Judgment dated [July 27, 2017] rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Fifth Judicial Region, Branch 34, Iriga City in Criminal Case Nos. IR-10559 and IR-10164 is AFFIRMED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>Responding to the arguments raised by Lopez in his appeal, the CA ruled that the prosecution need not have conducted surveillance prior to the buy-bust operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Furthermore, the failure of the prosecution to present the informant in court was not fatal to its case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In any case, the CA found that the prosecution successfully proved the identity and integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> since all links in the chain of custody were proven.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The CA did not give due credence to the defenses of denial and frame-up as these were not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]<br></sup><br>From the Assailed Decision, Lopez filed his Notice of Appeal dated May2, 2019.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>The issue for resolution before the Court is whether the CA erred in affirming the RTC's Judgment finding Lopez guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violations of Sections 5 and 15, Article II of R.A. No. 9165.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>After a careful review of the records, the Court partly grants the appeal.<br><br>Insofar as the charge for violation of illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 is concerned, the Court finds no compelling reason to deviate from the lower courts' findings that, indeed, the guilt of Lopez was sufficiently proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>However, with respect to the charge for violation of Section 15, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 on illegal use of dangerous drugs, the Court finds that the prosecution failed to prove the conduct of a confirmatory test subsequent to the screening test as required by law. Hence, to this charge, Lopez should be acquitted.<br><br>In so disposing, the Court considers, as is true in all appeals from conviction of crimes, any fact or circumstance in the accused-appellant's favor regardless of whether such fact or circumstance was raised as a defense or assigned as an error and despite the similar pronouncement of guilt by both the trial court and the appellate court. Every appeal of a criminal conviction opens the entire record to the reviewing court which should itself determine whether the findings adverse to the accused should be upheld or struck down in his favor.<br><br>The criminal liability of the accused-appellant under both charges are discussed separately.<br><br><center><b>I.</b><br></center><br>In <u>Criminal Case No. IR-10559</u>, Lopez stood charged, tried, and was found guilty by the lower courts of the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs defined and punished under the first paragraph of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 which provides:<br><blockquote>Section 5. <i>Sale, Trading, Administration. Dispensation, Delivery, Distribution and Transportation of Dangerous Drugs and/or Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals</i>. -<b>The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten million pesos (P10,000,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell</b>, trade, ad minister, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute dispatch in transit or transport <b>any dangerous drug</b>, including any and all species of opium poppy <b>regardless of the quantity and purity involved</b>, or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In prosecuting this charge, the State bears the burden of proving the following elements: (1) the identity of the buyer, as well as the seller, the object and consideration of the sale; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> What is material is proof that the transaction or sale took place as a matter of fact, coupled with the presentation in court of the dangerous drug seized as evidence.<br><br>The commission of the offense of illegal sale of dangerous drugs requires the consummation of the illegal sale which is statutorily defined as "[a]ny act of giving away any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical whether for money or any other consideration".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> In apprehensions pursuant to a buy-bust operation, delivery of the illegal drug to the poseur-buyer and the receipt by the seller of the marked money completes the illegal transaction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Stated otherwise, as long as the police officer went through the operation as a buyer and his offer was accepted by the accused-­appellant who delivers the dangerous drugs to the former, the crime is consummated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Conviction follows as a matter of due course barring any irregularities in the handling of the seized dangerous drug and its presentation was accounted for, photographed before the trial court.<br><br>In the present case, the Court agrees with the lower courts that the elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs were adequately and satisfactorily established by the prosecution.<br><br>A perusal of the proceedings before the trial court shows that in the afternoon of March 30, 2014 the police operatives of PNP Iriga City held a briefing for the conduct of a buy-bust operation against Lopez,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the details of which are reduced in the Pre-Operation Report dated March 30, 2014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> PO1 Buenaflor, together with their confidential informant, acted as the poseur­-buyer of the operation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and took custody of the marked money to be used.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The marked money used in this operation was accounted, photographed, photocopied, and positively identified<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> before the trial court.<br><br>PO1 Buenaflor positively identified<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Lopez during trial as the same person who approached them after being contacted by their confidential informant<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> for a possible sale. Upon meeting PO1 Buenaflor and the confidential informant, it was Lopez who asked them how much they would be buying.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Lopez made the offer and PO1 Buenaflor, as poseur-buyer, accepted. It was Lopez as well who received the marked money from PO1 Buenaflor, and who handed over a heat-sealed transparent sachet containing a crystalline substance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Considering that there is positive testimony, corroborated in its material points, and supporting documentary evidence identifying Lopez as the one who offered to sell, and in fact sold, the dangerous drug in exchange for P2,000.00 and who, upon receipt of the consideration, delivered the dangerous drug to the poseur-buyer, it is clear that all elements of the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs had been proven.<br><br>In his defense, Lopez ascribed irregularity in the conduct of the buy-­bust operation because no surveillance was done nor was a sketch-plan made prior to the conduct of the buy-bust operation, and that the operation proceeded merely on the information given by the confidential informant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Relying on <i>People v. Rojo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Lopez argued that the trial court should have been circumspect in its appreciation of the testimonies surrounding the operation.<br><br>The challenge fails. The Court has ruled that the absence of a prior surveillance does not affect the validity of an entrapment operation, much less result in the exoneration of the accused, especially in light of evidence establishing the elements of the crime. In <i>People v. Manlangit</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> citing <i>Quinicot v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Court pronounced:<br><blockquote>Settled is the rule that the absence of a prior surveillance or test buy does not affect the legality of the buy-bust operation. There is no textbook method of conducting buy-bust operations. The Court has left to the discretion of police authorities the selection of effective means to apprehend drug dealers. A prior surveillance, much less a lengthy one, is not necessary, especially where the police operatives are accompanied by their informant during the entrapment. Flexibility is a trait of good police work. We have held that when time is of the essence, the police may dispense with the need for prior surveillance. In the instant case, having been accompanied by the informant to the person who was peddling the dangerous drugs, the policemen need not have conducted any prior surveillance before they undertook the buy-bust operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>Lopez's reliance on <i>Rojo</i> is likewise misplaced. The Court in <i>Rojo</i> appreciated in favor of the accused the fact that none of the prosecution witnesses saw the accused therein deliver the dangerous drugs to the informant since the police operatives were meters away from the alleged illegal transaction. When the confidential informant in <i>Rojo</i> was not presented in court, the Court found that there was no direct evidence in <i>Rojo</i> to establish the alleged illegal sale:<br><blockquote>In this particular case, the witnesses for the prosecution who were members of the police team at the time of the alleged "buy-bust operation," particularly Sgt. Carbonel and Pat. Balatbat, were in their jeep parked at Beata street, some 100 meters away from the scene. Pat. Alferos was 10 meters away from the informant and the appellant while Pat. Maniquez was about seven (7) meters away and the others stayed at a far distance so as not to arouse suspicion. It was only after the informant gave the signal by scratching the left side of his head with his left hand to indicate that the marijuana was already handed to him and that he in turn gave the money to the appellant that the said police officers converged and arrested the appellant.<br><br>These are the facts as found by the trial court which show that none of the prosecution witnesses actually saw the appellant deliver the alleged bag of flowering tops of marijuana which was allegedly sold to the informant. It also indicates that they did not see the informant pay the alleged consideration of the sale with a 10-peso bill. They just assumed that the transaction was consummated upon a signal from the informant. There is, therefore, no direct evidence, much less conclusive proof, to establish the alleged unlawful sale of marijuana being pinned on the appellant.<br><br>If truly there was such an entrapment that was undertaken in this case, the informant would be the best witness for the prosecution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>The prosecution in this case presented the testimony of PO1 Buenaflor who acted as the poseur-buyer. In <i>Rojo</i>, the illegal sale transpired between the accused and the informant alone. Hence, it was necessary for the prosecution therein to present the informant as the police officers were stationed meters away from the alleged illegal sale and could not have seen the transaction from that far a distance. In contrast, the illegal drug and the marked money in this case exchanged hands between Lopez and PO1 Buenaflor. Unlike in <i>Rojo</i>, the prosecution presented direct evidence of the illegal sale in the form of PO1 Buenaflor's testimony.<br><br>Clearly, while the prosecution in <i>Rojo</i> grappled with a paucity of evidence, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in the case at bar. Moreover, the prosecution's case is supported by positive and corroborative testimony as well as documentary evidence sufficient to negate any reasonable doubt as to the occurrence of the buy-bust operation.<br><br>The analysis does not end here. The Court must still determine whether the dangerous drug, the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> reached the court with its identity and integrity preserved. This must be established with moral certainty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In arriving at this certainty, the very nature of prohibited drugs, they being susceptible to tampering and error, circumscribes the burden of the State in prosecuting the crime.<br><br>To establish the requisite identity of the dangerous drug, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drug is seized up to its presentation in court as evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 describes the following procedure:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><blockquote>Section 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof[.]<br></blockquote>The events of this case occurred prior to the effectivity date of Republic Act No. 10640<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> which amended Section 21 of R.A.

No. 9165:<br><blockquote>Compliance with the chain of custody requirement provided by Section 21, therefore, <b>ensures the integrity of confiscated, seized, and/or surrendered drugs and/or drug paraphernalia</b> in four (4) respects: first, the nature of the substances or items seized; second, the quantity (e.g., weight) of the substances or items seized; third, the relation of the substances or items seized to the incident allegedly causing their seizure; and fourth, the relation of the substances or items seized to the person/s alleged to have been in possession of or peddling them. Compliance with this requirement <b>forecloses opportunities for planting, contaminating, or tampering of evidence in any manner</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>To be clear, strict adherence with Section 21 remains to be the rule. This is a singular and rigid standard. Anything less than strict adherence would automatically be a deviation from the chain of custody rule that would only pass judicial muster in the most exacting of standards following the twin-requirements of: (1) existence of justifiable reasons, and (2) preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> In these cases, the point of contention should not revolve around the amount of illegal drugs seized, but on whether the constitutional and statutory rights of an accused are protected in the prosecution of the crime he or she stands accused.<br><br>The Court notes in this case the meticulousness of the apprehending officers in their compliance with the chain of custody rule and in documenting their movements. Additional safeguards employed by the police operatives in this case such as the taking of photographs in every step of the operation, though not legally required, are commendable practices in law enforcement. Equal note should also be made on the prosecution's efforts in drawing out the details in establishing the crucial custodial links to secure the identity and integrity of the dangerous drug seized from the accused. <u><b>This shows that the requirements imposed by Section 21, while exacting considering the liberties at stake, are logical and susceptible to strict and full compliance.</b></u><br><br><center><b>II.</b><br></center><br>In Criminal Case No. IR-10614, Lopez stood charged for illegal use of dangerous drugs, defined and penalized under Section 15, Article II of R.A.

No. 9165 and who is found to be positive for use of any dangerous drug,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> a conviction presupposes the prior conduct of an initial screening test and a subsequent confirmatory test both yielding positive results for illegal drug use. In this regard, Section 36 of R.A. No. 9165 provides, in part:<br><blockquote>Section 36. <i>Authorized Drug Testing</i>. - Authorized drug testing shall be done by any government forensic laboratories or by any of the drug testing laboratories accredited and monitored by the DOH to safeguard the quality of test results. The DOH shall take steps in setting the price of the drug test with DOH accredited drug testing centers to further reduce the cost of such drug test. <b>The drug testing shall employ, among others, two (2) testing methods, the screening test which will determine the positive result as well as the type of the drug used and the confirmatory test which will confirm a positive screening test.</b> Drug test certificates issued by accredited drug testing centers shall be valid for a one-year period from the date of issue which may be used for other purposes. The following shall be subjected to undergo drug testing: x x x. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Meanwhile, Section 38 of R.A. No. 9165 provides:<br><blockquote>Section 38. <i>Laboratory Examination or Test on Apprehended/Arrested Offenders</i>. - <b>Subject to Section 15 of this Act, any person apprehended or arrested for violating the provisions of this Act shall be subjected to screening laboratory examination or test within twenty-four (24) hours</b>, if the apprehending or arresting officer has reasonable ground to believe that the person apprehended or arrested, on account of physical signs or symptoms or other visible or outward manifestation, is under the influence of dangerous drugs. <b>If found to be positive, the results of the screening laboratory examination or test shall be challenged within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the result through a confirmatory test conducted in any accredited analytical laboratory equipment with a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry equipment or some such modern and accepted method, if confirmed the same shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that such person has used dangerous drugs</b>, which is without prejudice for the prosecution for other violations of the provisions of this Act: <i>Provided</i>, That <u><b>a positive screening laboratory test must be confirmed for it to be valid in a court of law</b></u>. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>From the foregoing, two distinct drug tests are required: a screening test and a confirmatory test. A positive screening test must be confirmed for it to be valid in a court of law.
