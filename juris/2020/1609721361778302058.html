				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The courage of a Filipina to work as a household helper in a foreign land deserves much more than a cursory evaluation of the evidence on record.

Respondents, on the other hand, contend that she pre-terminated her employment contract due to homesickness. As between these two contentions, undersigned finds that respondents' assertion cannot prevail over complainant's categorical, straightforward, and detailed statement. There is more serious reason that made her decide to give up her employment than mere homesickness. It is unbelievable that for being homesick, she would ran [sic] away from her foreign employer and risk her life in so doing. In fact, complainant presented the Discharge summary to prove her allegation that she suffered an injury due to an accident. This fact was recognized by respondents with their statement in the reply – <i>"Moreover, her failure to return to her foreign employer and the accident that subsequently landed her in the hospital was caused by her doing and fault, and which resulted to her inability to continue working for her foreign employer."</i> Such statement clearly contradicts their earlier stand in their Position Paper that complainant Jacob decided to pre-terminate her employment due to homesickness.<br><br>....<br><br>... In the case at bar, based on the narration of events which complainant suffered in the hands of her foreign employer, undersigned opines that she had experienced unbearable treatment from her foreign employer which compelled her to give up her employment. Indubitably, there exists illegal constructive dismissal.<br><br>....<br><br>As regards the Final Settlement document signed by complainant Jacob, the same is not a proof that she voluntarily gave up her employment and received all the benefits due her. Taking into consideration her situation at the time of the signing, she had no choice but to go back to the Philippines. In other words, signing the Final Settlement document was a condition for her repatriation.<br><br>....<br><br>It is worthy to note that the Philippine Embassy and POLO's stamps in the document did not mean that complainant subscribed and swore to it before the Labor Attaché. Complainant did not attest the veracity and truthfulness of the contents of the document before Labor Attaché Rustico SM.

Kaya po natakot kami at isa pa po [ibebenta] kami sa Arabo na magiging employer namin ulit. [Nang] dumating ang 3:00 A.M. doon kami dumaan sa may C.R. ng agency sa bintana nagdugtong dugtong kami ng mga damit pa doon sa bintana ng mga may naunang tumakas.

To avert a commotion, she reported the matter to her female employer but unfortunately, she was merely discredited and even blamed for the incident. From then on, petitioner's female foreign employer treated her differently. Jacob was subjected to physical and verbal harm that she was left with no other choice but to relinquish her employment.<br><br>Certainly, the treatment petitioner experienced in the hands of her foreign employers fostered a hostile and unbearable work setting which impelled her not only to leave her employers but also, as in petitioner's words, to escape (<i>tumakas</i>). The conclusion is all too clear that there exists a well­grounded fear on her part prompting her to run away despite having been employed overseas for barely two (2) months. <br><br>The cessation of petitioner's employment was not of her own doing but was brought about by unfavorable circumstances created by her foreign employers. To put in simply, if petitioner failed to continue her job, it was because she refused to be further subjected to the ordeal caused by the her employers' conduct. All of these evidently constitute a case of constructive dismissal.<br><br>Unfortunately, petitioner's anguish did not end when she was able to escape on February 16, 2015. To seek refuge, she went to respondent First Step's counterpart agency in Riyadh. Upon discovering the unfortunate situation of female overseas workers there, she tried to escape through the agency's window where she fell and injured her spine. Petitioner's narration is not at all self-serving and baseless, as claimed by respondents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> The material points of her story were duly supported by the Discharge Summary<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> from King Saudi Medical City which, in part, provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Date of Admission: 17/02/2015</b><br><br><b><u>Reason [o]f Admission:</u></b><br><br>PT.

In resolving issues of constructive dismissal, courts do not only weigh the evidence presented by the parties, but also delve into the "totality of circumstances."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> In petitioner's case, it is apparent that she could not have gone to the counterpart agency and eventually injure herself in the course of escape were it not for the hostile treatment afforded by her foreign employers which made her run away.<br><br>Furthermore, petitioner's failure to promptly report the matter of maltreatment and harassment to the authorities overseas<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> cannot be taken against her.

Siason</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br><br><blockquote><i>Resignation is the formal pronouncement or relinquishment of a position or office. It is the voluntary act ofan employee who is in a situation where he [or she] believes that personal reasons cannot be sacrificed in favor of the exigency of the service, and he [or she] has then no other choice but to disassociate himself [or herself] from employment.</i> The intent to relinquish must concur with the overt act of relinquishment; hence, the acts of the employee before and after the alleged resignation must be considered in determining whether he [or she] in fact intended to terminate his [or her] employment. <i>In illegal dismissal cases, it is a fundamental rule that when an employer interposes the defense of resignation, on him [or her] necessarily rests the burden to prove that the employee indeed voluntarily resigned.</i><br><br>In contrast, constructive dismissal exists where there is cessation of work because continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely, as an offer involving a demotion in rank or a diminution in pay and other benefits. Aptly called a dismissal in disguise or an act amounting to dismissal but made to appear as if it were not, constructive dismissal may, likewise, exist if an act of clear discrimination, insensibility, or disdain by an employer becomes so unbearable on the part of the employee that it could foreclose any choice by him [or her] except to forego his [or her] continued employment. It must be noted, however, that bare allegations of constructive dismissal, when uncorroborated by the evidence on record, cannot be given credence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>As stated above, respondents hold the burden of proving that petitioner voluntarily resigned. Respondents make much of the Final Settlement and Certification executed before the Philippine Embassy to support their claim.

Besides, nothing in the Final Settlement expressly provides that petitioner voluntarily resigned from employment due to the personal reason stated.

Having a witness could have been helpful to the cause of respondents, especially since petitioner is assailing<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> the authenticity of her signature in the pertinent documents. As such, we are left with nothing but self-serving assertions from respondents.<br><br>Notably, as a general<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> rule, "deeds of release, waivers, or quitclaims cannot bar employees from demanding benefits to which they are legally entitled or from contesting the legality of their dismissal, since quitclaims are looked upon with disfavor and are frowned upon as contrary to public policy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> The burden of proving that petitioner voluntarily entered into the agreement lies with the employer,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> which in this case, respondents miserably failed to do. Apart from merely claiming that petitioner's homesickness led her to voluntary resign from her job (as evinced by the execution of the Final Settlement), respondents failed to present other concrete evidence to support the assertion.<br><br>Also, the lack of any physical coercion on the part of petitioner does not automatically suggest that she voluntarily adhered to the stipulations in the Final Settlement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> This is especially so in light of her helpless situation, away from the comforts of her family and support group. Out of dire necessity and desperation, it is evident that signing the Final Settlement and Certification was her only choice as it was, in fact, explicitly noted therein that it was a "condition for the worker's [r]epatriation[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> Besides, it would be irrational for petitioner to resign and thereafter file a case for illegal dismissal since "[r]esignation is inconsistent with the filing of the said complaint."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> Given that resignation "is a formal pronouncement of relinquishment of an office[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> it must be concurrent with the intent and the act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><br><center><b>III</b></center><br><br>As a result of petitioner's illegal dismissal, she is entitled to moral damages, exemplary damages, nd attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup><br><br>Moral and exemplary damages are awarded in the following circumstances:<br><br><blockquote>Moral damages are recoverable when the dismissal of an employee is attended by bad faith or fraud or <i>constitutes an act oppressive to labor</i>, or is done in a manner contrary to good morals, good customs or public policy.

Breach of contract, maltreatment, rape, insufficient nourishment, sub-human lodgings, insults and other forms of debasement, are only a few of the inhumane acts to which they are subjected by their foreign employers, who probably feel they can do as they please in their own country.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In acknowledging the plight of Overseas Filipino Workers, this Court underscored the importance of stem enforcement of pertinent laws and rules.

Many hapless citizens of this cotmtry who have sought foreign employment to earn a few dollars to ensure for their families a life worthy of human dignity and provide proper education and a decent future for their children have found themselves enslaved by foreign masters, harassed or abused and deprived of their employment for the slightest cause. No one should be made to unjustly profit from their suffering. Hence, recruiting agencies must not only faithfully comply with Government-prescribed responsibilities; they must impose upon themselves the duty, borne out of a social conscience, to help citizens of this country sent abroad to work for foreign principals.

With the added burden of enduring the trauma caused by her employers' conduct, it can be reasonably deduced that the kind of treatment afforded her was nothing but oppressive. Worse, in petitioner's situation, she had to escape twice in order to save her life. Regrettably, instead of giving petitioner protection, respondents seemingly took advantage of her helpless condition by making her sign a Final Settlement with terms obviously disadvantagous to her. Hence, with the foregoing in mind, an award of P50,000 moral damages<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> is therefore justified.
