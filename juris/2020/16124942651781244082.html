dated August 20, 2019 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 
109701 which affirmed with modification the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 dated March 24, 2017 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 
268 (RTC) in Civil Case No. 72809-PSG, and accordingly, directed 
petitioner Bryan L. Uysipuo (petitioner) to pay respondent RCBC Bankard.
 Services Corporation (RCBC) the following sums: 
(<em>a</em>) P787,500.00 as the principal obligation; 
(<em>b</em>)
 an amount equivalent to six percent (6%) per annum of the principal 
obligation computed from the date of extra-judicial demand,<em> 
i.e</em>., November 26, 2010, until full payment, as legal 
interest; (<em>c</em>)
 an amount equivalent to six percent (6%) per annum of the principal 
obligation computed from August 2009 until full payment, as late payment
 interest; (<em>d</em>) P50,000.00 as attorney's fees; and 
(<em>e</em>) costs of litigation.
  <p align="center"> <b>The Facts</b> 
  </p><p>Sometime in 2009, petitioner applied for and was 
issued a 
credit card by Bankard, Inc. (Bankard), a domestic banking corporation 
engaged in the business of extending credit,<sup style="COLOR: 
RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 allowing the former to avail of the latter's credit services. Under the
 terms and conditions governing the issuance and use of the said card, a
 copy of which was given to petitioner, the cardholder was required to 
settle his account on or before the due date indicated in his statement 
of account, subject to the payment of interest and late payment charges,
 in case of default, at the respective monthly rates of three point five
 percent (3.5%) and seven percent (7%). Subsequently, petitioner started
 making purchases with the use of the credit card, and, for a certain 
period, was duly paying his obligations. However, he later defaulted in 
his payments, and, as of May 9, 2010, had incurred an unpaid balance of 
P1,757,024.53, inclusive of interests and late payment charges. Later, a
 formal letter of demand was sent to petitioner, which he duly received 
on November 26, 2010 but failed to heed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 
0, 0);">[6]</sup> Thus, on December 15, 2010, Bankard filed a 
complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 with the RTC praying for the payment of the amount of P1,757,024.53, 
plus interest and late payment charges, attorney's fees, and costs of 
suit. Bankard was later substituted by respondent RCBC Bankard Services 
Corporation (RCBC).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[8]</sup>
  </p><p> For his part, petitioner asserted that his credit 
card 
purchases only amounted to P300,000.00, which ballooned to the amount of
 P1,757,024.53 because of the imposition of illegal interests and 
surcharges.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[9]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The 
RTC Ruling</b>
  </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[10]</sup> dated March 24, 2017, the RTC ruled in RCBC's 
favor, and accordingly, ordered petitioner to pay RCBC: 
(<em>a</em>) the total outstanding obligation in the amount 
of P1,757,024.53; (<em>b</em>)
 interest on the total outstanding obligation at the rate of 12% per 
annum from November 26, 2010 until June 30, 2013 and 6% per annum from 
July 1, 2013 until full payment; (<em>c</em>) interest on 
accrued interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of the 
filing of the complaint,<em> i.e</em>., December 15, 2010 
until June 30, 2013 and 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until full 
payment; (<em>d</em>) attorney's fees in the amount of 
P50,000.00; and (<i>e</i>) costs of litigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 
0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 The RTC found that RCBC had sufficiently established a valid claim 
against petitioner, as it was proven that he used his credit card to 
make purchases and had voluntarily accepted the terms and conditions 
governing the issuance and use of the same.<sup style="COLOR: 
RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Aggrieved, petitioner 
appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to 
the CA.
  </p><p align="center"> <b>The CA Ruling</b>  
  </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[14]</sup> dated April 11, 2019, the CA 
<big>affirmed</big> the decision of the RTC with 
<b>modification</b>.
 The CA found that the stipulated amount of interest and late penalty 
charges, at the respective monthly rates of three point five percent 
(3.5%) and seven percent (7%), were excessive and unconscionable, and 
thus, equitably reduced each of them to the prevailing legal rates. 
Anent the amount of the principal obligation, the CA found the same to 
be in the amount of P787,500.00, which was the balance due to be paid 
within August 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[15]</sup>Accordingly, the CA ordered petitioner to pay 
RCBC: (<em>a</em>) the amount of P787,500.00 as the 
principal obligation; (<em>b</em>)
 an amount equivalent to six percent (6%) per annum of the principal 
obligation computed from the date of extra-judicial demand, 
<em>i.e</em>., November 26, 2010, until full payment as 
legal interest; (<em>c</em>)
 an amount equivalent to six percent (6%) per annum of the principal 
obligation computed from August 2009 until full payment as late payment 
interest; (<em>d</em>) attorney's fees in the amount of 
P50,000.00; and (<em>e</em>) costs of litigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>   
  </p><p>Undeterred, petitioner moved for 
reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0,

2019; hence, the instant petition.  
  </p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue Before the 
Court</b>
  </p><p> The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or
 not the CA 
erred in ordering the payment of the amount of P787,500.00 as the 
principal obligation, plus interest and late payment interest thereon at
 the prevailing legal rates. </p><p align="center"> 
<b>The Court's Ruling</b>
  </p><p> The petition is without merit. </p><p align="center"> <b>I.</b>
  </p><p> At the outset, the Court notes that petitioner 
admits his 
indebtedness to RCBC on account of his use of the credit card issued to 
him. However, he insists that he should only be made to pay the 
principal obligation amounting to P300,000.00, as RCBC's imposition of 
illegal interests and late payment charges should be struck down for 
being unconscionable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[19]</sup> On the other hand, the courts<em> a 
quo</em>
 valued the principal obligation differently, in that the RTC pegged the
 same at P1,757,024.53, while the CA lowered it to P787,500.00. While 
factual findings of the lower courts are generally considered final and 
binding on this Court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[20]</sup> the Court is nevertheless allowed to make its 
own when, among others, the factual findings of the lower courts are 
conflicting,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 as in this case. Guided by the foregoing considerations, the Court 
deems it proper to make its own findings to determine petitioner's 
principal obligation to RCBC.
  </p><p> Records show that, from April 2009 to October 8, 
2009, 
petitioner made purchases with the use of his credit card in the total 
amount of P4,834,774.18,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[22]</sup> and merely paid the total amount of 
P3,623,773.85,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 leaving a difference of <strong>P1,211,000.33</strong>
 as the total unpaid obligation. Such finding may be gathered from a 
review of petitioner's statement of account covering the aforesaid 
period, as summarized by the CA:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0,

  </blockquote>
  <p>Based on the foregoing, the CA erred in finding that the 
principal 
obligation merely amounted to the sum of P787,500.00, which was the 
balance due to be paid within the month of August of 2009, considering 
that such amount was already paid by petitioner in the succeeding months
 of September and October of 2009, within which the latter made further 
purchases on credit. Accordingly, the Court finds that petitioner's 
principal obligation to RCBC should amount to 
<b><u>P1,211,000.33</u></b>, which, as 
previously explained, remains unpaid.</p>
  <p align="center"> <b>II. </b>
  </p><p> Anent the proper amount of<b><u> 
interest and late payment charges</u></b>,
 the CA correctly found that the monthly interest rate of 3.5% as well 
as the penalty charge for late payment of 7% was excessive, iniquitous, 
unconscionable, and exorbitant, and hence, must be equitably 
tempered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
 Nonetheless, the Court deems it appropriate to adjust the interest 
rates imposed by the CA in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence. 
</p><p>
 Case law states that there are two (2) types of interest, namely, 
monetary interest and compensatory interest. Monetary interest is the 
compensation fixed by the parties for the use or forbearance of money. 
On the other hand, compensatory interest is that imposed by law or by 
the courts as penalty or indemnity for damages. Accordingly, the right 
to recover interest arises only either by virtue of a contract (monetary
 interest) or as damages for delay or failure to pay the principal loan 
on which the interest is demanded (compensatory interest).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> 
  </p><p>Anent monetary interest, the parties are free to 
stipulate 
their preferred rate. However, courts are allowed to equitably temper 
interest rates that are found to be excessive, iniquitous, 
unconscionable, and/or exorbitant, such as stipulated interest rates of 
three percent (3%) per month or higher. In such instances, it is well to
 clarify that only the unconscionable interest rate is nullified and 
deemed not written in the contract; whereas the parties' agreement on 
the payment of interest on the principal loan obligation subsists. It is
 as if the parties failed to specify the interest rate to be imposed on 
the principal amount, in which case <b><i><u>the legal
 rate of interest prevailing at the time the agreement was entered 
into</u></i></b>
 would have to be applied by the Court. This is because, according to 
jurisprudence, the legal rate of interest is the presumptive reasonable 
compensation for borrowed money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[27]</sup> Such monetary interest should be computed from 
default,<i> i.e</i>., from extrajudicial or judicial demand,
 until full payment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[28]</sup>  </p><p>
 In addition, the aforesaid monetary interest shall itself earn 
compensatory interest at the prevailing legal rates, pursuant to Article
 2212 of the Civil Code, which states that '[i]nterest due shall earn 
legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded, although the 
obligation may be silent upon this point.' To be sure, [the foregoing 
provision] contemplates the presence of stipulated or conventional 
interest, <i>i.e</i>., monetary interest, which has accrued 
when demand 
was judicially made." In contrast, Article 2212 of the Civil Code finds 
no application if there was no stipulated/monetary interest agreed upon 
by the parties which could further earn compensatory interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p> 
In this case, the courts <i>a quo</i>
 correctly found that petitioner voluntarily agreed to the payment of 
interest and late payment charges as stipulated in the credit card terms
 and conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[30]</sup> Notably, 
both impositions partook the nature of monetary interest as it was 
intended as compensation for the use or forbearance of money arising 
from petitioner's purchases on credit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[31]</sup>
 Since the stipulated rates were struck down for being unconscionable, 
the Court finds that a straight monetary interest at the prevailing rate
 of twelve percent (12%) per annum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[32]</sup> should instead be imposed on the principal 
obligation, reckoned from the date of default, <i>i.e.</i>,
 from extrajudicial demand on November 26, 2010, until full payment. 
Additionally, the accrued monetary interest itself shall earn 
compensatory interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from
 the date of judicial demand,<em> i.e</em>., the filing of 
the complaint
 on December 15, 2010 until June 30, 2013, and thereafter, at the rate 
of six percent (6%) per annum from July 1, 2013 until full payment. 
Finally, the award of attorney's fees in the amount of P50,000.00 shall 
also earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality 
of this Decision until full payment.
