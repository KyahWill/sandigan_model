(Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The foregoing rules were further refined by the Court in <i>Pilipinas Total Gas</i>, which resolved the question of: "In an administrative claim for tax credit or refund of creditable input VAT, from what point does the law allow the CIR to determine when it should decide an application for refund? Or stated differently: <i>Under present law, when should the submission of documents be deemed 'completed' for purposes of determining the running of the 120-day period?</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Confronted with this question, the Court then ruled that the reckoning point of the 120-day period would depend on the following circumstances:<br><blockquote>(<i>a</i>) If the taxing authority does not make any notice requesting for additional documents or if the taxpayer manifests that he no longer wishes to submit any additional documents, the 120-day period begins from the date the administrative claim was made as it would be assumed that at that point, the taxpayer had already submitted complete documents in support of its claim;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> or<br><br>(<i>b</i>) <u><b>If the taxing authority requests for additional documents, the 120-day period begins from the time the taxpayer submits the complete documents sufficient to support his claim.</b></u> In this scenario, <b>it is the taxpayer who ultimately determines when complete documents have been submitted for the purpose of commencing and continuing the running of the 120-day period</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote><b>Notably, there is no requirement in the Tax Code or in RMC No. 49-2003 that the taxing authority's request for additional documents should be made in a specific form. Stated differently, nowhere in the law does it require that the request for additional documents must <u>always and absolutely</u> be made in written form.</b> While written requests would be preferred because it would be easier for the BIR to keep track of the documents submitted by the taxpayer in response thereto, the law does not explicitly prohibit verbal requests for additional documents as long as they are duly made by authorized BIR officials.<br><br>To be sure, while the Court in <i>Pilipinas Total Gas</i> did state that "such notice by way of a written request is required by the CIR to be sent to [the taxpayer],"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the said statement was not intended to foist any judicial doctrine anent the request's required form. The seeming requirement that the request for additional documents must be "written" only appears in a singular sentence of the Court's entire Decision. In fact, the word "written" only appears twice in <i>Pilipinas Total Gas</i>, the pertinent portion of which is hereby reproduced as follows:<br><blockquote>Second, the CIR sent <b>no written notice</b> informing Total Gas that the documents were incomplete or required it to submit additional documents. <b>As stated above, such notice by way of a written request is required by the CIR to be sent to Total Gas.</b> Neither was there any decision made denying the administrative claim of Total Gas on the ground that it had failed to submit all the required documents. It was precisely the inaction of the BIR which prompted Total Gas to file the judicial claim. Thus, by failing to inform Total Gas of the need to submit any additional document, the BIR cannot now argue that the judicial claim should be dismissed because it failed to submit complete documents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote>In contrast, it must be pointed out that the initial portions of the Court's ruling in <i>Pilipinas Total Gas</i> did not even qualify that the request must be in written form. As held in the same case, what is "<b>essential</b>" is that there must be "<b>a request from the tax collection authority to produce the complete documents</b>" given to the taxpayer-claimant:<br><blockquote>Lest it be misunderstood, the benefit given to the taxpayer to determine when it should complete its submission of documents is not unbridled. Under RMC No. 49-2003, if in the course of the investigation and processing of the claim, additional documents are required for the proper determination of the legitimacy of the claim, the taxpayer-claimants shall submit such documents within thirty (30) days from request of the investigating/processing office. <b>Again, notice, by way of <u>a request from the tax collection authority to produce the complete documents</u> in these cases, is <u>essential</u>.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, the statement that "such notice by way of a written request is required by the CIR to be sent to [the taxpayer]" was only an innocuous statement of the Court which was not meant to create any doctrine on the request's required form. This is confirmed by the fact that in <i>Pilipinas Total Gas</i>, there was even no request - whether verbal or written - given by the BIR to the taxpayer.<br><br>In any event, <i>Pilipinas Total Gas</i> is not squarely applicable to the case at bar. To be sure, the core of the controversy in <i>Pilipinas Total Gas</i> only lies in the supposed prematurity of the taxpayer's judicial claim for refund, considering that the latter allegedly failed to submit complete documents in support thereof at the time the claim was filed; hence, the 120-day period for the BIR to decide the claim had not yet begun to run.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The Court held that the 120-day period should be reckoned from the time the taxpayer had deemed itself to have submitted the complete documents in support of its administrative claim, without prejudice to the BIR's request for additional documents which did not obtain in this case; thus, with the 120 days having lapsed therefrom, the taxpayer may then, within thirty (30) days, accordingly, file its judicial claim for refund, as was done by the taxpayer in <i>Pilipinas Total Gas</i>. To this end, the Court had summarized its disposition as follows:<br><blockquote>To summarize, for the just disposition of the subject controversy, the rule is that from the date an administrative claim for excess unutilized VAT is filed, a taxpayer has thirty (30) days within which to submit the documentary requirements sufficient to support his claim, unless given further extension by the CIR. Then, upon filing by the taxpayer of his complete documents to support his application, or expiration of the period given, the CIR has 120 days within which to decide the claim for tax credit or refund. Should the taxpayer, on the date of his filing, manifest that he no longer wishes to submit any other addition documents to complete his administrative claim, the 120-day period allowed to the CIR begins to run from the date of filing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>Unlike in this case, the Court in <i>Pilipinas Total Gas</i> was not confronted with the issue of whether or not requests for documents should be in any particular form, for the purpose of determining the reckoning point of the 120-day period. In fact, as earlier mentioned, in <i>Pilipinas Total Gas</i>, there was no request - whether verbal or written - given by the BIR to the taxpayer. Thus, in view of the foregoing, <i>Pilipinas Total Gas</i> is not the proper basis to construe that all subsequent verbal communications made by the BIR to Zuellig-PH (or any taxpayer for that matter) are insufficient for the purpose of determining the reckoning point of the 120-day period.<br><br>In this case, records show that Zuellig-PH duly complied with the BIR officials' written and verbal requests for additional documents through its letters dated July 5, 2011,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> May 8, 2012,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> July 25, 2012,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> December 6, 2012,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> September 11, 2013,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> and April 29, 2014,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> with the last letter indicating that it had "<u>already submitted the complete documents in support of [its] application for refund of excess and unutilized input VAT for the four (4) quarters of TY 2010 in the amount of Php39,931,971.21</u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Notably, <b>all of these verbal requests for additional documents and Zuellig-PH's corresponding submissions in response thereto were well-documented and all confirmed by the BIR</b>; hence, there is no danger of losing track of when to reckon the 120-day period. As held in <i>Pilipinas Total Gas</i>, it is the taxpayer who ultimately determines when complete documents have been submitted for the purpose of commencing and continuing the running of the 120-day period. <b>As herein applied, the 120-day period should therefore be reckoned from the April 29, 2014 letter of Zuellig-PH wherein it stated that it had already submitted the complete documents in support of its refund claim. In turn, the BIR had 120 days from such time (or until August 27, 2014) to act on Zuellig-PH's administrative claim for refund.</b> Since it was established that the BIR failed to act within such period, Zuellig­-PH had thirty (30) days, or until September 26, 2014, to file its judicial claim. <b>Thus, its Petition for Review was timely filed on September 25, 2014.</b><br><br>At this juncture, it is well to point out that it was the BIR's own officials who led Zuellig-PH to believe that the numerous verbal requests for documents they made were all regular and above-board, and that the taxpayer's compliance therewith would result in the timely processing of its administrative claim. Were it not for the BIR's own representations, then Zuellig-PH could have filed its judicial claim for refund sooner. Thus, Zuellig­-PH cannot be faulted for merely acting in accord with the representations of the BIR itself. Indeed, while the Court recognizes the well-entrenched principle that estoppel does not apply to the government, especially on matters of taxation (as taxes are the nation's lifeblood through which government agencies continue to operate and with which the State discharges its functions for the welfare of its constituents), this principle does not apply if it would work injustice against an innocent party,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> such as Zuellig-PH in this case. Hence, all things considered, the Court holds that the CTA erred in dismissing Zuellig-PH's judicial claim for refund. Since the CTA-Second Division had already conducted a trial on the merits but instead chose to dismiss Zuellig­-PH's claim on the aforementioned ground, the Court finds it proper to remand the case to it for a resolution on the merits with utmost dispatch.<br><br>As a final note, the Court clarifies that the above disquisition only finds application to those claims for refund made <u><b><i>prior to</i></b></u> June 11, 2014 (<i>i.e.</i>, the date that RMC No. 54-2014 was issued).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Under this new circular, <b>the taxpayer is now required to submit complete documents <u><i>upon its filing of an administrative claim for VAT refund/tax credit</i></u></b>, <u>as no other documents shall be accepted thereafter</u>. For this purpose, the taxpayer shall also execute a statement under oath attesting to the completeness of said documents which shall also be submitted upon such filing. Thus, under the auspices of RMC No. 54-2014, there is no more need to delineate between verbal or written requests for additional documents because the submission thereof is not anymore allowed. To reiterate, the prevailing rule now is that all complete documents are to be submitted upon the filing of the taxpayer's administrative claim for refund.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
