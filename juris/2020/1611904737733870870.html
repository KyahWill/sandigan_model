For instance, in Criminal Case No. 17-096-C,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the accused's Proposal to Plea Bargain filed on 16 July 2018 was denied in the Order dated 12 September 2018. However, in the ensuing Order dated 12 December 2018, it was stated that <i>"[t]here being a proposal for plea bargaining, reset this case to May 15, 2019 at 8:30 in the morning. ";</i><br><br></li><li> In drugs cases, the subject court deferred the resolution on a number of motions to plea bargain due to the conflict between the guidelines set forth in the Supreme Court Circular and the Department of Justice Memorandum until such time that the said conflict was resolved by the Supreme Court. The said motions remained unacted upon and unresolved for quite some time as of the date of the judicial audit;<br><br></li><li> The subject court, upon the filing of a Motion to Allow the Accused to Plea Bargain, directed the accused to submit to a drug dependency examination even before it resolved the pending motion. This practice was not in accord with the framework for plea bargaining in drugs cases since the presumption is that the requirement for the accused to undergo a drug dependency examination was directed after the favorable resolution of the said motion. Hence, in A. M. No. 18-03-16-SC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> under the Remarks column, it is provided that,<i> "[in] all instances, whether or not the maximum period of the penalty imposed is already served, drug dependency test shall be required. If the accused admits drug use, or denies it but is found positive after drug dependency test, he/she shall undergo treatment and rehabilitation for a period of not less than 6 months. Said period shall be credited to his/her penalty and the period of his after­ care and follow-up program is penalty is still unserved. ",</i> and<br><br></li><li> It should be noted that in the Minutes of the Hearing, the total duration of the hearings lasted for only two (2) hours at most, considering that the actual hearings usually started at past 10:00 a.m. and ended at 12:00 noon. However, in the orders setting the case for hearing, it was indicated that the hearing starts at 8:30 a.m. There was also no showing that hearings were conducted in the afternoon. This practice contradicted the mandate provided in A.M. No. 15-06-10-SC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><i>Seventh,</i> the judicial audit team pinpointed seventy-one (71) cases with court actions that may constitute a violation or violations of existing laws, the Rules of Court, circulars and other issuances of the Supreme Court.

He also attributed this to the lawyers and public prosecutors who come from Cebu, Bacolod, Dumaguete City and Canlaon City, whose travel time to the subject court takes three (3) hours. Corollarily, he stated that no hearings were conducted in the afternoon because that was when the public prosecutors, PAO lawyers and private lawyers had their hearings before the first-level courts, particularly in the MTCC of Canlaon City, MTCC of Guihulngan City and the MCTC of Vallehermoso-La Libertad in Vallehermoso, Negros Oriental; and<br><br></li><li> As for the seventy-one (71) cases with court actions that may constitute a violation or violations of existing laws, the Rules, circulars and other issuances of the Supreme Court, the corresponding comments of Judge Trinidad are enumerated under the column denominated as Comment/s of Judge Trinidad, as follows:</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td colspan="7"><div align="center"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div align="center"><strong>Criminal Cases</strong></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div align="center"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td></tr><tr><td width="16%"><strong>No.</strong></td><td width="16%"><strong>Case No.</strong></td><td width="17%"><strong>Title</strong></td><td width="17%"><div align="center"><strong>Date </strong><strong> Filed</strong></div></td><td width="17%"><strong>Court Action</strong></td><td width="17%"><strong>Observation(s)/ Finding(s)</strong></td><td width="17%"><div align="center"><strong>Comment/s of Judge </strong><strong> Trinidad</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="center">1-2</div></td><td>03-014-G and 03-015-G </td><td>Pp. vs. Honofre Cabrera </td><td><div align="center">2-24-03</div></td><td><p>Application for Bail was filed on 7-17-03. </p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Order dated 2- 9-06, submitting the said application for decision, and giving the prosecution 5 days from receipt to file its Formal Offer of Exhibits, and 5 days from receipt for the defense to file its Comment. </p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Prosecution's Formal Offer of Exhibits was filed on 2-28- 06, while the corresponding Comment thereon was submitted on 3- 2-06. </p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Order dated 2-27-06, granting the Petition for Bail.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>Court of Appeals Resolution dated 6-25-08 on C.A.

In Civil Case No. FC-11-03-G,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> the subject court issued an Order dated February 6, 2017, admitting the Formal Offer of Exhibits of petitioner, and submitting the instant case for decision. Hence, following the ninety (90)-day period provided by law to decide cases, the instant case should have been decided on or before May 7, 2017. The said decision was already overdue for more than two (2) years as of the date of the judicial audit, and yet no decision has been rendered by the subject court on the instant case to date.<br><br>As for Special Proceedings Case No. FC-14-03-G,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> the same was submitted for decision on November 27, 2017 per the subject court's Order of even date. Given the ninety (90)-day period to decide the instant case, the subject court should have decided the same not later than February 25, 2018. Hence, as of the date of the judicial audit, the said decision was already overdue for more than one (1) year, and to date, there is no showing that the said case has already been decided.<br><br>Thus, in its Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> dated June 8, 2020, addressed to the Chief Justice Diosdado M. Peralta, the OCA recommended that the subject judicial audit report be re-docketed as a regular administrative matter, and retired Presiding Judge Mario O. Trinidad be found guilty of gross ignorance of the law or procedure, undue delay in rendering decisions and in resolving pending incidents already submitted for resolution, and simple misconduct, and be meted the penalty of fine in the amount of one million pesos (P1,000,000.00), to be deducted from the proceeds of his retirement benefits.<br><br>The OCA pointed out that Judge Trinidad failed to give any justifiable reason for the delay. Among these reasons are the burgeoning caseload of the subject court, which he claims already reached almost 2,000 cases; his temporary detail to other courts sometime in 2008 due to an attempt on his life; the earthquake that struck Guihulngan City in 2012 resulting in the collapse of the Hall of Justice thereat and the consequential disarray of the case records which, he alleged, was attributed to the failure of the court staff to chronologically and orderly arrange them thereafter, thereby causing the affected cases to be overlooked; the cancelled hearings in 2014 after a grenade was lobbed at his house, and the escalating encounters between the New People's Army and the Philippine National Police, resulting in the rampant killings in the area that made litigants, their witnesses, and the counsels, including the public prosecutors, skip hearings for fear of their lives, necessitating the resetting of the scheduled hearings.<br><br>The OCA further stressed that these events that allegedly caused the delay would not hold water as two (2) cases which decisions were already overdue were only submitted for decision on February 6, 2017 and November 27, 2017, respectively. However, the records of the Office of the Court Administrator show that he was detailed to other courts as early as 2008,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> then in 2011,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> in 2012<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> and up until 2013<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> only. As for the incident where a grenade was thrown at his house, this happened in 2014, and the resulting cancellation of court proceedings was only for a few days.<br><br>As to his assertion that hearings were also cancelled in 2017 because of the absence of the parties and counsels due to the altercation between the New People's Army and the Philippine National Police, still this will not justify the delay because by this time, the cases were already submitted for decision, hence, the hearings were already terminated. Clearly, these events which took place prior to the submission of the subject cases for decision, could not have possibly hindered him from timely rendering the said decisions.<br><br><center><b>RULING</b></center><br><br>After a perusal of the records, the Court concurs with the findings and recommendations of the OCA.<br><br>The foregoing are undisputed facts as they are based court records. The irregularities speak for themselves and require no in-depth discussion. In effect, the evidence against Judge Trinidad, speaks of his infractions as to justify the application of the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur.</i><br><br>This is not the first time that the principle has been applied in administrative cases. In a number of cases, the Court applies the res ipsa loquitor principle in removing judicial officers and personnel from office. As can be gathered from the cases decided in this jurisdiction, res ipsa loquitor has been defined as the "the thing speaks for itself and "the fact speaks for itself."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> It is even asserted that there is no more need for any further investigation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br><i>On the charge of Undue Delay in Rendering Decisions<br>and Resolutions of Pending Incidents,<br>and Gross Inefficiency.</i><br><br>The Constitution expressly provides that all lower courts should decide or resolve cases or matters within three months from the date of submission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Section 5, Canon 6 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> likewise provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 5. Judges shall perform all judicial duties, including the delivery of reserved decisions, efficiently, fairly, and with reasonable promptness.</blockquote>Accordingly, this Court has laid down certain guidelines to ensure the compliance with this mandate. More particularly, Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 13-87<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> provides:<br><blockquote>3. Judges shall observe scrupulously the periods prescribed by Article VIII, Section 15 of the Constitution for the adjudication and resolution of all cases or matters submitted in their courts.</blockquote>Thus, all cases or matters must be decided or resolved within twelve months from date of submission by all lower collegiate courts while all other lower courts are given a period of three months to do so.<br><blockquote>Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 1-88<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> further states:<br><br>6.1 All Presiding Judges must endeavor to act promptly on all motions and interlocutory matters pending before their courts.</blockquote>Given the foregoing rules, the Court cannot overstress its policy on prompt disposition or resolution of cases. Delay in the disposition of cases is a major culprit in the erosion of public faith and confidence in the judicial system, as judges have the sworn duty to administer justice without undue delay. Thus, judges have been constantly reminded to strictly adhere to the rule on the speedy disposition of cases and observe the periods prescribed by the Constitution for deciding cases, which is three months from the filing of the last pleading, brief or memorandum for lower courts. To further impress upon judges such mandate, the Court has issued guidelines (Administrative Circular No. 3-99 dated January 15, 1999) that would ensure the speedy disposition of cases and has therein reminded judges to scrupulously observe the periods prescribed in the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, we have considered the justifications and explanations proffered by Judge Trinidad, however, while they may be recognized as true and reasonable, they are not sufficient to exonerate him from liability. Indeed, as the OCA noted, Judge Trinidad's explanations cannot exculpate him from his administrative liability for undue delay in deciding the two (2) cases and in resolving the pending incidents for resolution in forty-six (46) cases. The inordinate delay was not just in terms of days or months, but delay in terms of years. Aside from the said undecided cases and unresolved incidents, there were, as of the date of the judicial audit, eighty-four (84) pending incidents that remained to be resolved;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> forty-one (41) cases which were considered as dormant, there being no further action and/or further setting thereon;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> and the absence of hearings in some criminal cases for one (1) to two (2) years.<br><br>We are also aware of the heavy case load of trial courts, as well as the different circumstances or situations that judges may encounter during trial, thus, the Court has allowed reasonable extensions of time needed to decide cases, but such extensions must first be requested from the Court. Whenever a judge cannot decide a case promptly, all he has to do is to ask the Court for a reasonable extension of time to resolve it. However, there is no showing that Judge Trinidad requested for any extension of time within which to decide the said civil cases and the said pending incidents for resolution.

Thereafter, she jumped bail, prompting the subject court to issue the Order dated July 26, 2006, archiving the instant case for the reason that the accused had jumped bail. In his defense, Judge Trinidad stated that the reason for archiving the instant case was because <i>"the court wanted to afford accused full opportunity to be heard thus the subject court opted to archive the case pending arrest of the accused instead of having trial in absentia. "</i><br><br>However, under OCA Circular No. 89-2004l02 dated August 12, 2004, a case may only be archived if the accused jumped bail before arraignment and she/he cannot be arrested by the bondsman. In the instant case, the accused was already arraigned prior to jumping bail, hence, Judge Trinidad should have conducted trial in <i>absentia,</i> in accordance with Section 14(2), Article III of the 1987 Constitution, which provides that,<i> "after arraignment, trial may proceed notwithstanding the absence of the accused provided that he has been duly notified and his failure to appear is unjustifiable. " </i>As a consequence thereof, the instant case was dormant for five (5) years following the archiving, to the prejudice of the State and the offended party.<br><br>Also, in Civil Case No. FC-17-04-C,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> for Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Marriage, the Return on the Summons dated October 10, 2017 provided that <i>"the respondent is now in Manila with no address given for almost two (2) years now. "</i> Petitioner filed an Ex-Parte Motion to Serve Summons Either by Substituted Service or by Publication on April 16, 2018, which Judge Trinidad granted in the Order dated May 30, 2018, stating that <i>"the Sheriff is hereby directed to serve the Summons thru substituted service, should the same be futile, let the Summons and petition and the Order be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Province of Negros Oriental and its component cities once a week for 3 consecutive weeks. "</i> The publication of the Summons, Petition and the said Order appeared in the <i>Dumaguete Star Informer</i> on July 22 and 29, and on August 5, 2018.<br><br>The audit report showed that the same procedure was repeated in Civil Case No. FC-18-02-C,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> for Annulment of Marriage, where the Return on the Summons, which was submitted on April 25, 2018, stated that it was unserved. since respondent no longer resided in their ancestral home for almost three (3) years, and that she has been living in Manila where she works as a lady guard. Petitioner filed a Motion for Leave to Serve Summons with a Copy of the Petition by way of Publication on May 11, 2018. Accordingly, Judge Trinidad issued the Order dated June 4, 2018, directing the petitioner to publish a copy of the Petition and the Order in a newspaper of general circulation in the Province of Negros Oriental and its component cities once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks. The same were published on July 29, August 5 and August 12, 2018 in the <i>Dumaguete Star Informer.</i><br><br>Again, Judge Trinidad justified the said orders by elucidating that <i>"the Rule provides that when the whereabouts of respondent is unknown as in this case, service may be effected upon him by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in such place as the court may order. "</i> However, the provision relied upon by Judge Trinidad, which pertains to extraterritorial service under Section 15,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> Rule 14 of the Rules of Court, is misplaced since the subject cases involved nullity and annulment of marriages, respectively. As such, the applicable provision is that provided under Section 6(1) of A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC, which emphatically states that <i>"[w]here the respondent cannot be located at his given address or his whereabouts are unknown and cannot be ascertained by diligent inquiry, service of summons may, by leave of court, be effected upon him by publication once a week for two consecutive weeks <b>in a newspaper of general circulation in the Philippines and in such places as the court may order.</b> In addition, a copy of the summons shall be served on the respondent at his last known address by registered mail or any other means the court may deem sufficient. "</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Thus, the publication should not only be made in a newspaper of general circulation in such places as the court may order, but also in a newspaper of general circulation in the Philippines. More so, in the cases considering that the respective Returns on the Summons provided that both respondents are already residing in Manila.<br><br>Judge Trinidad likewise failed to direct the petitioners to comply with the additional requirement of serving summons on the respondents at their respective last known addresses by registered mail or by other means the subject court deemed sufficient.<br><br>Anent Civil Case No. FC-18-05-G,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> for Declaration of Nullity of Marriage, Judge Trinidad issued the Order dated July 18, 2019, directing the petitioner to amend the petition for being defective, there being no specific address of the respondent therein. The judicial audit team flagged the said order as improper since the appropriate action should have been to dismiss the instant case without prejudice, for failure to prove residency. Judge Trinidad explained that the instant case was not outrightly dismissed because <i>"[petitioner] has complied with the residency requirement, however, the court finds slight clerical error as to his specific address and it would be too harsh to dismiss the cases, thus the court allowed the petitioner to amend his petition. "</i><br><br>However, in the Supreme Court Resolution dated October 2, 2018 in A.M.

For these, Judge Trinidad explained that it has been the practice of his branch clerk of court to attach a warrant of arrest in every criminal case record although the accused were already arrested at the time of the filing of the Informations.<br><br>However, said practice does not conform with the explicit provision in Section 5 of Rule 112 of the Rules of Court, that <i>"[if] the [judge] finds probable cause, he shall issue a warrant of arrest, or a commitment order if the accused has already been arrested ... when the complaint or information was filed pursuant to Section 6 of this Rule.

However, on appeal to the Court of Appeals, the latter, in its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> dated June 25, 2008, directed the subject court to order the arrest and detention of the accused, and to cancel his bail. A copy of the said resolution was received by the subject court on July 10, 2008. Thereafter, the Petition for Review<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> filed by accused before the First Division of the Supreme Court was denied in the Resolution dated October 20, 2010, a copy of which was received by the subject court sometime in May 2011. Notwithstanding, records reveal that Judge Trinidad failed to comply with and implement the directive of the Court of Appeals. At the time of the judicial audit, the accused remained released on bail as there was no record that Judge Trinidad revoked his bail and issued a warrant for his arrest.<br><br>In Criminal Case Nos. FC-04-10-G and FC-04-042-G,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision dated July 11, 2011, remanding the instant cases to the subject court for the reception of the prosecution's evidence. A copy of the said decision was received by the subject court on March 1, 2012. However, the same was only acted upon by Judge Trinidad after more than six (6) years, when he issued the Order dated September 13, 2018, resetting the hearing of the instant cases on March 14, 2019. As of the date of the judicial audit, the case was still on the initial trial stage of the proceedings.<br><br>For his defense, Judge Trinidad again invoked the excuse of having a heavy caseload in the subject court and the disorderly management of the case records for not promptly acting on the cited directives of the appellate court.<br><br>Judging by the foregoing, the Court can only conclude that the actuations of Judge Trinidad were not only gross ignorance of the law, but also grave abuse of discretion as well as defiance to the lawful directives/orders of the appellate courts. Indeed, as OCA observed, Judge Trinidad repeatedly failed to apply even the very basic of laws, rules and procedures, which he cannot feign ignorance of, given his stature as a presiding judge of the second level court for fifteen (15) years.<br><br>No less than the Code of Judicial conduct mandates that a judge shall be faithful to the laws and maintain professional competence. Indeed, competence is a mark of a good judge. A judge must be acquainted with legal norms and precepts as well as with procedural rules. When a judge displays an utter lack of familiarity with the rules, he erodes the public's confidence in the competence of our courts. Such is gross ignorance of the law. One who accepts the exalted position of a judge owes the public and the court the duty to be proficient in the law. Unfamiliarity with the Rules of Court is a sign of incompetence. Basic rules of procedure must be at the palm of a judge's hands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br><br>Though not every judicial error bespeaks ignorance of the law or of the rules, and that, when committed in good faith, does not warrant administrative sanction, the rule applies only in cases within the parameters of tolerable misjudgment. When the law or the rule is so elementary, not to be aware of it or to act as if one does not know it constitutes gross ignorance of the law. One who accepts the exalted position of a judge owes the public and the court proficiency in the law, and the duty to maintain professional competence at all times. When a judge displays an utter lack of familiarity with the rules, he erodes the confidence of the public in the courts. A judge is expected to keep abreast of the developments and amendments thereto, as well as of prevailing jurisprudence. Ignorance of the law by a judge can easily be the mainspring of injustice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup><br><br>In the absence of fraud, dishonesty, or corruption, the acts of a judge in his judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action. However, the assailed judicial acts must not be in gross violation of clearly established law or procedure, which every judge must be familiar with. Every magistrate presiding over a court of law must have the basic rules at the palm of his hands and maintain professional competence at all times. Thus, Judge Trinidad's actuations cannot be considered as mere error of judgment that can be easily excused. Obstinate disregard of basic and established rule of law or procedure amounts to inexcusable abuse of authority and gross ignorance of the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><br><center><b>PENALTY</b></center><br>The administration of justice demands that those who don judicial robes be able to comply fully and faithfully with the task set before them.

This is the least that judges can do to sustain the trust and confidence which the public reposed on them and the institution they represent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the judicial audit revealed that there were many cases that were undecided notwithstanding the lapse of the 90-day reglementary period within which they should be disposed, apart from those that have remained dormant or unacted upon for several years.
