For reasons of preserving the public's faith in the Judiciary's capability to dispense impartial justice, the best option of a judge who made a prior voluntary inhibition is to continue the same.

Judge Omelio's failure to heed the guidelines provided in Section 8(a) of A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC amounts to a serious transgression of due process as the litigants (most especially respondents) were deprived of the benefits of a fair and neutral resolution of their case. Worse, Judge Omelio also violated the basic tenets of due process when he denied the Republic's Petition for Relief from Judgment without conducting a hearing; thereby denying the State an opportunity to raise its concerns or objections on the re-assumption of jurisdiction as provided in Section 6, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> Due to these serious jurisdictional transgressions, this Court considers him <b>absolutely devoid of authority</b> in taking action on and expeditiously denying the Republic's Petition for Relief from Judgment.

It could have ignored the prematurely-issued March 31, 2008 Entry of Judgment and, instead, filed a Motion for Reconsideration or new trial from the March 4, 2008 Decision or a notice of appeal before the lapse of April 11, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[200]</sup> </p><p> Nevertheless, this Court finds the attendant circumstances strongly compelling as to warrant the suspension of the applicable mandatory rules regarding strict compliance of reglementary periods and proper modes of review.

Since Judge Omelio's act — in giving due course to petitioner's <i>Urgent Motion for Execution</i> instead of dismissing it outright — appears to be in tolerance of Atty. Velasco's erroneous issuance of the March 31, 2008 Entry of Judgment, any likelihood that the OSG's Motion for Reconsideration or Notice of Appeal from the March 4, 2008 Decision might be given due course or granted is virtually <i>nil</i>.</p><p> Moreover, Judge Omelio's May 25, 2010 Order which directed the Davao City Engineer's Office to<b> issue</b> a <b>Fencing Permit</b> over the properties covered by the OCTs sought to be reconstituted, as well as the October 8, 2010 <b><i>Writ</i> of Demolition</b> for the clearing of structures erected on the properties covered by the same OCTs <b>while the <i>certiorari</i> proceedings before the CA were still pending</b>, conclusively show that judicial authority had been exercised in an <b><i>oppressive manner</i></b>. The situation should have called for the application of "judicial courtesy" on his part which is exercised by suspending a lower court's proceedings although there is no injunction or an order from a higher court as a matter of respect and for practical considerations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[203]</sup> And even though judicial courtesy remains the exception rather than the rule, it will apply as there is a <b>strong probability</b> that the issues before the higher court would be rendered <b>moot</b> and <b>moribund</b> as a result of the continuation of the proceedings in the lower court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup></p><p> Since a substantial number of actual occupants (of the lots covered by the OCTs sought to be reconstituted) had started to file their respective pleadings-in-intervention, the RTC through Judge Omelio should have exercised a considerable amount of prudence by refraining from performing or engaging in acts which are consistent with executing a final judgment. Issuing a Fencing Permit and a demolition <i>writ</i> for existing structures are the constitutive of final acts of execution which is almost certain to inflict an irreversible damage on the parties involved and frustrate whatever action that the CA may adopt to resolve the entire pending dispute. As such, Judge Omelio should have exercised due restraint in giving due course to petitioner's pleadings which practically sought for the execution of the RTC's March 4, 2008 Decision even without an injunctive <i>writ</i> issued by the CA. His insouciant attitude in continuing to conduct proceedings incidental to execution only added to the complexity of the entire dispute, annoyingly belabored all parties into participating in several unnecessary proceedings, and made the attendant conundrums considerably burdensome for higher courts to untangle.</p><p> Hence, under these oppressive circumstances, it is fair to conclude that the CA <b>correctly took cognizance</b> of respondents' <b>petitions for <i>certiorari</i></b> in spite of the Republic having lost its right to appeal. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>On nullifying the RTC's March 4, 2008 Decision through the issuance of a Writ of Certiorari</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <blockquote> <table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="6%"><div align="justify"><i>I</i>. </div></td> <td width="94%"><div align="justify"><i>The CA correctly nullified the RTC's March 4, 2008 Decision when it issued the subject Writ of Certiorari.</i></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>The doctrine of finality of judgment or immutability of judgment articulates that a decision which has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable; it may no longer be modified in any respect even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law, and whether it be made by the court that rendered it or by the Highest Court of the land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup> This principle is a matter of sound public policy, which rests upon the practical consideration that every litigation must come to an end.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup></p> <p> Nonetheless, the immutability of judgment doctrine admits of some exceptions which are: (a) the correction of clerical errors; (b) the so-called <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entries which cause no prejudice to any party; (c) void judgments; and (d) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup> Of these exceptions, the last couple of items in the enumeration (void judgments and supervening evident rendering the execution unjust and inequitable) <u>may not be summarily performed</u> by the court concerned because they are necessarily threshed out in another proceeding.</p><p> In a procedural context, a final and executory judgment may be set aside in one of the following: (a) petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38; (b) direct action to annul and enjoin the enforcement of the judgment;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup> and (c) direct action either by <i>certiorari</i> or by collateral attack against the challenged judgment which is void upon its face, or that the nullity of the judgment is apparent by virtue of its own recitals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup> This means that some exceptions to the immutability of judgment doctrine have been expanded to include the grounds of the foregoing remedies.

If Section 1, Rule 65 is to be followed in its literal sense, the CA's actions would be limited to <b>nullifying</b> (or <b>modifying</b>) the RTC's September 3, 2009 Order of denial and directing the <b><i>reinstatement</i></b> of the <b>proceedings</b> relative to the Republic's <b>Petition for Relief from Judgment</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[212]</sup> Doing so would only delay the resolution of the entire dispute leading to a circuitous and protracted litigation between all parties; thereby wasting not only their time and resources but also the Judiciary's.

Considering the aforementioned special circumstances, a reinstatement of the proceedings relative to the Petition for Relief from Judgment will only make the dispute between the contending parties protracted and circuitous. Fittingly, this Court also deems it proper that the issue regarding the March 4, 2008 Decision's jurisdictional validity be resolved now to avoid further delay in the disposition of this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup> Under the present circumstances and also by reason of the adequacy of available records, the CA was justified in wielding the powers of a <i>cert writ</i> when it: (1) exercised equity jurisdiction albeit unknowingly; and (2) resolved the issue on whether to grant or deny the Petition for Relief from Judgment as if it were filed before it.</p><p> Relatedly, this Court deems it best to clarify that the CA also did not err in unknowingly or subconsciously applying the concept of equity jurisdiction <b><i>even if</i></b> the <b>grounds</b> for a successful Petition for Relief from Judgment <b>were absent</b> in this case. Admittedly, the records bear no evidence that Atty. Velasco's act (of prematurely entering a judgment which had not yet become final) was a result of petitioner's acts, fraudulent or otherwise. In both Rules 38 and 47, the grounds referred to here are those <b>which have been committed by prevailing parties</b> — not those which have been committed by the court or its personnel because the same may be corrected by means of an <b>appeal</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup> This notwithstanding, equity jurisdiction may be exercised by the CA in a <i>certiorari</i> proceeding for it to nullify a judgment being assailed in a petition for relief because <b>serious allegations of lack or absence of jurisdiction were raised</b>. Failure to comply with mandatory jurisdictional requirements in a special proceedings case is one such instance.</p><p> Finally, as regards petitioner's assertion of the immutability of final judgments doctrine, this Court rejects the same as respondents raised serious allegations <b>affecting</b> the RTC's <b>authority</b> to take cognizance of the subject reconstitution case and power to render the March 4, 2008 Decision. In this instance, a re-examination as to the <b>jurisdictional validity</b> of the March 4, 2008 Decision cannot simply be barred or prevented by a simple invocation of the immutability doctrine. Once the allegations of absence of jurisdiction are proven by the party assailing it, it now becomes the burden of the other to prove presence of jurisdiction. Special proceedings cases are dependent on express statutory requirements regarding jurisdiction in order for said proceedings and judgments to be wholly valid. Thus, in the case of reconstitution of title, a petitioner has the burden to successfully substantiate with evidence all the statutorily-mandated jurisdictional requirements. </p><blockquote> <table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="6%"><div align="justify"><i>II.</i></div></td> <td width="94%"><div align="justify"><i>The CA correctly found the RTC to have exceeded its jurisdiction in granting the petition for reconstitution of title despite the failure of petitioner to comply with some jurisdictional requirements.</i></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Jurisdiction is the basic foundation of judicial proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[219]</sup> It is simply defined as the power and authority — conferred by the Constitution or statute — of a court to hear and decide a case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[220]</sup> Without jurisdiction, a judgment rendered by a court is null and void and may be attacked anytime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup> Indeed, a void judgment is no judgment at all — it can neither be the source of any right nor the creator of any obligation; all acts performed pursuant to it and all claims emanating from it have no legal effect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[222]</sup></p> <p> In adjudication, the concept of jurisdiction has several <b><i>aspects</i></b>, namely: (a) jurisdiction over the <b>subject matter</b>; (b) jurisdiction over the <b>parties</b>; (c) jurisdiction over the <b>issues</b> of the case; and (d) in cases involving property, jurisdiction over the <b><i>res</i></b> or the <b>thing</b> which is the subject of the litigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup> Additionally, a court must also acquire jurisdiction over the <b>remedy</b> in order for it to exercise its powers validly and with binding effect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup></p><p> First, jurisdiction over the subject matter is the power to hear and determine the general class to which the proceedings in question belong and is conferred by the sovereign authority which organizes the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup> Second, jurisdiction over the parties is the power of the courts to make decisions that are binding on them and is based on due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup> This is acquired through voluntary appearance, in the case of the plaintiff or petitioner, or through the coercive power of legal processes, in the case of the defendant or respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[227]</sup> Third, jurisdiction over the issues pertains to a tribunal's power and authority to decide over matters which are either disputed by the parties or simply under consideration. This aspect of jurisdiction is closely tied to jurisdiction over the remedy and over the subject matter which, in turn, is generally determined in the allegations of the initiatory pleading (complaint or petition) and not the result of proof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[228]</sup> However, unlike jurisdiction over the subject-matter, jurisdiction over the issues may be conferred by either express or implied consent of the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[229]</sup> Fourth, jurisdiction over the<em> res</em> pertains to the court's authority over the object or thing subject of the litigation as well as its power to bind the same with its judgment. Last, jurisdiction over the remedy pertains to authority of a tribunal to take cognizance and pass upon the propriety of petitioner or complainant's reliefs sought. The same aspect of jurisdiction is dependent on either the statute providing for a specific procedure for the recognition of a particular right (<i>i.e</i>. reconstitution of certificate of title, registration of title, <i>etc</i>.) or the procedure promulgated by this Court pursuant to its constitutional powers (<i>i.e</i>. <i>habeas corpus, quo warranto</i>, declaratory relief, <i>etc</i>.). </p><p> Pertinently, certain statutes confer jurisdiction, power, or authority while others provide for the <b>procedure</b> by which that power or authority is projected into judgment — the first deals with the powers of the court in the real and substantive sense while the other class with the procedure by which such powers are put into action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[230]</sup> As in this case, <b>special proceedings</b> are creatures of statutes (or constitutional provisions in the case of extraordinary <i>writs</i> like <i>habeas corpus</i>) that <b>do <i>both</i></b> — <b>confer jurisdiction</b> on specific courts <b>while providing for a specific procedure to be followed</b> in order for the resulting judgment to be valid.

This makes jurisdiction in special proceedings primarily <b>dependent</b> on petitioner's <b>strict compliance</b> with statutory requirements which fix the authority of the court to take cognizance of the case and pass a judgment thereon. Consequently, a petitioner's noncompliance with jurisdictional requirements in a special proceedings case removes a court's authority thereby rendering the whole proceedings void.</p><p> At this juncture, the issue that needs to be resolved is: Was petitioner able to comply with the jurisdictional requirements enumerated in R.A. No. 26? </p><p> This Court answers in the negative. </p><p> Reconstitution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[235]</sup> of title is a special proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[236]</sup> Being a special proceeding, a petition for reconstitution must allege and prove certain specific jurisdictional facts before a trial court can acquire jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[237]</sup> R.A. No. 26, as amended, is the special law which provides for a specific procedure for the reconstitution of Torrens certificates of title lost or destroyed; Sections 2 and 3 thereof provide how original certificates of title and transfer certificates of title shall be respectively reconstituted and from what specific sources successively enumerated therein such reconstitution shall be made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[238]</sup> It <i>confers jurisdiction</i> upon trial courts to hear and decide petitions for judicial reconstitution; however, before the court can properly act, assume and acquire jurisdiction or authority over the petition and grant the reconstitution prayed for, petitioner must observe certain special requirements and mode of procedure prescribed by the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[239]</sup> More importantly, substantial compliance with jurisdictional requirement is not enough because the acquisition of jurisdiction over a reconstitution case is hinged on a <b>strict compliance</b> with the requirements of the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[240]</sup></p><p> Conversely, noncompliance with <b><i>all</i></b> jurisdictional requirements in special proceedings (such as reconstitution of title) adversely affects the trial court's jurisdiction over the <i>subject matter</i> of the case and, in cases where a specific procedure is outlined by law, over the <i>remedy</i> pursued by petitioner. Failure to comply with any of the jurisdictional requirements for a petition for reconstitution renders the whole proceedings null and void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[241]</sup> Strict observance of this rule is vital to prevent parties from exploiting reconstitution proceedings as a quick but illegal way to obtain Torrens certificates of title over parcels of land which turn out to be already covered by existing titles.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[242]</sup> Comparatively, this Court cannot even take a lenient approach in resolving reconstitution cases because <b>liberal construction of the Rules does not apply to <i>substantive requirements</i> specifically enumerated by a statute</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[243]</sup> <b>especially so if <i>matters affecting jurisdiction</i> are involved</b>. In other words, the principle of liberality cannot be applied to statutory requirements as they are not technical rules of procedure which may be brushed aside by the courts to serve the higher reason of resolving the case on the merits. In special proceedings, the merits directly hinges on petitioner's compliance with statutory requirements proven in court to establish a status, right or particular fact. </p><p> Accordingly, in obtaining a new title in lieu of the lost or destroyed one, petitioner must be mindful of R.A. No. 26 which laid down procedures that must be <b>strictly followed</b> in view of the danger that reconstitution could be the source of anomalous titles or unscrupulously availed of as an easy substitute for original registration of title proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[244]</sup> Even in the absence of an opposition, a petition for reconstitution which does not strictly adhere to the requirements of the law will not be granted in the pretext that the same proceeding will not affect the ownership or possession of the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[245]</sup> Hence, it is the reason why this Court has held in numerous cases involving reconstitution of title that noncompliance with the prescribed procedure and requirements deprives the trial court of jurisdiction over the subject matter or nature of the case and, consequently, all its proceedings are rendered null and void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[246]</sup> </p><p> For the trial court <i>to acquire jurisdiction</i> over the petition for reconstitution, the <i>occupants</i> of the property <i>should be notified</i> of the petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[247]</sup> In other words, it is beyond cavil that the <b>requirement of actual notice</b> to the <b>occupants <i>and</i></b> the <b>owners</b> of the adjoining property under Sections 12 and 13 of R.A.

The presence of inhabited artificial and permanent structures erected on a particular land is an obvious indication of occupation or possession. To have such structures, inhabited by third persons, demolished through a court process is a clear act of recognition that the same land is indeed adversely occupied or possessed. Petitioner's act of seeking for the issuance of a <i>Writ</i> of Demolition is patently incongruous with the allegations in her petition for reconstitution of title that "there are no buildings or other structures of strong materials on the above-mentioned pieces of land which do not belong to [her]."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[252]</sup> Moreover, she also failed to adduce any proof that the subject lots were actually unoccupied <b>at the time she filed her petition</b> for reconstitution of title as the records bear that the TCTs in the name of the intervenors-respondents have already been issued by the Registry of Deeds. These observations can only mean that petitioner failed to prove the jurisdictional requirement of sending notices to actual occupants and registered owners of the land covered by the certificate of title sought to be reconstituted. Therefore, the proceedings before the RTC (as presided by Judge Omelio) which resulted in the grant of the petition for reconstitution of title is void for being tainted with grave abuse of discretion as a consequence of petitioner's failure to prove all the jurisdictional requirements set in R.A. No. 26.</p><p> Besides, the Court <em>En Banc</em>'s pronouncement here is in consonance with its <i>dictum</i> in <i>Peralta v. Judge Omelio (Peralta)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[253]</sup> — a portion of which pertains to an administrative complaint filed by Atty. Cruzabra against Judge Omelio involving the latter's March 4, 2008 Decision and proceeds from facts identical and intimately related to the case at hand — which reads: </p><blockquote> Cruzabra charges respondent with ignorance of law and procedure, misconduct, bias, partiality and oppression in granting Denila's petition for reconstitution despite the previous ruling of this Court in <i>Heirs of Don Constancio Guzman, Inc. v.

The court shall likewise cause a copy of the notice to be sent, by registered mail or otherwise, at the expense of the petitioner, to every person named therein whose address is known, at least thirty days prior to the date of hearing. Said notice shall state, among other things, the number of the lost or destroyed certificate of title, if known, the name of the registered owner, the names of the occupants or persons in possession of the property, the owners of the adjoining properties and all other interested parties, the location, area and boundaries of the property, and the date on which all persons having any interest therein must appear and file their claim or objections to the petition. The petitioner shall, at the hearing, submit proof of the publication, posting and service of the notice as directed by the court.</p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, the petition for reconstitution of the subject OCTs is based on Section 2(c), that is, on certified true copies of the said titles issued by a legal custodian from the LRA. However, <b>the amended petition and the notice of hearing failed to state the names and addresses of the occupants or persons in possession of the property and all persons who may have any interest in the property as required by Section 12</b>. There is also <b>no compliance with the required service of notice to the said occupants, possessors and all persons who may have any interest in the property</b>. </p> <p> Records reveal that Denila indeed <b>failed to disclose in her amended petition for reconstitution that there are occupants and possessors in the properties</b> covered by the subject OCTs. Third parties, including the City Government of Davao filed motions for intervention in CA-G.R. SP 03270-MIN and manifested before the CA Cagayan de Oro City that several structures and buildings, including a <i>barangay</i> hall, a police station and a major public highway would be affected by the order for the issuance of a fencing permit and writ of demolition issued by respondent. These occupants and possessors have not been notified of the reconstitution proceedings. The March 4, 2008 decision itself shows that no notice was sent to any occupant, possessor or person who may have an interest in the properties. </p> <p> The requirements prescribed by Sections 12 and 13 of R.A. No. 26 are mandatory and compliance with such requirements is jurisdictional. Notice of hearing of the petition for reconstitution of title must be served on the actual possessors of the property. Notice thereof by publication is insufficient. Jurisprudence is to the effect settled that in petitions for reconstitution of titles, actual owners and possessors of the land involved must be duly served with actual and personal notice of the petition. Compliance with the actual notice requirement is necessary for the trial court to acquire jurisdiction over the petition for reconstitution. If no notice of the date of hearing of a reconstitution case is served on a possessor or one having interest in the property involved, he is deprived of his day in court and the order of reconstitution is null and void. </p> <p> In <i>Subido v. Republic of the Philippines</i>, this Court ruled: </p> <blockquote> <p> As may be noted, Section 13 of R.A. No. 26 specifically enumerates the manner of notifying interested parties of the petition for reconstitution, namely: (a) publication in the Official Gazette; (b) posting on the main entrance of the provincial capitol building and of the municipal building of the municipality or city in which the land is situated; and (c) by registered mail or otherwise, to every person named in the notice. The notification process being mandatory, <b>noncompliance with publication and posting requirements would be fatal to the jurisdiction of the reconstituting trial court and invalidates the whole reconstitution proceedings</b>. So would failure to notify, in the manner specifically prescribed in said Section 13, interested persons of the initial hearing date. Contextually, Section 13 particularly requires that the notice of the hearing be sent to the property occupant or other persons interested, by registered mail or otherwise. The term "otherwise" could only contemplate a notifying mode other than publication, posting, or [through] the mail. That other mode could only refer to service of notice by hand or other similar mode of delivery. </p> </blockquote> <p> It cannot be over-emphasized that R.A. No. 26 specifically provides the <b>special requirements and procedures that must be followed before the court can properly act, assume and acquire jurisdiction over the petition and grant the reconstitution prayed for</b>. These <b>requirements</b>, as the Court has repeatedly declared, are <b>mandatory</b>. Publication of notice in the Official Gazette and the posting thereof in provincial capitol and city/municipal buildings would not be sufficient. The <b>service of the notice</b> of hearing to parties affected by the petition for reconstitution, notably <b>actual occupant/</b><strong>s</strong> of the land, either by registered mail or hand delivery <b>must also be made</b>. In the case at bar, the "<b>posting</b> of the <b>notice</b> at the place where TCT No. 95585 is situated" is not, as urged by petitioner, <b>tantamount to compliance</b> with the mandatory requirement that notice by registered mail or otherwise be <b>sent</b> to the person named in the notice. </p> <p> In view of what amounts to a <b>failure to properly notify parties affected by the petition for reconstitution</b> of the date of the initial hearing thereof, the appellate court correctly held that <b>the trial court indeed lacked jurisdiction to take cognizance of such petition</b>. And needless to stress, barring the application in appropriate cases of the <i>estoppel</i> principle, a judgment rendered by a court without jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case is void, ergo, without binding legal effect for any purpose. </p> <p> In <i>Ortigas &amp; Co. Ltd. Partnership v. Velasco</i>, we have held Judge Tirso Velasco's acts of proceeding with the reconstitution despite awareness of lack of compliance with the prerequisites for the acquisition of jurisdiction under R.A. No. 26, and disregarding adverse findings or evidence of high officials of LRA that militates against the reconstitution of titles, to be of serious character warranting his dismissal from the service. We also charged Judge Velasco with knowledge of this Court's pronouncement in <i>Alabang Development Corporation v. Valenzuela</i> and other precedents admonishing courts to exercise the "greatest caution" in entertaining petitions for reconstitution of allegedly lost certificates of title and taking judicial notice of innumerable litigations and controversies that have been spawned by the reckless and hasty grant of such reconstitution of allegedly lost or destroyed titles as well as of the numerous purchasers who have been victimized by forged or fake titles or whose areas simply expanded through table surveys with the cooperation of unscrupulous officials.</p> <p> Here, respondent's bad faith in disregarding the jurisdictional requirements in reconstitution proceedings is evident in his order for the issuance of a fencing permit and writ of demolition in favor of Denila. Respondent <b>should have been alerted by the presence of actual occupants and possessors when</b>, after the finality of the March 4, 2008 Decision which ordered the reconstitution of the subject OCTs, <b>Denila <u>moved for the issuance of a writ of demolition</u> for such belied her allegation in the amended petition that "[T]here are no buildings or other structures of strong materials on the above-mentioned pieces of land, which do not belong to the herein petitioner"</b> and the absence of any name and address of any occupant, possessor or person who may have an interest in the properties.</p> <p> With the <b>failure to serve actual notice on these occupants and possessors</b>, Branch 14 had <b><i>not acquired jurisdiction</i></b> over Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004, and therefore the March 4, 2008 <b>Decision rendered</b> by respondent is <b>null and void</b>. A <b>decision</b> of the court <b>without jurisdiction</b> is <b>null and void</b>; hence, it can never logically become final and executory. Such a judgment <b>may be attacked</b> directly or <b>collaterally</b>.</p> <p> But respondent's bad faith is most evident in his reversal of his inhibition in Sp. Proc. No. 7527-2004 to act upon the petition for relief from judgment. Respondent voluntarily inhibited himself after rendition of the decision, only to resume handling the case and immediately denied the said petition for relief despite the previous order of Judge Tanjili setting the petition for hearing, and completely ignoring the jurisdictional defects of the decision raised by the OSG and Cruzabra.</p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> x x x x </p><blockquote> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, Judge <b>George E. Omelio</b>, Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 14 Davao City is found <b>GUILTY</b> of <b><u>Gross Ignorance of the Law</u></b> and violation of Canon 3 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct and is hereby <b>DISMISSED FROM THE SERVICE</b>, with forfeiture of all his retirement benefits, except his accrued leave credits, and with perpetual disqualification for re-employment in any branch, agency or instrumentality of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations.<p> This Decision is immediately EXECUTORY.</p><p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[254]</sup> (emphases supplied; citations omitted) </p></blockquote> In this case, the afore-cited portion in <b><i>Peralta</i></b> clearly shows that Judge Omelio's March 4, 2008 Decision cannot be legally revived and reinstated. It is obvious that the very reason why Judge Omelio was dismissed from the judicial service by the Court <i>En Banc</i> was precisely because he was adjudged to be grossly ignorant of the law when he took cognizance of and eventually granted the subject petition for reconstitution of the subject certificates of title filed by petitioner <b>despite the lack of jurisdictional requirements</b>. Judge Omelio even failed to verify and cite a single evidence from the records which reasonably supports petitioner's factual allegations pertaining to the jurisdictional requirement of mailing notices to actual occupants or possessors of a property subject in a reconstitution case. Clearly, the RTC's grant of reconstitution favoring petitioner in its March 4, 2008 Decision was devoid of factual basis. This is due to the basic principle that courts cannot grant a relief without first ascertaining the evidence presented in support thereof because due process considerations require that judgments must conform to and be supported by the pleadings and evidence presented in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[255]</sup> Therefore, the RTC's March 4, 2008 Decision penned by Judge Omelio is beyond salvage. <blockquote> <table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="6%"><div align="justify"><i>III.</i> </div></td> <td width="94%"><div align="justify"><i>The RTC ignored the basic principles of res judicata in allowing the reconstitution of OCT Nos. 219, 337, 67 and 164</i>.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p><i>Res judicata</i> is defined as a matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup> Under this rule, a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies, in all later suits and on all points and matters determined in the previous suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup> To invoke <i>res judicata</i>, the elements that should be present are: (a) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (b) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (c) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (d) there must be as between the first and second action, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[258]</sup></p> <p> Corollarily, judgments and final orders constituting <i>res judicata</i> are categorized into different concepts which have distinctive effects as provided under Section 47 of Rule 39 as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 47. <i>Effect of judgments or final orders</i>.

Paragraph (a) of the foregoing rule is commonly known to speak of judgments <i>in rem</i>; paragraph (b) is said to refer to judgments<i> in personam</i>; and paragraph (c) is the concept understood in law as "conclusiveness of judgment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[259]</sup></p> <p> Traditionally, paragraphs (b) and (c) are both <i>in personam</i> proceedings technically pigeonholed in prior cases before this Court under the blanket of the <i>res judicata</i> proper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[260]</sup> Here, only two (2) concepts of <i>res judicata </i>were previously recognized — (a) bar by prior judgment" as enunciated in Section 47(b), Rule 39; and (b) "conclusiveness of judgment" as embodied in Section 47(c), Rule 39.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[261]</sup> However, the concept of <i>res judicata</i> <u>also embraces <i>in rem</i> proceedings embodied in paragraph (a)</u> because "a judgment or final order against a specific thing ... is <u><b>conclusive</b> upon the title to the thing</u> [or the <i>res</i>]."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[262]</sup> This means that a judgment is directed "against the thing" which, as a consequence, "binds the whole world" because persons dealing with such "thing" are bound by the disposition of the tribunal which ruled on its legal status.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup> As a consequence, <b>a final and executory judgment concluding an <i>in rem</i> proceeding becomes part of the legal attributes of the thing being litigated in which all persons dealing with it are bound to respect</b>.</p><p> Accordingly, since special proceedings pertain to a declaration of status, right or particular fact, judgments therein are said to be <i>in rem</i> as it binds the whole world. The reason for the all-encompassing reach of final<i> in rem</i> judgments is that <b>the "whole world" had been constructive parties </b>(with non-participants usually subjected to a prior order of general default) to the case the moment the jurisdictional requirement of publication was met by petitioner. Such is also the reason why <b>special proceedings</b> present a <b>justiciable controversy</b> as they treat the declaration of a thing's legal status as a claim of interest <b>against everyone</b>. Here, what is crucial is the due publication of such notice because it brings in the whole world as a party in the case and vests the court with jurisdiction to hear and decide it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup> In other words, an <i>in rem</i> proceeding is validated essentially through publication.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup></p><p> As applied in this case, this Court emphasizes that proceedings for judicial reconstitution of certificates of title are proceedings <i>in rem</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup> The object of such proceeding is to bar indifferently all who might be minded to make any objection against the right sought to be enforced, hence the judgment therein is binding theoretically upon the whole world.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[267]</sup> Here, it is required that the court must acquire jurisdiction over the <i>res</i> in order to render a valid judgment thereon — it is done either: (a) by seizure of the property under legal process, whereby it is brought into actual custody of the law; or (b) as a result of the institution of legal proceedings, in which the power of the court is recognized and made effective.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[268]</sup> In other words, the exercise of <i>in rem</i> jurisdiction depends on the court's exercise of exclusive custody and control over the <i>res</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[269]</sup> Consequently, this makes the requirement of acquiring jurisdiction over the person of petitioner in a subsequent reconstitution case even unnecessary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[270]</sup></p><p> More importantly, it is the compliance of jurisdictional requirements (such as the service of notice to all the actual occupants of the land covered by the certificate of title sought to be reconstituted) that vests the court with jurisdiction to validly take cognizance and rule on a reconstitution case. Adequately proving all factual allegations which are part of jurisdictional requirements with preponderant evidence is mandatory for the court to successfully acquire jurisdiction over the <i>res </i>and to render its own adjudicative power effective. Once jurisdiction is validly obtained by the court and the judgment in the reconstitution case becomes final, the findings therein can no longer be opened for review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[271]</sup> Thus, it follows that a person who is not a party to a previously settled reconstitution of title case cannot seek for the same remedy without violating the principle of <i>res judicata</i>. </p><p> In the case at hand, this Court had already ruled in the case of <i>Heirs of Guzman, Inc.</i> that OCT Nos. 219, 337, 67 and 164 in the name of Constancio and Isabel cannot be reconstituted because they have already been cancelled, transferred and registered in the name of other owners; one of them being Arroyo. Even if disposed by this Court through an unsigned resolution, the same ruling would still constitute an actual adjudication on the merits because the legal basis cited to support the conclusion on why there was an absence of reversible error committed in the challenged judgment signifies this Court's assent to the findings and conclusion of the lower court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[272]</sup> Though an unsigned resolution is neither reported nor doctrinal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[273]</sup> the judgment in this case is directed to the properties themselves and, thus, binds not only those who participated therein but also those who subsequently deal with the same properties involved. Obviously, the present case filed by petitioner seeking to have the certificates of same title reconstituted cannot legally prosper for the simple reason that she had already been prevented by the rule on <i>res judicata</i> from re-litigating the same matter. Therefore, Judge Omelio committed a fatal error amounting to grave abuse of discretion for ordering the reconstitution of OCT Nos. 219, 337, 67 and 164 in the name of Guzman and for disregarding the final and executory judgment regarding the legal status of these certificates of title. </p><blockquote> <table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="6%"><div align="justify"><i>IV</i>. </div></td> <td width="94%"><div align="justify"><i>Judge Omelio denied the Republic's Motion for Reconsideration in utter disregard of established jurisprudence</i>.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>The general rule is that the three (3)-day notice requirement in motions under Sections 4 and 5, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court is mandatory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[274]</sup> Nonetheless, when the adverse party had been afforded the opportunity to be heard, and has been indeed heard through the pleadings filed in opposition to the motion, the purpose behind the 3-day notice requirement is deemed realized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[275]</sup> In effect, the defect was cured for the adverse party was still notified of the existence of said pleading.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[276]</sup></p> <p> In perfunctorily denying the Republic's motion for reconsideration, Judge Omelio pointed out by citing <i>Col.

No such negative factual finding was made in the October 1, 2009 Order which denied the Republic's Motion for Reconsideration. Hence, for lack of adequate basis in ordering such denial, this Court finds that the same order is tainted with grave abuse of discretion.</p><p> <b><i>Propriety of the Intervention</i></b></p><p> Intervention is a remedy by which a third party, not originally impleaded in the proceedings, becomes a litigant therein for a certain purpose: to enable the third party to protect or preserve a right or interest that may be affected by those proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[279]</sup> However, it is not an absolute right for the statutory rules or conditions for the right of intervention must be shown.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[280]</sup> Accordingly, to allow intervention: (a) it must be shown that the movant has <b>legal interest </b>in the matter in litigation, or is otherwise qualified; and (b) consideration must be given as to whether the adjudication of the rights of the original parties may be delayed or prejudiced, or whether the intervenor’s rights may be protected in a <b>separate proceeding</b> or not — both requirements must concur, as the first is not more important than the second.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[281]</sup> To sum it up, the legal interest as qualifying factor must be of a direct and immediate character so that <b><i>the intervenor will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation of the judgment</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[282]</sup> Hence, in all cases, the allowance or disallowance of a Motion for Intervention rests on the sound discretion of the court after consideration of the appropriate circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[283]</sup> </p><p> Here, the previous discussions are clear that R.A. No. 26 requires petitioners in reconstitution of title cases to send notices to actual occupants of the land covered by certificates of title sought to be reconstituted. Since the City of Davao and the intervenors-private respondents are indeed actual occupants of different portions of lots covered by the subject certificates of title sought by petitioner to be reconstituted, they have a clear legal interest to protect. While reconstitution does not vest ownership because the only fact that has to be established its whether or not the original owner's duplicate copy of a certificate of title is still in existence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[284]</sup> it emboldens the person — whose name appears on the face of the certificate of title as the registered owner — to exercise acts of dominion over the land identified and described therein. Additionally, a registered owner also enjoys the benefit and comfort of not having to ward off any collateral attack on the certificate of title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[285]</sup> Such complication was confirmed by the fact that petitioner applied for and was issued with a <i>Writ</i> of Demolition as well as a favorable directive for the issuance of a Fencing Permit. This only bolsters all respondents' claim that their interests will not be protected in a separate proceeding. Demolition of permanent structures and perimeter fencing adversely affects the possessory rights of all occupants in an immensely onerous manner. It is an ample basis for a court handling a reconstitution of title case to implead the un-notified occupants who may be deprived of their undisturbed possession.</p><p> For these reasons, it now becomes clear that such <i>de jure</i> recognition of ownership is favorable to the registered owner because a reconstituted certificate of title has certain adverse implications against the possessory rights of actual occupants. As a consequence, these actual occupants are now forced to defend their possessory rights as they are likely to be considered as the intruders. Verily, a separate proceeding undertaken for the purpose of assailing the true ownership of the person whose name is registered on the face of the certificate of title is circuitous and only contributes to the clogging of court dockets. Hence, the CA did not commit a reversible error in allowing all respondents to intervene in the <i>certiorari</i> proceedings initiated by the Republic in seeking to have its Petition for Relief from Judgment granted. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Administrative Sanctions Against Erring Members of the Bar</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>This Court has been exacting in its demand for integrity and good moral character of members of the Bar for them to uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession at all times.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[286]</sup> Lawyers should set a good example in promoting obedience to the Constitution and the laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[287]</sup> This is because a lawyer who performs his duty with diligence and candor not only protects the interest of his client; he also serves the ends of justice, does honor to the bar, and helps maintain the respect of the community to the legal profession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[288]</sup> That is why the entrusted privilege to practice law carries with it correlative duties not only to the client but also to the court, to the bar, and to the public.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[289]</sup> To this end, all members of the bar are strictly required to at all times maintain the highest degree of public confidence in the fidelity, honesty, and integrity of their profession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[290]</sup> Indeed, the law is an exacting taskmaster.

Pangilinan, in the present petition for review, cited this Court's ruling in <i>Republic v. Marasigan, et al. (Marasigan)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[295]</sup> which the pertinent portions reproduced <i>in verbatim</i> as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 23 of P.D. No. 1529 is entitled <i>Notice of initial hearing, publication, etc</i>. and provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that: </p> <blockquote> <p> The public shall be given notice of initial hearing of the application for land registration by means of (1) publication; (2) mailing; and (3) posting. </p> </blockquote> <p> As regards publication, it specifically provides: </p> <blockquote> <p> Upon receipt of the order of the court setting the time for initial hearing, the Commissioner of Land Registration shall cause a notice of initial hearing to be published once in the Official Gazette and once in a newspaper of general circulation in the Philippines: <i>Provided, however</i>, that the publication in the Official Gazette shall be sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the court x x x</p> </blockquote> <p> <u>This proviso was never meant to dispense with the requirement of notice by <i>mailing</i> and by <i>posting</i></u>. What it simply means is that in so far as publication is concerned, there is sufficient compliance if the notice is published in the Official Gazette, although the law mandates that it be published "once in the Official Gazette and once in a newspaper of general circulation in the Philippines." However, publication in the latter alone would not suffice. This is to accord primacy to the official publication. </p> <p> <u>That such proviso was never meant to dispense with the other modes of giving notice, which remain mandatory and jurisdictional</u>, is obvious from Section 23 itself. If the intention of the law were otherwise, said section would not have stressed in detail the requirements of mailing of notices to all persons named in the petition who, per Section 15 of the Decree, include owners of adjoining properties, and occupants of the land. </p> <p> The above view of the Court of Appeals negates one of the principal purposes of the Decree, which is clearly expressed in its exordium, namely, to strengthen the Torrens System through safeguards to prevent anomalous titling of real property. It opens wide the doors to fraud and irregularities in land registration proceedings and in proceedings for the reconstitution of certificates of title. Judicial notice may be taken of the fact that only very few have access to or could read the Official Gazette, which comes out in few copies only per issue. If publication in the Official Gazette of the notice of hearing in both proceedings would be sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the court, owners of both unregistered and registered lands may someday painfully find out that others have certificates of title to their land because scheming parties had caused their registration, or secured reconstituted certificates of title thereto and sold the property to third parties. </p> <p> The belabored argument of respondent Court of Appeals that it would be unfair to impose upon the private respondent the duty to comply with the requirement of service of notice because it was not through her fault that the original copy of the Transfer Certificate of Title was lost is unacceptable since the law does not make any exception or exemptions; besides, it is, to say the least, a ludicrous proposition. <u>Equally <i><b>unacceptable</b></i> is the opinion of said Court that it was the <b>duty</b> of the <b>trial court</b> to <b>serve</b> the <b>required notices</b></u> and private respondent should not be prejudiced if it failed to do so. It suggests, quite unfortunately, and gives the wrong impression that mandatory requirements of notices may be dispensed with if the failure to comply with them is attributable to the court. It likewise negates the principles of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency which the Constitution directs public officials and employees to faithfully observe. We should stress here that lapses on the part of courts or their personnel cannot be made a reason or a justification for non-observance of laws. By the very nature of their functions, they should be the first to obey the laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[296]</sup> (emphases supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> In advocating for petitioner's cause, Atty. Pangilinan boldly claimed that this Court held that "[u]nder Sec[tion] 13 of R.A.

Such blatant act of misquoting jurisprudence is a clear badge of some desperate effort to mislead this Court into thinking that it was the RTC's and not petitioner's duty to notify actual occupants in a reconstitution of title case. It is the height of disrespect on the part of Atty. Pangilinan to insinuate that the RTC should have taken up petitioner's cudgels in complying with the jurisdictional requirements for the latter's petition for reconstitution to prosper even when the contrary statutory principle had already been clarified by jurisprudence. More so, her act of mangling the unequivocal statements in <b><i>Marasigan</i></b> is intellectually dishonest and is insulting to the intelligence of the Members of this Court. </p><p> Another important and fundamental tenet in legal ethics is that a lawyer owes fidelity to the cause of his or her client — but not at the expense of truth and the administration of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[298]</sup> As officers of the court tasked with aiding this court in its dispensation of justice,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[299]</sup> lawyers take an oath that they will not wittingly or willingly promote any groundless, false or unlawful suit, nor give aid or consent to the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[300]</sup> Unfounded suits only serve to disrupt rather than promote the orderly administration of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[301]</sup> Moreover, an appeal is not a matter of right but a statutory privilege.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[302]</sup> Being a mere privilege, all lawyers should put in mind that an appeal cannot be abusively utilized to support or advance utterly meritless causes.

Instead of disagreeing with petitioner's intransigent stance of pursing the reconstitution of these certificates of title, she allowed herself to be used as an instrument of disruption in the administration of justice. Arguing that <i>res judicata</i> does not apply for the flimsy reason that petitioner is a stranger to the case in <i>Heirs of Guzman, Inc</i>. despite the obvious fact that the same judgment involved the <b>status</b> and <b>nature</b> of the lands covered by OCT Nos. 219, 337, 67 and 164 even treads dangerously along the border of gross ignorance of the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[304]</sup> Atty.

Case No. 7527-2004, entitled PETITION FOR JUDICIAL RECONSTITUTION OF ORIGINAL and OWNER'S DUPLICATE OF ORIGINAL CERTIFICATE OF TITLE OF THE REGISTRY OF DEEDS FOR DAVAO CITY and THE INSCRIPTION OF THE TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION THERETO; HELEN P. DENILA, Petition copies of which were received by the counsel for the petitioner on March 5, 2008 and by the Register of Deeds for the City of Davao on March 10, 2008, has now become FINAL and EXECUTORY. </p> <p> This Certification is issued upon the request of the Petitioner. </p> <p>Davao City, Philippines, March 28, 2008. </p> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="45%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="55%"><div align="center">(signed) <br> ATTY.

Velasco which, in turn, became the basis of the April 23, 2008<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[322]</sup> Writ of Execution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[323]</sup> which he also issued pursuant to Judge Omelio's grant of petitioner's April 18, 2008 Urgent Motion for Execution. Undoubtedly, Atty. Velasco's March 28, 2008 Certification triggered the series of irregularities subsequently committed by Judge Omelio relative to the untimely and hastily conducted execution proceedings of the March 4, 2008 Decision. </p> <p> Atty. Velasco — being a member of the Bar employed by the Judiciary as Branch Clerk of Court — had been utterly remiss of his duty to be conversant with prevalent jurisprudence. The Court in <b><i>National Power Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission, et al.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[324]</sup> had already declared in an unequivocal manner that "copies of orders and decisions served on the deputized counsel, acting as agent or representative of the Solicitor General, <u>are not binding until they are actually received by the latter</u>." This means that the reglementary period to file an appeal or Motion for Reconsideration begins to run against the government only upon receipt of the judgment or final order by the OSG. For issuing a Certification attesting that the March 4, 2008 Decision had become final and executory, even without any information as to the OSG's actual receipt of such judgment, Atty. Velasco ignored very nature of the Solicitor General's unequivocal mandate for the government in legal proceedings — more particularly <b>in all land registration and related proceedings</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[325]</sup> Such thoughtless disregard of basic principles on service of judgments or final orders to the OSG amounts to gross ignorance of the law and is inconsistent with a Clerk of Court's duty to show competence, honesty and probity. It besmirches the Judiciary's reputation and erodes the people's faith in the justice system. </p><blockquote> <p> <b><i>III.</i></b> <b><i>Atty. Maria Theresa D. Biongan-Pescadera</i></b></p> </blockquote> <p> Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility states that "[a] lawyer shall uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and legal processes." By virtue of this Canon, lawyers should always keep in mind that, although upholding the Constitution and obeying the law is an obligation imposed on every citizen, a lawyer's responsibilities under Canon 1 mean more than just staying out of trouble with the law; as servants of the law and officers of the court, lawyers are required to be at the forefront of observing and maintaining the rule of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[326]</sup> Any act or omission that is contrary to, or prohibited or unauthorized by, or in defiance of, disobedient to, or disregards the law is included in the scope of "unlawful" conduct which, in turn, does not necessarily imply the element of criminality although the concept is broad enough to include such element.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[327]</sup> In the context of Canon 1, respect for the law encompasses faithful adherence to the legal processes. </p><p> Concomitantly, Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court includes the "willful disobedience of any lawful order of a superior court" as one of the grounds for disbarment or suspension from the practice of law. Lawyers are called upon to obey court orders and processes and respondents deference is underscored by the fact that willful disregard thereof will subject the lawyer not only to punishment for contempt but to disciplinary sanctions as well.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[328]</sup> Graver responsibility is imposed upon a lawyer than any other to uphold the integrity of the courts and to show respect to their processes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[329]</sup> Moreover, Section 3(b), Rule 71 of the same Rules makes "[disobedience of or resistance to a lawful <i>writ</i>, process, order, or judgment of a court" one of the grounds from indirect contempt. Since "contempt of court" has been defined as a willful disregard or disobedience of a public authority,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[330]</sup> even a defiance directed against a judgment of a superior court which has not yet attained finality and is pending for review before this Court is considered contemptuous.</p><p> Before proceeding to examine Atty. Bionang-Pescadera's official actions as Register of Deeds in relation to this case, this Court stresses that government lawyers in the discharge of their official tasks have more restrictions than lawyers in private practice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[331]</sup> Since public office is a public trust, the ethical conduct demanded upon lawyers in the government service is more exacting than the standards for those in private practice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[332]</sup> As such, government lawyers should be more sensitive to their professional obligations as their disreputable conduct is more likely to be magnified in the public eye.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[333]</sup></p><p> Generally speaking, a lawyer who holds a government office may not be disciplined as a member of the bar for misconduct in the discharge of his duties as a government official.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[334]</sup> However, if said misconduct as a government official also constitutes a violation of his oath as a lawyer, then he may be disciplined by this Court as a member of the Bar.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[335]</sup> </p><p> In this case, although the CA's July 25, 2012 Decision granting the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> (as well as the RTC's September 3, 2009 Order denying the petition for relief from judgment <i>and</i> the RTC's March 4, 2008 Decision granting the Petition for Reconstitution of Title) <b>had not yet become final</b> when the OCT Nos. 301 and 219 were re-issued, the fact still remains that Atty. Biongan-Pescadera <b>ignored a standing judgment of a superior court</b>. Performing an act contrary to a decision of a superior court, even if the same has not yet attained finality, is a clear act of contempt and defiance against duly-sanctioned legal processes. Worse, her act of re-issuing some of the presently disputed certificates of title only added to the factual complexity of this case making it more burdensome for the courts in related or derivative disputes to resolve. The least that Atty. Biongan-Pescadera could have done was to maintain the <i>status quo</i> and wait for the case to become final and executory (or ultimately settled by this Court) before performing any act which would drastically affect the rights and obligations of the parties. Additionally, as to OCT No. 219, Atty. Biongan-Pescadera also ignored this Court's ruling in <b><i>Heirs of Guzman, Inc.</i></b> which had long attained finality and has barred by <i>res judicata</i> any future litigation affecting the same certificate of title. </p><p> Rules establishing structured legal processes command respect, especially from lawyers from both the public and the private sectors, for they are not empty rituals but part and parcel of the justice system itself. Without deference to legal processes, the administration of justice will run haywire causing confusion and instability as to the rights and obligations of the parties in all stages of litigation. Hence, Atty. Biongan-Pescadera's utter indifference to established court processes and complete disregard of the basic principle of<i> res judicata</i> are inconsistent with a government lawyer's sworn duty to "obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and legal processes." </p><p align="center"> <b>Conclusion</b></p><p> In sum, this Court reiterates that noncompliance with <i>all</i> the statutorily-mandated jurisdictional requirements in a Petition for Reconstitution of Certificate of Title renders the consequential proceedings void. For the trial court's jurisdiction in a reconstitution of title case to be validated, it must be clearly shown that petitioner had substantiated all the jurisdictional requirements with preponderant evidence. Blatantly, petitioner failed to prove the jurisdictional fact that notices were effectively sent to all occupants of the lots covered by the certificates of title sought to be reconstituted. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing premises, this Court: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify"><b>DENIES</b> Helen P.

Moreover, judgments or orders become final and executory by operation of law — not by judicial declaration (<i>Philippine Savings Bank v. Papa</i>, 823 Phil. 725, 736 [2018]). The finality of a judgment becomes a fact <i>upon the lapse of the reglementary period</i> of appeal if no appeal is perfected, or no motion for reconsideration or new trial is filed (<i>Barrio Fiesta Restaurant v. Beronia</i>, 789 Phil. 520, 539 [2016]; citation omitted). Verily, the trial court need not even pronounce the finality of the order or judgment as the same becomes final by operation of law (<i>Franco-Cruz v. Court of Appeals</i>, 587 Phil. 307, 317 [2018]). In other words, an entry of judgment does not make the judgment so entered as final and executory when it is not so in truth because it <b>merely records</b> the <b>fact</b> that a judgment, order or resolution has become final and executory — it is <b>not</b> <i>the <b>operative act</b> that makes the judgment, order or resolution final and executory</i> (<i>Realty Sales Enterprises, Inc. v.
