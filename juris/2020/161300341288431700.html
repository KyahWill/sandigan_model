In its Comment/Opposition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated November 4, 2013, the OSG alleged that the present legislation shows a strong intent to regulate adoption by aliens.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> It contended that Executive Order No. (EO) 91<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> provides certain conditions before an alien may adopt Filipino citizens. Likewise, it argued that the Family Code provides limits on who are allowed to adopt Filipino citizens.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Moreover, it claimed that an adoption is only valid if made within the legal framework on adoption as enunciated in Republic Act No. (RA) 8043 known as the Inter-Country Adoption Act of 1995, and RA 8552 known as the Domestic Adoption Act of 1998. The OSG concluded that petitioner's adoption is not in accordance with the laws, and thus, should not be allowed.<br><br>On November 21, 2013, the RTC issued the assailed Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dismissing the petition for being contrary to law and public policy. The RTC was of the view that the judicial recognition sought would render nugatory the local laws on adoption. The dispositive portion of the RTC Order reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Motion for further Proceedings is hereby DENIED, for lack of merit. The instant petition is hereby DISMISSED, for being contrary to law and public policy.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which the RTC denied in its Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated April 23, 2014. The RTC was convinced that RA 8043 (Inter-Country Adoption Act of 1995) and RA 8552 (Domestic Adoption Act of 1998) govern all adoptions of Filipino citizens.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the RTC ruled that even assuming that the adoption of petitioner is valid under the Japanese law, Philippine courts are not automatically obliged to recognize its validity. The RTC stated that under Section 48, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, there must be a "judgment or final order of a tribunal of a foreign country." The RTC noted that the petition merely alleges the fact of registration of petitioner's adoption in the Family Register of Hayashi and fails to present any judgment or final order issued by a Japanese tribunal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioner, on pure questions of law, directly filed before the Court the present petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45.<br><br>On August 7, 2017, the Court issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> requiring the parties to submit their respective memoranda within 30 days from notice.<br><br>In his Memorandum,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> petitioner claimed that: (1) the National Statistics Office<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Memorandum Circular No. 2007-008<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated September 24, 2007 which establishes the guidelines for the registration in the civil registry of foreign judgments/orders, includes adoption in its coverage; (2) Rule 53 of Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 1993,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> issued by the Office of the Civil Registrar-General (OCRG), states that a decree of adoption issued by a foreign court is acceptable for registration in the Philippines and can be issued only in the Office of the Civil Registrar of Manila; (3) Rule 9 of Circular No. 90-2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated March 28, 1990, also issued by the OCRG, allows a decree of adoption issued by a foreign court to be accepted for registration in the Philippines; and (4) that the modem trend is to encourage adoption and that every reasonable intendment should be sustained to promote such objective.<br><br>On the other hand, the OSG in its Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> reiterated that: (1) petitioner's adoption is subject to the Philippine laws; (2) the Philippine laws manifest a strong legislative intent to regulate adoption; (3) an adoption is valid only if made within the framework enunciated in RA 8043 and RA 8552; (4) petitioner's adoption was not performed under RA 8043; and (5) the adoption was not made pursuant to RA 8552.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The present petition relies upon the following ground:<br><blockquote>THE RTC ERRED IN RULING THAT UNDER PHILIPPINE-JURISDICTION A JUDICIAL RECOGNITION OF A FOREIGN DECREE OF ADOPTION IS NOT ALLOWED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote><div align="center"><i>Our Ruling</i><br></div><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>The RTC erroneously ruled that a foreign judgment of adoption of a Filipino citizen cannot be judicially recognized based on the view that such recognition would render nugatory the Philippine laws on adoption. It bears to emphasize that there are two parties involved in an adoption process: the adopter and the adoptee. The RTC in this case failed to consider that Hayashi, the adopter, is a Japanese citizen.<br><br>Article 15 of the Civil Code states that "[<i>l</i>]<i>aws relating to family rights and duties, or to the status, condition and legal capacity of persons are binding upon citizens of the Philippines, even though living abroad</i>." Owing to this nationality principle, the Philippine laws on adoption are thus binding on petitioner. However, with respect to the case of Hayashi, who is a Japanese citizen, it bears stressing that the Philippine courts are: precluded from deciding on his "family rights and duties, or on [his] status, condition and legal capacity" concerning the foreign judgment to which he is a party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Thus, as to the foreign judgment of adoption obtained by Hayashi, if it is proven as a fact, the Philippine courts are limited to the determination of whether to extend its effect to petitioner, the Filipino party.<br><br>By definition, adoption is "the process of making a child, whether related or not to the adopter, possess in general, the rights accorded to a legitimate child."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It is a juridical act, a proceeding <i>in rem</i> which creates a relationship that is similar to that which results from legitimate paternity and filiation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The process of adoption therefore fixes a status, <i>viz.</i>, that of parent and child.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> More technically, it is an act by which relations of paternity and affiliation are recognized as legally existing between persons not so related by nature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Adoption has also been defined as the taking into one's family of the child of another as son or daughter and heir and conferring on it a title to the rights and privileges of such. The purpose of the proceeding for adoption is to effect this new status of relationship between the child and its adoptive parents, the change of name which frequently accompanies adoption being more an incident than the object of the proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Adoption creates a status that is closely assimilated to legitimate paternity and filiation with corresponding rights and duties that necessarily flow from it, including, but not necessarily limited to, the exercise of parental authority, use of surname of the adopter by the adopted, as well as support and successional rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Indeed, matters relating to adoption are subject to regulation by the State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In the Philippines, the general provisions on adoption are found in Articles 133 to 193, Title VII of EO 209, Series of 1987, entitled "The Family Code of the Philippines" (Family Code). Under the Family Code, not all persons are qualified to adopt. Articles 183 and 184 provide limitations, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Art. 183. A person of age and in possession of full civil capacity and legal rights may adopt, provided he is in a position to support and care for his children, legitimate or illegitimate, in keeping with the means of the family.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In addition, the adopter must be at least sixteen years older than the person to be adopted, unless the adopter is the parent by nature of the adopted, or is the spouse of the legitimate parent of the person to be adopted.<br><br>Art. 184. The following persons may not adopt:<br><br>(1) The guardian with respect to the ward prior to the approval of the final accounts rendered upon the termination of their guardianship relation;<br><br>(2) Any person who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude;<br><br>(3) An alien, except:<br><br>(a) A former Filipino citizen who seeks to adopt a relative by consanguinity;<br>(b) <i>One who seeks to adopt the legitimate child of his or her Filipino spouse</i>; or<br>(c) One who is married to a Filipino citizen and seeks to adopt jointly with his or her spouse a relative by consanguinity of the latter.<br><br>Aliens nut included in the foregoing exceptions may adopt Filipino children in accordance with the rules on inter-country adoptions as may be provided by law. (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>Based on Article 184 of the Family Code, Hayashi falls under exception (b) of item (3). He is a Japanese citizen married to Lorlie, a Filipino. Under the Philippine law, it is therefore valid and legal for Hayashi to adopt petitioner, the legitimate child of Lorlie. Further, the rules on inter-country adoptions of Filipino children as mentioned in the last paragraph of Article 184 do not apply to him.<br><br>Special laws on adoption have been passed by Congress subsequent to the promulgation of the Family Code. In 1995, RA 8043<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> was enacted to establish the rules governing inter-country adoptions of Filipino children. The Inter-Country Adoption Board (ICAB) was created to serve as the central authority in matters relating to inter-country adoptions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Meanwhile, in 1998, RA 8552<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> was passed to set out the rules and policies on domestic adoption.<br><br>As already mentioned, the rules on inter-country adoption are not applicable in the case of Hayashi pursuant to Article 184(3)(b) of the Family Code. Specifically, the provisions of RA 8043 do not apply to him. Besides, as provided in Section 8 thereof, "only a legally free child may be the subject of inter-country adoption." By definition, a "legally-free child" means a child who has been voluntarily or involuntarily committed to the Department of Social Welfare and Development, in accordance with the Child and Youth Welfare Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Petitioner is not a "legally-free child" within the contemplation of the law; hence, he may not be the subject of inter-country adoption.<br><br>On the other hand, the rules on domestic adoption under RA 8552 have the following pertinent provisions with respect to eligibility:<br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE III<br></center><br><center><i>Eligibility</i><br></center><br>SECTION 7. <i>Who May Adopt</i>. — The following may adopt:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Any Filipino citizen of legal age, in possession of full civil, capacity and legal rights, of good moral character, has not been convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude, emotionally and psychologically capable of caring for children, at least sixteen (16) years older than the adoptee, and who is in a position to support and care for his/her children in keeping with the means of the family.

However, the Court disagrees with the RTC's view that adoption decrees involving Filipino citizens obtained abroad cannot be judicially recognized in the Philippines for being contrary to law and public policy.<br><br>As emphasized by Associate Justice Edgardo L. Delos Santos (Justice Delos Santos), the availability of RA 8552 as a means to adopt petitioner should not automatically foreclose proceedings to recognize his adoption decree obtained under Japanese law. Justice Delos Santos reminds that the principle behind the recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment derives its force not only from our Rules of Court but from the fact that such act of recognition is considered part of what is considered as the "generally accepted principles of international law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> It is characterized as such because aside from the widespread practice among States accepting in principle the need for such recognition and enforcement, the procedure for recognition and enforcement is embodied in the rules of law, whether statutory or jurisprudential, in various foreign jurisdictions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>As already established, the adoption by an alien of the legitimate child of his/her Filipino spouse is valid and legal based on Article 184(3) (b) of the Family Code and Section 7(b)(i), Article III of RA 8552. Thus, contrary to the RTC's sweeping conclusion against foreign adoption decrees, the Court finds that the adoption of petitioner by Hayashi, if proven as a fact, can be judicially recognized in the Philippines. Justice Delos Santos aptly propounds that the rules on domestic adoption should not be pitted against the recognition of a foreign adoption decree; instead, the better course of action is to reconcile them and give effect to their respective purposes.<br><br>Judicial recognition of a foreign judgment is allowed under Section 48, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>SEC. 48. <i>Effect of Foreign Judgments or Final Orders</i>. — The effect of a judgment or final order of a tribunal of a foreign country, having jurisdiction to render the judgment or final order is as follows:<br><br>(a) In case of a judgment or final order upon a specific thing, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing; and<br><br><i>(b) In case of a judgment or final order against a person, the judgment or final order is presumptive evidence of a right as between the parties and their successors in interest by a subsequent title.</i><br><br>In either case, the judgment or final order may be repelled by evidence of a want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law or fact. (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>To emphasize, the rule states that the foreign judgment against a person is already "presumptive evidence of a right as between the parties." Upon judicial recognition of the foreign judgment, the right becomes conclusive and the judgment serves as the basis for the correction or cancellation of entry in the civil registry.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In <i>Mijares v. Hon. Rañada</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the Court extensively discussed the underlying principles for the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in the Philippine jurisdiction:<br><blockquote>There is no obligatory rule derived from treaties or conventions that requires the Philippines to recognize foreign judgments, or allow a procedure for the enforcement thereof. <i>However, generally accepted principles of international law, by virtue of the incorporation clause of the Constitution, form part of the laws of the land even if they do not derive from treaty obligations.</i> The classical formulation in international law sees those customary rules accepted as binding result from the combination two elements: the established, widespread, and consistent practice on the part of States; and a psychological element known as the <i>opinion juris sive necessitates</i> (opinion as to law or necessity). Implicit in the latter element is a belief that the practice in question is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it.<br><br><i>While the definite conceptual parameters of the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments have not been authoritatively established, the Court can assert with certainty that, such an undertaking is among those generally accepted principles of international law.</i> As earlier demonstrated, there is a widespread practice among states accepting in principle the need for such recognition and enforcement, albeit subject to limitations of varying degrees. The fact that there is no binding universal treaty governing the practice is not indicative of a widespread rejection of the principle, but only a disagreement as to the imposable specific rules governing the procedure for recognition and enforcement.<br><br>Aside from the widespread practice, it is indubitable that the procedure for recognition and.enforcement is embodied in the rules of law, whether statutory or jurisprudential, adopted in various foreign jurisdictions. <i>In the Philippines, this is evidenced primarily by Section 48, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court which has existed in its current form since the early 1900s. Certainly, the Philippine legal system has long ago accepted into its jurisprudence and procedural rules the viability of an action for enforcement of foreign judgment, as well as the requisites for such valid enforcement, as derived from internationally accepted doctrities</i>. Again, there may be distinctions as to the rules adopted by each, particular state, but they all prescind from the premise that there is a rule of law obliging states to allow for, however generally, the recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment. The bare principle, to our mind, has attained the status of <i>opinio juris</i> in international practice.<br><br>This is a significant proposition, as it acknowledges that the procedure and requisites outlined in Section 48, Rule 39 derive their efficacy not merely from the procedural rule, but by virtue of the incorporation clause of the Constitution. Rules of procedure are promulgated by the Supreme Court, and could very well be abrogated or revised by the high court itself. Yet the Supreme Court is obliged, as are all State Components, to obey the laws of the land, including generally accepted principles of international law which form part thereof, such as those ensuring the qualified recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments.<br><br><i>Thus, relative to the enforcement of foreign judgments in the Philippines, it emerges that there is a general right recognized within our body of laws, and affirmed by the Constitution, to seek recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, as well as a right to defend against such enforcement on the grounds of want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law or fact.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>It is an established international legal principle that final judgments of foreign courts of competent jurisdiction are reciprocally respected and rendered efficacious subject to certain conditions that vary in different countries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> "<i>In the recognition of foreign judgments, Philippine courts and incompetent to substitute their judgment on how a case was decided under foreign, law.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> They are limited to the question of whether to extend the effect of the foreign judgment in the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Thus, in a foreign judgment relating to the status of adoption involving a citizen of a foreign country, Philippine courts will only decide whether to extend its effect to the Filipino party.<br><br>For this purpose, Philippine courts will only determine: (1) whether the foreign judgment is contrary to an overriding public policy in the Philippines; and (2) whether any alleging party is able to prove an extrinsic ground to repel the foreign judgment, <i>i.e.</i>, want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law or fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Absent any inconsistency with public policy or adequate proof to repel the judgment, Philippine courts should, by default, recognize the foreign judgment as part of the comity of nations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>For Philippine courts to judicially recognize a foreign judgment relating to the status of an adoption where one of the parties is a citizen of a foreign country, the petitioner only needs to prove the foreign judgment as a fact under the Rules of Court.
