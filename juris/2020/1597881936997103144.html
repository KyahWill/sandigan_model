It also established fourteen (14) holding companies, one of which is APHI, for the sole purpose of owning and holding such shares, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote><center>PRIMARY PURPOSE<br></center><br>The primary purpose for which such Corporation is formed is:<br><br>To purchase, subscribe for, or otherwise acquire and own, hold, use, sell, assign, transfer, mortgage, pledge, exchange, or otherwise dispose of real and personal property of every kind and description, including shares of stock, voting trust certificates for shares of the capital stock, bonds, debentures, notes, evidences of indebtedness,and other securities, contracts, or obligations of any corporation or corporations, association or associations, domestic or foreign, and to pay therefor in whole or in part in cash or by exchanging therefor stocks, bonds, or other evidences of indebtedness or securities, contracts, or obligation, to receive, collect, and dispose of the interest, dividends and income arising from such property, and to possess and exercise in respect thereof, all the rights, powers and privileges of ownership, including all voting powers on any stocks so owned; and to do every act and thing covered generally by the denomination "holding corporation," and especially to direct the operations of other corporations through the ownership of stock therein, provided however that <u>the Corporation shall not act as an investment company or a securities broker and/or dealer nor exercise the functions of a trust corporation</u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (Underscore supplied)<br></blockquote>Over time, APHI received cash and stock dividends from its SMC preferred shares. These dividends were deposited in a trust account which earned interest from money market placements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In 1986, APHI's SMC shares were sequestered by the Presidential Commission on Good Government. Subsequently, cases were filed before this Court questioning the ownership of the CIIF, CIIF OMG, the fourteen (14) holding companies and the SMC shares held by them. One of these cases was G.R.

Pursuant to Section 69(f) of the 2005 Revenue Code of the City of Davao, the tax was assessed on the dividends and interests APID earned from its SMC preferred shares and money market placements, respectively. APHI paid the assessment under protest. Subsequently, it filed an administrative claim for refund or tax credit with the City Treasurer. Claiming that the City Treasurer failed to act on the protest, APHI filed a petition for review with the Regional Trial Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, by Decision dated January 24, 2012, this Court in G.R.

Randy Allied Ventures, Inc. (RAVI)</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court ordained that RAVI, a CIIF holding company like APHI, was exclusively established to own and hold SMC shares of stock. As such, it is not liable to pay local business taxes on the dividends earned from its SMC preferred shares as the same shares are government assets owned by the national government for the benefit of the coconut industry, thus:<br><blockquote>In this case, it is clear that RAVI is neither a bank nor other financial institution, <i>i.e.</i>, an NBFI. In order to be considered as an NBFI under the National Internal Revenue Code, banking laws, and pertinent regulations, the following must concur:<br><ol type="a"><li>The person or entity is authorized by the BSP to perform quasi­-banking functions;<br><br></li><li>The principal functions of said person or entity include the lending, investing or placement of funds or evidences of indebtedness or equity deposited to them, acquired by them, or otherwise coursed through them, either for their own account or for the account of others; and<br><br></li><li>The person or entity must perform any of the following functions on a regular and recurring, not on an isolated basis, to wit:<br><ol><br><li>Receive funds from one (1) group of persons, irrespective of number, through traditional deposits, or issuance of debt or equity securities; and make available/lend these funds to another person or entity, and in the process acquire debt or equity securities;<br><br></li><li>Use principally the funds received for acquiring various types of debt or equity securities;<br><br></li><li>Borrow against, or lend on, or buy or sell debt or equity securities.<br></li></ol></li></ol>As observed in the COCOFED case, RAVI is a CIIF holding company. The SMC preferred shares held by it are considered government assets owned by the National Government for the coconut industry. As held in the same case, these SMC shares as well as any resulting dividends or increments from said shares are owned by the National Government and shall be used only for the benefit of the coconut farmers and for the development of the coconut industry. Thus, RAVI's management of the dividends from the SMC preferred shares, including placing the same in a trust account yielding interest, is not tantamount to doing business whether as a bank or other financial institution, <i>i.e.</i>, an NBFI, but rather an activity that is essential to its nature as a CIIF holding company.<br></blockquote>Verily, therefore, CIIF holding companies, including APHI itself and the entire CIIF block of SMC shares, are public assets owned by the Republic of the Philippines. Consequently, dividends and any income from these shares are also owned by the Republic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> On this score, APHI cannot be considered as a non-bank financial intermediary since its investment and placement of funds are not done in a regular or recurring manner for the purpose of earning profit. Rather, its management of dividends from the SMC shares is only in furtherance of its purpose as a CIIF holding company for the benefit of the Republic.<br><br>All told, the City of Davao acted beyond its taxing authority when it imposed the questioned business tax on APHI.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
