				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">That the medical examination showed no laceration, erythema, and abrasion in the victim's vaginal orifice is immaterial. Accused-appellant's inability to maintain an erection firm enough for continuous penetration will not save him from punishment. The Court, in deciding this appeal, stresses the oft-stated doctrine that in rape cases the slightest penetration is sufficient.<br><br>This is an appeal from the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated May 6, 2016 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.

During his arraignment, he entered a plea of not guilty to the crime charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Trial ensued.<br><br>According to the prosecution, on January 22, 2011 at around 4:30 a.m., AAA (private complainant) was on her way home after watching over her sister-in-law who just gave birth in a clinic. While walking along Zone Mars, Suarez, Iligan City she noticed that someone was following her. It was the accused-appellant. She walked faster, but accused-appellant caught up with her and declared "hold-up." At gun point, accused-appellant asked for her jewelry and other belongings. Accused-appellant warned her not to shout as he would not hesitate to kill her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Private complainant told accused-appellant that she had no jewelry, but accused-appellant demanded for her cellphone, opened her bag, and inspected its contents. Accused-appellant took her cellphone worth P10,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Not satisfied with the cellphone, accused-appellant fondled private complainant's breast and genitalia, pulled her to the grassy part of the road, and ordered her to lie down. Private complainant obliged out of fear. As she was lying down, accused-appellant drew up her skirt and removed her panty. He then took off his pants and brief, placed his body on top of her, and started to caress her. He then tried to insert his penis into private complainant's vagina, but he failed as it was not fully erect. After trying and failing to penetrate private complainant's vagina, he gave up and put on his brief and trousers and instructed her to dress up. He again demanded for any jewelry from the private complainant. Private complainant told him again that she had none. When he sensed that she was telling the truth, he instructed her to pass from the right side of tne road and not to look back. Private complainant hurriedly left.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>When private complainant arrived home, she reported the incident to her brother and mother. They then proceeded to the Nonucan Police Station to report the incident. Afterwards, they went to the City Health Office to secure a medical certificate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Dr. Efleida Valdehueza (Dr. Valdehueza) conducted the medical examination of the private complainant at 8:15 a.m. of the same day and found no laceration, erythema, and abrasion in her vaginal orifice, but noted the presence of a grass stalk and two small seeds near her anus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In his defense, accused-appellant denied the charge of Robbery with Rape and made contradicting testimony with respect to his whereabouts on that fateful day. Initially, he damned to be working as security guard of Happibee Disco Bar (Happibee, on January 22, 2011, then later admitted that he was jobless at that time and was staying in their house the whole day.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Defense witnesses Vanessa Grace Nadoza and Ramil Pol testified that they fetched accused-appellant, together with Michelle Nadoza who is accused-appellant's common law wife, from Happibee at 3:00 a.m. on January 22, 2011. They were with accused-appellant until they reached his house where they ate and later on slept. Michael Ferolino (Michael), on his part, testified that on February 1, 2011, at the Suarez <i>Barangay</i> Hall, he heard private complainant saying that accused-appellant was not the culprit, as her assailant has a tattoo in his body. This was specifically denied by private complainant when she was presented as a hostile witness. On the other hand, Police Officer II Carmelo Daleon (PO2 Daleon) testified that private complainant told him that accused-appellant was her assailant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated May 15, 2014, the RTC disposed- of as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, all told, and in view of the evidence herein adduced, this Court renders judgment in the following manner to wit:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">a)</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">Convicting the accused with the offense of Robbery with Attempted rape and hereby sentences him to suffer an imprisonment of reclusion temporal ranging from 14 years, 8 months and 1 day as minimum to 17 years and 4 months as maximum.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">b) </div></td><td><div align="justify">To indemnify the offended party the sum of P10,000.00 representing the cost of the cellphone that was taken from her;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">c) </div></td><td><div align="justify">No damages of any kind are being awarded for lack of proof.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">d) </div></td><td><div align="justify">The period of accused's detention in jail is fully credited in the computation of his sentence.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>On appeal, the CA, in its assailed Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated May 6, 2016, upheld accused-appellant's conviction with modification, to wit:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appeal is DENIED.

At that moment, accused-appellant asked private complainant for jewelry and other belongings. He searched private complainant's bag and took her cellphone at gun point. Clearly, the first element, that the taking is committed with violence and intimidation, and the second element, that the property taken belongs to another, are present in this case. As to the third element, <i>animus lucrandi</i> or intent to gain is presumed from the unlawful taking of private complainant's cellphone.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> <i>Acta exteriora indicant interiora secreta</i>—a man's action is a reflection of his intention.<br><br>Thus, the first three elements of the crime were clearly established.<br><br>Anent the fourth element, it was established that on the occasion of the robbery, the private complainant was ordered by accused-appellant, at gun point,, to lie down and out of fear she obliged. Accused-appellant drew up her skirt and removed her panties. Soon after, accused-appellant started caressing private complainant's private parts. He then positioned himself on top of the private complainant and began pumping his body to satisfy his lust.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It was also established, based from the testimony of Dr. Valdehueza who physically examined private complainant's genital organ that while there was no laceration or bleeding on the hymen, she however noted the presence of a grass stalk and two small seeds in the perianal area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In this case, both the RTC and CA found that on the occasion of the robbery, rape was committed. However, their legal conclusions differed as to the stage of execution.<br><br>The RTC held that the crime committed was not consummated, but only attempted rape, since the accused-appellant's penis merely touched private complainant's genitalia due to his failure to have an erection.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> However, the CA ruled that the crime was consummated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with the CA.<br><br>Article 6 of the RPC defines the stages of a felony in this wise:<br><blockquote>ART. 6. <i>Consummated, frustrated, and attempted felonies</i>. — Consummated felonies as well as those which are frustrated and attempted, are punishable.<br><br><b>A felony is consummated when all the elements necessary for its execution and accomplishment are present</b>; and it is frustrated when the offender performs all the acts of execution which would produce the felony as a consequence but which, nevertheless, do not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the perpetrator.<br><br><b>There is an attempt when the offender commences the commission of a felony directly by over acts, and does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony by reason of some cause or accident other than this own spontaneous desistance.</b> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>It is well-settled that the crime of rape is deemed consummated even when the man's penis merely enters the labia or lips of the female organ or, as once so said in a case, by the "mere touching of the external genitalia by a penis capable of consummating the sexual act."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> That the slightest penetration of the male organ or even its slightest contact with the outer lip or the labia majora of the vagina already consummates the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Thus, mere knocking of accused-appellant's penis at the door of the pudenda, regardless of the extent of erection, is sufficient to constitute the crime of rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Parenthetically, applying the above-mentioned principle, the slightest contact of the penis with even just the outer lip of the vagina consummates the crime of rape. Here, accused-appellant committed rape through sexual intercourse when he tried to insert his penis into private complainant's vagina though it merely touched her genitals as his penis was not fully erect.<br><br>A perusal of private complainant's testimony shows that she felt accused-appellant's penis touch her labia majora, to wit:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><em>(Atty.

"Carnal knowledge," unlike its ordinary' connotation of sexual intercourse, does not necessarily require that the vagina be penetrated or that the hymen be ruptured.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> A complete or total penetration of the private organ is not necessary to consummate the crime of rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The slightest penetration is sufficient.<br><br>As long as the attempt to insert the penis results in contact with the lips of the vagina, even without rupture or laceration of the hymen, the rape is consummated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> This is based from the physical fact that the labias are physically situated beneath the mons pubis or the vaginal surface, such that for the penis to touch either of them is to attain some degree of penetration beneath the surface of the female genitalia.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Hence, the CA correctly convicted accused-appellant of the crime of Robbery with Rape.<br><br>In line with the recent jurisprudence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the award of damages should be P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages.
