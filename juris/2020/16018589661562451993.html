According to the Manila trial court, Winston Brian and Christopher Troy 's resort to Rule 108 was "appropriate"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> considering that the rule not only allows the change of clerical but also of substantial errors such as nationality as entered in the civil register.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Since Winston Brian and Christopher Troy complied with the jurisdictional requirements under Rule 108 and have proven that they are the legitimate children of Lao Kian Ben and Chia Kong Liong—former Chinese nationals who became naturalized Filipinos while Winston Brian and Christopher Troy were still minors—the change in their parents' nationality as entered in their Certificate of Live Birth was, therefore, in order. The dispositive portion of the January 2, 2013 Decision read: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, the amended petition is hereby GRANTED. The Local Civil Registrar of Manila is hereby directed to correct/change the entries in the Certificate[s] of Live Birth of Winston Brian Chia Lao and Christopher Troy Chia Lao relating to the nationality of their parents, Ben Kian Lao (Kian Ben Lim Lao) and Chia Kong Liong (Kong Liong Ang Chia) from "Chinese" to "Filipino".</p> <p> The Local Civil Registrar of Manila is further directed to annotate this Decision in said certificates of live birth and to transmit and make known to the National Statistics Office the corrected birth records of Winston Brian Chia Lao and Christopher Troy Chia Lao. </p> <p> The Decision shall form part of the records of birth of Winston Brian Chia Lao and Christopher Troy Chia Lao. </p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> For his part, Jon Nicholas filed his Petition, which was later amended,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> to correct the entry in his Certificate of Live Birth relating to his parents' nationality before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City (Quezon City trial court). Like his brothers, Winston Brian and Christopher Troy, Jon Nicholas argued that the grant of Philippine citizenship to his parents should result in a change in their nationality as entered in his Certificate of Live Birth.</p><p> In the Order dated May 30, 2011, the Quezon City trial court set the case for hearing on September 23, 2011 to establish jurisdictional facts. The May 30, 2011 Order was published in a newspaper of general circulation once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks. Copies of the Petition were also served on the Office of the Solicitor General, Local Civil Registrar of Quezon City, the Quezon City Prosecutor's Office, and the National Statistics Office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> During the initial hearing on September 23, 2011, Jon Nicholas presented documentary evidence to prove compliance with jurisdictional facts. In particular, he established the publication of the May 30, 2011 Order in Newsline Newspaper, a newspaper of general circulation, in its June 30 to July 6, 2011, July 7 to July 13, 2011, and July 14 to July 20, 2011 issues.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Copies of the Amended Petition were likewise served to the Quezon City Prosecutor's Office, the National Statistics Office, the Office of the Solicitor General, and the Local Civil Registrar of Quezon City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> Finding that Jon Nicholas complied with the jurisdictional requirements under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court and after his presentation of evidence, the Quezon City trial court granted his Petition.

The Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari</em> against Winston Brian and Christopher Troy was filed on March 4, 2013 and was docketed as G.R. No. 205218. On the other hand, the Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari</em> against Jon Nicholas was filed on June 25, 2013 and was docketed as G.R. No. 207075.</p> <p> On motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> by the Republic, the cases were consolidated through the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated September 30, 2013. Comments<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and Replies<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> were subsequently filed.</p> <p> The common issue put forth in the Petitions is whether or not the correction of entries in respondents' respective certificates of live birth, pertaining to the citizenship of their parents from "Chinese" to "Filipino," is proper in the absence of an appropriate proceeding to determine whether they are qualified to acquire Filipino citizenship. In the mind of this Court, this can be further divided into two distinct issues: </p> <p>First, whether or not the nationality of the parents of Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas Chia Lao, as entered in their respective Certificates of Live Birth, may be changed to "Filipino" considering that, at the time of their birth, their parents were still Chinese nationals. </p> <p>Second, whether or not an appropriate proceeding before the Special Committee on Naturalization to determine whether an individual is qualified to acquire Filipino citizenship is required before the nationality of a person's parents, as entered in the birth ce1iificate, may be changed. </p> <p>Petitioner Republic maintains that there was no error to correct in respondents' Certificate of Live Birth. Citizenship, according to the Republic, is determined at the time of one's birth; on the day respondents Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas were born, their parents were still Chinese nationals. Since respondents were born to natural-born Chinese citizens, respondents are necessarily natural-born Chinese, and the nationality of their parents was correctly entered as "Chinese" in their respective Certificates of Live Birth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p> <p>Even assuming that the nationality of respondents' parents as entered respondents' Certificates of Live Birth may be changed and, therefore, extending Filipino citizenship to respondents, the change in the entry can be done only after an appropriate proceeding under the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Presidential Decree No. 836, in relation to Presidential Decree No. 923. This proceeding should be conducted before the Special Committee on Naturalization to determine if, indeed, respondents are qualified to become naturalized Filipinos.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></p> <p> As for respondents, Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas all contend that the Manila and Quezon City trial courts committed no reversible error since the trial courts had jurisdiction to change a substantial entry in their respective Certificates of Live Birth-their parents' nationality—pursuant to Rule 108 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> They argue that <i>Co v. The Civil Register of Manila</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> where this Court allowed the change in the nationality of the parents as entered in the certificate of live birth, is applicable in this case. </p><p> On the issue of whether children whose parents were naturalized as Filipinos during their minority, under Letter of Instructions No. 270, automatically qualify them to change their parents' nationality as originally entered in their certificates of live birth—that is, without any proceeding conducted before the Special Committee on Naturalization—Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas co tend that<em> Co</em> long resolved the issue in the affirmative. The father in<em> Co</em> was naturalized under Letter of Instructions No. 270, the same presidential decree under which Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas' father applied for naturalization. Letter of Instructions No. 270, according to the Court in <em>Co</em>, is in<em> pari materia</em> with Section 15<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> of Commonwealth Act No. 473 or the Revised Naturalization Law, which automatically granted Philippine citizenship to the minor children of the naturalized Filipino under certain conditions. In their case, Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas argue that that they have established these essential facts: (1) that their father was naturalized under Letter of Instruction No. 270; (2) that they were born in the Philippines; and (3) that they were minors at the time their father was granted Philippine citizenship. Thus, pursuant to Letter of Instructions No. 270 in relation to Section 15 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, they should likewise be deemed Filipinos.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p>As to whether a proceeding should first be conducted by the Special Committee on Naturalization to determine whether Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas indeed satisfied the requirements for naturalization under Section 15 of Commonwealth Act No. 473, Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas argue that they never disputed the Special Committee on Naturalization's jurisdiction over administrative proceedings for acquiring Philippine citizenship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> However, they maintain that the issue of whether a proceeding should first be conducted is irrelevant in this case. Specifically for respondent Jon Nicolas, he effectively maintains that the Special Committee on Naturalization is already estopped from claiming that a proceeding should first be conducted since it actively participated as a witness for Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas before the trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> The consolidated Petitions for Review on <em>Certiorari</em> are denied. The Manila and Quezon City trial courts correctly granted the Petitions for Correction filed by Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas. </p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> Births are among those events required to be entered in the civil register.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The certificate of live birth or birth certificate, a vital record contained in the birth and death register, establishes the fact of birth. The required entries in the certificate of live birth are provided in Section 5 of Act No. 3753, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 5. <i>Registration and Certification of Births</i>. — The declaration of the physician or midwife in attendance at the birth or, in default thereof, the declaration of either parent of the newborn child, shall be sufficient for the registration of a birth in the civil register. Such declaration shall be exempt from the documentary stamp tax and shall be sent to the local civil registrar not later than thirty days after the birth, by the physician, or midwife in attendance at the birth or by either parent of the newly born child.</p> <p> In such declaration, the persons above mentioned shall certify to the following facts: <u>(a) date and hour of birth; (b) sex and nationality of infant; (c) names, citizenship, and religion of parents or, in case the father is not known, of the mother alone; (d) civil status of parents; (e) place where the infant was born; (f) and such other data may be required in the regulation to be issued.</u> </p> <p>In the case of an exposed child, the person who found the same shall report to the local civil registrar the place, date and hour of finding and other attendant circumstances.</p> <p> In case of an illegitimate child, the birth certificate shall be signed and sworn to jointly by the parents of the infant or only the mother if the father refuses. In the latter case, it shall not be permissible to state or reveal in the document the name of the father who refuses to acknowledge the child, or to give therein any information by which such father could be identified. </p> <p>Any foetus having human features which dies after twenty four hours of existence completely disengaged from the maternal womb shall be entered in the proper registers as having been born and having died. (Underscoring provided)</p> </blockquote> <p> Generally, the entries recorded in the birth certificate: (1) the date and hour of birth; (2) the sex and nationality of the infant; (3) the names, citizens, and religion of parents; (4) the civil status of parents; and (5) the place where the infant was born, all correspond to facts existing at the time of birth as argued by the Republic. However, reading Article 407 of the Civil Code in conjunction with Article 412 of the Civil Code, even acts or events that occurred <i>after </i>birth may be recorded in the certificate of live birth. The reason is that Article 412 of the Civil Code uses the word "changed," which implies the occurrence of an event subsequent to birth may be recorded in the civil register. Articles 407 and 412 provide: </p><blockquote> <p>ARTICLE 407. Acts, events and judicial decrees concerning the civil status of persons shall be recorded in the civil register. </p> <p>ARTICLE 412. No entry in a civil register shall be changed or corrected, without a judicial order. </p> </blockquote> <p> That an event occurring after birth may be recorded in the civil register was pronounced in <i>Co v. The Civil Register</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> a case cited by Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas in support of their Petition before the trial court. In <i>Co</i>, Hubeti Tan Co was born on March 23, 1974 and his sister, Arlene Tan Co, was born on May 19, 1975. In their birth certificates, the nationality of their parents as entered in their birth certificates was "Chinese." Subsequently, Hubeti and Arlene's father, Co Boon Peng, applied for naturalization under Letter of Instruction No. 270. The application was granted, and Co Boon Peng was issued a Certificate of Naturalization on February 15, 1977.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </p><p>Arguing that "the naturalization of [their] father in 1977 was an act or event affecting and concerning their civil status that must be recorded in the Civil Register,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Hubert and Arlene filed a Petition to correct the citizenship of their father as entered in their birth certificates. </p><p> The trial court dismissed the Petition outright, because Co Boon Peng applied for naturalization under Letter of Instruction No. 270 which, unlike Commonwealth Act No. 473 or the Revised Naturalization Law, did not expressly provide that the father's naturalization automatically extended to his wife and children.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> This Court, however, reversed the trial court, ruling that Letter of Instruction No. 270 and Commonwealth Act No. 473 are statutes in <i>pari materia</i>, both governing the naturalization of qualified aliens residing in Philippines. Thus: </p><blockquote> <p>Absent any express repeal of Section 15 of [Commonwealth Act] No. 473 [on the effect of the naturalization on wife and children] in [Letter of Instruction] No. 270, the said provision should be read in to the latter law as an integral part thereof, not being inconsistent with its purpose. Thus, Section 15 of [Commonwealth Act] No. 473, which extends the grant of Philippine citizenship to the minor children of those naturalized thereunder, should be similarly applied to the mi nor children of those naturalized under [Letter of Instruction] No. 270[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>On Hubert and Arlene's recourse to Rule 108 of the Rules of Court to change the nationality of their father as entered in their birth certificates, this Court said that the recourse was "appropriate."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The entry sought to be corrected was one of those allowed under Rule 108, the Court-approved procedure to correct entries in the civil registry such as those made in the birth certificate. Hubert and Arlene were found to have sufficiently alleged the ultimate facts required to effect the change: (1) that they are the legitimate children of Co Boon Peng; (2) that their father was a naturalized Filipino citizen; and (3) that their birth certificates still indicate that their father is Chinese. Taking that into consideration, this Court said that it "behooved the trial court to do its duty under Section 4, Rule 108 of the Rules of Court,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> that is, to issue a notice of the hearing on the Petition for Correction of Entry and cause its publication. The change will be in the form of a marginal annotation on the certificate of live birth. In the words of the Court: </p> <blockquote> <p> The petitioners' recourse to Rule 108 of the Rules of Court, as amended, is appropriate. Under Article 412 of the New Civil Code, no entry in a civil register shall be changed or corrected without a judicial order. The law does not provide for a specific procedure of law to be followed. But the Court approved Rule 108 of the Rules of Court to provide for a procedure to implement the law. The entries envisaged in Article 412 of the New Civil Code are those provided in Articles 407 and 408 of the New Civil Code which reads: </p> <blockquote> <p>Art. 407. Acts, events and judicial decrees concerning the civil status of persons shall be recorded in the civil register. </p> <p>Art. 408. The following shall be entered in the civil register:</p> <p> (1) Births; (2) marriages; (3) deaths; (4) legal separations; (5) annulments of marriage; (6) judgments declaring marriages void from the beginning; (7) legitimations; (8) adoptions; (9) acknowledgments of natural children; (10) naturalization; (11) loss, or (12) recovery of citizenship; (13) civil interdiction; (14) judicial determination of filiation; (15) voluntary emancipation of a minor; and (16) changes of name. </p> </blockquote> <p>Specific matters covered by the said provision include not only status but also nationality. The acts, events or factual errors envisaged in Article 407 of the New Civil Code include even those that occur after the birth of the petitioner. However, in such cases, <u>the entries in the certificates of live birth will not be corrected or changed. The decision of the court granting the petition shall be annotated in the certificates of birth and shall form part of the civil register in the Office of the Local Civil Registrar.</u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Underscoring provided)</p> </blockquote> <p> The facts here are similar to those in Co. Since the entry sought to be changed—<i>citizenship</i>—was substantial, the Manila and Quezon City trial courts correctly conducted an adversarial proceeding, notifying the local civil registrar and all parties interested under the entry sought to be corrected are impleaded. After having complied with the jurisdictional requirements for a petition under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court, Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas alleged and proved the ultimate facts required to reflect the naturalization of their parents in their respective certificates of live birth. They established that: (1) they are the legitimate children of Lao Kian Ben and Chia Kong Liong, former Chinese nationals; (2) their parents are naturalized Filipino citizens; and (3) the nationality of their parents entered in their respective certificates of live birth remains "Chinese." The trial courts correctly granted the Petitions of Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicolas, ordering that their decisions be annotated in their certificates of live birth. </p><p>To prohibit the annotation of events subsequent to birth in the certificate of live birth is to deny a person the right to form his or her own identity. More than a "historical record of the facts as they existed at the time of birth,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> the birth certificate is an instrument of individuation. It contains entries that separates a person from others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> We cannot fault Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas for wanting to change the nationality of their parents as entered in their certificates of live birth. They only want a vital marker of their identity to align with a legal truth. </p><p align="center"><b>II</b> </p><p>The Republic nevertheless contends that, before the change prayed for by Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas may be effected, they should first show that they had undergone the appropriate proceeding under the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Presidential Decree No. 836 in relation to Presidential Decree No. 923 before the Special Committee on Naturalization. The same way that their mother, Chia Kong Liong, underwent the similar procedure.
