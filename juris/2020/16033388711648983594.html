The BIR also requested that the balance of P7,385,209.00 be paid within 10 days from receipt of the letter.<br><br>Petitioner sought reconsideration, but the BIR denied due course<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> thereon after finding that no new/additional justification was introduced as provided under Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 13-2001, and reiterated the request for payment of the balance within 10 days.<br><br>Undeterred, petitioner appealed for another reconsideration, but in a Letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated April 3, 2014, the CIR denied petitioner's request for the last time, <i>viz.</i>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><blockquote>03 April 2014<br><br><b>Mr. Abdallah A. Okasha</b><br>Country Manager Philippines<br>Qatar Airways Company with Limited Liability<br>Units 803-804, One Global Place, 5<sup>th</sup> Ave., cor 25<sup>th</sup> St.<br>Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City<br><br><b>Dear Mr. Okasha:</b><br><br>We refer to the letter dated 19 February 2014 of your counsel, Atty. Estrella V. Martinez, addressed to [OIC-ACIR Misajon] and forwarded to this Office, requesting <u>another</u> reconsideration of the earlier denial of your company's application for abatement of surcharge in the amount of [P]7,385.209.00, imposed for the late filing of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Quarterly Income Tax Return for the Fiscal Year 2012 (Ju1y 2011 to September 2011).<br><br>As may be recalled, in a letter dated 03 October 2013, OIC-ACIR Misajon informed you of the denial of [your] company's application for abatement of surcharge. Thereafter, you filed, [through] counsel, a request for reconsideration contending <i>inter-alia</i>, that the late filing of such return was due to circumstances beyond the company's control as it was due to a technical failure brought about by faulty internet connection at the company's office on 29 November 2011. In [a] letter dated 10 February 2014, OIC-ACIR Misajon informed you of the denial of such request for reconsideration as you did not introduce any new/additional justifiable reason as provided under [RR] No. 13-2001, as an1ended by RR [No.] 4-2012. Dissatisfied still, you filed, [through] counsel, the present letter, which, in effect, is a second request or motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Kindly be informed that there is no law, rules or regulations that allow a second request or motion for reconsideration of a decision on abatement cases. This is a prohibited pleading. Be that as it may, we find no cogent reason to depart from our earlier findings. There was no advice on eFPS Unavailability on 29 November 2011, which means that no technical problems were encountered in eFPS on that day. Also, if you claimed that you had log-in problems on the night of 29 November 2011, filing of the return should have been done on the first working hour of the following day. But as it [were], the return was filed and paid only on the following day, 30 November 2011, at 1:38 in the afternoon.<br><br>Further, you were given a period of sixty (60) days to file the return. You chose, however, to file it on the last day [when] you could have filed it any day before. An acceptable reason that may be advanced for failing to file the return on time is if there is a major natural catastrophe. This is not, however, the situation in the present case. To us, any other reasons could have been avoided if the filing was made earlier or before the deadline.<br><br>Based thereon, the instant request for reconsideration is hereby <u><b>denied</b></u>. This denial is <u><b>final</b></u>. No further request for reconsideration, or other letters or pleadings of similar import, shall be entertained.<br><br>Accordingly, we reiterate our request that the amount of Seven <b>Million Three Hundred Eighty[-]Five Thousand Two Hundred Nine Pesos Only ([P]7,385,209.00)</b> be paid within ten (10) days upon receipt of this notice, thru the [<i>e</i>FPS] to any Authorized Agent Bank (AAB) for large taxpayers. Otherwise, we shall be constrained to enforce the collection thereof [through the] administrative summary remedies provided by law, without further notice.

It held that the 30-day period to file a Petition for Review already commenced when petitioner received the February 10, 2014 letter of the BIR denying petitioner's request for reconsideration. It ratiocinated that since petitioner sought reconsideration for the second time and waited for the BIR's action thereon, it therefore had no jurisdiction over the petition for review belatedly filed on May 8, 2014.

Petitioner claims its belated filing of ITR was due to a technical problem beyond its control.<br><br>To recall, the CTA <i>En Banc</i>, citing the CIR's April 3, 2014 Letter, found that there was no advice on <i>e</i>FPS unavailability on November 29, 2011 and the delay could have been easily avoided had petitioner undertook to file its ITR earlier or before the deadline. Moreover, the CTA <i>En Banc</i> ruled that the surcharge was not unjust nor excessive.<br><br>The Court will not set aside lightly the conclusions reached by the CTA which, by the very nature of its functions, is dedicated exclusively to the resolution of tax problems and has, accordingly, developed an expertise on the subject, unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the Court finds no abuse of authority on the part of the CTA. Verily, the findings of the CTA, supported as they are by logic and law, carry great weight in the proper interpretation of what constitutes as "circumstances beyond control." Undeniably, a technical malfunction is not a situation too bleak so as to render petitioner completely without recourse. As correctly observed by the CTA, petitioner would not incur delay in the filing of its ITR if only it filed the same before the deadline and not at the 11<sup>th</sup> hour or on the last day of filing. On petitioner's averment that it had difficulty in interpreting the correct Gross Philippine Billings Computation for income tax under the then newly-issued RR No. 11-2011, the CTA aptly stated that:<br><blockquote>To avoid delay, petitioner could file a tentative quarterly income tax return if it was still unsure with the figures contained therein to avoid paying the [25%] surcharge for late filing. Thereafter, it could modify, change, or amend the tentative return already filed if warranted, pursuant to Section 6(A) of the 1997 NIRC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>Further, the Court agrees that the surcharge imposed upon petitioner was not unjust or excessive pursuant to Section 248(A)(1) of the 1997 NIRC which provides for the imposition of a penalty equivalent to 25% of the amount due for failure to timely file any return and pay the tax due thereon. <i>Dura lex sed lex</i>. While the Court commiserates with the unfortunate plight of petitioner, the Court, like the CTA, is still bound to apply and give effect to the applicable law and rules.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision dated September 5, 2017 and Resolution dated April 12, 2018 of the Court of Tax Appeals <i>En Banc</i> in CTA EB No. 1468 are hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Peralta, C.
