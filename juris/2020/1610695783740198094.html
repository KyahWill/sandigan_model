The Resolution No. 13-2015 directed all distribution utilities (DUs) to conduct a competitive selection process (CSP) in securing their power supply agreements (PSAs).<br><br>Believing that Resolution No. 1-2016 was a ploy to accommodate or favor the Manila Electric Company (MERALCO) and its sister companies, and enable them to bag lucrative PSAs without complying with the CSP requirement, the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas (ABP) filed before the Court on November 3, 2016 a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition (With Urgent Prayer for the Issuance of a TRO and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction) assailing the validity of Resolution No. 1-2016, as well as the CSP Guidelines, docketed as <b>G.R.

During the pendency of both G.R. Nos. 239168 and 240288, the Ombudsman filed a criminal Information before the RTC of Pasig City against petitioners and Salazar for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A.

No.] 10660, "<i>cases falling under the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court under this section, shall be tried in a judicial region other than were the official holds office</i>." This is because as things stand, the Honorable Supreme Court has yet to promulgate the pertinent rules on the aforesaid innovation of the law. As there are no implementing rules yet on this particular matter, the default regime is the one found in Section [15(a)], Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, [<i>viz</i>.], the criminal action shall be instituted and tried in the proper court of the municipality, city, or province where the offense was committed or where any of its essential ingredients took place. Since the instant Information alleges that the subject offense was committed by the accused in relation to the exercise of their official positions in the ERC, the office of which is seated in Ortigas Center, Pasig City, it cannot be gainsaid that this Court has territorial jurisdiction over the offense charged.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Motion to Quash Information filed by accused Jose Vicente B.

No. 10660.<br><br>Upon their arraignment on November 21, 2018 in Criminal Case No. R-PSG-18-01280-CR, the petitioners pleaded "not guilty," and the trial court set the pre-trial conference on February 13, 2019.

(P1,000,000.00).<br><br>Subject to the rules promulgated by the Supreme Court, the cases falling under the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court under this section shall be tried in a judicial region other than where the official holds office</b>. (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>Petitioners assert that, under Section 2 of R.A. No. 10660, not only is the RTC vested with jurisdiction over the instant case, the law also fixed the venue of the action. The Congress' intent was to confer both jurisdiction and venue on certain cases that used to be within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan to the RTC, but in a judicial region different from where the accused holds office. They argue that even though the Supreme Court has yet to promulgate rules therefor, since R,A. No. 10660 was already effective at the time of the filing of the Information, the public respondent should have applied its provisions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The Ombudsman, in its Comment, meanwhile, avers that <i>certiorari</i> is not the proper remedy from a denial of a motion to quash. Assuming that <i>certiorari</i> is proper, it should have been filed with the Sandiganbayan. In any event, the RTC Pasig City has jurisdiction over Criminal Case No. R- PSG-18-01280-CR.<br><br>According to the Ombudsman, while Section 4 of the Sandiganbayan law (as amended by Section 2 of R.A. No. 10660) explicitly states that "cases falling under the jurisdiction of the RTC under this section shall be tried in a judicial region other than where the official holds office" such proviso is qualified by the phrase "subject to the rules promulgated by the Supreme Court." Said section regarding venue is not self-executing as it is still subject to the rules to be promulgated by the Supreme Court. This interpretation, according to the Ombudsman, is more consistent with the constitutional provision that the Congress may not deprive the Court of its power to promulgate rules of pleadings, practice, and procedure. Further, the Ombudsman asserts, as the Court has yet to promulgate the pertinent rules on venue, the actions against high ranking officials falling under the jurisdiction of the RTC under Section 4 must be instituted and tried in the court of the municipality or territory where the offense was committed or where any of its essential ingredients occurred," pursuant to existing rule on venue under Section 15(a), Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), meanwhile, filed its Manifestation and Motion (In Lieu of Comment) stating that as the Tribune of the People and an officer of the Court, it shares in the task and responsibility of dispensing justice. In the discharge of its duty, it is mandated to present to the Court the position that will best uphold the interest of both the Government and the People. Thus, in certain instances, it may take a position adverse or contrary to that of its client.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The OSG then expressed its agreement with petitioners specifically on the following points: that direct resort to this Court via certiorari was proper; that respondent judge gravely abused her discretion in denying petitioners' motion to quash; that the RTC Pasig City has no jurisdiction over Criminal Case No. R- PSG-18-01280-CR; and that petitioners are entitled to the issuance of a TRO/Writ of Preliminary Investigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><b><center><br>The Court's Ruling<br></center></b><br>We grant the petition.<br><br><b><i>Direct recourse to the Court from <br>a denial of a Motion to Quash<br>allowed in meritorious cases</i></b><br><br>As a rule, a denial of a motion to quash filed by an accused is not appealable, since an appeal from an interlocutory order is not allowed under Section 1(b), Rule 41 of the Rules of Court. Neither can it be a proper subject of a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, which is filed only in the absence of an appeal or any other adequate, plain, and speedy remedy. In a denial of a motion to quash information, the plain and speedy remedy is to proceed to trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In the usual course of procedure, a denial of a motion to quash filed by an accused results in the continuation of the trial and the determination of his guilt or innocence. If a judgment of conviction is rendered and the lower court's decision of conviction is appealed, the accused can raise the denial of his motion to quash, not only as an error committed by the trial court, but as an added ground to overturn the latter's ruling.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Thus, a direct resort to this Court <i>via</i> a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> is an exception rather than the rule, and is a recourse that must be firmly grounded on compelling reasons.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In meritorious cases, however, we have recognized <i>certiorari</i> as an appropriate remedy to assail interlocutory orders, specifically pertaining to denials of motions to quash. These instances are: (a) when the court issued the order without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion; (b) when the interlocutory order is patently erroneous and the remedy of appeal would not afford adequate and expeditious relief; (c) in the interest of a more enlightened and substantial justice; (d) to promote public welfare and public policy; and (e) when the cases have attracted nationwide attention, making it essential to proceed with dispatch in the consideration thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><i>Certiorari</i> is the appropriate remedy in grave abuse of discretion cases, if the petitioner can establish that the lower court issued the judgment or order without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion, and the remedy of appeal would not afford adequate and expeditious relief The writ of <i>certiorari</i> serves to keep an inferior court within the bounds of its jurisdiction or to prevent it from committing such grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction, or to relieve parties from arbitrary acts of courts which courts have no power or authority in law to perform. The burden is on the petitioner to show that the circumstances warrant the resort to <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Here we find that the RTC Pasig City acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying petitioners' motion to quash the Information which warrants the resort to the filing of the instant Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.<br><br>By definition, the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>, as provided for under Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, is an extraordinary remedy that is available only upon showing that a tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>As we held in <i>De Lima v. City of Manila:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><blockquote><i>The writ is designed to correct grave errors of jurisdiction</i> — [W]hich means either that the judicial or quasi-judicial power was exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, or that the respondent judge, tribunal or board evaded a positive duty, or virtually refused to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law, such as when such judge, tribunal or board exercising judicial or quasi-judicial powers acted in a capricious or whimsical manner as to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.</blockquote>In the present case, respondent judge refused to grant the Motion to Quash filed by petitioners despite the clear wording of R.A. No. 10660 that cases falling under the jurisdiction of the RTC under Section 4, as amended, shall be tried in a judicial region other than where the official holds office.<br><br><b><i>RTC Pasig City has no jurisdiction over<br>Criminal Case No. R-PSG-18-01280-CR</i></b><br><br>In the September 10, 2018 Order of respondent judge, she held that since the "Supreme Court has yet to promulgate the pertinent rules on R.A.

The default regime is found in Section 15(a), Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, viz., the criminal action shall be instituted and tried in the proper court of the municipality, city, or province where the offense was committed and where any of its essential ingredients took place."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Such reasoning is specious.<br><br>A quick look at Section 15(a), Rule 110 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure would reveal that when a law specifically provides a venue, then the criminal action shall be instituted in such place.<br><blockquote>SEC. 15. <i>Place where action is to be instituted</i>. —<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%" valign="top"><div align="center">(a)</div></td> <td width="95%" valign="top"> <div align="justify"> Subject to existing laws, the criminal action shall be instituted and tried in the court of the municipality or territory where the offense was committed or where any of its essential ingredients occurred.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>Here, Section 2 of R.A. No. 10660 clearly provides that the RTC has original and exclusive jurisdiction when the information either: (a) does not allege any damage to the government or any bribery; or (b) alleges damage to the government or bribery arising from the same or closely related transactions or acts in an amount not exceeding One Million Pesos (P1,000,000.00). Moreover, such cases falling within the jurisdiction of the RTC shall be tried in a judicial region <i>other</i> than the place where the accused official holds office.<br><br>R.A. No. 10660 took effect in 2015. When the Information against petitioners was filed in 2018, petitioners were still Commissioners of the ERC, holding office in Ortigas, Pasig City. The Information also did not allege any amount of damage to the government, or any bribery. Applying Section 2 of R.A. No. 10660, the Information against petitioners should have been filed in a judicial region outside of the National Capital Judicial Region. Since jurisdiction is a matter of substantive law, the established rule is that the statute in force at the time of the commencement of the action determines the jurisdiction of the court.<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[25]</sup></font><br><br>The <i>proviso</i> ''<i>subject to the rules promulgated by the Supreme Court</i>" should not stand as a hindrance to the application of the clear intention of the law.<br><br>The Senate deliberations on R.A. No. 10660 support the view that the RTC's jurisdiction under said law shall be tried in a judicial region outside of the place where the accused public official holds office.<br><blockquote>As regards the amendment on page 3, lines 28 to 31, on the trial of cases falling within the jurisdiction of the RTC in a judicial region other than where the official holds office, <b>Senator Angara believed that the basic reasoning behind the provision is to prevent a public official from exerting influence over the RTC judge who is hearing the case. Senator Pimentel agreed</b>, saying that it is the assumption of the amendment.<br><br>Senator Angara expressed concern that the proposed amendment could be used as harassment against a public official. For instance, he noted that if cases are filed against a mayor or governor x x x in Region III and these cases are referred to RTCs in Regions I, II and IV, that would entail substantial expenses and time on their part. Senator Pimentel explained that the provision would only apply when there is already an information and it could not be considered harassment because those cases would have to go through the Ombudsman. He stated that under existing procedures, there are sufficient safeguards in detailing with such kind of situation, and he believed that the Ombudsman would not file harassment cases. Besides, not all cases filed with the Sandiganbayan lead to convictions, he said.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote>Contrary to the interpretation of the respondent judge and the Ombudsman, the applicability of R.A. No. 10660 is not conditioned upon the promulgation of rules by the Court. As we declared in <i>Government Service Insurance System v. Daymiel</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><blockquote>Jurisdiction over a subject matter is conferred by the Constitution or the law, and rules of procedure yield to substantive law. Otherwise stated, jurisdiction must exist as a matter of law. Only a statute can confer jurisdiction on courts and administrative agencies.</blockquote>If we were to follow respondents' reasoning — that until the Court comes up with implementing rules, the application of R.A. No. 10660 shall be put on hold — then the letter of the law would be rendered nugatory by the mere expediency of the Court's non-issuance of such rules. This is clearly not the intention of the framers of the law in placing the <i>proviso</i>, neither would the Court countenance such a scenario. The Court cannot enlarge, diminish, or dictate when jurisdiction shall be removed, given that the power to define, prescribe, and apportion jurisdiction is, as a general rule, a matter of legislative prerogative.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Since the RTC of Pasig City has no jurisdiction over the present case, the dismissal of Criminal Case No. R-PSG-18-01280-CR is clearly in order. Further, all actions of the RTC of Pasig City in the case are declared null and void for having been issued without jurisdiction. As the Court held in <i>Bilag v. Ay-ay</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> "x x x any act that [a court] performs without jurisdiction shall be null and void, and without any binding legal effects." It is also well established that "the decision of a court or tribunal without jurisdiction is a total nullity. A void judgment for want of jurisdiction is no judgment at all. All acts performed pursuant to it and all claims emanating from it have no legal effect."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The dismissal of the case, thus, follows as a necessary consequence. As aptly stated in the case of <i>Radiowealth Finance Co., Inc. v. Pineda, Jr.</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><blockquote>Jurisdiction is a matter of substantive law. Thus, an action may be filed only with the court or tribunal where the Constitution or a statute says it can be brought. Objections to jurisdiction cannot be waived and may be brought at any stage of the proceedings, even on appeal. When a case is filed with a court which has no jurisdiction over the action, the court shall <i>motu proprio</i> dismiss the case.<br></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Orders dated September 10, 2018 and October 22, 2018 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 155, Pasig City are <b>ANNULLED</b> for lack of jurisdiction.
