The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 05-CV-2116.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p> The Gomez siblings sought for the following reliefs: <i>first</i>, to be declared as the true and lawful owners of Espirita, Teresita, and Rodolfo's co-ownership shares over the subject land. <i>Second</i>, for TCT No. T-5690 to be cancelled and a new title be issued in their names. <i>Third</i>, to have the Mabalot Siblings execute a document ceding Espirita, Teresita, and Rodolfo's co-ownership shares in their favor. <i>Fourth</i>, to be remunerated for moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p> In their defense, the Mabalot Siblings argued as follows: <i>first,</i> the action was premature, having been filed without first complying with Article 222<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the Civil Code. <i>Second,</i> the Affidavit of Waivers were void because these were executed without: (1) compliance with 1 the prescribed form; (2) the co-owners' consent; and (3) obtaining confirmation from the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), a requirement for property transfers involving members of a cultural minority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <i>Third</i>, the subject land remained undivided.

Thus, the Affidavits of Waiver should have been submitted to the NCIP for appropriate action prior to execution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <em>Second,</em> the consideration given by the Gomez Siblings in exchange of Espirita, Teresita, and Rodolfo's co-ownership shares (P50,000.00 per share) was "too meager" and did not commensurate the actual value of property ceded to them. <i>Third</i>, Loreto, Sr. also admitted that he personally drafted and prepared the Affidavits of Waiver, brought them to Esperita, Teresita, and Rodolfo for signature, and had the documents notarized thereafter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> As a consequence thereof, the RTC reinstated the Talbora Siblings' co-ownership over the subject land<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> in contrast to the decision in Civil Case No. 92-CV-0753.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p>Aggrieved, the Gomez Siblings appealed the decision to the CA. </p><p align="center"> <i>The CA Ruling</i> </p><p> In its assailed Decision, the CA granted the Gomez Siblings' appeal, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Decision of the RTC Branch 63 of La Trinidad, Benguet docketed as Civil Case No. 05-CV-2116 dated June 2, 2010 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The decision in Civil Case No. 92-CV-0753 dated October 28, 1994 rendered by RTC Branch 10 of La Trinidad[,] Benguet is hereby REINSTATED and should be carried into effect. Plaintiffs-appellants Catherine Gomez, Loreto Gomez, Jr., and Neil Gomez are now declared the true and lawful owners of the co-ownership shares of Esperita Tabora-Mabalot, Teresita Tabora and Rodolfo Tabora, respectively, of that land covered by TCT No. T-5690 located in La Trinidad, Benguet. The public defendant Registry of Deeds for the Province of Benguet is hereby ordered to cancel TCT No. [T-]5690 and issue a new title in its stead in the names of Balbina Tabora, Loreto Gomez[,] Jr. and Catherine Gomez and Neil Gomez as co-owners thereof. </p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The CA pointed out that the land in dispute in the present case was the subject of Civil Case No. 92-CV-0753. In the first civil case, the RTC already declared the Gomez Siblings as the lawful purchasers of Espirita, Teresita, and Rodolfo's co-ownership shares and dissolved the co-ownership over the subject land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Decision was not appealed. Hence, it became final and executory. The RTC in Civil Case No. 05-CV-2116 erred when it invalidated the Affidavits of Waiver, contrary to the first RTC Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> There was no reason to once more rule on the merits of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p><p> The Mabalot Siblings moved for reconsideration, but the CA denied it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p> Hence, the present petition.</p><p> <i>Petitioners' Arguments</i></p><p> Petitioners recognized that the RTC in Civil Case No. 92-CV- 0753 dated October 28, 1994, terminated the co-ownership among the Tabora siblings over the subject land and denied partition thereof. They also admitted that there was no appeal taken from the decision and it became final and executory on November 23, 1994.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p><p> However, Gomez Siblings did not pursue the execution of the earlier decision either by motion within five years or by independent action reviving the judgment within ten years from its finality. Thus, the decision "has since become a stale judgment that can no longer be enforced."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Furthermore, the respondents were guilty of laches. They were presumed to have abandoned their right or declined to assert it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></p><p> Ultimately, petitioners maintained that a sale of real property must be made through a public instrument. Inasmuch as the Affidavits of Waiver were private documents, the RTC in Civil Case No. 05-CV-2116 correctly declared these as unenforceable. </p><p> The petitioners also pointed out the following: (1) there was no showing that Alfonso Mabalot, Espirita's husband, assented to the execution of his wife's Affidavit of Waiver.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Thus, if adjudged as valid, it must be construed to pertain only to half of Espirita's share in the co-ownership; and (2) they may still dispute the validity of Rodolfo's affidavit, inasmuch as it was never put in issue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In this regard, his affidavit must be invalidated because Rodolfo, who was suffering and abnormality, could not have understood the import of what he signed. Moreover, his affidavit was notarized without personally appearing before the notary public.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <i>The Court's Ruling</i> </p><p> The petition is unmeritorious. </p><p> The Court shall first address the procedural matter raised by the respondents before resolving the substantive aspect of the present case. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>One signature on the certification against forum shopping is substantial compliance.</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>In their Respondents' Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Gomez Siblings point out that the certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> against forum shopping accompanying the present petition was signed by Marissa Mabalot only, supposedly for herself and in behalf of the other petitioners, namely: Edwin Mabalot, Oscar Mabalot, Marilou Mabalot, and Josephine Mabalot. This amounts to a defective petition, which must be dismissed. </p><p> Verily, the Rules of Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> require the petitioner to submit a certification against forum shopping together with his petition. In case there are several petitioners, the certification must be signed by all of them. Otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped and will no longer be considered as parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p><p> However, the recognized exception to this rule is when "all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and involve a common cause of action or defense." In which case, "the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping" is substantial compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p><p> Herein petitioners' claim on the subject property is grounded on the co-ownership right/share of their predecessor-in-interest, Espirita. This commonality in their interest brings the petitioners within the exception, such that the signature of any one of them (in this case, Marissa) on the certification substantially complies with the rule. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Complaint in second civil case is not an attempt to execute the judgment in the first civil case or a revival Thereof. </i></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The petitioners admit that the RTC decision in Civil Case No. 92-CV-0753 dated October 28, 1994 lapsed into finality on November 23, 1994. However, they contend that the Gomez Siblings only had ten years from the date of finality to enforce the judgment <em>via</em> an independent action. Thus, when the Gomez Siblings filed their complaint" in Civil Case No. 92-CV-0753 in May 2005, they were already barred from enforcing the decision from the first civil case. </p><p> </p><p> The petitioners are mistaken. </p><p> The prevailing party in a decided case may move for execution, as a matter of right,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> within five years from the finality of the decision sought to be enforced.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Beyond this period, he may revive the judgment through an independent action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The Civil Code of the Philippines requires a party to bring the independent action within ten years from its finality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Otherwise, his right of action will have prescribed. </p><p> However, the ten-year prescriptive period on actions seeking to enforce a judgment obligation could not have applied to the Gomez Siblings' complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The original action here was not for the execution of a previous judgment or the revival thereof. </p><p> The case at bar stems from a complaint in Civil Case No. 05-CV-2116 filed by the Gomez Siblings. They alleged that, as the true and lawful owners of the co-ownership shares pertaining to Espirita, Teresita and Rodolfo over the subject land,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> they were entitled to the cancellation of TCT No. T-5690 and the issuance of a new title in their names.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> <em>These averments constitute a cause of action for reconveyance, not the revival or execution of a judgment.</em> </p><p> That the Gomez Siblings cited the ruling in Civil Case No. 92-CV-0753—an earlier case involving them and the petitioners' predecessors-in-interest—to support their claim does not convert their complaint into an action to revive the judgment in the first civil case. To be sure, while they prevailed in Civil Case No. 92-CV-0753, the RTC then did not explicitly order for the issuance of a new title in favor of the Gomez Siblings. The <i>fallo</i> in the earlier decision in Civil Case No. 92-CV-0753 reads: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, all premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of all the defendants and against the plaintiffs, the complaint is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Inasmuch as the dispositive portion plainly called for a dismissal, a motion for execution, as a matter of right, or an independent action for the revival of judgment, even if instituted within the ten-year prescriptive period, would not have been the proper remedies to as for reconveyance and other reliefs prayed for by herein respondents. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Parties may no longer re-litigate the issue on the Affidavits of Waiver's validity and enforceability.</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The Mabalot siblings insist that the Affidavits of Waiver are unenforceable documents. However, the Court cannot allow the petitioners to assail anew the documents' validity and unenforceability. </p><p> To recall, in the first civil case (Civil Case No. 92-CV-0753), the RTC terminated the co-ownership between the Tabora siblings. It found that the affidavits, together with the acknowledgment receipts of the amounts paid by the respondents for each co-ownership share, clearly conveyed the intention of the parties to consummate a sale of Espirita, Teresita, and Rodolfo's co-ownership shares to the Gomez siblings As there was no ground to annul the affidavits, the RTC gave the documents full faith and credit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It further held that as notarized documents, the affidavits are presumed to have been regularly executed. Without fear and convincing proof to overturn this presumption, the notarized documents shall serve "as evidence of facts in clear unequivocal manner therein expressed."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p><p> After the decision lapsed into finality, the parties were bound by the matters adjudged in Civil Case No. 92-CV-0753. The issues previously settled therein may no longer be relitigated. The doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment precludes the parties from raising issues squarely ruled upon in a previous processing in any future case between the same parties, albeit involving a different cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p> Furthermore, when the RTC reinstated the co-ownership over the subject land in the second civil case (Civil Case No. 05-CV-2116), directly contravening the final and executory decision in Civil Case No. 92-CV-0753, it disregarded not only the doctrine of<em> res judicata</em>, but also that of immutability of judgments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </p><p> Thus, the CA correctly overturned the erroneous ruling and ordered for the cancellation of TCT No. T-5690 and the issuance of a new title in favor of herein respondents. This finally laid to rest issues that have long been settled between parties who have remained in litigation for over two decades. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is <strong>DENIED</strong>.
