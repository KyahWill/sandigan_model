These showed that Alex indeed delivered <i>shabu</i> to IO1 Molina, who in turn gave a marked P500 bill as payment. The confiscated item was also presented during the trial to prove the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime.<br><br>Alex also did not allege and show that the PDEA officers who composed the buy-bust team were prompted by ill motives in conducting the operation. Hence, there was no color of illegality in the conduct of the operation.<br><br>The prosecution's setback in this case lies in the failure of the drug enforcement officers to observe the chain of custody rule, specifically in proving the identity of the object of the sale, <i>i.e.</i>, the dangerous drugs. The Court agrees with Alex that the chain of custody rule was not properly observed during the operation.<br><br>Related to establishing the identity of the object of the illegal sale is the observance of the chain of custody rule. The chain of custody rule in Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 has been amended on July 15, 2014 by RA 10640<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> to the extent that the witness requirement during the marking of the seized items has been relaxed. But the applicable rule for this case is Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 prior to its amendment as the transaction happened on March 5, 2013. The relevant portion of Section 21 reads:<br><blockquote><b>Section 21.</b> <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized, and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><blockquote>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;<br></blockquote></blockquote>Section 21 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA 9165 (<b>IRR of RA 9165</b>) also provides for the same requirements, the pertinent portion of which reads:<br><blockquote><b>Section 21.</b> <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</i>. - The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><blockquote>(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>The foregoing provisions provide that the marking, photographing, and inventory of the seized items must be done immediately after seizure and confiscation of the items in the presence of three witnesses-a representative from the media, the Department of Justice (<b>DOJ</b>), and any elected official.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The purpose of this rule is to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized dangerous drugs in order to fully remove doubts as to its identity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>The provisions allow exceptions to the chain of custody rule. The case of <i>Belmonte v. People</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> mentions that under varied field conditions, the strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 may not be always possible as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The IRR of RA 9165 likewise provides that the marking, photographing, and inventory of the seized items may be done "at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In his testimony, IO1 Molina stated that he marked the seized items only in the PDEA National Headquarters in Quezon City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> They opted to leave the buy-bust site as soon as possible because of possible danger to their safety and because it was already night time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The RTC ruled, as affirmed by the CA, that the failure to immediately mark the seized items at the place of arrest was not fatal to the prosecution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> This Court agrees with the RTC and the CA in this regard.<br><br>However, the Court notes that the PDEA officers failed to observe the three-witness requirement during the marking of the seized items. This lapse in procedure warrants the acquittal of Alex.<br><br>To reiterate, under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 prior to its amendment, three (3) witnesses are required to be present during the marking, photographing, and inventory of the seized items-a representative from the media, the DOJ, and any elected official. It goes without saying that the accused or his representative or counsel should also be present. The case of <i>People v. Reyes</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> discusses the requirement of three (3) witnesses and its importance, to wit:<br><blockquote>Under the original provision of Section 21, after seizure and confiscation of the drugs, the apprehending team was required to immediately conduct a physical inventory and to photograph the same in the presence of (1) the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, (2) a representative from the media <b>and</b> (3) the DOJ, <b>and</b> (4) any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof. It is assumed that the presence of these three persons <b>will guarantee "against planting of evidence and frame up,"</b> i.e., they are "necessary to insulate the apprehension and incrimination proceedings from any taint of illegitimacy or irregularity." (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>In addition, the case of <i>People v. Mendoza</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> mentions:<br><blockquote>The consequences of the failure of the arresting lawmen to comply with the requirements of Section 21 (1), <i>supra</i>, were dire as far as the Prosecution was concerned. Without the insulating presence of the representative from the media or the Department of Justice, or any elected public official during the seizure and marking of the sachets of shabu, the evils of switching, "planting" or contamination of the evidence that had tainted the buy-busts conducted under the regime of RA No. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972) again reared their ugly heads as to negate the integrity and credibility of the seizure and confiscation of the sachets of shabu that were evidence herein of the corpus delicti, and thus adversely affected the trustworthiness of the incrimination of the accused. Indeed, the insulating presence of such witnesses would have preserved an unbroken chain of custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br></blockquote>This requirement seeks to avoid frame ups or wrongful arrests of persons suspected to be violators of the law. The presence of the three witnesses assures that the officers conducting the operation do not plant evidence on the person or effects of the accused. The prosecution must allege and prove that at the time of the marking, photographing, and inventory of the evidence, the three witnesses were present.<br><br>Indubitably, this strict requirement is subject to exceptions as well. The case of <i>People v. Lim</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> holds that in the event of absence of one or more of the witnesses, the prosecution must allege and prove that their presence during the inventory of the seized items was not obtained due to reasons such as:<br><blockquote>(1) their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area; (2) their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs was threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf; (3) the elected official themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended; (4) <b>earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code prove[d] futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention;</b> or (5) time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The prosecution must show that the apprehending officers employed earnest efforts in procuring the attendance of witnesses for the inventory of the items seized during the buy-bust operation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Mere statements of unavailability of the witnesses given by the apprehending officers are not justifiable reasons for non-compliance with the requirement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> This is because the apprehending officers usually have sufficient time, from the moment they received information about the alleged illegal activities until the time of the arrest, to prepare for the buy-bust operation that necessarily includes the procurement of three (3) witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> If one of the individuals invited refuses to participate as witness, the apprehending officers can still invite another individual to become a witness.<br><br>In this case, only two (2) witnesses were present during the marking of the seized items. <i>Kagawad</i> Jose Ruiz of <i>Barangay</i> Pinyahan, Quezon City was the elected public official; Mr. Jimmy Mendoza was the representative from the media.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> There was no representative from the DOJ. The records did not show that the prosecution explained or justified the absence of said representative from the DOJ during the marking, photographing, and inventory of the seized items. In fact, IO1 Molina, when asked during his cross examination, admitted that there were only two (2) witnesses present during the inventory of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Neither did IO1 Molina nor IO1 Pinto provide any explanation to justify the absence of a representative from the DOJ.<br><br>Furthermore, the PDEA officers had sufficient time to procure a third witness. The records show that the operation was scheduled, and was in fact conducted late in the afternoon of March 5, 2013 with the actual buy-bust conducted at night. They had the whole day to procure the third witness after they were informed of the alleged illegal activities in the morning of the same day; yet, they have failed to do so.<br><br>The failure to comply with the three-witness requirement produces a gap in the chain of custody of the seized items that adversely affects the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> This raises doubts that the integrity of the seized items may have been compromised.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>The prosecution also cannot just rely on the saving clause<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> provided in Section 21 of the IRR of RA 9165. The clause requires showing of justifiable grounds for non-compliance and that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved. In this case, however, the prosecution failed to offer evidence to show justifiable grounds for non-compliance. It also failed to prove that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved despite this lapse in the procedure.<br><br>It is a well-settled rule that in criminal cases, the accused's guilt must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> This burden lies with the prosecution. In this case, the prosecution was not able to prove Alex's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The failure of the drug enforcement officers to observe the three-witness rule seriously compromised the integrity of the seized items and ultimately casted reasonable doubt on Alex's guilt.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
