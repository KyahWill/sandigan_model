				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">At the core of sexual harassment in the workplace, as penalized by Republic Act No. 7877, otherwise known as the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995, is abuse of power by a superior over a subordinate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Sexual harassment engenders three-fold liability: criminal, to address the wrong committed against society itself; civil, to address the private wrong against the offended party; and administrative, to protect the public service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Courts and administrative bodies should not hesitate to penalize insidious acts of sexual harassment, especially when committed by high-ranking public officers.<br><br>This resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure filed by petitioner Jose Romeo C.

The assailed Decision found Escandor guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of sexual harassment as penalized by the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act. The assailed Resolution, denied Escandor's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>Escandor was the Regional Director of the National Economic and Development Authority Region 7, Cebu City from August 16, 1992 to October 31, 2005. Private complainant Cindy Sheila C.

ESCANDOR, a public officer, being the Regional Director of NEDA Regional Office No. 7, based in Sudlon, Lahug, Cebu City (SG-28), in such capacity and committing the offense in relation to his official functions and taking advantage of his position, and with grave abuse of authority, with deliberate intent, with evident bad faith, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally perform or make a series of unwelcome sexual advances or verbal or physical behaviour of sexual nature, and demand, solicit, and request sexual favors from Mrs. Cindy Sheila Cobarde- Gamallo, then a Contractual Employee of the NEDA Regional Office No. 7 for the UNICEF-assisted Fifth Country Program for Children (CPC V), and, thus, the accused's subordinate, thereby exercising authority, influence or moral ascendancy over said Mrs. Cindy Sheila Cobarde-Gamallo in her working place, namely <b>by: telling her that he has fallen in love with her and has been&nbsp; attracted to her for a long time already, maliciously&nbsp; grabbing her hands, embracing her and planting a kiss on her forehead; telling her that if it were possible, he would have prevented her marriage with her husband; asking her for a date; groping her thigh; sending her winpop messages showing his amorous concern for her; on the office Christmas party of 2002, by grabbing her on a stairway and kissing her on the lips; giving her gifts of chocolates, wine and a bracelet on that same Christmas, and consistently throughout this time, sending her text messages suggestive of sex; which acts of the accused resulted to an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment as these caused discomfort and humiliation on his subordinate, Ms. Cindy Sheila Cobarde-Gamallo,</b> adversely affecting her and her family, thus constituting sexual harassment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>In her Complaint-Affidavit,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Gamallo averred that the first incident of sexual harassment happened one afternoon in July 1999, when Escandor called her in his office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> There, Escandor apologized for his temper the previous day when he got angry at Gamallo for the delay in the payment of her salary. Escandor, who was standing near his computer, then asked Gamallo to approach him. When she did, he "grabbed her hand, embraced her, and kissed her on the forehead."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Gamallo further narrated the succeeding incidents of sexual harassment, as follows:<br><blockquote>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One day sometime in 2000 RD Escandor called me to his office. . . . Then he said that I deserved to be happy, that I am beautiful and smart and that many men admired me. . . . To my great horror, he told me he had been attracted to me for a long time and if it was only possible, he would have prevented me from marrying Mark. ... He said he liked the way I walked . . . He declared I was the kind of woman he wanted. . .<br><br>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the afternoon of the same day, ... he gently said he loved me and he could no longer hold back his attraction to me. . . . Suddenly, I felt his hand on my thigh.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>After these incidents, Gamallo told her colleague, Lina Villamor, about what Escandor did to her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]<br>&nbsp;</sup><br>Escandor's alleged advances continued in the succeeding days, when Escandor would frequently ask Gamallo personal questions such as her mood, what she did at home and during weekends, and details about her family, among others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Because of the frequency of Escandor summoning Gamallo to his office, Gamallo related the incidents to Rafael Tagalog (Tagalog), her immediate superior. Together with Villamor, Tagalog helped Gamallo avoid situations where she would be alone with Escandor. Whenever Escandor would look for Gamallo, either Tagalog or Villamor would accompany her to his office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>However, Escandor's alleged advances did not stop. He incessantly sent Gamallo unsolicited messages through Winpop, an intra-office messaging system, such as "Hello," "How are you today," "I miss you," "You look beautiful," "You look nice in your dress," and "I love you more every day."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> When Gamallo did not reply to these messages, Escandor threatened her that she would be removed from the meeting list.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>During their Christmas party in 2000, Gamallo claimed she felt conscious as Escandor stared at her during her dance performance with her officemates. After the party, she went to get her things from the third floor of the office and when she reached the guard's station, Escandor was there. Upon reaching him, he grabbed her and was about to kiss her on the lips. However, she moved away and the kiss landed on her left check. Gamallo then ran downstairs where Villamor was waiting for her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the same year's Christmas, Gamallo received chocolates, wine, an agenda book and a bracelet from Escandor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> A few days after, Gamallo told then Asst. Regional Director of the National Economic Development Sandra Manuel (Manuel) about the incidents. Manuel advised her not to resign, but made arrangements with Tagalog and Villamor to guard her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In February 2001, while in Cebu for a workshop, Escandor tracked Gamallo and Villamor to a folk house near their hotel. He did not make any advances but insisted to pay for their drinks, which Gamallo and Villamor refused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Escandor's sexual advances allegedly continued, until Gamallo finally quit her job in November 2003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Three colleagues testified to corroborate Gamallo's account.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Villamor testified that not only had Gamallo told her about Escandor's sexual advances, but that she herself saw Escandor make such overtures, causing Gamallo great distress to the point of reducing her to tears.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> She said that after those instances, she tried to prevent Gamallo from being left alone with Escandor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Tagalog claimed that he, too, found out about the sexual harassment after he saw Escandor commit "some improper acts and advances... to wards Gamallo."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> He said that "he counseled her to give Escandor the benefit of the doubt [since] he might be undergoing a midlife crisis."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Still, as Gamallo's immediate superior, he said he did his best to "protect her from Escandor."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br>Finally, Manuel averred that in 2000, she also learned of Escandor's indiscretions—first, when Villamor told her, and second, when Gamallo herself confided in her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> She said that while she "dissuaded Gamallo from resigning," she "reported the matter to the [National Economic and Development Authority] Deputy Director General."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> This caused the latter to confront Escandor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Escandor, learning about her action "accused her of disloyalty and told her to resign from NEDA."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In his defense,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Escandor testified that he never engaged in the acts recounted by Gamallo. He claimed that the acts allegedly committed by him are "pure fabrication."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> He explained that his office was always open and its inside was visible from the outside, as their office was designed such that every room would have one door beside a large glass window measuring around four by six feet, making the people inside visible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> He also claimed that he could not have harassed Gamallo as his wife, who was employed at the same office, could also see the things happening in his office, just like the other employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>According to Escandor, the filing of the Complaint was part of an effort by a group of disgruntled employees to remove him and his wife from office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> He averred that the Complaint was also filed in retaliation to the filing of administrative cases against Gamallo's husband, Atty. Russ Mark Gamallo (Atty. Gamallo), who was also a National Economic and Development Authority employee. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br>&nbsp;<br>To prove this scheme against him, Escandor presented as lone witness John Louis Savellon, a utility worker at the National Economic and Development Authority, who testified that some of his officemates asked for his support to oust Escandor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> When he declined, Atty. Gamallo and a certain Mark Cabadsan harassed him. He also said that he heard someone say in the library, <i>"Tan awa nato asa kutob si Escandor kini kafile sa sexual harassment cases" </i>(Let us see how far Escandor can go when the sexual harassment cases are filed).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Escandor also questioned Gamallo's credibility, averring that her acts when she was still with the National Economic and Development Authority were inconsistent with her claims of sexual harassment. Escandor questioned Gamallo's signature in a Memorandum Petition indorsed to the Director General of the National Economic and Development Authority in October 2000 against the demand of Senator Osmena for Escandor's ouster.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[40]</sup></font> Escandor also questioned Gamallo's March 2003 application to be his secretary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>On October 17, 2013, the Sandiganbayan rendered a Decision<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[42]</sup></font> finding Escandor guilty of sexual harassment. It found that the prosecution was able to prove the elements of sexual harassment as defined and punished under Republic Act No. 7877.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[43]</sup></font> It gave credence to Gamallo's testimony, noting that "there is nothing in the records that would indicate that Gamallo is dishonest or untruthful."<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[44]</sup></font></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">The Sandiganbayan also noted that Escandor presented only one corroborating witness, despite identifying several individuals who were allegedly present during the incidents of sexual harassment:<br><blockquote>Escandor's testimony identifies several people who were allegedly present during the incidents recounted by Gamallo - Mrs. Escandor, his secretary, the other staff, the security guard, and so on. However, with the exception of Mrs. Escandor whose testimony was excluded, it is unfortunate for the accused that only Savellon could corroborate part of his defense that the NEDA employees allegedly schemed to oust Escandor from office. It is unbelievable, to say the least, that Escandor, a person of high rank at the NEDA, could not find other witnesses to refute Gamallo's claims, while the complainant was able to gather witnesses who testified on her behalf.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></blockquote>The Sandiganbayan disposed of the case in the following manner:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the accused Jose Romeo C. Escandor is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt and is sentenced to imprisonment for six (6) months and to pay a fine of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00), with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote>Escandor filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[47] </sup></font>where he stated that the Sandiganbayan erred in ignoring undisputed evidence and established facts on record showing the belated filing of the Complaint. He averred that the Decision "contravened the exacting test in assessing the credibility of a sexual harassment complaint."<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[48]</sup></font> He also stated that the Sandiganbayan erroneously disregarded the doctrinally settled rule in evaluating major self-contradictions and irreconcilable inconsistencies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> His motion was denied by the Sandiganbayan in its February 28, 2014 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br>Petitioner insists that the evidence fails to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> He likewise assails his conviction as having been made for an offense which was never charged in the Information since Gamallo testified to events that supposedly transpired during the Christmas Party in 2000, whereas the Information alleged sexual harassment for events that supposedly transpired during the Christmas party in 2002.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> He claims that this amounts to a violation of his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and the cause of accusation against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> <br><br>He further assails his conviction based on a complaint that was filed after the lapse of the three (3) year prescriptive period under Section 7 of Republic Act No. 7877.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>For resolution are the following issues:<br><br>First, whether or not Jose Romeo C. Escandor's guilt for sexual harassment under Republic Act No. 7877 has been established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Second, whether or not the discrepancy in the date of the Christmas party in which some complained act/s were allegedly committed suffices to absolve Jose Romeo C. Escandor of liability.<br><br>Third, whether or not the Complaint against Jose Romeo C. Escandor was filed on time.<br><br><div align="center"><b>I (A)</b><br></div><br>Republic Act No. 7877, otherwise known as the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995, was the first criminal statute enacted in the Philippines to penalize sexual harassment. It was adopted pursuant to the declared policy that "the State shall value the dignity of every individual, enhance the development of its human resources, guarantee full respect for human rights, and uphold the dignity of workers, employees, applicants for employment, students or those undergoing training, instruction or education."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>It defines sexual harassment as follows:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. <i>Work, Education or Training -Related, Sexual Harassment Defined.</i> — Work, education or training-related sexual harassment is committed by an employer, employee, manager, supervisor, agent of the employer, teacher, instructor, pi-ofessor, coach, trainor, or any other person who, having authority, influence or moral ascendancy over another in a work or training or education environment, demands, requests or otherwise requires any sexual favor from the other, regardless of whether the demand, request or requirement for submission is accepted by the object of said Act.<br><br>(a) In a work related or employment environment, sexual harassment is committed when:<br><blockquote>(1) The sexual favor is made as a condition in the hiring or in the employment, re-employment or continued employment of said individual, or in granting said individual favorable compensation, terms, conditions, promotions, or privileges; or the refusal to grant the sexual favor results in limiting, segregating or classifying the employee which in any way would discriminate, deprive or diminish employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect said employee;<br></blockquote><blockquote>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The above acts would impair the employee's rights or privileges under existing labor laws; or<br><br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The above acts would result in an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for the employee.<br></blockquote>(b) In an education or training environment, sexual harassment is committed:<br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Against one who is under the care, custody or supervision of the offender;<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Against&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one whose&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; education,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; training, apprenticeship&nbsp; or&nbsp; tutorship&nbsp;&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp; entrusted&nbsp; to&nbsp; the offender;<br><br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When the sexual favor is made a condition to the giving of a passing grade, or the granting of honors&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; scholarships,&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; the&nbsp; payment&nbsp;&nbsp; of a stipend, allowance or other benefits, privileges, or considerations; or<br><br>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; sexual&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; advances&nbsp;&nbsp; result&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment for the student, trainee or apprentice.<br></blockquote>Any person who directs or induces another to commit any act of sexual harassment as herein defined, or who cooperates in the commission thereof by another without which it would not have been committed, shall also be held liable under this Act.<br></blockquote>Sexual harassment, as initially conceived, was the product of a consciousness that emerged among women, and propelled various feminist movements. Its subsequent recognition in law is an offshoot of those campaigns.<br><br>The concept of sexual harassment began in the context of unwanted sexual relations imposed by superiors on subordinates in the workplace.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>&nbsp; As early as 1887, the plight of women working in factories and the extortion vis-a-vis sexual favors that they experience have been noted by several commentators.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> In 1840, women's moral reform societies in the United States started petition drives for statutes penalizing seduction, in response to what were then inadequate legal protection of women against sexual predation at work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In the decade before the American Civil War, women's rights movement began pursuing discussions on women's socioeconomic conditions which make them vulnerable to sexual coercion.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[59]</sup></font> Women's rights advocates publicized the case of domestic servant Hester Vaughn who was held guilty of infanticide.

It was during this time that a concerted retaliation against sexual harassment was pursued by advocates.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[62]</sup></font> The term "sexual harassment" was coined by Lin Farley during a consciousness-raising session for a Cornell University course on women and work, where the women in the discussion group repeatedly described being fired or quitting a job because they were harassed and intimidated by men.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[63]</sup></font> In her works, Farley recognized the sexual coercion women experienced at work as a "social order that situates sexual relations between men and women in relations of economic dependency."<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[64]</sup></font> In April 1975, Farley testified before the New York City Human Rights Commission Hearings on Women and Work, and defined sexual harassment as "unsolicited nonreciprocal male behavior that asserts a woman's sex role over her function as a worker."<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[65]</sup></font> Inspired by the case of Carmita Dickerson Wood, an administrative assistant at Cornell University who quit her position due to harassment by her supervisor, Farley and other women activists at Cornell formed the Working Women United, a women's rights organization that sought to combat sexual harassment of women in the workplace.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In 1979, Catharine MacKinnon published her book "Sexual Harassment of Working Women" which propelled the adoption of laws on sexual harassment in the United States.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Her central argument was that sexual harassment was sex discrimination: "Sexual harassment is discrimination 'based on sex' within the social meaning of sex, as the concept is socially incarnated in sex roles. Pervasive and 'accepted' as they are, these rigid roles have no place in the allocation of social and economic resources."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Through the works of Lin Farley and Catharine MacKinnon, the discourse on sexual harassment translated into that of anti-discrimination.<br><br>In 1964, in the United States, the Civil Rights Act prohibited acts of discrimination on the basis of sex, among others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> American jurisprudence subsequently recognized two (2) categories of sexual harassment: first, quid pro quo; and second, hostile environment sexual harassment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Quid pro quo harassment conditions employment or job benefits on sexual favors;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> while hostile environment sexual harassment results from sexual advances which make the working environment hostile or abusive to the employee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>The two types of sexual harassment recognized in American jurisprudence are akin to sexual harassment as defined under Republic Act No. 7877. Section 3(a)(l)<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[73]</sup></font> similarly recognizes that sexual harassment is committed when a sexual favor is made a condition for employment or for the grant of certain benefits. Likewise, Section 3(a)(3)<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[74]</sup></font> recognizes sexual harassment as committed when the offender's advances result in an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for the employee.<br><br>In the Philippines, the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995 is a relatively new law. Although the Revised Penal Code, enacted in 1930, already penalized offenses relating to violations of chastity, Congress saw it fit to enact a new law specifically punishing sexual harassment committed in an "employment, education, or training environment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>The original provisions of the Revised Penal Code on Rape (prior to its amendment in 1997) already punished a man who has carnal knowledge of a woman under specified circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> That the crime is committed in an employment, school, or training environment was not an element.

As to its setting, the offense may only be committed in a work-related, training-related, or education-related environment. As to the perpetrator, it may be committed by a person who exercises authority, influence, or moral ascendancy over another.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[</sup><sup>86]</sup></font><br><br>Since Republic Act No. 7877 is a special criminal statute, the offense of sexual harassment is malum prohibitum. Thus, in prosecuting an offender for sexual harassment, intent is immaterial. Mere commission is sufficient to warrant a conviction.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[87]</sup></font> The Court explained in <i>Narvasa v. Sanchez</i><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[</sup><sup>88]</sup></font> the reason why, even without intent, sexual harassment is penalized:<br><blockquote>Assuming <i>arguendo </i>that respondent never intended to violate [Republic Act No.] 7877, his attempt to kiss petitioner was a flagrant disregard of a customary rule that had existed since time immemorial — that intimate physical contact between individuals must be consensual. Respondent's defiance of custom and lack of respect for the opposite sex were more appalling because he was a married man. Respondent's act showed a low regard for women and disrespect for petitioner's honor and dignity.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[</sup><sup>89]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This is in contrast with crimes mala <i>in se, </i>which are so serious in their effects on society as to call for almost unanimous condemnation of its members.&nbsp;&nbsp; In crimes mala in se, the intent governs; but in mala prohibita, the only inquiiy is whether the law has been violated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br><i>Vedana v. Judge Valencia</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> explained that the criminalization of sexual harassment was in keeping with "humanity's march towards a more refined sense of civilization":<br><blockquote>In the community of nations, there was a time when discrimination was institutionalized through the legalization of now prohibited practices. Indeed, even within this century, persons were discriminated against merely because of gender, creed or the color of their skin, to the extent that the validity of human beings being treated as mere chattel was judicially upheld in other jurisdictions. But in humanity's march towards a more refined sense of civilization, the law has stepped in and seen it fit to condemn this type of conduct for, at bottom, history reveals that the moving force of civilization has been to realize and secure a more humane existence. Ultimately, this is what humanity as a whole seeks to attain as we strive for a better quality of life or higher standard of living. <i>Thus, in our nations very recent history, the people have spoken, through Congress, to deem conduct constitutive of sexual harassment or hazing, acts previously considered harmless by custom, as criminal.</i><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[92]</sup></font><br></blockquote>Conviction under Republic Act No. 7877 subjects the offender to criminal penalties.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[93]</sup></font> Under Section 7, any person who violates the law shall, upon conviction, be penalized by imprisonment of not less than one (1) month nor more than six (6) months, or a fine of not less than P10,000.00 nor more than P20,000.00, or both such fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the court.

The Court explained:<br><blockquote>In all the incidents complained of, the respondent's pecks on the cheeks of the complainant should be understood in the context of having been done on the occasion of some festivities, and not the assertion of the latter that she was singled out by Judge Acosta in his kissing escapades.

It thus recognizes gender-based sexual-harassment as including, among others, "misogynistic, transphobic, homophobic and sexist slurs."<br><br>The Safe Spaces Act does not undo or abandon the definition of sexual harassment under the Anti-Sexual Harassment Law of 1995. The gravamen of the offenses punished under the Safe Spaces Act is the act of sexually harassing a person on the basis of the his/her sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, while that of the offense punished under the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995 is abuse of one's authority, influence or moral ascendancy so as to enable the sexual harassment of a subordinate.<br><br>All the elements of sexual harassment, as penalized by Republic Act No. 7877, are present in this case.<br><br>Gamallo had earlier filed an administrative complaint with the National Economic Development Authority Central.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> The present case, however, is exclusively concerned with Escandor's criminal liability and will be decided exclusively of and without prejudice to his administrative liability.&nbsp; On this, we find all the requisites for criminal liability present, and sustain Escandor's conviction.<br><br>On the first requisite, it is clear that Escandor had authority over Gamallo.

Moreover, few persons are privileged indeed to transfer from one employer to another. The dearth of quality employment has become a daily "monster" roaming the streets that one may not be expected to give up one's employment easily but to hang on to it, so to speak, by all tolerable means. Perhaps, to private respondent's mind, for as long as she could outwit her employer's ploys she would continue on her job and consider them as mere occupational hazards. This uneasiness in her place of work thrived in an atmosphere of tolerance for four (4) years, and one could only imagine the prevailing anxiety and resentment, if not bitterness, that beset her all that time. But William Chua faced reality soon enough. Since he had no place in private respondent's heart, so must she have no place in his office.
