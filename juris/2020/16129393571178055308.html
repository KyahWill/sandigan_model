<p align="justify"> Petitioners Federation of Coron, Busuanga, Palawan Farmer's Association, Inc., <em>(FCBPFAI) </em>and Sandigan ng Mambubukid ng Bintuan Coron, Inc., <em>(SAMBICO) </em>are
 federations consisting of fanners in Palawan. Sometime in 2002, the 
farm lands occupied by the members of SAMBICO in Sitio Dipangan and 
Langka, Brgy. Bintuan, Coron, Palawan were placed under the coverage of 
the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program <em>(CARP) </em> by the Department of Agrarian Reform <em>(DAR). </em>The lands placed under CARP had titles in the name of Mercury Group of Companies, covering a total area of 1,752.4006 hectares.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> However, the implementation of the CARP over the 
subject lands was stopped because the said lands were unclassified 
forest land under Sec. 3(a) of P.D. No. 705 and thus, are inalienable 
and belong to the government. As these are forest lands, they are under 
the administration of the Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources <em>(DENR) </em>and not the DAR.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> In March 2014, a meeting was conducted at the office
 of the DAR, Coron, Palawan, attended by the Legal Division Region IV-B,
 where petitioner Rodolfo Cadampog, Sr. of FCBPFAI was formally informed
 that the CARP coverage will not push through because the lands were 
unclassified forest land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Similarly, members of the Samahan ng Magsasaka ng Sto. Nino <em> (SAMMASA) </em>
 alleged that they farmed the lands of Brgy. Sto. Nino, Busuanga, 
Palawan. Farming was their means of livelihood even before their 
barangay was established in the 1960s. Sometime in 1980, the farm lands 
they tilled were placed under the coverage of CARP. The land tilled by 
the farmers was originally titled under the name of a certain Jose 
Sandoval. However, the land distribution was stopped under the CARP 
because the DENR stated that the said lands were unclassified forest 
land under Sec. 3(a) of P.D. No. 705 and these forest lands belong to 
the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style4"> In April 3, 2014, petitioner Rodolfo Cadampog, Sr., of FCBPFAI received a letter from Provincial Agrari</span>an Reform Program Officer <em>(PARPO) </em>
 Conrado S. Gueverra stating that the lands of Mercury Group of 
Companies and Josefa Sandoval Vda. De Perez are within the forest 
classification of the DENR under Sec. 3 (a) of P.D. No. 705. Thus, the 
same cannot be covered by CARP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Hence, this petition to declare Sec. 3(a) of P.D. No. 705 unconstitutional. </p>
<p align="center"><strong> <u>Issue</u></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><strong> WHETHER SECTION 3(a) OF PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NO. 705 IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> Petitioners argue that Sec. 3(a) of P.D. No. 705 
violates the Philippine Bill of 1902 and the 1935, 1973 and 1987 
Constitution; that under the Philippine Bill of 1902, when an 
unclassified land is not covered by trees and has not been reserved as a
 forest land, then it is considered as an agricultural land; that Sec. 
3(a) retroactively changed the unclassified lands into forest lands; 
that the said law deprived millions of Filipinos, who possess land and 
informally settle on the land, with their vested right of ownership; 
that it unreasonably stated that unclassified land shall be forest land;
 instead, petitioners insist that unclassified land should be considered
 as alienable and disposable land of public domain; and that only those 
lands with trees and timber should be considered as forest land, and the
 rest should be considered as public agricultural land. </p>
<p align="justify"> In their Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> respondents Secretary of the DENR and DAR, as represented by the Office of the Solicitor General <em>(OSG), </em>countered that petitioners failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality of the law; that petitioners have no <em>locus standi </em>to
 file the petition; that the Philippine Bill of 1902 simply gave the 
State the power to classify lands; that pursuant to the Regalian 
Doctrine, all lands belong to the State and there must be a positive act
 from the State before the land can be alienable and disposable; that 
Sec. 3(a) of P.D. No. 705 is in accordance with the Regalian Doctrine; 
and that there is no violation of the rights of petitioners because 
unclassified lands, which are forest lands, belong to the State, hence, 
petitioners have no property rights to be violated. </p>
<p align="justify"> In their Reply,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> petitioners argued that they have the <em>locus standi </em>to
 file this petition; that prior to Sec. 3(a) of P.D. No. 705, there was 
no requirement that land must first be declared alienable and disposable
 before it could subject to private ownership; that informal settlement 
or material occupancy of vacant crown lands were allowed; that there is a
 presumption that land is agricultural unless the contrary is shown; and
 that Sec. 3(a) of P.D. No. 705 renders the implementation of the land 
reform under CARP impossible because the biggest landowner is the 
government. </p>
<p align="center"><strong> <u>The Court's Ruling</u></strong></p>
<p align="justify"> The petition lacks merit. </p>
<p align="justify"><em> Presumption of constitutionality;<br>
</em><em> locus standi</em></p>
<p align="justify"> Every statute has in its favor the presumption of 
constitutionality. This presumption is rooted in the doctrine of 
separation of powers which enjoins upon the three (3) coordinate 
departments of the government a becoming courtesy for each other's acts.
 The theory is that every law, being the joint act of the Legislature 
and the Executive, has passed careful scrutiny to ensure that it is in 
accord with the fundamental law. This Court, however, may declare a law,
 or portions thereof, unconstitutional, where a petitioner has shown a 
clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution, not merely a doubtful 
or argumentative one. In other words, the grounds for nullity must be 
beyond reasonable doubt, for to doubt is to sustain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p>
<p align="justify"> The presumption of constitutionality, in its most 
basic sense, only means that courts, in passing upon the validity of a 
law, will afford some deference to the statute and charge the party 
assailing it with the burden of showing that the act is incompatible 
with the Constitution. The doctrine comes into operation when a party 
comes to court praying that a law be set aside for being 
unconstitutional. In effect, it places a heavy burden on the act's 
assailant to prove invalidity beyond reasonable doubt; it commands the 
clearest showing of a constitutional infraction. Thus, before a law may 
be struck down as unconstitutional, courts must be certain that there 
exists a clear and unequivocal breach of the constitution, and not one 
that is speculative or argumentative.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> The fundamental criterion is that all reasonable 
doubts should be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of a 
statute. Every law has in its favor the presumption of 
constitutionality. For a law to be nullified, it must be shown that 
there is a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution. The ground 
for nullity must be clear and beyond reasonable doubt. Those who seek to
 declare the law, or parts thereof, unconstitutional, must clearly 
establish the basis therefore. Otherwise, the arguments fall short.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> In this case, petitioners assail Sec. 3(a) of P.D. 
No. 705. However, the Court finds that petitioners failed to discharge 
the heavy burden in assailing the constitutionality of the law. As will 
be discussed later, Sec. 3(a) is consistent with the Constitution, which
 adapted the Regalian Doctrine that all lands of public domain belong to
 the State. </p>
<p align="justify"> Further, petitioners failed to prove that they have the <em>locus standi </em>to raise a constitutional question. Legal standing or <em>locus standi </em>is
 defined as a "personal and substantial interest in the case such that 
the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the
 governmental act that is being challenged." For a citizen to have 
standing, he must establish that he has suffered some actual or 
threatened injury as a result of the allegedly illegal conduct of the 
government; the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action; and
 the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p>
<p align="justify"> A party is allowed to "raise a constitutional 
question" when (1) he can show that he will personally suffer some 
actual or threatened injury because of the allegedly illegal conduct of 
the government; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged 
action; and (3) the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable 
action. Jurisprudence defines interest as "material interest, an 
interest in issue and to be affected by the decree, as distinguished 
from mere interest in the question involved, or a mere incidental 
interest. By real interest is meant a present substantial interest, as 
distinguished from a mere expectancy or a future, contingent, 
subordinate, or consequential interest."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> In this case, aside from their bare assertion that 
they are recipients of the distribution of the lands in Sitio Dipangan 
and Langka, Brgy. Bintuan, Coron, and Brgy. Sto. Nino, Busuanga, Palawan
 under the CARP, petitioners failed to substantiate their claim of 
ownership and possession over the same. As properly pointed out by 
respondents, petitioners have not presented any evidence to prove that 
they actually occupy the lands much less that the lands are alienable 
and disposable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Further, 
petitioners have not even alleged that they attempted to file an 
application to have the subjects lands re-classified from forest lands 
to alienable and disposable lands of public domain with the proper 
government agency and that their application was denied. Hence, no 
actual or threatened injury can be attributed to petitioners. </p>
<p align="justify"> In any case, even on the substantive aspect, the petition fails. </p>
<p align="justify"><em> Sec. 3 (a) is constitutional; </em><em> <br>
Regalian Doctrine</em></p>
<p align="justify"> Sec. 3(a) of P.D. No. 705 states: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>(a) Public forest is the mass of lands of the public 
domain which has not been the subject of the present system of 
classification for the determination of which lands are needed for 
forest purposes and which are not. </blockquote>
</div>
<p>According to petitioner, it is against the Constitution to declare 
that unclassified lands should be treated as forest lands because it 
deprives the actual possessors of the land to claim ownership over it; 
and that under the Philippine Bill of 1902, lands of public domain are 
presumed to be agricultural lands. </p>
<p align="justify"> The argument, however, of petitioner is not of first
 impression; rather, this issue has already been settled in several 
decisions of the Court, particularly, in <em>Heirs of the late Spouses Vda. de Palanca v. Republic (Vda. De Palanca)</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and <em>The Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources </em> v. <em>Yap (Yap).</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 It is already well-settled that unclassified land cannot be considered 
as alienable and disposable land of public domain pursuant to the 
Regalian Doctrine. </p>
<p align="justify"> Pursuant to the Regalian Doctrine <em>(Jura Regalia), </em>a
 legal concept first introduced into the country from the West by Spain 
through the Laws of the Indies and the Royal Cedulas, all lands of the 
public domain belong to the State. This means that the State is the 
source of any asserted right to ownership of land, and is charged with 
the conservation of such patrimony. All lands not appearing to be 
clearly under private ownership are presumed to belong to the State. 
Also, public lands remain part of the inalienable land of the public 
domain unless the State is shown to have reclassified or alienated them 
to private persons.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> To further understand the Regalian Doctrine, a 
review of the previous Constitutions and laws is warranted. The Regalian
 Doctrine was embodied as early as in the Philippine Bill of 1902. Under
 Section 12 thereof, it was stated that all properties of the Philippine
 Islands that were acquired by the United States through the treaty with
 Spain shall be under the control of the Government of the Philippine 
Islands, to wit: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>
    <p>SECTION 12. That all the property and rights which may have been 
acquired in the Philippine Islands by the United States under the treaty
 of peace with Spain, signed December tenth, eighteen hundred and 
ninety- eight, except such land or other property as shall be designated
 by the President of the United States for military and other 
reservations of the Government of the United States, are hereby placed 
under the control of the Government of said Islands, to be administered 
for the benefit of the inhabitants thereof, except as provided in this 
Act. </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<p>The only exception in the Regalian Doctrine is native title to land, 
or ownership of land by Filipinos by virtue of a claim of ownership 
since time immemorial and independent of any grant from the Spanish 
Crown.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In <em> Cariño </em> v. <em>Insular Government,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the United States Supreme Court at that time held that: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>
    <p>It might, perhaps, be proper and sufficient to say that when, as 
far back as testimony or memory goes, the land has been held by 
individuals under a claim of private ownership, it will be presumed to 
have been held in the same way from before the Spanish conquest, and 
never to have been public land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<p>As pointed out in the case <em>of Republic </em>v. <em>Cosalan</em>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p>
<blockquote>
  <div align="justify"> Ancestral lands are covered by the concept of 
native title that "refers to pre-conquest rights to lands and domains 
which, as far back as memory reaches, have been held under a claim of 
private ownership by ICCs/IPs, have never been public lands and are thus
 indisputably presumed to have been held that way since before the 
Spanish Conquest." To reiterate, they are considered to have never been 
public lands and are thus indisputably presumed to have been held that 
way. </div>
  <p>The CA has correctly relied on the case of <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Secretary of </em><em> DENR, </em> which institutionalized the concept of native title. Thus: </p>
  <div align="justify">
    <blockquote>Every presumption is and ought to be taken against the 
Government in a case like the present. It might, perhaps, be proper and 
sufficient to say that <strong>when, as far back as testimony or memory goes, the land has been held by </strong><strong>
 individuals under a claim of private ownership, it will be presumed to 
have been held in the same way before the Spanish conquest, and never to
 have been public land.</strong></blockquote>
  </div>
  <p>From the foregoing, it appears that lands covered by the concept of native title are considered an exception to the <em>Regalian Doctrine </em>embodied
 in Article XII, Section 2 of the Constitution which provides that all 
lands of the public domain belong to the State which is the source of 
any asserted right to any ownership of land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> On the other hand, Section 13 of the Philippine Bill
 of 1902 states that the Government of the Philippine Islands could 
classify the lands of public domain either as agricultural, timber or 
mineral land. Contrary to petitioners' assertion, the law does not 
provide any presumption that a land of public domain is agricultural. 
Notably, it merely gave the said government the prerogative to classify 
land; nothing therein states that unclassified lands are <em>ipso facto </em>treated as agricultural land, which are alienable and disposable, to wit: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>SEC. 13. That the Government of the Philippine Islands, 
subject to the provisions of this Act and except as herein provided, 
shall classify according to its agricultural character and 
productiveness, and shall immediately make rules and regulations for the
 lease, sale, or other disposition of the public lands other than timber
 or mineral lands, but such rules and regulations shall not go into 
effect or have the force of law until they have received the approval of
 the President, and when approved by the President they shall be 
submitted by him to Congress at the beginning of the next ensuing 
session thereof and unless disapproved or amended by Congress at said 
session they shall at the close of such period have the force and effect
 of law in the Philippine Islands: Provided, That a single homestead 
entry shall not exceed sixteen hectares in extent. </blockquote>
</div>
<p>Further, Sec. 13 referred to the President of the United States, who 
had the power to classify public land, subject to the disapproval or 
amendment of the Congress of the United States. At that time, the 
Philippine Islands only had a Philippine Commission, which exercised the
 powers of the government,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> but did not have the power to classify lands. </p>
<p align="justify"> As the Executive and Legislative Branch in the 
Philippine Islands had no power to classify lands of public domain then,
 the Judiciary had the jurisdiction to determine for itself the 
classification of a particular parcel of land in justiciable cases. In <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>The Director of Lands (Ramos),</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and <em> Ankron v. The Government of the Philippine Islands (Ankron),</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 which were decided under the Philippine Bill of 1902, the courts had a 
right to presume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that in 
each case the lands are agricultural lands. At that moment, since there 
was no central authority in the Philippine Islands to classify lands, 
the courts had to rely on their own judicial discretion with respect to 
the classification of land. </p>
<p align="justify"> However, the power to classify the lands by the Philippine courts was finally removed in 1919 when Act No. 2874,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> or the Public Land Act, was enacted, which stated that the Governor-General in the Philippines had the power to classify land: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>SECTION 6. The Governor-General, upon the recommendation 
of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, shall from time 
to time classify the lands of the public domain into — </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div align="justify">
    <blockquote>
      <p>(a) Alienable or disposable <br>
      (b)  Timber, and <br>
      (c)  Mineral lands, </p>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  <p align="justify">and may at any time and in a like manner, transfer 
such lands from one class to another, for the purposes of their 
government and disposition.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> Then, under the 1935 Constitution, Commonwealth Act <em>(C.A.) </em>No.
 141 or the present Public Land Act, was enacted. It retained the 
provision that the President of the Philippines had the power to 
classify lands of public domain, to wit: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>
    <p>SECTION 6. <strong>The President, upon the recommendation of the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, shall from time to time classify 
the lands of the public domain into </strong> — </p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div align="justify">
    <div align="justify">
      <blockquote>
        <p>(a) Alienable or disposable <br>
        (b) Timber, and <br>
        (c) Mineral lands, </p>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    
  and may at any time and in a like manner transfer such lands from one 
class to another, for the purposes of their administration and 
disposition, (emphasis supplied) </div>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> Thus, the State, through the legislature enacting 
Act No. 2874 and C.A. No. 141, delegated to the Executive Branch the 
power to classify lands of public domain and finally removed from the 
courts the power to classify such. Accordingly, the presumption of 
agricultural classification under <em>Ankron </em>and <em> Ramos </em> 
applied by the courts was also set aside. The removal of the court's 
presumption that a public land was agricultural was succinctly discussed
 in <em> Yap, </em> citing <em>Vda. De Planca:</em></p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote><strong>Petitioner's reliance upon <em>Ramos v. Director of Lands </em>and </strong><strong><em> Ankron v. Government </em></strong><strong> is misplaced. These cases were decided under the </strong><strong> Philippine Bill of 1902 and the first Public Land Act No. 926 enacted </strong><strong>
 by the Philippine Commission on October 7, 1926, under which there was 
no legal provision vesting in the Chief Executive or President of the 
Philippines the power to classify lands of the public domain into 
mineral, timber and agricultural so that the courts then were free to 
make corresponding classifications in justiciable cases, or were vested 
with implicit power to do so, depending upon the preponderance of the 
evidence.</strong></blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> To aid the courts in resolving land registration 
cases under Act No. 926, it was then necessary to devise a presumption 
on land classification. Thus, evolved the dictum in <em>Ankron </em>that
 "the courts have a right to presume, in the absence of evidence to the 
contrary, that in each case the lands are agricultural lands until the 
contrary is shown." </p>
  <p align="justify"><strong> But We cannot unduly expand the presumption in <em>Ankron </em>and <em> De Aldecoa </em>
 to an argument that all lands of the public domain had been 
automatically reclassified as disposable and alienable agricultural 
lands. By no stretch of imagination did the presumption convert all 
lands of the public domain into agricultural lands.</strong>
  </p>
  <p align="justify"> If We accept the position of private claimants, 
the Philippine Bill of 1902 and Act No. 926 would have automatically 
made all lands in the Philippines, except those already classified as 
timber or mineral land, alienable and disposable lands. That would take 
these lands out of State ownership and worse, would be utterly 
inconsistent with and totally repugnant to the long-entrenched Regalian 
Doctrine. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"> x x x x</p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>Since 1919, courts were no longer free to determine the 
classification of lands from the facts of each case, except those that 
have already became private lands. Act No. 2874, promulgated in 1919 and
 reproduced in [Sec] 6 of [C.A.] No. 141, gave the Executive Department,
 through the President, the exclusive prerogative to classify or 
reclassify public lands into alienable or disposable, mineral or forest.
 Since then, courts no longer had the authority, whether express or 
implied, to determine the classification of lands of the public domain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </blockquote>

exception of agricultural lands, all other natural resources shall not

</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> In 1975, P.D. No. 705 was enacted and Sec. 3(a) 
thereof essentially stated that lands of the public domain which have 
not been the subject of the present system of classification are 
considered as forest land. Verily, this provision is consistent with the
 Regalian Doctrine. Lands of public domain are, by default, owned by the
 State. The only classification of land that may be subject to private 
ownership would be agricultural lands that are classified as alienable 
and disposable lands. Forest and mineral lands cannot be the subject of 
private ownership. <strong>Thus, Sec. 3(a) merely reiterates that </strong><strong>unclassified
 lands are in the same footing as forest lands because these belong to 
the State; these are not alienable and disposable land of public domain;
 and these are not subject to private ownership.</strong></p>
<p align="justify"> However, it must be emphasized that even without 
Sec. 3(a), which declared that unclassified lands are considered as 
forest lands, the exact same result shall apply - unclassified lands are
 still not subject to private ownership because they belong to the State
 and are not alienable and disposable lands of public domain. </p>
<p align="justify"> In <em>Director of Lands </em>v. <em>Intermediate Appellate Court,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
 the Court explained that when a land of public domain is unclassified, 
it cannot be released and rendered open for private disposition pursuant
 to the Regalian Doctrine and that the private applicant in a land 
registration case has the burden of proof to overcome State ownership of
 the lands of public domain, to wit: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>Lands of the public domain are classified under three main
 categories, namely: Mineral, Forest and Disposable or Alienable Lands. 
Under the Commonwealth Constitution, only agricultural lands were 
allowed to be alienated. Their disposition was provided for under [C.A.]
 Act No. 141 (Secs. 6-7), which states that it is only the President, 
upon the recommendation of the proper department head, who has the 
authority to classify the lands of the public domain into alienable or 
disposable, timber and mineral lands. Mineral and Timber or forest lands
 are not subject to private ownership unless they are first reclassified
 as agricultural lands and so released for alienation. In the absence of
 such classification, the land remains as unclassified land until 
released therefrom and rendered open to disposition. Courts have no 
authority to do so. </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> This is in consonance with the Regalian Doctrine 
that all lands of the public domain belong to the State, and that the 
State is the source of any asserted right to ownership in land and 
charged with the conservation of such patrimony. Under the Regalian 
Doctrine, all lands not otherwise appearing to be clearly within private
 ownership are presumed to belong to the State. Hence, a positive act of
 the government is needed to declassify a forest land into alienable or 
disposable land for agricultural or other purposes. </p>
  <p align="justify"> The burden of proof in overcoming the presumption 
of state ownership of the lands of the public domain is on the person 
applying for registration that the land subject of the application is 
alienable or disposable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> Similarly, in <em>Manalo </em>v. <em>Intermediate Appellate Court,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>
 it was held that when the land is unclassified, it shall not be subject
 to disposition pursuant to the Regalian Doctrine that all lands of 
public domain belong to the State, <em>viz.</em>: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>In effect, what the Court <em>a quo </em>has done is to 
release the subject property from the unclassified category, which is 
beyond their competence and jurisdiction. The classification of public 
lands is an exclusive prerogative of the Executive Department of the 
Government and not of the Courts. In the absence of such classification,
 the land remains as unclassified land until it is released therefrom 
and rendered open to disposition (Sec. 8, [C.A.] No. 141, as amended: <em>Yngson </em>v. <em>Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, </em> 123 SCRA 441 [193]; <em>Republic v. </em><em> Court of Appeals, </em>
 99 SCRA 742 [1980]. This should be so under time-honored 
Constitutional precepts. This is also in consonance with the Regalian 
Doctrine that all lands of the public domain belong to the State (Secs. 8
 &amp; 10, Art. XIV, 1973 Constitution), and that the State is the 
source of any asserted right to ownership in land and charged with the 
conservation of such patrimony <em>(Republic </em>v. <em>Court of Appeals, </em>89 SCRA 648 [1979].<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </blockquote>
</div>
<p>Indeed, under the Regalian Doctrine, all lands of the public domain 
belong to the State, which is the source of any asserted right to any 
ownership of land. All lands not appearing to be clearly within private 
ownership are presumed to belong to the State. <strong>Accordingly, 
public lands not shown to have been reclassified or released as 
alienable agricultural land or alienated to a private person by the 
State remain part of the inalienable public domain.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p>
<p align="justify"> The argument of petitioners that Sec. 3(a) of P.D. 
705 is unconstitutional because unclassified lands of public domain 
should instead be treated as agricultural land, subject to private 
disposition, is utterly baseless. The said provision is consistent with 
the Constitutional mandate of the Regalian Doctrine that lands of public
 domain, whether unclassified, forest, or mineral lands, remain within 
the ownership of the State and shall not be subject to alienation or 
disposition of private persons.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>
 Absent any positive act of the government to classify a land of public 
domain into alienable or disposable land for agricultural or other 
purposes, it remains with the State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p>
<table width="30%" border="0">

<p align="justify">Finally, petitioners argue that only those lands with
 trees and timber should be considered as forest land, and the rest 
should be considered as public agricultural land. </p>
<p align="justify"> The argument fails. </p>
<p align="justify"> Even if an island or a parcel of land has already 
been stripped of its forest cover, it does not negate its character as 
public forest. Forests, in the context of both the Public Land Act and 
the Constitution classifying lands of the public domain into 
"agricultural, forest or timber, mineral lands, and national parks", do 
not necessarily refer to large tracts of wooded land or expanses covered
 by dense growths of trees and underbrushes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> A forested area classified as forest land of the 
public domain does not lose such classification simply because loggers 
or settlers may have stripped it of its forest cover. Parcels of land 
classified as forest land may actually be covered with grass or planted 
to crops by kaingin cultivators or other farmers. "Forest lands" do not 
have to be on mountains or in out of the way places. Swampy areas 
covered by mangrove trees, nipa palms, and other trees growing in 
brackish or sea water may also be classified as forest land. The 
classification is descriptive of its legal nature or status and does not
 have to be descriptive of what the land actually looks like. <strong>Unless
 and until the land classified as "forest" is released in an official 
proclamation to that effect so that it may form part of the disposable 
agricultural lands of the public domain, the rules on confirmation of 
imperfect title do not apply.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p>
<p align="justify"> To reiterate, even if the subject lands are unclassified, these are still not subject to private ownership. In <em>Republic v. Heirs of Daquer,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the Court stated: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote><strong>While it is true that the land classification map 
does not categorically state that the islands are public forests, the 
fact that they were unclassified lands leads to the same result. In the 
absence of the classification as mineral or timber land, the land 
remains unclassified land until released and rendered open to 
disposition. </strong> When the property is still unclassified, whatever
 possession applicants may have had, and however long, still cannot 
ripen into private ownership. This is because, pursuant to 
Constitutional precepts, all lands of the public domain belong to the 
State, and the State is the source of any asserted right to ownership in
 such lands and is charged with the conservation of such patrimony. 
Thus, the Court has emphasized the need to show in registration 
proceedings that the government, through a positive act, has 
declassified inalienable public land into disposable land for 
agricultural or other purposes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (emphasis supplied) </blockquote>
</div>
<p>To subscribe to the view of petitioners - that unclassified lands 
should be presumed as disposable land, and not a forest land - would run
 afoul to the Regalian Doctrine. Any person could simply declare that a 
parcel of land of public domain is alienable and disposable by the mere 
fact that it is not covered by trees. The recognized system of 
classification of lands by the State would be destroyed and conflicting 
classifications of lands of public domain would arise. Indeed, the 
better approach is to uphold Sec. 3(a) of P.D. No. 705 because it is 
consistent with the Regalian Doctrine that all lands of public domain 
belongs to the State. </p>
<p align="justify"> In <em>Republic v. Heirs of Sin,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>
 the Court underscored that there must be a positive act from the 
Government before a land of public domain can be considered as alienable
 and disposable land of public domain: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>Under the Regalian Doctrine, which is embodied in our 
Constitution, all lands of the public domain belong to the State, which 
is the source of any asserted right to any ownership of land. All lands 
not appearing to be clearly within private ownership are presumed to 
belong to the State. Accordingly, public lands not shown to have been 
reclassified or released as alienable agricultural land or alienated to a
 private person by the State remain part of the inalienable public 
domain. Unless public land is shown to have been reclassified as 
alienable or disposable to a private person by the State, it remains 
part of the inalienable public domain. Property of the public domain is 
beyond the commerce of man and not susceptible of private appropriation 
and acquisitive prescription. Occupation thereof in the concept of owner
 no matter how long cannot ripen into ownership and be registered as a 
title. The burden of proof in overcoming the presumption of State 
ownership of the lands of the public domain is on the person applying 
for registration (or claiming ownership), who must prove that the land 
subject of the application is alienable or disposable. To overcome this 
presumption, incontrovertible evidence must be established that the land
 subject of the application (or claim) is alienable or disposable. </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><strong> There must be a positive act declaring 
land of the public domain as alienable and disposable. To prove that the
 land subject of an application for registration is alienable, the 
applicant must establish the existence of a positive act of the 
government, </strong> such as a presidential proclamation or an 
executive order; an administrative action; investigation reports of 
Bureau of Lands investigators; and a legislative act or a statute. The 
applicant may also secure a certification from the government that the 
land claimed to have been possessed for the required number of years is 
alienable and disposable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (emphasis supplied) </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> In effect, as petitioners failed to assail Sec. 3(a)
 of P.D. No. 705, which is consistent with the Regalian Doctrine, 
wherein the subject lands remain within the ownership of the State. To 
repeat, the burden of proof in overcoming the presumption of state 
ownership of the lands of the public domain is on the person applying 
for registration that the land subject of the application is alienable 
or disposable. Unless public land is shown to have been reclassified as 
alienable or disposable to a private person by the State, it remains 
part of the inalienable public domain. Property of the public domain is 
beyond the commerce of man and not susceptible of private appropriation 
and acquisitive prescription. Occupation thereof in the concept of owner
 no matter how long cannot ripen into ownership and be registered as a 
title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In other words, 
petitioners have no vested right over the subject lands because these 
unclassified lands belong to the State, hence, no private right was 
violated by the State. </p>
<p align="justify"> Verily, Sec. 3(a) of P.D. No. 705 is not 
unconstitutional because it merely enforces the Regalian Doctrine in 
favor of the State. No amount of possession will expose the subject 
lands to private ownership. Petitioners should not seek to devoid the 
said statutory provision; instead, they should proceed to the Executive 
Department, through the Secretary of DENR, to establish that the subject
 unclassified forest lands must be re-classified to alienable and 
disposable lands of public domain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>
 Only when the lands of public domain are classified as alienable or 
disposable, may petitioners assert their property rights over the 
subject lands. </p>
<p align="justify"><em> Remedy is beyond the courts</em></p>
<p align="justify"> Assuming that petitioners have indeed been tilling 
the subject lands, which they eventually discovered to be unclassified 
forest lands of public domain, hence, non-registrable, the Court 
commiserates with their predicament. It is distressing for a farmer to 
physically possess and till a parcel of land for decades, or even 
generations, only to discover that it is not subject to disposition and 
alienation simply because it is an unclassified land or a forest land of
 public domain. However, as thoroughly discussed-above, the assailed 
provision Sec. 3(a) of P.D. No. 705 is constitutional because it is 
consistent with the Regalian Doctrine. In such a case, the farmer must 
undergo the tedious process for the reclassification of land to be 
alienable and disposable; the authority to reclassify is lodged with the
 central executive government. It is settled that the declaration of 
alienability must be through executive fiat, as exercised by the 
Secretary of the DENR.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> As the centralized process may be beyond the farmer's reach and means, the land ultimately remains untitled. </p>
<p align="justify"> Notably, as the Court painstakingly discussed in <em>Heirs of Malabanan </em>v. <em> Republic</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the difficulty arising from the classification of land is attributable to the policy of the law itself: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>A final word. The Court is comfortable with the 
correctness of the legal doctrines established in this decision. 
Nonetheless, discomfiture over the implications of today's ruling cannot
 be discounted. For, every untitled property that is occupied in the 
country will be affected by this ruling. The social implications cannot 
be dismissed lightly, and the Court would be abdicating its social 
responsibility to the Filipino people if we simply levied the law 
without comment. </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> The informal settlement of public lands, whether 
declared alienable or not, is a phenomenon tied to long-standing habit 
and cultural acquiescence, and is common among the so-called "Third 
World" countries. This paradigm powerfully evokes the disconnect between
 a legal system and the reality on the ground. The law so far has been 
unable to bridge that gap. Alternative means of acquisition of these 
public domain lands, such as through homestead or free patent, have 
proven unattractive due to limitations imposed on the grantee in the 
encumbrance or alienation of said properties. Judicial confirmation of 
imperfect title has emerged as the most viable, if not the most 
attractive means to regularize the informal settlement of alienable or 
disposable lands of the public domain, yet even that system, as revealed
 in this decision, has considerable limits. </p>
  <p align="justify">There are millions upon millions of Filipinos who 
have individually or exclusively held residential lands on which they 
have lived and raised their families. Many more have tilled and made 
productive idle lands of the State with their hands. They have been 
regarded for generation by their families and their communities as 
common law owners. There is much to be said about the virtues of 
according them legitimate states. Yet such virtues are not for the Court
 to translate into positive law, as the law itself considered such lands
 as property of the public dominion. It could only be up to Congress to 
set forth a new phase of land reform to sensibly regularize and 
formalize the settlement of such lands which in legal theory are lands 
of the public domain before the problem becomes insoluble. This could be
 accomplished, to cite two examples, by liberalizing the standards for 
judicial confirmation of imperfect title, or amending the Civil Code 
itself to ease the requisites for the conversion of public dominion 
property into patrimonial.
  </p>
  <p align="justify"> One's sense of security over land rights infuses 
into every aspect of well-being not only of that individual, but also to
 the person's family. Once that sense of security is deprived, life and 
livelihood are put on stasis. It is for the political branches to bring 
welcome closure to the long pestering problem.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> C.A. No. 141 could be improved with respect to 
manner and method of classifying land. Instead of giving the President, 
through his alter ego the Secretary of DENR, the sole power to classify 
lands of public domain, this authority could be decentralized and 
simplified so that the masses, especially the farmers of the far-flung 
provinces, would not have to rely on the central executive government in
 order to secure a title in their land. Of course, decentralization of 
the governmental functions has both positive and negative impact on 
State regulation, which must be thoroughly studied and deliberated by 
policy-makers. </p>
<p align="justify"> In any case, the remedy that petitioners seek is 
definitely beyond the powers of the Court; Rather, it is matter of 
policy that must be addressed by the other branches of government. 
Indeed, the question of wisdom of the law is beyond the province of this
 Court to inquire. An inquiry of that sort amounts to a derogation of 
the principle of separation of powers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p>

<p align="justify"> Petitioners are federations of farmers in Coron and 
Busuanga, Palawan, whose lands were placed under the coverage of the 
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. They allege that since 1960, they
 had been tilling and occupying the parcels of land registered under the
 Mercury Group of Companies and Jose Sandoval.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> However, the Department of Agrarian Reform

<p align="justify"> This Petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> assails the constitutionality of Section 3(a) of Presidential Decree No. 705. The provision reads: </p>

  <p>First, petitioners aver that the declaration of all unclassified public lands as public forests contravenes the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> They argue that past and present constitutions have consistently classified public lands depending on their character.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 They contend that Section 3(a) of Presidential Decree No. 705 violates 
this constitutional prescription because it automatically converts all 
public lands as forest land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p>
</div>
<p align="justify"> Second, petitioners contend that the provision violates due process because it is an undue deprivation of property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 They argue that under Act No. 926, the first Public Land Act, all 
public agricultural lands possessed since July 26, 1894 were converted 
into private lands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
Pursuant to this law, an occupant-owner can apply for judicial 
confirmation of imperfect title or free patent under Act No. 2874 and 
Commonwealth Act No. 141 without prior declaration that the land is 
alienable and disposable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Through this process, ownership is not acquired but merely confirmed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Petitioners further argue that Presidential Decree 
No. 705 disregarded vested ownership when it required prior 
classification of land as alienable and disposable for the purposes of 
prescription or confirmation of title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
 By classifying all public lands as forests, the law effectively 
declares as inalienable lands that have been declared as agricultural 
under the 1935, 1973, and 1987 Constitutions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Petitioners further lament the disconnect between 
the law and the actual classifications of land, claiming that under 
Section 3 (a) of Presidential Decree No. 705, all unclassified lands 
were automatically reclassified as forests regardless of their nature. 
They point out that with the current law, there are urbanized lands 
without trees but are still considered forests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> In their Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 respondents claim that petitioners do not have the legal standing to 
file the Petition as they have failed to show that they sustained any 
real injury.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Respondents also maintain that Section 3(a) of 
Presidential Decree No. 705 is not unconstitutional because it is 
consistent with the Constitution and the regalian doctrine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 They assert that petitioners are mistaken in their interpretation of 
Philippine Bill of 1902 and Act No. 926 because there is no presumption 
that all public lands are converted to agricultural lands under Act No. 
926. The law merely laid down how land registration courts should 
classify public domain lands. Ultimately, they maintain, classification 
still depends on the proof presented.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Respondents argue that pursuant to the regalian 
doctrine and Article XII, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution, all lands 
of public domain are owned by the State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 They assert that Section 3(a) of Presidential Decree No. 705 merely 
echoes this recognition in categorizing all unclassified lands of public
 domain as public forests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Respondents further dispute petitioners' claim that 
Section 3(a) is an undue deprivation of property. Considering that there
 was no automatic classification of lands as agricultural lands, they 
claim that the unclassified lands remained part of the public domain and
 no property right on these lands was vested upon their occupants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> In their Reply,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 petitioners assert that they have the legal standing to file the 
Petition because their property rights are affected by Presidential 
Decree No. 705.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Moreover, 
they claim that their Petition raises an issue of transcendental 
importance because it is bound to affect Filipinos who have occupied and
 tilled lands for generations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Petitioners reiterate that before Presidential 
Decree No. 705 took effect, there was no requirement that agricultural 
lands first be declared alienable and disposable before being registered
 under Commonwealth Act No. 141.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
 They point out that public agricultural lands are lands acquired from 
Spain that are neither timber nor mineral in nature and these lands are 
alienable; hence, they are no longer subject to presidential or 
congressional declaration of alienability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
 The presumption that the land is agricultural still holds true. The 
government can make a forest reservation on public agricultural lands 
but subject to prior vested rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Petitioners add that that this presumption is 
consistent with Article 421 of the Civil Code. Under this provision, 
there is no need for a prior declaration of alienability or 
manifestation that a public agricultural land is not intended for public
 use or service for it to be considered patrimonial property of the 
State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Rather, they say 
that the property is presumed patrimonial, and the State bears the 
burden to declare that the land is intended for public service or use 
for it to become part of public dominion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Petitioners further aver that under Sections 32 and 
54 of Act No. 926, public agricultural lands were not only considered 
alienable, but deemed alienated as they were opened to homestead, sale, 
or lease application.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Such lands will only be withdrawn from disposition after the declaration that they a non-alienable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Moreover, the requirement of declaration of alienability only applied to reclassification of forest to agricultural lands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Petitioners point out that since <em>Cariño </em>v. <em>Insular Government,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> jurisprudence has held that public agricultural land may be automatically converted to private property by prescription.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>
 Section 3(a) of Presidential Decree No. 705 is, in effect, a 
State-sponsored grabbing of agricultural land whose ownership is already
 vested on its occupants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Lastly, petitioners argue that Section 3(a) renders the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program useless,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> as it automatically converts all unclassified lands into forest lands, which cannot be covered by agrarian reform.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> The <em>ponencia </em>dismissed the Petition. First,
 it held that petitioners have no legal standing to file the Petition 
because they failed to show real and actual injury.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Second, the <em>ponencia </em>reasons that 
"unclassified land[s] cannot be considered alienable and disposable land
 of public domain pursuant to the Regalian doctrine."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>
 It maintains that there is no presumption that a land of public domain 
is agricultural. The Constitution and the laws merely allowed the 
government to classify lands of public domain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> According to the <em>ponencia, </em>while Section 
3(a) of Presidential Decree No. 705 indeed declared unclassified lands 
of public domain as forests, it is not unconstitutional because it is in
 accord with the regalian doctrine, which the <em>ponencia </em>says is incorporated in the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>
 It adds that Section 3(a) "merely reiterates that unclassified lands 
are in the same footing as forest lands because these belong to the 
State; these are not alienable and disposable land of public domain; and
 these are not subject to private ownership."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Even without this provision, the <em>ponencia </em>maintains
 that "unclassified lands are still not subject to private ownership 
because they belong to the State and are not alienable and disposable 
lands of public domain."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> To <em>the ponencia, </em>petitioners' view that 
unclassified lands are presumed disposable violates the regalian 
doctrine. As settled by this Court, for a land to be considered 
alienable and disposable land of public domain, there must be a positive
 act from the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Until then, the land remains part of the public domain and its occupation cannot ripen into ownership.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Third, the <em>ponencia </em>held the classification
 of a land as forest does not refer to its actual nature, but is only a 
legal description. Hence, even if a parcel of land no longer has forest 
cover, it may still be classified as a public forest under the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> The <em>ponencia </em>concludes that the issue presented by petitioners is a question of policy—a matter beyond the jurisdiction of this Court. </p>
<p align="justify"> Let me express a few points. </p>
<p align="justify"> The regalian doctrine, while often repeated in our 
jurisprudence, is a legal fiction that has no clear constitutional 
mooring. It presumes that all lands are public based on the premise that
 the State's land ownership was passed down from the Spanish Crown. 
However, this concept is not textually expressed in our Constitution. 
Article XII, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution only states that all 
lands of public domain are owned by the State, but nowhere does it 
provide that all unclassified and untitled lands are presumed public 
lands. </p>
<p align="justify"> Thus, lands shall not be presumed as part of the 
public domain and shall remain as such unless the State reclassifies 
them as alienable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Jurisprudence since <em>Cariño</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>
 has acknowledged that there are lands that have never become part of 
the public domain, even if they are found untitled and unregistered. </p>
<p align="justify"> Further, Section 15 of the Presidential Decree No. 
705 must be declared unconstitutional because it violates due process. 
It declares all unclassified lands as forests without regard to lands 
whose ownership are already vested upon its occupants. </p>
<p align="justify"> The definition of public forest in Section 3(a) must
 be read in conjunction with Section 15, which uses a single criterion 
in determining in classifying lands. Using the land's slope as the sole 
factor in classifying land as forest or as timber land is patently 
arbitrary. </p>
<p align="center"><strong> I </strong></p>
<p align="justify"> In the precolonial era, land ownership in the Philippines was communal in nature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Land titles were vested not to natural persons but to the communal barangay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">When the Spaniards came, the recognition of property 
rights transitioned to individual ownership and the titling of land was 
introduced. While communal ownership was still acknowledged, only 
individual ownership and rights were deemed alienable and were allowed 
documentation
and registration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Royal decrees allowed for the titling of lands when "long and continuous possession" was shown.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Claimants then had to prove tradition and submit 
witness depositions. Alleging that this process caused controversy, the 
Spanish government required all landowners to obtain official 
documentation of their ownership.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In 1893, the Spanish Mortgage Law put in place a systematic registration of titles.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>
 However, due to government officials' abuses, lack of effective notice,
 illiteracy, and the costs of registration, land ownership registration 
became inaccessible to a large majority of natives, who could "only show
 their title by actual possession."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>
 In an attempt to address this problem, a unilateral registration 
deadline was imposed through the Maura Law of 1894—the law that presaged
 the regalian doctrine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> As provided in its preamble, the Maura Law sought to
 "insure to the natives, in the future, whenever it may be possible, the
 necessarily land for cultivation, in accordance with traditional 
usages." However, this policy is contradicted by Article 4 of the law, 
which stated that lands not titled will "revert back to the State." The 
provision further stated that "[a]ny claim to such lands by those who 
might have applied for adjustment of the same but have not done so [on 
April 17, 1895], will not avail themselves in any way nor at any time."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> With the Maura Law in place, the recognition of customary land rights was effectively denied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> It introduced a legal concept that presumed all undocumented lands as owned by the Spanish Crown and its  successors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> This policy was cemented in the 1898 Treaty of 
Paris, which expressly stated that "all immovable properties . . . 
belong to the Crown of Spain and were to be ceded and relinquished to 
the new colonial master."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> It was also textually reflected in the Philippine Bill of 1902. Section 12 stated: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>SECTION 12. <em>That all the property and rights which may have been </em><em> acquired in the Philippine Islands by the United States under the treaty of</em>
    <em>peace with Spain, </em> signed December tenth, eighteen hundred 
and ninety- eight, except such land or other property as shall be 
designated by the President of the United States for military and other 
reservations of the Government of the United States, <em>are hereby placed under the control of the Government of said Islands, </em> to be administered for the benefit of the inhabitants thereof, except as provided in this Act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the 1904 case of <em>Valenton </em>v. <em>Murciano,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> the regalian doctrine was first introduced in our jurisprudence. In <em>Valenton, </em>claimants
 alleged ownership over a parcel of untitled public land based on 
adverse possession for over 30 years, counting from 1860 until they 
filed the case in 1890. In dismissing the case, this Court ruled that 
there was no right of prescription against the State as to public lands.
 It explained: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>It happened, in the course of time, that tracts of the 
public land were found in the possession of persons who either had no 
title papers therefor issued by the State, or whose title papers were 
defective, either because the proper procedure had not been followed or 
because they had been issued by persons who had no authority to do so. 
Law 14, title 12, book 4 of said compilation (referred to in the 
regulations of June 25, 1880, for the Philippines) was the first of a 
long series of legislative acts intended to compel those in possession 
of the public lands, without written evidence of title, or with 
defective title papers, to present evidence as to their possession or 
grants, and obtain the confirmation of their claim to ownership. . . . </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">. . . .</p>
  <p align="justify"> While the State has always recognized the right of
 the occupant to a deed if he proves a possession for a sufficient 
length of time, yet it has always insisted that he must make that proof 
before the proper administrative officers, and obtain from them his 
deed, and until he did that the State remained the absolute owner. </p>
  <p align="justify"><em> In the preamble of this law there is, as is 
seen, a distinct statement that all those lands belong to the Crown 
which have not been granted by </em><em> Philip, or in his name, or by 
the kings who preceded him. This statement excludes the idea that there 
might be lands not so granted, that did not belong to the king. It 
excludes the idea that the king was not still the owner of all ungranted lands, because some private person had been in the adverse 
occupation of them. </em> By the mandatory part of the law all the 
occupants of the public lands are required to produce before the 
authorities named, and within a time to be fixed by them, their title 
papers. And those who had good title or showed prescription were to be 
protected in their holdings. It is apparent that it was not the 
intention of the law that mere possession for a length of time should 
make the possessors the owners of the lands possessed by them without 
any action on the part of the authorities. It is plain that they were 
required to present their claims to the authorities and obtain a 
confirmation thereof. What the period of prescription mentioned in this 
law was does not appear, but later, in 1646, law 19 of the same title 
declared "that no one shall be 'admitted to adjustment' unless he has 
possessed the lands for ten years."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> Nevertheless, the 1909 case of <em>Cariño </em>v. <em>Insular Government</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> rectified this doctrine and held that not all lands are presumed part of public domain. </p>
<p align="justify"> In <em>Cariño, </em>Mateo Cariño claimed that he and
 his ancestors had occupied and tilled a land in Benguet since time 
immemorial, one he had inherited the land in accordance with Igorot 
custom. He said that the land was not titled pursuant to the Spanish 
royal decrees despite his application in 1893 to 1894 and 1896 to 1897. 
Thus, in 1902, Cariño applied for ownership, though he could only show a
 possessory title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> His petition before the Court of Land Registration 
was approved, but this was reversed on appeal before the Benguet Court 
of First Instance. When the case reached the Philippine Supreme Court in
 1906, the ruling was affirmed. Citing Article 4 of the Maura Law, the 
Court reasoned that Cariño could no longer assert ownership over the land
 after he had failed to have it registered within the period set in the 
law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Upon appeal, the United States Supreme Court ruled 
in favor of Cariño. It held that the United States was not bound to 
assert the same powers held by its predecessor, and the government must 
respect the rights under the laws of the United States, including due 
process rights, granted in favor of Cariño.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Thus: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>If we suppose for the moment that the government's 
contention is so far correct that the Crown of Spain in form asserted a 
title to this land at the date of the Treaty of Paris, to which the 
United States succeeded, it is not to be assumed without argument that 
the plaintiffs case is at an end. It is true that Spain, in its earlier 
decrees, embodied the universal feudal theory that all lands were held 
from the Crown, and perhaps the general attitude of conquering nations 
toward people not recognized as entitled to the treatment accorded to 
those in the same zone of civilization with themselves. It is true, 
also, that, in legal theory, sovereignty is absolute, and that, as 
against foreign nations, the United States may assert, as Spain 
asserted, absolute power. But it does not follow that, as against the 
inhabitants of the Philippines, the United States asserts that Spain had
 such power. When theory is left on one side, sovereignty is a question 
of strength, and may vary in degree. How far a new sovereign shall 
insist upon the theoretical relation of the subjects to the head in the 
past, and how far it shall recognize actual facts, are matters for it to
 decide. </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> The Province of Benguet was inhabited by a tribe 
that the Solicitor- General, in his argument, characterized as a savage 
tribe that never was brought under the civil or military government of 
the Spanish Crown. It seems probable, if not certain, that the Spanish 
officials would not have granted to anyone in that province the 
registration to which formerly the plaintiff was entitled by the Spanish
 laws, and which would have made his title beyond question good. 
Whatever may have been the technical position of Spain it does not 
follow that, in the view of the United States, he had lost all rights 
and was a mere trespasser when the present government seized his land. 
The argument to that effect seems to amount to a denial of native titles
 throughout an important part of the Island of Luzon, at least, for the 
want of ceremonies which the Spaniards would not have permitted and had 
not the power to enforce.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The United States Supreme Court explained that under
 the Philippine Bill of 1902, "all the property and rights acquired 
there by the United States are to be administered 'for the benefit of 
the inhabitants thereof.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>
 It added that the same charter likewise guarded against undue 
deprivation of property. Taking these into consideration, the United 
States Supreme Court held that due process rightfully extended to 
unregistered and untitled properties whose owners presumably have not 
heard and availed of the registration processes. In the same vein, the 
charter did not consider as part of public domain lands held "by native 
custom and by long association."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Cariño  further pointed out that the presumption 
ought to be against the State. Thus, in cases where the land in question
 has been held since time immemorial, it must be presumed to have been 
held in private ownership before the Spanish occupation and never to 
have been public land. The United States Supreme Court held: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>Whatever the law upon these points may be, and we mean to 
go no further than the necessities of decision demand, every presumption
 is and ought to be against the government in a case like the present. 
It might, perhaps, be proper and sufficient to say that when, as far 
back as testimony or memory goes, the land has been held by individuals 
under a claim of private ownership, it will be presumed to have been 
held in the same way from before the Spanish conquest, and never to have
 been public land. Certainly in a case like this, if there is doubt or 
ambiguity in the Spanish law, we ought to give the applicant the benefit
 of the doubt. Whether justice to the natives and the import of the 
Organic Act ought not to carry us beyond a subtle examination of ancient
 texts, or perhaps even beyond the attitudes of Spanish law, humane 
though it was, it is unnecessary to decide. If, in a tacit way, it was 
assumed that the wild tribes of the Philippines were to be dealt with as
 the power and inclination of the conqueror might dictate, Congress has 
not yet sanctioned the same course as the proper one "for the benefit of
 the inhabitants thereof."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> </blockquote>

<p><em>Cariño</em>  does not only embrace ancestral land rights, but it applies to all people who have held land since time immemorial. </p>
<p align="justify"> The ruling establishes two important doctrines. 
First, it affirms the people's constitutional right over the land since 
time immemorial; and second, it settles that the Spanish colonial 
concept of regalian doctrine did not extend to the American occupation 
and to the subsequent organic acts enacted.  <em>Cariño</em>  concludes that the Maura Law "should not be construed as confiscation, but as the withdrawal of a privilege"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> to register a title. </p>
<p align="justify"> In 1903, Act No. 926, otherwise known as the Public 
Land Act, mandated the expropriation of "unoccupied, unreserved, 
unappropriated agricultural public land" through homestead.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>
 It continued to require registration and titling of land ownership, but
 it also provided a presumption in favor of persons who have openly, 
continuously, exclusively, and notoriously possessed and occupied 
agricultural public lands. Section 54(6) of Act No. 926 states: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>6. <em>All persons who by themselves or their predecessors
 in interest has been in the open, continuous exclusive, and notorious 
possession and occupation of agricultural public lands, </em> as defined
 by said Act of Congress of July first, nineteen hundred and two, under a
 bona fide claim of ownership except as against the Government, for a 
period of ten years next preceding the taking effect of this Act except 
when prevented by war or force majeure, shall be <em>conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a government grant and to have received the same, </em>and shall be entitled to a certificate of title to such land under the provisions of this chapter. </blockquote>
</div>
<p>Similar to <em>Cariño, </em>the Public Land Act provides for judicial confirmation in affirming the native title claims. However, unlike Cariño<em>, </em>the
 Public Land Act no longer demands a claim of ownership based on 
occupation "since time immemorial." Rather, it only requires possession 
and occupation for a specified number of years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> This provision was reiterated in Section 44 of 
Commonwealth Act No. 141, which grants free patents to citizens who do 
not own more than 24 hectares of land and have "continuously occupied 
and cultivated . . . agricultural public lands" since July 4, 1955.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> This provision was central in the 1980 case of <em>Herico v.</em> <em>Dar.</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> In <em> Herico, </em>
 this Court ruled that upon compliance with the provision, the possessor
 acquires a right to a grant even without a certificate of title. As a 
result, the land is acknowledged as privately owned, withdrawn from the 
public domain. </p>
<p align="justify"> In 1956, a free patent was granted to respondent 
Cipriano Dar (Dar) after claiming that he has possessed and cultivated a
 parcel of land since 1922. According to a report of a Public Land 
Inspector, nobody else claimed the land and Dar cultivated around 8.6 
hectares of land, introducing 700 coconut trees ranging from 20 to 30 
years. Subsequently, petitioner Moises Herico (Herico) filed a complaint
 seeking the cancellation of Dar's title, which was granted by the Court
 of First Instance. This was reversed by the Court of Appeals. </p>
<p align="justify"> Upon appeal, this Court reversed the appellate 
court's decision. It found that Herico's predecessors-in-interest 
possessed the land way back in 1914 and declared the land for taxation 
purposes in 1940—earlier than Dar's tax declaration in 1952. It ruled 
that under Republic Act No. 1942, the law amending Commonwealth Act No. 
141, Herico's occupation and cultivation for more than 30 years since 
1914 has vested on him title over the land. The land, then, has been 
effectively withdrawn from public dominion. This Court expounded: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>As interpreted in several cases when the conditions as 
specified in the foregoing provision are complied with, the possessor is
 deemed to have acquired, by operation of law, a right to a grant, a 
government grant, without the necessity of a certificate of title being 
issued. The land, therefore, ceases to be of the public domain, and 
beyond the authority of the Director of Lands to dispose of. The 
application for confirmation is a mere formality, the lack of which does
 not affect the legal sufficiency of the title as would be evidenced by 
the patent and the Torrens title to be issued upon the strength of said 
patent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (Citation omitted) </blockquote>
</div>
<p align="justify">The judicial confirmation of title under Section 
48(b) of Commonwealth Act No. 141 was later amended by Republic Act No. 
1942. It dispensed with the requirement of possession beginning not 
later than July 26, 1984, removed the phrase "except as against the 
Government," and qualified the possession "under a bona fide claim of 
acquisition of ownership."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"><em> Cariño </em> and <em>Herico </em>affirm that 
ownership claims based on long occupation and possession of land are 
still recognized in our system. They
recognize that not all untitled lands are automatically deemed part of 
the public domain and that there is no absolute presumption that all 
lands are presumed public lands. The due process clause, present from 
Philippine Bill of 1902 to the present Constitution, respects acquired 
ownership of land, whether or not ownership is confirmed by a title. </p>
<p align="justify"> Thus, I agree with the <em>ponencia </em>that a 
"native title to land, or ownership of land by Filipinos by virtue of a 
claim of ownership since time immemorial and independent of any grant 
from the Spanish Crown[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> is an exception to the regalian doctrine. </p>
<p align="justify"> This pronouncement not only affirms the validity of a <em>native </em>title,
 but also shows respect and sensitivity by doing away with the reference
 to "indigenous" or the pejorative "tribal," which is astute and 
prescient. </p>
<p align="justify"> We are all natives in relation to our ancestral 
properties. The distinction of tribal or indigenous was introduced by 
our colonizers to convince their metropolis that there were "civilized" 
and "uncivilized" among us. Through their many laws, they favored 
ethnolinguistic groups, such as Tagalogs and Ilocanos, that easily 
succumbed to their rule and painfully marginalized indigenous groups 
through the legal order, suggesting that they are weak and uncivilized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> The distinction was a political device employed by 
the Spanish colonizers who labeled as "uncivilized" Filipinos who 
refused to identify as Christians, and as "civilized" those who were 
converted and who were subservient to the Spaniards and their beliefs. 
This dichotomy was further utilized by the Americans, who labeled 
uncolonized groups as "non-Christian tribes." As Professor Owen J. Lynch
 observed: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>At the end of the Spanish era an estimated ten to twenty 
percent of the native population continued to live outside the colonial 
pale. Most either belonged to Islamicized communities in the southern 
parts of the colony or lived among the upland interiors of the major 
islands. The U.S. Regime generically labeled these labeled these peoples
 as 'non-Christian tribes.' An official Christian/non-Christian 
dichotomy ensued and was reified in the minds of the colonial elites. 
The dichotomy ignored the indigenous cultural traits that endured among 
the Hispanicized, the varied degrees of Hispanization among ostensible 
Christians, and the cultural variations among those labeled 
non-Christian. </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> One of the greatest, and largely unrecognized, 
ironies of the Taft era was the tendency to overlook the wide spectrum 
of westernized acculturation among the Philippine masses, as well as the
 enduring indigenous influences in their lives. As a result, the much 
disdained Hispanicized peasantry was lumped together and 
indiscriminately labeled, along with Filipino elites, as 'civilized.' 
Worcester insisted that people from the three main Christian ethnic 
groups, i.e. the Tagalogs, Ilocanos, and Visayans, were culturally 
homogeneous and 'to be treated as a class.'. . .<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> The benefit of possession since time immemorial 
means that the holding of the property as an owner must be unbroken. It 
should not discriminate between a marginal farmer, whose ethnicity is 
not yet categorized as "indigenous," and a Tagbanua or Palawanon. </p>
<p align="justify"><em> Cariño </em> is a correction of the colonial 
illusion that all land rights and titles emanated from the Spanish 
Crown. However, despite its promulgation, <em>Cariño </em>was 
deliberately ignored by the U.S. regime. The errors in our land 
policies, especially on ancestral domain rights, were never reviewed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Thus, the <em>ponencia's </em>assertion and affirmation of the doctrine in <em>Cariño<u> </u></em>is
 a relief not only to indigenous groups, but also to many marginalized 
people who have long struggled to defend the native titles to their 
lands. </p>
<p align="center"><strong> II</strong></p>
<p align="justify"> The Philippine Bill of 1902 granted the colonial 
government the authority to classify public lands into agricultural, 
timber, or mineral lands, depending on their "agricultural character and
 productiveness[.]" Section 13 of Philippine Bill of 1902 provides: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>SECTION 13. <em>That the Government of the Philippine Islands, </em> subject to the provisions of this Act and except as herein provided, <em>shall

have the force of law until they have received the approval of the 
President, and when approved by the President they shall be submitted by
 him to Congress at the beginning of the next ensuing session thereof 
and unless disapproved or amended by Congress at said session they shall
 at the close of such period have the force and effect of law in the 
Philippine Islands: Provided, That a single homestead entry shall not 
exceed sixteen hectares in extent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the 1908 case of <em>Mapa </em>v. <em>Insular Government,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> this Court settled the scope and meaning of agricultural land vis-a-vis other land classifications. </p>
<p align="justify"> In <em>Mapa, </em>petitioner Cirilo Mapa (Mapa) 
sought registration of his land, a lowland he and his ancestors had 
uninterruptedly possessed and used as fish pond, nipa lands, and salt 
deposits. The government opposed this, saying his land was not 
agricultural land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> In that case, this Court determined whether the land
 was an agricultural land within the meaning of Section 54 of Act No. 
926. The provision reads: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>SECTION 54. The following described persons or their legal
 successors in right, occupying public lands in the Philippine Islands, 
or claiming to own any such lands or an interest therein, but whose 
titles to such lands have not been perfected, may apply to the Court of 
Land Registration of the Philippine Islands for confirmation of their 
claims and the issuances of a certificate of title therefor, to wit: </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">. . . .</p>
  <p align="justify"> 6) All persons who by themselves or their 
predecessors in interest have been in the open, continuous exclusive, 
and notorious possession and occupation of agricultural public lands, as
 defined by said act of Congress of July first, nineteen hundred and 
two, under a bona fide claim of ownership except as against the 
Government, for a period of ten years next preceding the taking effect 
of this act, except when prevented by war, or force majeure, shall be 
conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a
 Government grant and to have received the same, and shall be entitled 
to a certificate of title to such land under the provisions of this 
chapter. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> This Court, ruling in favor of Mapa, held that 
Section 13 of the Philippine Bill of 1902 did not provide an exact 
standard and definition of what comprises an agricultural land. 
Nevertheless, Section 13 stated that it was incumbent upon the 
government to "[m]ake rules and regulations for the lease, sale, or 
other disposition of the public lands other than timber or mineral 
lands."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Referring to the 
definition in the Public Land Act, this Court ruled that the phrase 
"agricultural land" embraced those lands which are not timber or mineral
 lands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> This definition was expanded later in <em>Ramos v. Director of Lands,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> which settled that the presumption that land is agricultural in nature absent proof to the contrary. </p>
<p align="justify"> In <em>Ramos, </em>petitioner Cornelio Ramos (Ramos)
 sought the registration of his possessory title over a land under 
Section 54 of the Public Land Act.The Director of Lands opposed, arguing
 that Ramos had not acquired a good  title from the Spanish government 
and that the land was a forest land. The trial court denied the 
registration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Upon appeal, this Court upheld the presumption that 
lands are agricultural in nature and ruled in favor of Ramos. It 
explained that under the Philippine Bill of 1902 and the Public Land 
Act, the determination of the land's classification is by exclusion, 
meaning, it must be determined "if the land is forestal or mineral in 
nature and, if not so found, to consider it to be agricultural land."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> To be classified as a forest, the land must be 
determined as "forestal" in nature by the Bureau of Forestry. The 
government policy then is to leave the task of determining forest land 
to a board of experts, which would investigate if a land may be 
considered forest land. In its investigation, the Bureau of Forestry 
uses an exacting list of criteria to classify a land as forest. It 
ascertains the lands' slope, exposure, soil type, soil cover character, 
cultivation, among other bio-physical factors. This Court stated: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>In many cases, in the opinion of the Bureau of Forestry, 
lands without a single tree on them are considered as true forest land. 
For instance, mountain sides which are too steep for cultivation under 
ordinary practice and which, if cultivated, under ordinary practice 
would destroy the big natural resource of the soil, by washing, is 
considered by this Bureau as forest land and in time would be 
reforested. Of course, examples exist in the Mountain Province where 
steep hillsides have been terraced and intensive cultivation practiced 
but even then the mountain people are very careful not to destroy 
forests or other vegetative cover which they from experience have found 
protect their water supply. Certain chiefs have lodged protests with the
 Government against other tribes on the opposite side of the mountain 
cultivated by them, in order to prevent other tribes from cutting timber
 or destroy cover guarding their source of water for irrigation. </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify">. . . .</p>
  <p align="justify"> The method employed by the Bureau of Forestry in 
making inspection of lands, in order to determine whether they are more 
adapted for agricultural or forest purposes by a technical and duly 
trained personnel on the different phases of the conservation of natural
 resources, is based upon a previously prepared set of questions in 
which the different characters of the land under inspection are 
discussed, namely: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">Slope of land: Level; moderate; steep; very steep. </p>
    <p align="justify"> Exposure: North; South; East; West. </p>
    <p align="justify"> Soil: Clay; sandy loam; sand; rocky; very rocky. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> Character of soil cover: Cultivated, grass land, brush land, brush land and timber mixed, dense forest. </p>
  <p align="justify"> If cultivated, state crops being grown and approximate number of hectares under cultivation. (Indicate on sketch.) </p>
  <p align="justify">For growth of what agricultural products is this land suitable? </p>
  <p align="justify"> State what portion of the tract is wooded, name of
 important timber species and estimate of stand in cubic meters per 
hectare, diameter and percentage of each species. </p>
  <p align="justify"> If the land is covered with timber, state whether 
there is public land suitable for agriculture in vicinity, which is not 
covered with timber. </p>
  <p align="justify"> Is this land more valuable for agricultural than for forest purposes? (State reasons in full.) </p>
  <p align="justify"> Is this land included or adjoining any proposed or
 established forest reserve or communal forest? Description and 
ownership of improvements. </p>
  <p align="justify"> If the land is claimed under private ownership, 
give the name of the claimant, his place of residence, and state briefly
 (if necessary on a separate sheet) the grounds upon which he bases his 
claim. </p>
  <p align="justify"> When the inspection is made on a parcel of public 
land which has been applied for, the corresponding certificate is 
forwarded to the Director of Lands; if it is made on a privately claimed
 parcel for which the issuance of a title is requested from the Court of
 Land Registration, and the inspection shows the land to be more adapted
 for forest purposes, then the Director of Forestry requests the 
Attorney-General to file an opposition, sending him all data collected 
during the inspection and offering him the forest officer as a witness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> This Court held that the agricultural presumption 
was based on the government's policy of favoring conversion of lands 
from public domain to private ownership.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Subsequently, in <em>J.H. Ankron </em>v. <em>The Government of the Philippine Islands,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup>
 this Court reiterated the agricultural presumption, expounding that the
 classification of land as forestal or mineral is a matter of proof. It 
held: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>[W]hether the particular land in question belongs to one 
class or another is a question of fact. The mere fact that a tract of 
land has trees upon it or has mineral within it is not of itself 
sufficient to declare that one is forestry land and the other, mineral 
land. There must be some proof of the extent and present or future value
 of the forestry and of the minerals. While, as we have just said, many 
definitions have been given for "agriculture," "forestry," and "mineral"
 lands, and that in each case it is a question of fact, we think it is 
safe to say that in order to be forestry or mineral land the proof
must show that it is more valuable for the forestry or the mineral which
 it contains than it is for agricultural purposes. (Sec. 7, Act No. 
1148.) It is not sufficient to show that there exists some trees upon 
the land or that it bears some mineral. Land may be classified as 
forestry or mineral today, and, by reason of the exhaustion of the 
timber or mineral, be classified as agricultural land tomorrow. And 
vice-versa, by reason of the rapid growth of timber or the discovery of 
valuable minerals, lands classified as agricultural today may be 
differently classified tomorrow. Each case must be decided upon the 
proof in that particular case, having regard for its present or future 
value for one or the other purposes. We believe, however, considering 
the fact that it is a matter of public knowledge that a majority of the 
lands in the Philippine Islands are agricultural lands, that the courts 
have a right to presume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, 
that in each case the lands are agricultural lands until the contrary is
 shown. Whatever the land involved in a particular land registration 
case is forestry or mineral land must, therefore, be a matter of proof. 
Its superior value for one purpose or the other is a question of fact to
 be settled by the proof in each particular case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> </blockquote>
</div>
<p>The presumption in favor of agricultural land is only a disputable 
presumption. It may be overcome by showing the actual nature of the 
land. This is consistent with the text of Philippine Bill of 1902, which
 stated that the determination of land was hinged on its "agricultural 
character and productiveness."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Thus, the Bureau of Forestry's investigation is crucial because it is able to ascertain each land's actual character. </p>
<p align="justify"> However, in the 1970s, the Marcos administration 
sought to conserve the country's forest cover. Citing a study by a 
forestry professor, the government adopted a policy seeking to retain at
 least 42%, or 12,600,000 hectares, of the country's land area for 
forest purposes. The study had suggested that lands at least 18% in 
slope must be considered forest lands based on its calculation that 
approximately 42% of our land area was 18% in slope.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> As a result, the 18%-slope criteria under Presidential Decree No. 705 was established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> Section 15 states that any land at least 18% in slope shall be classified as alienable and disposable: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>SECTION 15. <em>Topography. </em> — No land of the public 
domain eighteen per cent (18%) in slope or over shall be classified as 
alienable and disposable, nor any forest land fifty per cent (50%) in 
slope or over, as grazing land. </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> Lands eighteen per cent (18%) in slope or over 
which have already been declared as alienable and disposable shall be 
reverted to the classification of forest lands by the Department Head, 
to form part of the forest reserves, unless they are already covered by 
existing titles or approved public land application, or actually 
occupied openly, continuously, adversely and publicly for a period of 
not less than thirty (30) years as of the effectivity of this Code, 
where the occupant is qualified for a free patent under the Public Land 
Act: Provided, That said lands, which are not yet part of a 
well-established communities, shall be kept in a vegetative condition 
sufficient to prevent erosion and adverse effects on the lowlands and 
streams: Provided, Further, That when public interest so requires, steps
 shall be taken to expropriate, cancel defective titles, reject public 
land application, or eject occupants thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"> This is consistent with Section 3(a), which creates a
 blanket declaration that all unclassified public lands are considered 
forest lands. Alienable and disposable lands at least 18% slope are 
reverted to the classification of forest land. This sudden shift in land
 policy meant that a sole criterion is now used to declare a land as a 
forest, regardless of its nature. In fact, this criterion led to 
unrealistic pronouncements declaring lands as forestal even if other 
biophysical factors show otherwise."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> The imposition of a single criterion has drawn 
criticisms for being an insufficient standard to determine how to 
economically use the lands without endangering the ecosystem.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup>
 It fails to account for other factors that will protect and respect the
 property rights of landowners whose lands are surrounded by forest 
zones.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> Section 15 of Presidential Decree No. 705 violates due process. </p>
<p align="justify"> Due process under Article III, Section 1 of the 1987
 Constitution protects property rights and precludes undue deprivation 
of property, regardless of the type and nature of the property. It 
applies not only to titled lands but also to lands that may be 
unregistered, but whose ownership was vested upon their occupants by 
prescription. </p>
<p align="justify"> The arbitrary conversion of lands to forest lands 
under Section 15 of Presidential Decree No. 705, as well as its 
proscription against alienability of lands on the basis of a single 
criterion, violates due process. It unduly severs ownership by 
automatically declaring lands as inalienable forest lands as long as 
they have a slope of at least 18%. There may be lands that remain 
untitled and unregistered but whose ownership had already been vested on
 their occupants. Section 15 effectively disregards property rights by 
enacting an outright conversion of any unclassified land as a forest. </p>
<p align="justify"> Section 15 cannot find refuge in the regalian 
doctrine. To reiterate, this legal fiction is a jurisprudential 
aberration that has no constitutional basis. None of our constitutions, 
past and present, have ever provided a presumption that all lands are 
public. Thus, it is unsound for this Court to pronounce that 
"unclassified lands are in the same footing as forest lands"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup>
 as there may be unclassified lands that have become subject to private 
ownership. It is likewise unwarranted to equate unclassified lands to 
forest lands because there are other classifications of lands under our 
Constitution. </p>
<p align="justify"> Thus, I take exception to the validity of Section 15 of the Presidential Decree No. 705. </p>
<p align="justify"> Nevertheless, as pointed out in the <em>ponencia, </em>the exception established in <em>Cariño </em>remains an option for those who seek recognition of their native titles to their lands. </p>

<p align="justify">In his Separate Opinion in <em>Cruz v. Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 Justice Reynato S. Puno explained the origins of the Regalian doctrine 
and traced its history back to the Laws of the Indies, thus: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> The capacity of the State to own or acquire property is the state's power of <em>dominium. </em>This was the foundation for the early Spanish decrees embracing the feudal theory <em>of jura regalia. </em>The "Regalian [d]octrine" or <em>jura regalia </em>is a Western legal concept that <em>was first introduced by the Spaniards into the country through the Laws of the Indies and the Royal Cedillas. </em> The Laws of the Indies, <em>i.e., </em>more specifically, <em>Law 14, Title 12, Book 4 of the Novisima Recopilacion de Leyes de las Indias, </em>set the policy of the Spanish Crown with respect to the Philippine Islands in the following manner: </p>
</blockquote>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"We, having acquired full sovereignty over the Indies, and all 
lands, territories, and possessions not heretofore ceded away by our 
royal predecessors, or by us, or in our name, still pertaining to the 
royal crown and patrimony, it is our will that all lands which are held 
without proper and true deeds of grant be restored to us as they belong 
to us, in order that after reserving before all what to us or to our 
viceroys, audiencias, and governors may seem necessary for public 
squares, ways, pastures, and commons in those places which are peopled, 
taking into consideration not only their present condition, but also 
their future and their probable increase, and after distributing to the 
natives what may be necessary for tillage and pasturage, confirming them
 in what they now have and giving them more if necessary, all the rest 
of said lands may remain free and unencumbered for us to dispose of as 
we may wish. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"> We therefore order and command that all viceroys
 and presidents of pretorial courts designate at such time as shall to 
them seem most expedient, a suitable period within which all possessors 
of tracts, farms, plantations, and estates shall exhibit to them and to 
the court officers appointed by them for this purpose, their title deeds
 thereto. And those who are in possession by virtue of proper deeds and 
receipts, or by virtue of just prescriptive right shall be protected, 
and all the rest shall be restored to us to be disposed of at our will."
 </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> The Philippines passed to Spain by virtue of 
"discovery'" and conquest. Consequently, all lands became the exclusive 
patrimony and dominion of the Spanish Crown. The Spanish Government took
 charge of distributing the lands by issuing royal grants and 
concessions to Spaniards, both military and civilian. Private land 
titles could only be acquired from the government either by purchase or 
by the various modes of land grant from the Crown. </p>
  <p align="justify"> The Laws of the Indies were followed by the <em>Ley Hipotecaria, </em>or the <em>Mortgage Law of 1893. </em>The
 Spanish Mortgage Law provided for the systematic registration of titles
 and deeds as well as possessory claims. The law sought to register and 
tax lands pursuant to the Royal Decree of 1880. The Royal Decree of 
1894, or the "Maura Law," was partly an amendment of the Mortgage Law as
 well as the Laws of the Indies, as already amended by previous orders 
and decrees. This was the last Spanish land law promulgated in the 
Philippines. It required the "adjustment" or registration of all 
agricultural lands, otherwise the lands shall revert to the State. </p>
</blockquote>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>Four years later, by the <em>Treaty of Paris of December 10, 1898, </em>
 Spain ceded to the government of the United States all of its rights, 
interests and claims over the national territory of the Philippine 
Islands. In 1903, the United States colonial government, through the 
Philippine Commission, passed Act No. 926, the first Public Land Act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>
</div>
<p align="justify"> That the Regalian doctrine remained in force even 
after the Philippines was ceded to the United States appears to have 
been confirmed by the Court <em>En Bane </em>in the 1904 case of <em>Valenton </em>v. <em>Murciano,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> through the following observations: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>The policy pursued by the Spanish Government from the 
earliest times, requiring settlers on the public lands to obtain deeds 
therefor from the State, has been continued by the American Government 
in Act No. 926, which takes effect when approved by Congress. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </blockquote>
</div>
<p>Subsequently, the Regalian doctrine was adopted under the 1935 Constitution, particularly, in Section 1, Article XIII: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>SECTION 1. <strong>All agricultural, timber, and mineral 
lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other
 mineral oils, all forces of potential energy and other natural 
resources of the Philippines belong to the State, </strong> and their 
disposition, exploitation, development, or utilization shall be limited 
to citizens of the Philippines or to corporations or associations at 
least sixty <em>per centum </em>of the capital of which is owned by such
 citizens, subject to any existing right, grant, lease, or concession at
 the time of the inauguration of the Government established under this 
Constitution. Natural resources, with the exception of public 
agricultural land, shall not be alienated, and no license, concession, 
or lease for the exploitation, development, or utilization of any of the
 natural resources shall be granted for a period exceeding twenty-five 
years, renewable for another twenty-five years, except as to water 
rights for irrigation, water supply, fisheries, or industrial uses other
 than the development of water power, in which cases beneficial use may 
be the measure and limit of the grant. (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote>
</div>
<p>Under the 1973 Constitution, the Regalian doctrine was set forth in clearer terms, hence: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>SECTION 8. <strong>All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, </strong><strong>
 coal, petroleum and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy,
 fisheries, wildlife, and other natural resources of the Philippines 
belong to the State. </strong> With the exception of agricultural, 
industrial or commercial, residential, and resettlement lands of the 
public domain, natural resources shall not be alienated, and no license,
 concession, or lease for the exploration, development, exploitation, or
 utilization of any of the natural resources shall be granted for a 
period exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for not more than 
twenty-five years, except as to water rights for irrigation, water 
supply, fisheries, or industrial uses other than the development of 
water power, in which cases, beneficial use may be the measure and the

<p>At present, the Regalian doctrine remains enshrined in Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution, which reads: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>SECTION 2. <strong>All lands of the public domain, waters,
 minerals, coal, petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of 
potential energy, fisheries, forests or timber, wildlife, flora and 
fauna, and other natural resources are owned by the State. </strong> 
With the exception of agricultural lands, all other natural resources 
shall not be alienated. The exploration, development, and utilization of
 natural resources shall be under the full control and supervision of 
the State. The State may directly undertake such activities, or it may 
enter into co-production, joint venture, or production-sharing 
agreements with Filipino citizens, or corporations or associations at 
least sixty <em>per centum </em>of whose capital is owned by such 
citizens. Such agreements may be for a period not exceeding twenty-five 
years, renewable for not more than twenty-five years, and under such 
terms and conditions as may be provided by law. In cases of water rights
 for irrigation, water supply, fisheries, or industrial uses other than 
the development of water power, beneficial use may be the measure and 
limit of the grant. (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote>
</div>
<p>In addition, the 1987 Constitution further states that only lands 
classified as agricultural shall be alienable, and thus, susceptible of 
private ownership.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong> Based on the foregoing, I submit that the Regalian doctrine </strong><strong> remains the basic foundation of the State's property regime under the </strong><strong> present Constitution.</strong></p>
<p align="justify"> The Regalian doctrine espouses that all lands of the
 public domain belong to the State, and that the State is the source of 
any asserted right to ownership of land. Accordingly, all lands not 
otherwise appearing to be clearly within private ownership are <em>presumed </em>to
 belong to the State. Unless land is shown to have been reclassified as 
agricultural (and thus, alienable), such land remains part of the 
inalienable land of the public domain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> As pointedly discussed by the <em>ponencia, </em>an 
exception to the general presumption that "all lands are part of public 
domain" had been crafted by the United States Supreme Court (U.S. 
Supreme Court) in the 1909 case of <em> Cariño</em> v. <em>Insular Government</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><em> (Cariño).</em></p>
<p align="justify"><em> Cariño</em> involved a claim of ownership over 
land occupied by the petitioner therein and his ancestors since time 
immemorial, that is, before the Spanish Conquest. Taking this peculiar 
circumstance into account, the U.S. Supreme Court held: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>The Province of Benguet was inhabited by a tribe that the 
Solicitor General, in his argument, characterized as a savage tribe that
 never was brought under the civil or military government of the Spanish
 Crown. It seems probable, if not certain, that the Spanish officials 
would not have granted to anyone in that province the registration to 
which formerly the plaintiff was entitled by the Spanish laws, and which
 would have made his title beyond question good. Whatever may have been 
the technical position of Spain, it does not follow that, in the view of
 the United States, he had lost all rights and was a mere trespasser 
when the present government seized his land. The argument to that effect
 seems to amount to a denial of native titles throughout an important 
part of the island of Luzon, at least, for the want of ceremonies which 
the Spaniards would not have permitted and had not the power to enforce.

mean to go no further than the necessities of decision demand, every 
presumption is and ought to be against the government <strong>in a case like the present. </strong>It
 might, perhaps, be proper and sufficient to say that when, as far back 
as testimony or memory goes, the land has been held by individuals under
 a claim of private ownership, it will be presumed to have been held in 
the same way from before the Spanish conquest, and never to have been 
public land. Certainly<strong> in a case like this, </strong>if there is
 doubt or ambiguity in the Spanish law, we ought to give the applicant 
the benefit of the doubt. Whether justice to the natives and the import 
of the organic act ought not to carry us beyond a subtle examination of 
ancient texts, or perhaps even beyond the attitude of Spanish law, 
humane though it was, it is unnecessary to decide. If, in a tacit way, 
it was assumed that the wild tribes of the Philippines were to be dealt 
with as the power and inclination of the conqueror might dictate,

<p align="justify"> I share the <em>ponente's </em>view that <em>Cariño</em>
 merely carved out an exception thereto in recognition of native titles

<p align="justify"> I submit, however, that these rulings should be understood in their proper context. </p>
<p align="justify"><em> De Aldecoa, Ramos </em> and <em>Ankron </em>involved actions for registration of title decided under the regime of the Philippine Bill of 1902<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>. </p>
<p align="justify"> Under the Philippine Bill of 1902, the Government of
 the Philippine Islands had been authorized to classify land into three 
categories — timber, mineral, and agricultural, thus: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>SECTION 13. That the Government of the Philippine Islands, <strong> subject to the provisions of this Act and except as herein provided, </strong><strong> shall classify according to its agricultural character and </strong><strong>

</div>
<p>Pursuant to the mandate in Section 13, the Philippine Commission enacted Act No. 926<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (Act 926) otherwise known as the first Public Land Act. </p>
<p align="justify"> While Act 926 prescribed the rules and regulations 
for the lease, sale, and other disposition of alienable public lands, it
 failed to grant the power to classify lands to any central authority. 
In the absence of such specific grant of power, courts were then 
confronted with the task of determining land classification in 
justiciable cases on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis, that is, depending on the evidence presented in each particular case. </p>
<p align="justify"> The Court's ruling in <em>Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources v. Yap</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><em> (Yap) </em> is instructive. </p>
<p align="justify"> In <em>Yap, </em>Proclamation No. (Proclamation) 1801<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 issued by President Ferdinand Marcos (President Marcos) and its 
implementing circular Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA) Circular No. 
3-82 were called into question. </p>
<p align="justify"> Under Proclamation 1801, President Marcos declared 
certain islands, coves, and peninsulas as tourist zones and marine 
reserves and placed them under the administration of the PTA. Boracay 
Island was included among the islands declared as tourist zones. </p>
<p align="justify"> Land claimants in <em>Yap </em>argued that 
Proclamation 1801 and PTA Circular No. 3-82 raised doubts on their 
ability to secure Torrens titles over land which they have been 
occupying since June 12, 1945 or earlier. Thus, they filed a Petition 
for Declaratory Relief with the RTC of Kalibo, Aklan. </p>
<p align="justify"> The Republic, through the Office of the Solicitor 
General (OSG), opposed the Petition for Declaratory Relief, primarily 
arguing that Boracay Island constitutes unclassified land which, in 
turn, is inalienable. Since Boracay Island has not been classified as 
alienable and disposable land, whatever form of possession which the 
claimants had, could not ripen into ownership. </p>
<p align="justify"> Acting on the claimants' Petition for Declaratory 
Relief, the RTC held that Proclamation 1801 and PTA Circular No. 3-82 
"pose no legal obstacle to the petitioners and those similarly situated 
to acquire title to their lands in Boracay, in accordance with the 
applicable laws and in the manner prescribed therein."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The CA affirmed. </p>
<p align="justify"> The Republic later elevated the case to the Court <em>via </em>Petition
 for Review which was docketed as G.R. No. 167707. G.R. No. 167707 was 
later consolidated with an original petition for prohibition, mandamus, 
and nullification of Proclamation 1064<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> docketed as G.R. No. 173775 filed by another set of land claimants. </p>
<p align="justify"> Under Proclamation 1064, President Gloria 
Macapagal-Arroyo classified Boracay Island into 400 hectares of reserved
 forest land and 628.96 hectares of agricultural land. The petitioners 
in G.R. No. 173775 assailed the validity of Proclamation 1064 as it 
allegedly infringed on their vested rights over portions of Boracay 
Island. The Republic, again through the OSG, countered that Boracay 
Island is unclassified land. Thus, the portions of the island which 
remain inalienable under Proclamation 1064 could not be subject of 
judicial confirmation of imperfect title. </p>
<p align="justify"> The land claimants in G.R. Nos. 167707 and 173775 
argued, among others, that Boracay Island constitute agricultural land 
pursuant to <em>Ankron </em>and <em>De Aldecoa. </em>The Court <strong><u>rejected</u></strong> this assertion in this wise: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote><em>Ankron </em> and <em>De Aldecoa </em>were decided at a
 time when the President of the Philippines had no power to classify 
lands of the public domain into mineral, timber, and agricultural. <strong>At that time, the courts were free to </strong><strong>make
 corresponding classifications in justiciable cases, or were vested with
 implicit power to do so, depending upon the preponderance of the 
evidence. </strong> This was the Court's ruling in <em>Heirs of the Late Spouses </em><em> Pedro S. Palanca </em> and <em>Soterranea Rafols Vda. De Palanca v. Republic, </em>in which it stated, through Justice Adolfo Azcuna, <em>viz.:</em></blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div align="justify">
    <blockquote>"x x x Petitioners furthermore insist that a particular 
land need not be formally released by an act of the Executive before it 
can be deemed open to private ownership, citing the cases <em>of Ramos v. Director of Lands </em> and <em>Ankron v. Government of the Philippine Islands.</em></blockquote>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="justify"> X X X X </p>
    <p align="justify"> Petitioner's reliance upon <em>Ramos v. Director of </em><em> Lands </em> and <em>Ankron v. Government </em>is
 misplaced. These cases were decided under the Philippine Bill of 1902 
and the first Public Land Act No. 926 enacted by the Philippine 
Commission on October 7, 1926, under which there was no legal provision 
vesting in the Chief Executive or President of the Philippines the power
 to classify lands of the public domain into mineral, timber and 
agricultural so that the courts then were free to make corresponding 
classifications in justiciable cases, or were vested with implicit power
 to do so, depending upon the preponderance of the evidence." </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="justify"><strong> To aid the courts in resolving land registration cases under Act </strong><strong> No. 926, it was then necessary to devise a presumption on land </strong><strong> classification. Thus evolved the dictum in <em>Ankron </em>that "the courts </strong><strong> have a right to presume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, </strong><strong> that in each case the lands are agricultural lands until the contrary is </strong><strong> shown."</strong></p>
  <p align="justify"><strong> But We cannot unduly expand the presumption in <em>Ankron </em>and <em> De Aldecoa </em>
 to an argument that all lands of the public domain had been 
automatically reclassified as disposable and alienable agricultural 
lands. By no stretch of imagination did the presumption convert all 
lands of the public domain into agricultural lands.</strong> </p>
  <p align="justify"><strong> If We accept the position of private claimants, the Philippine </strong><strong> Bill of 1902 and Act No. 926 would have automatically made all lands </strong><strong> in the Philippines, except those already classified as timber or mineral </strong><strong> land, alienable and disposable lands. That would take these lands out </strong><strong>
 of State ownership and worse, would be utterly inconsistent with and 
totally repugnant to the long-entrenched Regalian doctrine.</strong></p>
  <p align="justify"> The presumption in <em>Ankron </em>and <em>De Aldecoa </em>attaches
 only to land registration cases brought under the provisions of Act No.
 926, or more specifically those cases dealing with judicial and 
administrative confirmation of imperfect titles. The presumption applies
 to an applicant for judicial or administrative conformation of 
imperfect title under Act No. 926. It certainly cannot apply to 
landowners, such as private claimants or their predecessors-in-interest,
 who failed to avail themselves of the benefits of Act No. 926. As to 
them, their land remained unclassified and, by virtue of the Regalian 
doctrine, continued to be owned by the State. </p>
  <p align="justify"> In any case, the assumption in <em>Ankron </em>and <em>De Aldecoa </em>was
 not absolute. Land classification was, in the end, dependent on proof. 
If there was proof that the land was better suited for non-agricultural 
uses, the courts could adjudge it as a mineral or timber land despite 
the presumption. x x x </p>
  <p align="justify"><strong> x x x x</strong></p>
  <p align="justify"><strong> Since 1919, courts were no longer free to determine the </strong><strong> classification of lands from the facts of each case, except those that </strong><strong> have already become private lands. </strong>
 Act No. 2874, promulgated in 1919 and reproduced in Section 6 of CA No.
 141, gave the Executive Department, through the President, the 
exclusive prerogative to classify or reclassify public lands into 
alienable or disposable, mineral or forest. Since then, courts no longer
 had the authority, whether express or implied, to determine the 
classification of lands of the public domain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p>

<p align="justify"> Verily, the presumption espoused in <em>De Aldecoa, Ramos, </em>and <em>Ankron </em> was an evidentiary tool devised in the limited context of registration cases brought under the provisions of Act 926. <strong><u>Such presumption no longer applies in the current statutory regime</u></strong>.</p>

</div>
<p>Section 3 mandates that only lands classified as agricultural may be 
declared alienable, and thus susceptible of private ownership. Thus, all

<p align="justify"> As pointedly discussed by the <em>ponencia, </em>the
 fact that unclassified lands remain inalienable until released and 
declared open to disposition has been confirmed by the Court <em>En Banc</em>in <em>Yap, </em>thus: </p>
<div align="justify">
  <blockquote>Except for lands already covered by existing titles, 
Boracay was an unclassified land of the public domain prior to 
[Proclamation 1064]. Such unclassified lands are considered public 
forest under [PD 705]. The DENR and the National Mapping and Resource 
Information Authority certify that Boracay Island is an unclassified 
land of the public domain. </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> [PD 705] issued by President Marcos categorized 
all unclassified lands of the public domain as public forest. Section 
3(a) of [PD 705] defines a public forest as "a mass of lands of the 
public domain which has not been the subject of the present system of 
classification for the determination of which lands are needed for 
forest purpose and which are not". <strong>Applying [PD 705], all unclassified lands, including those in </strong><strong> Boracay Island, are <em>ipso facto </em>considered public forests. [PD 705], however, respects titles already existing prior to its effectivity.</strong></p>
  <p align="justify"> The Court notes that the classification of Boracay
 as a forest land under [PD 705] may seem to be out of touch with the 
present realities in the island. Boracay, no doubt, has been partly 
stripped of its forest cover to pave the way for commercial 
developments. As a premier tourist destination for local and foreign 
tourists, Boracay appears more of a commercial island resort, rather 
than a forest land. </p>
  <p align="justify"> Nevertheless, that the occupants of Boracay have 
built multi-million peso beach resorts on the island; that the island 
has already been stripped of its forest cover; or that the 
implementation of [Proclamation 1064] will destroy the island's tourism 
industry, do not negate its character as public forest. </p>
  <p align="justify"> Forests, in the context of both the Public Land 
Act and the Constitution classifying lands of the public domain into 
"agricultural, forest or timber, mineral lands, and national parks," do 
not necessarily refer to large tracts of wooded land or expanses covered
 by dense growths of trees and underbrushes. The discussion in <em>Heirs of Amunategui v. </em><em>Director of Forestry </em>is particularly instructive: </p>
  <div align="justify">
    <blockquote>"A forested area classified as forest land of the public
 domain does not lose such classification simply because loggers or 
settlers may have stripped it of its forest cover. Parcels of land 
classified as forest land may actually be covered with grass or planted 
to crops by kaingin cultivators or other farmers. "Forest lands" do not 
have to be on mountains or in out of the way places. Swampy areas 
covered by mangrove trees, nipa palms, and other trees growing in 
brackish or sea water may also be classified as forest land. The 
classification is descriptive of its legal nature or status and does not
 have to be descriptive of what the land actually looks like. Unless and
 until the land classified as "forest" is released in an official 
proclamation to that effect so that it may form part of the disposable 
agricultural lands of the public domain, the rules on confirmation of 
imperfect title do not apply." x x x </blockquote>
  </div>
  <p>There is a big difference between "forest" as defined in a 
dictionary and "forest or timber land" as a classification of lands of 
the public domain as appearing in our statutes. One is descriptive of 
what appears on the land while the other is a legal status, a 
classification for legal purposes. At any rate, the Court is tasked to 
determine the legal status of Boracay Island, and not look into its 
physical layout. Hence, even if its forest cover has been replaced by 
beach resorts, restaurants and other commercial establishments, it has 
not been automatically converted from public forest to alienable 
agricultural land. </p>
  <p align="justify"> Private claimants cannot rely on [Proclamation 
1801] as basis for judicial confirmation of imperfect title. The 
proclamation did not convert Boracay into an agricultural land. However,
 private claimants argue that [Proclamation 1801] issued by then 
President Marcos in 1978 entitles them to judicial confirmation of 
imperfect title. The Proclamation classified Boracay, among other 
islands, as a tourist zone. Private claimants assert that, as a tourist 
spot, the island is susceptible of private ownership. </p>
  <p align="justify"> [Proclamation 1801] or PTA Circular No. 3-82 did 
not convert the whole of Boracay into an agricultural land. There is 
nothing in the law or the Circular which made Boracay Island an 
agricultural land. The reference in Circular No. 3-82 to "private lands"
 and "areas declared as alienable and disposable" does not by itself 
classify the entire island as agricultural. Notably, Circular No. 3-82 
makes reference not only to private lands and areas but also to public 
forested lands, x x x </p>
  <p align="justify"> x x x x </p>
  <p align="justify"> [Proclamation 1801] cannot be deemed the positive 
act needed to classify Boracay Island as alienable and disposable land. 
If President Marcos intended to classify the island as alienable and 
disposable or forest, or both, he would have identified the specific 
limits of each, as President Arroyo did in [Proclamation. 1064]. This 
was not done in [Proclamation 1801]. </p>
  <p align="justify"> x x x x </p>
  <p align="justify"> It was [Proclamation 1064] of 2006 which 
positively declared part of Boracay as alienable and opened the same to 
private ownership. Sections 6 and 7 of CA No. 141 provide that it is 
only the President, upon the recommendation of the proper department 
head, who has the authority to classify the lands of the public domain 
into alienable or disposable, timber and mineral lands. </p>
  <p align="justify"> In issuing [Proclamation 1064], President Gloria 
Macapagal-Arroyo merely exercised the authority granted to her to 
classify lands of the public domain, presumably subject to existing 
vested rights. <strong> Classification of public lands is the exclusive 
prerogative of the Executive Department, through the Office of the 
President. Courts have no authority to do so. Absent such 
classification, the land remains unclassified until released and 
rendered open to disposition.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25] </sup>(Emphasis supplied; emphasis in the original omitted) </p>

 as a wholesale classification of alienable land to inalienable land,

<p align="justify"> Justice Leonen adds that the "sudden shift in land 
policy meant that a sole criterion is now used to declare a land as a 
forest, regardless of its nature"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
 and has in fact "led to unrealistic pronouncements declaring lands as 
forestal even if other biophysical factors show otherwise."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"> I note, however, that the Petition solely assails the constitutionality of Section 3 (a) of PD 705. </p>
<p align="justify"> Section 3(a) merely defines the term "public forest"
 as "the mass of lands of the public domain which has not been the 
subject of the present system of classification[.]" As explained, 
Section 3(a) does not have the effect of changing the nature of the 
lands under its scope, as both unclassified and forest lands are 
similarly inalienable. On the other hand, Section 15 mandates the 
reversion of alienable and disposable land 18% in slope or over to the 
classification of forest lands, subject to existing rights. To my mind 
Section 3(a) and Section 15 cover entirely different subject matters. </p>
<p align="justify"> Thus, considering that the validity of Section 15 of
 PD 705 (including the 18% slope criterion set forth thereunder) is not 
assailed by the petitioners herein, I submit that any pronouncement on 
these matters must await the filing of the proper case which directly 
puts the validity of Section 15 in issue. Any opinion thus expressed 
regarding Section 15 would be completely irrelevant and <em>obiter.</em></p>
<p align="justify"> Based on these premises, I vote to <strong>DISMISS</strong> the Petition. </p>
