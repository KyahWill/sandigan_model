On arraignment, appellant pleaded <i>not guilty</i> to all six (6) charges. Joint trial ensued.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><b>Prosecution's Evidence</b><br><br>During the trial, the prosecution offered the testimonies of AAA, BBB, CCC and DDD.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> AAA and BBB were DDD's children with her first live-in partner, while CCC was her son with appellant.<br><br><b>AAA</b> testified that she was born on November 24, 1988. She first met appellant when her mother DDD introduced him as her new live-in partner. At that time, she was still six (6) years old and living with her aunt in Barangay Tibag, Calapan City. When she reached third she started living with DDD and appellant in <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span>, Calapan City. She considered appellant her real father because her biological father left them when she was younger. Meanwhile, her sister BBB remained under the care of their grandmother in Naujan until she was already in high school. DDD and appellant had a child, CCC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The first time appellant raped her was on August 14, 2002. The night before the incident, on appellant's birthday, she overheard appellant talking to DDD downstairs in their house, asking permission to treat AAA as his wife ("<i>Hinihingi po ako ng step-father ko sa nanay ko. Gusto niya po akong asawahin</i>").<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> DDD got mad and immediately refused appellant's request. Alarmed by appellant's intention, she confronted DDD regarding the matter but DDD assured her that such incident would never happen. She felt relieved by DDD's assurance at first but realized later that the person whom she looked up to as her own father would still carry out his bestial desires.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On the day of the incident, around 6 o'clock in the evening, she was left alone doing kitchen chores when appellant suddenly held her arms and forcibly leaned her against the wall. Appellant covered her mouth and removed her jogging pants. He took off his trousers as well. She struggled to free herself from appellant but the latter was just too strong. She also tried to shout for help but appellant simply covered her mouth again and threatened to kill DDD if she reported the incident to anyone.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Appellant was behind her as he pushed her facing the wall. He forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina from behind. She felt a sharp pain during the insertion because it was the first time she had sexual intercourse. And just when she thought that appellant had already satisfied his lust, he sexually assaulted her by inserting his finger inside her private organ. Frightened and helpless, she could no longer fight back. Appellant only stopped when he realized that DDD was already on her way back home. Upon DDD's arrival, appellant acted as if nothing happened. For her part, she was too afraid to tell her mother about the incident for fear that appellant might hurt DDD.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On August 21, 2002, appellant raped her once again. Around 4 o'clock in the afternoon that day, while DDD and CCC were away, appellant shoved her face-down on the sofa. While she was in a stooping position (nakadapa), appellant removed her jogging pants and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. She felt pain while appellant made push and pull motions with his erect penis. She was too weak to resist. With her mouth against the sofa, she, too, failed to shout for help. Once again, she kept her silence for fear that appellant would kill DDD.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The third incident of rape was on August 3, 2006. She was already seventeen (17) years old but still shared a bedroom with all her family members. That morning, she was awakened by the malicious embrace and kisses of appellant who groped her inside her jogging pants with his left hand. He proceeded to insert his middle finger into her vagina several times. She felt pain as appellant's nails scratched the inner parts of her vagina. Although CCC was asleep in the same room, this did not prevent appellant from carrying out the deed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In the evening of August 4, 2006, she was again molested by appellant. While she and appellant were alone inside their house, appellant started kissing and caressing her as she cleaned kitchen utensils. Appellant placed his hands inside her shirt and mashed breasts. He only withdrew from taking advantage of her when he saw DDD about to arrive. Thereupon, he pretended to have sent her to an errand and left the house. The morning after, appellant berated everyone in the house for no apparent reason. He would usually lose his temper and act that way whenever he failed to satisfy his lust at her expense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On the night of August 5, 2006, while her family was watching television, appellant arrived home drunk and again berated everyone. He ridiculed her family, telling them they were good for nothing. He also called them demons and threatened to hack them into pieces. Later, she saw appellant come down the stairs, carrying a <i>samurai</i>. She immediately pulled CCC and ran out the house. They were separated from BBB and DDD who ran ahead of them but they were able to catch up with each other along the way. They proceeded to the police station to have the incident entered in the police blotter but the police did not accompany them back to their house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On their way home, they saw appellant burning their things. Shaken by what they saw, they decided to ask police officers to escort them home. The police officers obliged and immediately arrested appellant in their house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>When she saw appellant behind bars, she finally mustered enough courage to report the abuses she experienced in his hands. But she was more shocked to have learned that appellant molested BBB that same night, too.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b>BBB</b> testified that she was fifteen (15) years old when appellant performed lascivious acts on her. On August 5, 2006, around 8 o'clock in the evening, an hour before appellant ran amok, appellant molested her by touching her thighs and breasts. She did not cry for help because appellant threatened to kill her family if she disclosed the incident to anyone. This, however, was not the first time she was sexually violated by appellant. She would experience it whenever she was left alone with appellant in their home.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><b>CCC</b> corroborated AAA's testimony. On August 5, 2006, around 9 o'clock in the evening, appellant berated him and his sister before chasing them with a bladed weapon. They immediately went to the police station to report the incident. But when they returned home, they saw appellant burning their things so they went back to the police station to seek assistance, resulting in appellant's arrest. He was only thirteen (13) years old at that time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><b>DDD</b> testified that when she started living together with appellant, AAA was living with her (DDD's) sister while BBB, with her mother. AAA and BBB only came to live with them when they reached third grade and high school, respectively. AAA and BBB considered appellant as their <i> tatay</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On August 5, 2006, she was at home with all her children when appellant arrived drunk. They got frightened when he told them "<i>Mga hayop kayo! Mga demonyo kayo! Tatadtarin ko kayo! Papatayin ko kayo!</i>" Appellant went upstairs and they heard banging noises. When appellant went back downstairs, he was already carrying a bladed weapon so she and the children ran outside. She and BBB ran towards the barangay captain's house while appellant chased AAA and CCC. Appellant stopped chasing them when he saw one (1) of their neighbors Eddie Boy. They reported the incident to the police but when they got back home, appellant was already burning their things.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The prosecution and the defense stipulated on the proposed testimony of <b>Dr. Angelita Legaspi</b> who examined AAA and found healed hymenal lacerations at 4 o'clock, 8 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> She formalized her findings in the Medical Certificate she issued to AAA.<br><br><b>Defense's Evidence</b><br><br><b>Appellant</b> was the lone witness for the defense. He denied the first and second charges of rape against him. He claimed it was impossible for him to have committed these counts of rape since he was working in Puerto Galera for most of 2002. He was not free to leave work and visit DDD and the children regularly in Calapan City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>He also denied sexually assaulting AAA on August 3, 2006. He could not have committed the crime especially in the presence of CCC in the room. As for BBB's claim that appellant molested her on August 5, 2006, no such molestation could have taken place since he went straight to bed that night.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The alleged August 5, 2006 incident was fabricated. DDD's three (3) children probably held a grudge against him because days before his arrest, he and DDD had several bitter quarrels over the P80,000.00 which DDD owed him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Trial Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>Under Joint Decision dated June 24, 2014,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the trial court rendered a verdict of conviction, thus:<br><blockquote><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>1.

In Criminal Case No. CR-06-8541, this Court finds the accused <i>XXX</i> <u><b>GUILTY</b></u> beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of ACTS OF LASCIVIOUSNESS, defined and penalized under Article 336 of the RPC, and hereby sentences him to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from <u><b>SIX (6) MONTHS OF ARRESTO MAYOR, AS MINIMUM, TO SIX (6) YEARS OF PRISION CORRECCIONAL, AS MAXIMUM</b></u>, and to <b>PAY</b> the private complainant the amount of P20,000.00 as civil indemnity, P30,000.00 as moral damages, P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, and to pay the costs.<br><br>3. In Criminal Case No. CR-06-8542, this Court finds the accused <i>XXX</i> <u><b>GUILTY</b></u> beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime charged against him in the aforequoted Information and in default of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, hereby sentences him to suffer the straight penalty of imprisonment for <u><b>THREE (3) MONTHS OF ARRESTO MAYOR IN ITS MEDIUM PERIOD</b></u> and to <b> PAY</b> the FINE OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P100,000.00).<br><br>4. In Criminal Case No. CR-06-8543, this Court finds the accused <i>XXX</i> <u><b>GUILTY</b></u> beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of ACTS OF LASCIVIOUSNES, defined m1d penalized under Article 336 of the RPC, and hereby sentences him to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from <u><b>SIX (6) MONTHS OF ARRESTO MAYOR, AS MINIMUM, to SIX (6) YEARS OF PRISION CORRECIONAL</b></u> (<i>sic</i>), <u><b>AS MAXIMUM</b></u>, and to <b>PAY</b> the private complainant the amount of P20,000.00 as civil indemnity, P30,000.00 as moral damages, P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, and to pay the costs.<br><br>5. In Criminal Case No. CR-06-8544, this Court finds the accused <i>XXX</i> <u><b>GUILTY</b></u> beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime charged against him in the aforequoted Information, and hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of <u><b>RECLUSION PERPETUA</b></u>, <b>WITHOUT ELIGIBILITY FOR PAROLE</b>, and to <b>PAY</b> the private complainant the amount [of] P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, P25,000.00 as exemplary damages, and to pay costs;<br><br>6.

CR-06-8540, CR-06-8544 and CR-06-8545) were qualified by minority and relationship. Thus, the penalties against appellant for these crimes would have been death were it not for the enactment of RA 9346.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The charge of attempted rape committed against AAA (Criminal Case No. CR-06-8543), however, was downgraded to acts of lasciviousness considering the prosecution's failure to prove that appellant attempted touch AAA's vagina.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Thus, the trial court convicted appellant of two (2) counts of acts of lasciviousness, the other having been committed against BBB (Criminal Case No. CR-06-8541). It also considered the victims' minority and their relationship with appellant in determining the proper penalty against the latter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Finally, the trial court found appellant's acts of berating DDD's children, running amok, and chasing them with a bladed weapon, to be clear acts of violence penalized under Section 5(b) of RA 9262.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><center><b>Proceedings before the Court of Appeals</b><br></center><br>Appellant faulted the trial court for rendering a verdict of conviction despite the alleged incredibility and implausibility of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.<br><br>On the charges of rape, appellant argued:<br><br><b>First.</b> It was unimaginable why DDD, after hearing appellant's supposed indecent proposal, would not take extraordinary measures to ensure that her daughter would be safe from any form of molestation. She did not even attempt to physically separate her from appellant. She could have prevented the rape had she sent AAA to her grandmother's house where BBB was staying.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><b>Second.</b> The Informations for rape alleged that appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA through force, intimidation and threat. But AAA's testimony did not establish any basis for any alleged threat. Nothing on record showed that appellant was armed with a weapon. None of the witnesses testified on whether appellant had violent tendencies or history of inflicting physical harm. More, it was unusual for AAA to have remained silent while she was being molested when she could have easily pleaded with appellant for mercy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><b>Third.</b> AAA knew that DDD either goes to the market or to meetings at the cooperative in the afternoon while appellant manages his upholstery business at home. Knowing their routines, she could have easily avoided being left at home with appellant had she exerted more effort. She could have just gone with her mother to the market or to her meetings since she was not under any compulsion to stay home.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b>Fourth.</b> The alleged rape incident on August 3, 2006 was highly improbable since CCC was asleep in the same bedroom. More, BBB and DDD were already awake when the alleged crime was committed; appellant would not have risked the chance of BBB and DDD stumbling upon them in a compromising situation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><b>Fifth.</b> Dr. Angelita Legazpi's report on the cervical vaginal examination she conducted on AAA should not be admitted in evidence since she did not testify in open court. Also, her findings could not have proved AAA was raped twice in 2002 since the examination was conducted four (4) years later in 2006.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br><b>Finally.</b> It was unfair for the trial court to have placed the burden on appellant to prove his i1mocence despite the defenses he offered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>On the charge of acts of lasciviousness against BBB, appellant countered that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses on the events which supposedly happened on August 5, 2006 were contradictory. According to AAA and CCC, appellant arrived home drunk that evening. He allegedly berated and chased them with a <i>samurai</i>. BBB testified, however, that she was alone in the house when appellant purportedly molested her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>On the alleged violation of RA 9262, appellant harped on the prosecution's alleged failure to prove that the chasing incident actually happened. The prosecution witnesses claimed that other people saw it as it occurred but none of them testified in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), through Assistant Solicitor General Derek R. Puertollano and Associate Solicitor II Mark Ranier C. Arenas defended the verdict of conviction.<br><br>It maintained that AAA's testimony sufficiently established that she was raped by appellant on August 14, 2002, August 21, 2002, and August 3, 2006. No decent and sensible woman will publicly admit to having been raped and run the risk of public contempt unless she is, in fact, a rape victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> More, the crimes were qualified by AAA's minority and her relationship with appellant.<br><br>AAA and BBB gave credible testimonies on the lascivious acts which appellant committed on them.

Her revelation that appellant forcibly had carnal knowledge of her not once but twice, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the sordid details of the assaults on her dignity, could not be so easily dismissed as mere concoction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> It is highly improbable that a girl, only seventeen (17) years old, would fabricate a story that would expose herself and her family to a lifetime of dishonor,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> especially when her charge would mean the long-term imprisonment, if not death, of her "<i>tatay</i>."<br><br>By itself, AAA's testimony withstands scrutiny sufficient to sustain a verdict of conviction. But when corroborated by physical evidence, AAA's testimony assumes even more probative weight.<br><br>As stipulated by both the prosecution and the defense, Dr. Legaspi examined AAA and found healed hymenal lacerations at the 4 o'clock, 8 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions. Hymenal lacerations, whether healed or fresh, are the best evidence of forcible defloration. And when the consistent and forthright testimony of a rape victim is consistent with medical findings, as here, the essential requisites of carnal knowledge are deemed to have been sufficiently established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Appellant, nevertheless, claims that the prosecution failed to establish his supposed use of force, threat and intimidation in the commission of the rapes. For nothing on record showed that he was armed. More, it was unusual for AAA to have remained silent throughout her ordeal.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>Threat or intimidation need not be shown by appellant's use of a weapon. Instead, these concepts must be viewed in light of AAA's perception and judgment at the time of rape, and not by any hard and fast rule. It is enough that they produced fear - that if the she does not yield to the bestial demands of appellant, something would happen to her at the moment or thereafter, as when she was threatened with death if she reports the incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>At any rate, the Court held in <b><i>People v. Bentayo</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> that when the offender is the victim's father, there need not be actual force, threat or intimidation because when a father commits the odious crime of rape against his own daughter who was a minor at the time the crime was committed, his moral ascendancy or influence over the latter substitutes for violence and intimidation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Here, the fact that appellant is the live-in partner of AAA's mother, and whom she considered her <i>tatay</i> since she was six (6) years old, established his moral ascendancy over AAA. Appellant's moral ascendancy and influence over AAA substitutes for threat and intimidation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>AAA could not also be faulted for her failure to shout for help. Rape victims react differently. There is no standard form of reaction for a woman when facing a shocking and horrifying experience such as rape. The workings of the human mind placed under emotional stress are unpredictable, and people react differently: some may shout, some may faint, and some may be shocked into insensibility, while others may openly welcome the intrusion. None of these conducts, however, impair the credibility of a rape victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Appellant next claims that these incidents could have been avoided had DDD taken extraordinary measures to ensure AAA's safety, such as physically separating them and sending AAA to live with her grandmother. More, AAA was well aware of DDD's routine of leaving their house every afternoon. Hence, she could have exerted more effort to avoid being left alone at home with appellant.<br><br>In so arguing, appellant essentially blames AAA and DDD for exposing AAA to a vulnerable situation. This is unacceptable. Indeed, the Court has chastised appellants for resorting to the appalling act of victim-blaming. In <b><i>People v. Villaros</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the Court pronounced:<br><blockquote>This reasoning is outrageous, if not outright despicable. In his desperate attempt to exculpate himself from criminal liability, the accused-appellant turned on his victim who, to repeat, was a minor at the time the rape incidents were committed, and blamed her for putting herself in a vulnerable position <b><i>in her own home</i></b>. Grasping at straws, the accused-­appellant not only committed the abhorrent practice of victim-blaming so prevalent in sexual abuse cases, but he also failed to recognize that he made the irrational proposition that the victim should not have been comfortable <b><i>in her own abode</i></b>. (Emphasis and italics in the original)<br></blockquote>In fine, the trial court and the Court of Appeals correctly gave credence to AAA's testimony. Surely, the trial court's factual findings on the credibility of witnesses are accorded high respect. This is because the trial court has the unique opportunity to observe the witnesses' demeanor, and is in the best position to disdern whether they are telling the truth or not.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> This rule becomes more compelling when such factual findings carry the full concurrence of the Court of Appeals, as here.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>In this light, appellant's negative and self-serving defenses of denial and alibi crumble and cannot prevail over AAA's affirmative testimony and her categorical and positive identification of the appellant as the person who raped her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>In any event, appellant's claim that he was in Puerto Galera when the two (2) counts of rape were committed is no reason for this Court to render a verdict of acquittal. Puerto Galera is only about 40 kilometers from Calapan City.

Instead, appellant's depraved behavior only proved that lust is not a respecter of people, time, or place.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Noted in <b><i>People v. Peyra</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> we have already encountered far too many instances where rape was committed in plain view. We even took judicial notice of the fact that among poor couples with big families cramped in small quarters, copulation does not seem to be a problem despite the presence of other persons there. Rape could be committed under circumstances as indiscreet as a room full of family members sleeping side by side.<br><br>Appellant's act of inserting his finger into AAA's vagina would have amounted to rape by sexual assault punishable under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code as amended. Considering, however, that AAA was only seventeen (17) years old when she was abused by appellant, there is a need to modify the nomenclature of appellant's crime.<br><br>In <b><i>People v. Tulagan</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> the Court elucidated that when sexual assault is committed against a victim 12 years old or older but below 18, or is 18 years old but under special circumstances, the crime committed is lascivious conduct under Section 5 (b) of RA 7610, the <i>Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act, viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5 <i>Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse</i>. <b>Children</b>, whether male or female, <b>who</b> for money, profit, or any other consideration or <b>due to the coercion or influence of any adult</b>, syndicate or group, <b>indulge in</b> sexual intercourse or <b>lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse</b>.<br><br>The penalty of <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> shall be imposed upon the following:<br><br>xxxx<br><br>(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or <b>lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse</b>: Provided, That when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 3361 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period.<br></blockquote>The Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 7610 defines lascivious conduct, thus:<br><blockquote>Section 2. Definition of Terms. - As used in these Rules, unless the context requires otherwise -<br><br>xxxx<br><br>h. "Lascivious conduct" means the intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the <b>introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person</b>, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person; (emphasis added)<br></blockquote>The elements of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610 are as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> The accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td> <div align="justify">The said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or other sexual abuse, "children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse" those children, whether male or female, (1) who for money, profit or any other consideration or (2) due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Under the foregoing legal edicts, appellant's act of sexually assaulting AAA on August 3, 2006 qualifies as lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610. The Information, in fact, sufficiently alleged the elements of the offense, thus:<br><blockquote>xxx <b>by means of force, threat and intimidation</b>, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sexually assault one <b>AAA, the seventeen (17) year old daughter of his common-law-wife</b>, and living with him in the same house, <b>by inserting his finger in her vagina, against her will and without her consent</b>, acts of child abuse <b>which debase, degrade and demean the intrinsic worth and dignity of the said AAA, as a human being, to her damage and prejudice</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, the trial court and Court of Appeals' designation of appellant's crime as "<i>rape by sexual assault</i>" must be modified to "<i>lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610</i>."<br><br>As for the lascivious conduct appellant committed on AAA on August 4, 2006, suffice it to state that appellant did not offer any argument specifically assailing such finding.

BBB testified that on August 5, 2006, around 8 o'clock in the evening, she was alone with appellant in their house when the latter molested her. Appellant only stopped when AAA, CCC and DDD arrived home. Thereafter, appellant started yelling at them and went upstairs. This corroborates CCC's testimony that around <b>9 o'clock</b> that evening, they were watching television when appellant started berating them. During the one (1)­-hour window, appellant accomplished his dastardly deed of maliciously touching BBB's thighs and breasts.<br><br>As with AAA's testimony, both the trial court and Court of Appeals rightfully gave full weight and credit to the testimonies of the minor witnesses BBB and CCC. The Court has repeatedly held that youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Absent any ill-motive on the part of the minor witnesses, the credibility of their testimonies are not diminished.<br><br>As earlier discussed, however, there is a similar need here to modify the designation of appellant's offense from "<i>acts of lasciviousness</i>" to "<i>lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610</i>."<br><br><b>Appellant violated Section S(c) of RA 9262</b><br><br>Finally, the Court of Appeals did not err in affirming appellant's conviction for violation of Section 5(c) of RA 9262, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><b>SECTION 5.</b> <i>Acts of Violence Against Women and Their Children</i>. - The crime of violence against women and their children is committed through any of the following acts:<br><br>xxx<br><br>(c) Attempting to cause the woman or her child physical harm;<br><br>xxx<br></blockquote>Here, AAA, CCC and DDD testified that on August 5, 2006, appellant, in a drunken stupor, berated them "<i>Mga demonyo kayo! Mga walang kwenta! Tatadtarin ko kayo!</i>" Thereupon, appellant went upstairs, took a <i>samurai</i>, and chased AAA's family with it. These acts of the appellant clearly evince an attempt to cause them physical harm.<br><br>Appellant claims, however, that the prosecution failed to prove that the chasing incident actually happened. The prosecution witnesses testified that their neighbors saw it as it occurred but none of them testified in open court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> The argument, however, essentially assails the credibility and sufficiency of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. Again, these are matters that have already been addressed by the courts below. At any rate, the testimonies of the victims' neighbors are essential and merely corroborative at best.<br><br><b>Penalties</b><br><br>For the two (2) counts of rape by carnal knowledge (CR-06-8544 and CR-06-8545), both the trial court and Court of Appeals correctly sentenced appellant to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole for each count. Since the minor victim was the daughter of appellant's common-law spouse, the proper penalty under Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> would have been death were it not for the enactment of RA 9346.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> As such, the trial court correctly specified that appellant is not eligible for parole.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Pursuant to <b><i>People v. Jugueta</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> appellant is also liable for civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages of Php100,000.00 each for every count of rape.<br><br>For the three (3) counts of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610 (CR-06-8540, CR-06-8541 and CR-06-8543), appellant's penalties must be modified in accordance with <b><i>People v. Tulagan</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> The Court instructed that the proper penalty for each count of lascivious conduct is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. Since appellant is the stepfather of the victims, the penalty shall be imposed in its maximum period in consonance with Section 31(c) of RA 7610.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Appellant shall therefore be sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for each count. Appellant shall also pay civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages of P75,000.00 each for every count of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Finally, appellant's violation of Section 5(c) of RA 9262 (CR-06-8542) is punishable by one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months of <i>arresto mayor</i> pursuant to Section 6(b) of the same law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> In view of the attendant alternative circumstance of relationship between appellant and his victims, the maximum penalty of six (6) months of <i>arresto mayor</i> shall be imposed. Since the penalty does not exceed one (1) year, the indeterminate sentence law does not apply. In addition to imprisonment, appellant shall pay fine of P100,000.00. He shall also undergo mandatory psychological counseling and report his compliance to the trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>All amounts, except for the fine, shall earn six percent (6%) interest <i>per annum</i> from finality of this decision until fully paid.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.
