COA likewise submits that the delay was justified by the necessity for thoroughness in audit.<br><br>Respondent's position is well-taken.<br><br>Section 16, Article III of the 1987 Constitution guarantees that all persons shall have the right to a speedy disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial and administrative bodies.

After all, in administrative proceedings, "due notice" simply means the information that must be given or made to a particular person or to the public within a legally mandated period of time so that its recipient will have the opportunity to respond to a situation or to allegations that affect the individual's or public's legal rights or duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In this case, ND Nos. 2008-06-27-001-101 (2009), 2008-06-27-003-101 (2009), and 2008-06-27-004-101 (2009) bore the following reasons for disallowance:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>References</strong></div></td><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>Facts and/or Reasons for Disallowance</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">ND No. 2008-06-27-001-101 (2009)</div></td><td><div align="center">Unaccomplished deficiency of 0.58% or PI96,526.13[,] the equivalent amount i terms of pesos.

On appeal to the COA-RD of Region V, petitioners and Baldon offered the documents below to show the private contractor's rectification of the deficiency following their receipt of the ND:<br><blockquote>1. Letter/Report issued by the Office of the Municipal Engineer, dated October 20, 2009, stating that per inspection of the BIBT project conducted on even date, the 50kva transformer and its accessories, in accordance with the Program of Work (POW), had been installed;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>2.

Upon automatic review of the COA Proper, the respondent affirmed the modification made by the COA-RD of Region V.<br><br>In presently assailing ND No. 2008-06-27-001-101 (2009), petitioners draw attention to the apparent distinctions between the original ND No. 2008-06-27-001-101 (2009) issued by the ATL, on one hand, and the modified ND No. 2008-06-27-001-101 (2009) as assessed by the COA-RD of Region V, on the other hand, as shown below:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2" width="33%">&nbsp;</td><td colspan="2"><div align="center">NDNo. 2008-06-27-001-101 (2009) </div></td></tr><tr><td width="34%"><div align="center">ORIGINAL</div></td><td width="33%"><div align="center">MODIFIED</div></td></tr><tr><td>AMOUNT</td><td><div align="center">P196.526.13</div></td><td><div align="center">P145.770.60</div></td></tr><tr><td>REASON<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOR <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DISALLOWANCE</td><td>Unaccomplished deficiency of 0.58% upon per inspection</td><td>Liquidated Damages by reason of the delay in the delivery and installation of additional 25 kva transformer and its accessories in the main terminal building</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Petitioners assert that there was denial of administrative due process when, after the private contractor Baldon had established that her construction firm had rectified the deficiency cited by the ATL in the original ND No. 2008-06-27-001-101 (2009), the COA-RD and respondent COA Proper still partly sustained the said disallowance based on a new ground. Considering that the basis for the liability under the modified ND was different from that originally cited, petitioners claim that a new ND should have been issued covering the same. Petitioners, thus, argue that respondent COA committed grave abuse of discretion when it affirmed ND No. 2008-06-27-001-101 (2009) as modified by the COA-RD of Region V.<br><br>The argument lacks merit.<br><br>While the original and the modified ND No. 2008-06-27-001-101 (2009) may appear to refer to distinct violations, both are predicated on the same cause, which was the failure of the contractor to fulfill its obligation to install a 50kva transformer and its accessories in the main terminal building of the project within the contract time. Based on record, it is evident that the shift from the initial ground of disallowance to the new one was simply the residual result of the rectification of the deficiency beyond contract time, that perforce had the effect of causing further delay in the completion of the BIBT project. Hence, petitioners could not have been surprised at all by the succeeding assessment for delay, so as to validate their claim of denial of due process. After all, the cause of the modified disallowance was subsumed in the original. Accordingly, a new notice of disallowance is not required; the modification of the original ND No. 2008-06-27-001-101 (2009) suffices under the circumstances of this case.<br><br>In view thereof, the respondent COA Proper aptly affirmed the modification made by the COA RD on ND No. 2008-06-27-001-101 (2009), especially since the evidence on record clearly supports the contractor's liability for the said delay.<br><br>In this connection, it may not be amiss to state that the COA is not required to limit its review only to the grounds relied upon by a government agency's auditor with respect to disallowing certain disbursements of public funds. In consonance with its general audit power, respondent Commission on Audit is not merely legally permitted, but is also duty-bound to make its own assessment of the merits of the disallowed disbursement and not simply restrict itself to reviewing the validity of the ground relied upon by the auditor of the government agency concerned.

The reason for the partial lifting of the disallowance was the failure of the COA-TAS to support the finding of overpricing with actual canvass sheets and/or price quotations from identified suppliers, as required under COA Memorandum No. 97-012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Thus, the remaining amount of disallowance pertains to the NCV of the overestimated quantities of construction materials, rental cost of equipment and cost of labor. Petitioners fault the respondent COA Proper in sustaining the disallowance thereof. They argue that respondent gravely abused its discretion in giving credence to the Detailed Estimates<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> made by the COA-TAS, which are attended with the following supposed defects and irregularities:<br><blockquote><u>Point 1:</u><br><blockquote>It must be noted that in the Detailed Estimates under Masonry Works, page 2, for 10,475 hollow blocks used, Engr. Gomez estimated only 611 bags of cement needed or to be used.<br><br>However on page 5, for another Masonry Works, for 13,800 pieces of hollow blocks[,] Gomez estimated that only 120 bags of cement are needed.<br><br>x x x x</blockquote>Point 2:<br><blockquote>Relative to the Perimeter Fencing, on page 1 of both the LGU Program of Work and the COA Detailed Estimates, the COA inspector (Engr. Gomez) did not include in his Detailed Cost Estimates the use of scaffoldings for the construction of the perimeter fence, x x x</blockquote>Point 3:<br><blockquote>In the COA. Detailed Estimates prepared by the COA inspector, the employment of a Civil Engineer, or an Electrical Engineer, or a Project Engineer who must supervise, check and oversee the whole project as big as the Bus Terminal was not included. The BIBT was a big civil works project awarded to a contractor who must hire a professional civil engineer, or any other engineer, depending on the line of work or project being done. The labor cost for such engineer was obviously disregarded or omitted by the COA inspector[,] which could partly account for or explain or reduce the alleged overestimated cost of the project.</blockquote>Point 4:<br><blockquote>COA Inspector (Engr. Gomez) raised the issue that for the acquisition of common borrow which will be used as filling material, why adopt the farther source in the LGU estimate and pay a higher cost of P220.00 per cubic meter instead of the nearer source with lower cost of P130 per cubic meter? He claimed that] in this material alone, the government could have saved P90.00 per cubic meter of P1,944,000.00 for 21,600 cubic meters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>It must be pointed out that the site of the [BIBT] is very much different from that of the Municipal Slaughterhouse. The BIBT project is located in a rice field needing more selected type of filling materials than the usual filling materials for the construction site of an ordinary project like a slaughterhouse. The BIBT serves as a facility that can carry heavier loads like, not only the building but several buses equivalent to 50 units at some point of time, and thus, the foundation materials had included selected filling materials like boulders and rocks. The area at the site of the BIBT project sits on a ground softer than at the slaughterhouse site. Thus, there was a need for a selected borrow since safety like security is a main concern for the Bus Terminal Management.<br><br>Accordingly, [the] alleged savings of P90.00 per cubic meter for 21,600 cubic meters or a total amount of P1,944,000.00 is totally baseless and therefore there was no overestimation in the quantity and price of the borrow used as filling materials for the BIBT project.</blockquote>Point 5:<br><blockquote>The COA inspector (Engr. Gomez) had questioned the rental of Road Grader estimated by the LGU of Bulan at P12,048.00 per eight-hour operation based on Municipal Ordinance No. 002, Series of 2005<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> [xxx] which is the prevailing rate at the construction site. Engr.

And if Engr. Gomez used any other rates prevailing in a locality outside of the LGU [of] Bulan or in a place far from the construction site like Legaspi City, then Engr. Gomez failed to consider the factors that affect costing or pricing or rental, like distance, time and the added cost of hauling the heavy equipment to and from the project site at Bulan Sorsogon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>While this Court finds points 1 to 4 raised by petitioners to be ostensibly sound in theory, it is unfortunate that petitioners failed to present before Us the LGUs Program of Work (POW), in order to enable Us to confirm whether the items or expenses referred to in petitioners' arguments indeed form part of the agency approved budget, and whether they constitute the remaining gross variance of P2,964,344.89.

No. 57, series of 2002,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> in arriving at the rental cost estimates. According to petitioners, since DPWH D.O. No. 57, series of 2002, was not published in the University of the Philippines (U.P.) Law Center - Office of the National Administrative Register (ONAR), the same is "inexistent."<br><br>We agree with petitioners that the lack of publication and non-submission to the U.P. Law Center - ONAR, of DPWH Department Order (D.O.) No. 57, series of 2002, rendered the same ineffective, insofar as it requires the adoption of the Associated Construction Equipment Lessors. Inc. (ACEL) rental rates as the basis of equipment rental cost in the preparation of a project's Approved Budget for Contract (ABC). This Court has emphasized that both the requirements of publication and filing of administrative issuances intended to enforce existing laws—R.A. No. 9184, in this case—are mandatory for the effectivity of said issuances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>However, the ineffectiveness thereof notwithstanding, COA is not precluded from adopting the rental rates prescribed by the DPWH, if it is shown that the same is more practical and of least cost to the government. This is in view of COA's mandate preventing excessive and unnecessary costs to the government. In this case, it is apparent that the DPWH rental rates are lower than that prescribed in Municipal Ordinance No. 002, Series of 2005, which was used as basis in the preparation of the ABC for the BIBT project. Hence, the COA did not commit grave abuse of discretion in sustaining the COA-TAS rental cost estimate for the lease of heavy equipment, based on the DPWH rental rates.<br><br>This brings Us to the issue of who are liable under ND No. 2008-06-27-002-101 (2009). We hold that only the BAC Chairman Dino and Municipal Engineer Gonzales are liable for this disallowance. Under Section 103 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445, expenditures of government funds or uses of government property in violation of law or regulations shall be a personal liability of the official or employee found to be directly responsible therefor. Considering that the BAC chairman and the municipal engineer were directly involved in the preparation of the budget for the project, they should be made liable for the overestimated quantity of the materials and the rates used for the costing of the BIBT project.<br><br>Petitioner De Castro, on the other hand, cannot be held liable under this disallowance, since she had nothing to do with the preparation of the estimated cost of the BIBT project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Applying the <i>Arias</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> doctrine, the fact that petitioner De Castro was the final approving authority of the transactions in question and that the officers who processed the same were directly under her supervision, do not suffice to make her liable, in the absence of indication that she had notice of any circumstance that could have aroused her suspicion that what she was approving falls within the purview of an excessive transaction. To be clear, the documents in question involve technical matters that are beyond the professional competence of De Castro.<br><br>The proprietor of the private contractor S.R.

In so ruling, the respondent invalidated the Work Suspension Order dated May 15, 2007 issued by petitioner De Castro, which served as the basis for the contractor to stop the work operations on the project from July 2, 2007 until September 10, 2007. According to COA, De Castro's Work Suspension Order, which was predicated on the municipal government's recourse to undertake an alternative financing scheme to fund the project, is not a fortuitous event that would render it a valid ground for work suspension under Item 9(1) of Annex E to IRR-A of R.A. No. 9184, which states:<br><blockquote>9.1. The procuring entity shall have the authority to suspend the work wholly or partly by written order for such period as may be deemed necessary, due to force majeure or any fortuitous events or for failure on the part of the contractor to correct bad conditions which are unsafe for workers or for the general public, to carry out valid orders given by the procuring entity or to perform any provisions of the contract, or due to adjustment of plans to suit field conditions as found necessary during construction. The contractor shall immediately comply with such order to suspend the work wholly or partly.</blockquote>COA further ruled that neither does the said circumstance fall under Item 9(2) of Annex E to IRR-A of R.A. No. 9184, which enumerates the following grounds for a contractor to request for work suspension:<br><blockquote>9.2. The contractor or its duly authorized representative shall have the right to suspend work operation on any or all projects/activities along the critical path of activities after fifteen (15) calendar days from date of receipt of written notice from the contractor to the district engineer/regional director/consultant or equivalent official, as the case may be, due to the following:<br><br>a. There exist right-of-way problems which prohibit the contractor from performing work in accordance with the approved construction schedule.<br><br>b. Requisite construction plans which must be owner-furnished are not issued to the contractor precluding any work called for by such plans.<br><br>c. Peace and order conditions make it extremely dangerous, if not possible, to work. However, this condition must be certified in writing by the Philippine National Police (PNP) station which has responsibility over the affected area and confirmed by the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Regional Director.<br><br>d. There is failure on the part of the procuring entity to deliver government-furnished materials and equipment as stipulated in the contract.<br><br>e. Delay in the payment of contractor's claim for progress billing beyond forty- five (45) calendar days from the time the contractor's claim has been certified to by the procuring entity's authorized representative that the documents are complete unless there are justifiable reasons thereof which shall be communicated in writing to the contractor.</blockquote>Taking exception therefrom, petitioners argue that the respondent committed grave abuse of discretion in relying solely upon the grounds for work suspension mentioned in Items 9(1) and (2) of Annex E to IRR-A of R.A. No. 9184 to invalidate the subject Work Suspension Order. They assert that De Castro's order may likewise be justified under the General Welfare Clause of the Local Government Code. Expounding on this assertion, they explain that in order to fund the construction and development of the several priority projects, such as the BIBT, SB Ordinance No. 004, series of 2003,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> was enacted authorizing the municipal mayor to float Bulan bonds in the amount of P50,000,000.00. In the same ordinance, the municipal mayor was also authorized to undertake alternative arrangements should such be necessary due to cost considerations. Thereafter, when the implementation of the Bulan bonds turned out to be difficult, SB Resolution No. 033 series of 2007<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> was issued on July 16, 2007, authorizing the municipal mayor to apply, negotiate and enter into a contract of loan or any credit accommodation or facility to finance the early redemption or bail-out of the outstanding Bulan Bonds. Considering the amount of time, it would take to process the refinancing agreement, petitioner De Castro issued the questioned Work Suspension Order in order to protect the interest of the municipality from being sued by the private contractor for any resulting delay in the payment of progress and final billings.<br><br>Petitioners likewise submit that, in any case, since the date of approval of the loan is uncertain and beyond the control of De Castro, it can be considered a fortuitous event or force majeure, which thus constitutes as valid basis for the issuance of the challenged Work Suspension Order. Accordingly, they argue that there was no delay in the completion of the project since the work suspension was justified.<br><br>Petitioners further lament the imposition of personal liability upon De Castro for the subject disallowance. They claim that assuming that there was indeed a delay, the liability to pay liquidated damages must be shouldered by the private contractor alone, based on the tenor of Item 8(1), Annex "E" of the IRR of R.A. No. 9184, which reads:<br><blockquote>8.1. Where the contractor refuses or fails to satisfactorily complete the work within the specified contract time, plus any time extension duly granted and is hereby in default under the contract, the contractor shall pay the procuring entity for liquidated damages, and not by way of penalty, an amount, as provided in the conditions of contract, equal to at least one tenth (1/10) of one (1) percent of the cost of the unperformed portion of the works for every day of delay.</blockquote>Petitioner's last argument was echoed by the OSG in its Partial Manifestation.<br><br>We find merit in petitioners' arguments.<br><br>The above-cited clause on liquidated damages is clear about its purpose and application: it is a deterrent against delays by the contractor, which result in a breach of the contract. The same clause provides that the reckoning of the delay excludes any time extension duly granted. In other words, if the delay is not the contractor's fault, the clause on liquidated damages is not triggered and no such damages are due. Consequently, ND No. 2008-06-27-003-101 should be set aside. Under Part I<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> of the Rules of Return in the case of <i>Madera v. COA,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> there is no amount to disallow or to return.<br><br>Even assuming such liquidated damages are due, it must likewise be noted that the suspension was due to an ongoing loan negotiation which followed the failure of the bond flotation initially intended to fund the project. Petitioner De Castro argues that the issuance of the work suspension order was done to protect the interests of the municipality by avoiding collection suits from private contractors. This, to Our mind, is a badge of good faith which may excuse the "return" of the amount disallowed, as per Part 2a<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> of <i>Madera.</i><br><br>ND No. 2008-06-27-004-101 (2009)<br>(<i><u>Disallowance by Reason of Alleged Misfeasance in Giving Inconsistent and Misleading Information Regarding the Actual Date of Completion of the said Project</u></i>)<br><br>Under the original ND No. 2008-06-27-004-101 (2009), the amount of P169,721.20 was disallowed, covering the liquidated damages for the pmported 34-day delay in the completion of the Bulan Slaughterhouse project, based on a Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> issued by Municipal Engineer Gonzales, dated July 24, 2007, which states that the BIBT and the Bulan Slaughterhouse projects were still on-going. On appeal to the COA-RD for Region V, Gonzales explained that the content of the said Certification dated July 24, 2007 was an honest mistake. He claimed the project was actually completed on April 29, 2007, based on his Accomplishment Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> on even date. He further argued that even supposing that the actual completion date was on May 29, 2007, as purported by the Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> issued by the Project-in-Charge and noted by him, the same was still well-within schedule, and thus, there was no basis to impose liquidated damages.<br><br>On July 4, 2012, the CO A Regional Director for Region V issued a Decision lifting ND No. 2008-06-27-004-101 (2009) due to insufficiency of evidence that the Bulan Slaughterhouse was completed beyond schedule, but gave a stern warning to the municipal engineer to stop giving inconsistent and misleading information (i.e. dates of project completion, work accomplishment, etc.) to users of his reports.<br><br>On automatic review of the decision of the COA RD, the COA Proper set aside the lifting of ND No. 2008-06-27-004-101 (2009). The public respondent found Municipal Engineer Gonzales, solely and personally liable for the disallowance under ND No. 2008-06-27-004-101 (2009), by reason of his alleged misfeasance in giving inconsistent and misleading information regarding the actual date of completion of the said project. The COA Proper held that although there was no legal basis to sustain the ND No. 2008-06-27-004-101 (2009), as issued by the ATL, the same is without prejudice to the administrative liability of the Municipal Engineer for his misfeasance.<br><br>Petitioners now assail the ruling of respondent COA Proper, arguing that misfeasance is not a ground for disallowance. Along this line of argument, the OSG likewise challenges the said COA ruling, arguing that the liability imposed upon Gonzales cannot be considered as a disallowance since there is no irregular or excessive expenditure to speak of in this case. The OSG posits that in imposing liability on Gonzales for his supposed misfeasance, the public respondent, in excess of its jurisdiction, rendered the municipal engineer guilty of an administrative offense. According to the OSG, COA Proper, in effect, imposed a fine upon Gonzales for his alleged misfeasance, in the guise of a disallowance.<br><br>We agree with the OSG.<br><br>The power of COA to disallow expenditures proceeds from its duty<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> to prevent irregular<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup>, unnecessary<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup>, excessive<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup>, or extravagant<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> expenditures or uses of government funds or property,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> and those which are illegal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> and unconscionable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> It stands to reason, therefore, that in the absence of these anomalous types of disbursements, there is no ground to warrant the disallowance of an expenditure.<br><br>Such is the situation in this case. To recall, the purported ground for the issuance of ND No. 2008-06-27-004-101 (2009) by the ATL, was the illegal or irregular disbursement of the sum of P169,721.20 representing the liquidated damages for the alleged 34-day delay in the completion of the Bulan Slaughterhouse project — an amount that ought to have been deducted from the final payment to the private contractor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> However, upon review of both the COA RD and the COA Proper, both tribunals found no sufficient basis to sustain the assessment of the ATL under the original ND No. 2008-06-27-004-101 (2009), ostensibly holding that there was insufficient evidence to establish the alleged 34-day delay.<br><br>On this score, Our own perusal of the evidence yields to the same finding. On one hand, the single evidence relied upon by the ATL in support of its finding of delay, was the Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> issued by petitioner Gonzales dated July 24, 2007, stating that the construction of the project was then still ongoing. On the other hand, petitioners harped on the following documents to prove that the project was completed prior to its deadline on June 20, 2007, and the statement made by Gonzales in the Certification dated July 24, 2007, regarding the ongoing status of the project, was an honest mistake:<br><blockquote>a. Accomplishment Report issued by Municipal Engineer Gonzales, dated April 29, 2007, stating that the Bulan Slaughterhouse was actually completed on April 29, 2007;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>b. Request for Inspection and Final Payment, dated May 28, 2007, from Steven Construction and Supply, addressed to then Mayor De Castro;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>c. Certification issued by the Project-in-Charge Mr. Benito Marquez, and noted by Municipal Engineer Gonzales, dated May 29, 2007, stating that the project was 100% work accomplished as of May 29, 2007;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>d. Official Receipt issued by Steven Construction dated June 4, 2007, acknowledging that final payment has been made by the LGU of Bulan for a project already completed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup></blockquote>To Our minds, petitioners' documentary evidence preponderantly establish that the project was completed prior to the expiration of the 180-day contract time, ending on June 20, 2007. In their chronological sequence, these documents credibly tell the following narrative: that on April 29, 2007 (128 days from the commencement date), the construction of Bulan Slaughterhouse project was completed; thereafter, on May 28, 2007, the private contractor requested the municipal government to conduct an inspection on the project as a necessary precursor for the final payment; on May 29, 2007 (still well-within the 180-day contract time), the project was inspected and the work thereon was certified as 100% accomplished "as of the inspection date; accordingly, the final payment was made to the private contractor on 4 June 2007. Under the foregoing established facts, the purported delay in the project completion—the basis for the issuance of the original ND No. 2008-06-27-004-101 (2009)—is belied.<br><br>In view thereof, the amount covered by ND No. 2008-06-27-004-101 (2009), as assessed by the ATL, cannot be characterized as an illegal or irregular disbursement so as to constitute a valid ground for its disallowance. Accordingly, no liability in audit arises therefrom, considering that a liability for disallowance should partake of the nature of an obligation for restitution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> of an expenditure or disbursement that is found to be illegal, irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant or unconscionable.<br><br>Turning now to the liability imposed upon the Municipal Engineer Gonzales to pay the amount of P169,721.20 under ND No. 2008-06-27-004-101 (2009) on the ground of his supposed misfeasance, the same clearly constitutes an administrative liability, since it was meted not for the purpose of restituting the government of an unlawful disbursement, but obviously as a fine or penalty. By doing so, COA clearly overstepped its authority to merely initiate appropriate administrative action, as well as civil and criminal, against any government officer or employee, whenever upon examination or audit, a violation of law or regulation is discovered or disclosed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br><u>ND No. 2008-06-27-005-101 (2009) and<br>NDNo. 2008-06-27-006-101 (2009)</u><br><br>ND Nos. 2008-06-27-005-101 (2009) and ND No. 2008-06-27-006-101 (2009), which declared null and void the contracts over the BIBT and the Bulan Slaughterhouse projects, respectively, were predicated on petitioners1 violation of Section 8-III-A of R.A. No. 9184, for their failure to post procurement opportunities relative to the said projects in the PhilGEPS website. On appeal to the COA RD for Region V and upon automatic review by the COA Proper, both tribunals found no legal basis to nullify the subject contracts and ordered the lifting of the said disallowances, without prejudice to the administrative liability of the municipal officers and employees responsible for the said violation. The COA Proper ratiocinated:<br><blockquote>It is clear from the provision of Section 8.2.1 and 8.3.1 of IRR-Aof R.A. No. 9184 that the Procuring Entity is mandated to fully use the PhilGEPS. The Head of the Procuring Entity (HOPE) and BAC in this case, deliberately violated the said provisions through its failure to post the invitation to bid of the said project procurement, results of bidding and related information in the PhilGEPS website.<br><br>However, since the project was already completed and delivered, and the public has benefited therefrom, equitable considerations allow for payment to the Contractor based on <i>quantum meruit.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup></blockquote>Petitioners now assail the portion of the COA Proper Decision finding them administratively liable for the non-posting of the invitation to bid for the BIBT and the Bulan Slaughterhouse projects in the PhilGEPS website. According to petitioners, respondent had illegally assumed administrative disciplinary jurisdiction when it proclaimed petitioners be administratively liable under ND Nos. 2008-06-27-005-101 (2009) and ND No. 2008-06-27-006-101 (2009), notwithstanding its own finding that the said disallowances had no legal basis.<br><br>The contention is misplaced.<br><br>Subsumed in respondent's authority to initiate an appropriate criminal, civil or administrative action, whenever it discovers a violation of a law or regulation upon examination, audit, or settlement of an account or claim,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> is the authority make preliminary findings and conclusions as bases for filing such actions. Hence, it is within the bounds of COA's jurisdiction to make determinations as to petitioners' administrative liability, albeit preliminarily and only for the purpose of filing the appropriate action.<br><br>Under the circumstances, respondent COA's disposition of ND Nos. 2008-06-27-005-101 (2009) andNDNo. 2008-06-27-006-101 (2009), which states "without prejudice to the administrative liability of Mayor De Castro, Head of Procuring Entity and the BAC Members for violation of the provisions of R.A. No. 9184 and its IRR regarding the full use of PhilGEPS" is not indicative of an imposition of administrative liability. Hence, the respondent committed no grave abuse of discretion in making such pronouncement.<br><br>At this point, the Court finds it premature to resolve the defenses raised by petitioners to justify the non-posting of the procurement opportunities in the PhilGEPS website, as to do so would be preempting the resolution of the administrative case against them involving the matter.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the petition is <b>PARTIALLY</b> <b>GRANTED.</b> The assailed COA Decision dated September 11, 2014 and Resolution dated November 9, 2016 are <b>MODIFIED</b> as follows:<br><br>The modified ND No. 2008-06-27-001-101 (2009), holding Shirley R.
