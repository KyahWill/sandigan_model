SP. No. 135062 which modified the December 26, 2013 National Labor Relations Commission's (NLRC) Decision and February 25, 2014 NLRC Resolution by dismissing the monetary claims except for indemnity. The NLRC affirmed the September 26, 2013 Labor Arbiter's (LA) Decision, which dismissed the complaint for illegal dismissal but awarded monetary claims to petitioner Fiamette A. Ramil (Ramil).</p><p align="center"><strong>The Facts</strong></p><p>On June 7, 2009, Ramil was hired as a Spa Supervisor and Massage Therapist at respondent's establishment, Stoneleaf Spa and Wellness Center. Respondent Stoneleaf, Inc. (Stoneleaf) paid Ramil a monthly salary of P10,000.00 and P100.00 per massage service rendered. Ramil was also an incorporator/director in Stoneleaf's Articles of Incorporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p>In January 2010, Ramil inquired about the payment of contributions for Social Security System (SSS), Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (Philhealth), and Pag-Ibig Fund [Pagtutulungan sa kinabukasan: Ikaw, Bangko, Industriya at Gobyerno Fund]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (Pag-Ibig), which were necessary in processing the spa's permit. She also questioned the deduction of 12% value-added tax from her commission. As a result, she got the ire of Stoneleaf President, respondent Joseph Anthony P. De Guzman (De Guzman).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><p>On August 27, 2012, Stoneleaf's receptionist/cashier, Jingle Abarquez, (Abarquez), was on official leave, and Ramil took over her duties. In the afternoon of that day, a regular client came in for massage service. However, the service was not recorded in the computer as required by company procedure. After closing of business day, Ramil reported to De Guzman through a short messaging system (SMS) that there were only three clients, when in fact there were four. The cash box contained P1,300.00 instead of P1,650.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p><p>When Abarquez reported for work the following day, she checked the previous day's transactions. Another spa employee, Rowena Beloy (Beloy), told Abarquez about Ramil's anomalous transaction. Abarquez and Beloy reported the matter to De Guzman. Julius Tabangcora (Tabangcora), another spa employee, confirmed that he rendered a massage service to a client on August 27, 2012, but it was not reflected in the computer and the billing was not on file.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p><p>De Guzman investigated the matter and discovered Ramil's dishonest act. When Ramil was confronted, she denied the allegation against her. On September 27, 2012, Stoneleaf terminated Ramil's employment due to serious misconduct, betrayal of trust, and loss of confidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p><p>Ramil filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against Stoneleaf, De Guzman, and Maximo M. Dones<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (Dones) before the labor tribunal. She alleged that she was not given a copy of the charge against her, and she was fired on the same day that she was notified of her dismissal. She averred that she was denied of substantial and procedural due process. She claimed to be entitled to reinstatement with backwages, last salary for September 16-30, 2012, proportionate 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, unpaid commission, labor standard benefits, moral and exemplary damages of P100,000.00, and 10% attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p>Stoneleaf, De Guzman, and Dones contended that investigations and meetings were conducted, and sworn statements of the spa's employees were submitted. Ramil also offered her explanation in a lunch meeting with De Guzman sometime in September 2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p align="center"><strong>The Labor Arbiter's Decision</strong></p><p>On September 26, 2013, LA Alberto B. Dolosa rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dismissing the complaint for lack of merit. The individual respondents, De Guzman and Dones, were dropped for lack of factual basis. However, the LA ordered Stoneleaf to pay Ramil the following labor standards benefits since Stoneleaf was unable to prove payment. All other claims were dismissed for lack of merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">1.

Stoneleaf was able to support the dismissal through documentary evidence and found the following: (1) on August 27, 2012, a massage service on a client was not recorded in the computer; (2) Ramil instructed Abarquez to cover-up the shortage on August 27, 2012 with undeclared sales; (3) Ramil took the credit for services rendered by Dia Camilon, another spa employee; (4) Ramil sold to others the ointments that were used in the spa; (5) Ramil took home the towels in the spa; and (6) Ramil did not reflect the sales in the computer and took the money instead.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p>However, Ramil was dismissed without due process, which entitled her to an indemnity of P5,000.00. The LA resolved that the alleged meeting cannot take the place of the required notice. Ramil was also entitled to attorney's fees since she was forced to litigate her case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p align="center"><strong>The NLRC Decision</strong></p><p>Stoneleaf appealed to the NLRC, which affirmed the LA's Decision in its December 26, 2013 Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The NLRC held that Ramil was not a managerial employee/staff because her duties and responsibilities do not fall under any of the categories of Section 2(b), Rule 1, Book III of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code. Ramil's work does not: (1) directly relate to management policies; (2) involve regular exercise of discretion and judgment; and (3) pertain to policy formulation, hiring, or firing of employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p>The NLRC explained that the test of supervisory or managerial status depends on whether a person possesses authority to act in the interest of his employer, and whether such authority is not merely routinary or clerical in nature, but requires the use of independent judgment. Here, there is no evidence that Ramil has authority equivalent to managerial actions which uses independent judgment. It was apparent that she executed approved and established policies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p>The NLRC determined that although Ramil looked for suppliers for the spa, she cannot decide whether to get a particular supplier. Ramil evaluated applicants for the spa, but her evaluation was subject to De Guzman's approval. She also reported to De Guzman the number of clients served and how much sales were made for the day.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p>Lastly, Stoneleaf failed to refute that Ramil received P100.00 as commission for every massage service that she rendered. Furthermore, one of the employees stated in her sworn statement that Ramil assigned to herself clients who give tips and claimed that the client specifically requested her. This indicated that Ramil was a massage therapist or a rank-and-file employee, and not a managerial employee/staff. Thus, she was entitled to the labor standards benefits awarded by the LA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p>Stoneleaf moved for reconsideration, which the NLRC denied in its February 25, 2014 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Unconvinced, Stoneleaf filed a petition for <em>certiorari</em> in the CA.</p><p align="center"><strong>The CA Decision</strong></p><p>On August 13, 2015, the CA rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> partially granting the petition and modifying the NLRC Decision and Resolution by retaining only the indemnity award of P5,000.00 for violation of right to procedural due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p>The CA resolved that Ramil was a supervisory/managerial employee based on her admission and the scope of assignments she indicated in her position paper. She exercised management prerogatives for Stoneleaf's interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Consequently, she was not entitled to 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, holiday pay, and service incentive leave pay. The CA also ruled that there was no basis for the award of attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p>However, the CA sustained that she was dismissed for a valid cause but without observance of due process; thus, she was entitled to nominal damages of P5,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p>Ramil moved for reconsideration, which the CA denied in its January 14, 2016 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Aggrieved, Ramil filed this petition before the Court.</p><p align="center"><strong>The Issue Presented</strong></p><p>Whether or not the CA erred in partially granting the petition and deleting the monetary awards of service incentive leave pay, holiday pay, pro-rated 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, and attorney's fees.</p><p align="center"><strong>The Court's Ruling</strong></p><p>The petition is granted.</p><p>The general rule in a petition for review on <em>certiorari</em> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is that only questions of law should be raised. In <em>Republic of the Philippines v. Heirs of Eladio Santiago,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Court enumerated that one of the exceptions to the general rule is when the CA's findings are contrary to those of the trial court. Considering the different findings of fact and conclusions of law of the LA, the NLRC and the CA, the Court shall entertain this petition, which involves a re-assessment of the evidence presented.</p><p>Foremost, the Court clarifies that the Court shall no longer discuss the legality of the dismissal and the propriety of the award of nominal damages of P5,000.00, because the labor tribunals and the CA are consistent in its findings that Ramil was dismissed for a valid cause but without due process. Thus, she is entitled to nominal damages. Factual findings of administrative agencies are generally accorded respect and even finality by the Court, especially when these findings are affirmed by the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Furthermore, Ramil did not appeal the LA's ruling dismissing the complaint for illegal dismissal for lack of merit. It was Stoneleaf who filed an appeal questioning the monetary awards.</p><p>The main issue to be resolved is whether or not petitioner Ramil is entitled to service incentive leave pay, holiday pay, pro-rated 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, and attorney's fees. Under the Labor Code of the Philippines (Labor Code), rank-and­-file employees are entitled to these monetary awards, but not managerial employees. Stoneleaf claims that Ramil is a managerial employee/staff, while the latter argues otherwise. The Court must determine to which class of employees Ramil belongs.</p><p>Article 82 of the Labor Code enumerates the employees excluded from the coverage of labor standards benefits.</p><blockquote><p>ART. 82. <em>Coverage</em>. – The provisions of this Title shall apply to employees in all establishments and undertakings whether for profit or not, but not to government employees, <strong>managerial employees</strong>, field personnel, members of the family of the employer who are dependent on him for support, domestic helpers, persons in the personal service of another, and workers who are paid by results as determined by the Secretary of Labor in appropriate regulations.</p><p>As used herein, <strong>"managerial employees" refer to those whose primary duty consists of the management of the establishment in which they are employed or of a department or subdivision thereof, and to other officers or members of the managerial staff.</strong> (Emphasis supplied)</p></blockquote><p>The Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code states that managerial employees and members of the managerial staff are those who meet the following conditions:</p><blockquote><p>(b) Managerial employees, if they meet all of the following conditions:</p><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="2%" valign="top">(1)</td><td width="98%"><div align="justify">Their primary duty consists of the management of the establishment in which they are employed or of a department or sub-division thereof.</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>(2)</td><td>They customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more employees therein.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(3)</td><td><div align="justify">They have the authority to hire or fire employees of lower rank;

The scope of her assignment pertains to the daily operation of the spa by making sure that the business runs smoothly. However, her tasks do not include the regular exercise of discretion. Her authority is limited to the execution of company procedures and policies. She has plenty of administrative work, but none of it involves the use of independent judgment. Her duties are also subject to De Guzman's approval.</p><p>The Court agrees with the NLRC's observations as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Applying the above criteria, complainant's duties and responsibilities do not x x x fall under any of the categories enumerated above. Complainant's work was not directly related to management policies. No circumstances were shown by respondents to reveal that complainant regularly exercised discretion and independent judgment. Neither did complainant participate in policy formulation nor in the hiring or firing of employees.</p><p>It must be pointed out that the test of "supervisory" or "managerial status" depends on whether a person possesses authority to act in the interest of his employer, and whether such authority is not merely routinary or clerical in nature, but requires the use of independent judgment. Simply put, the functions of the position are not managerial in nature if they only execute approved and established policies leaving little or no discretion at all whether to implement said policies or not.</p><p>In the instant case, the position held by complainant and its concomitant duties failed to overcome the above mentioned test. Her assigned tasks do not at all indicate that complainant can exercise the powers equivalent to managerial actions which require independent judgment. At the least, there is no evidence that she was vested with duties attributable to a managerial employee or to a member of the managerial staff.</p><p>What is more apparent, however, is that the functions of complainant seem to involve the execution of approved and established policies. While she may be tasked to source out suppliers of merchandise for the spa, there is no showing that she has the last say on whether to get from the supplier or not. Truly, she may evaluate the competency of applicants, but still this is subject to the approval of respondent De Guzman. Noteworthy, complainant reports to respondent De Guzman at the end of business hours to inform the latter how many clients were served by the spa and how much sales was made for the day.</p><p>Moreover, the respondents' failure to controvert the complainant's claim that she gets a commission of [P]100.00 for every massage service rendered is a clear manifestation that complainant was one of the massage therapists of the spa. This finds support in the sworn statement of Arcega, wherein the latter attested that complainant assigns to herself clients who give tips and claim that the customer specifically asked for her. Indeed, if it were true that she is a managerial employee or a member of the managerial staff, complainant would not have been entitled to commissions for every massage rendered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The Court concurs with the NLRC's conclusion that Ramil is not a managerial employee, but a rank-and-file employee. Specifically, she is a fiduciary rank-and-file employee. <em>Wesleyan University Phils. v. Reyes</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> defines a fiduciary rank-and-file employee as one who in the normal and routine exercise of his/her functions regularly handle significant amounts of money or property. Cashiers, auditors, and property custodians are some of the employees in the second class.</p><p>Here, Ramil regularly handles significant amounts of money or property in the normal and routine exercise of her functions. She was in charge of the facilities of the spa by making sure it is in good condition and that the items needed are in full stock all the time. She was also in charge of the sales of the spa when she took over the duties of the receptionist/cashier. In fact, Stoneleaf admitted in its Comment that she was entrusted with the finances of the spa, including the handling of cash receipts, billings statements, and the care of the spa's property. Therefore, Ramil is a fiduciary rank-and-file employee, and she is entitled to service incentive leave pay, holiday pay, and pro-rated 13<sup>th</sup> month pay. She is also entitled to attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the monetary award, because she was compelled to file a complaint to protect her interests.</p><p>The Court disagrees with Stoneleaf's argument that Ramil is a corporate officer. While the Articles of Incorporation states that she is one of the incorporators, Stoneleaf was unable to rebut Ramil's claim that she has no capital contribution to the corporation. She is merely an incorporator on paper, but not in fact. There was no proof that she participated in any corporate meeting or exercised functions related to a corporate officer.</p><p>The Court observes that Stoneleaf was not able to demonstrate how Ramil recommends managerial actions that would make her a managerial employee. What is clear was Stoneleaf's admission that Ramil oversees the daily operation of the spa and supervises the employees. Stoneleaf admitted the scope of assignment given to her.</p><p>In sum, Ramil was able to overcome the burden of proving that she is a fiduciary rank-and-file employee, while Stoneleaf was unable to show evidence that she is a corporate officer. Ramil is entitled to service incentive leave pay, holiday pay, pro-rated 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, and attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the monetary award. Pursuant to <em>Nacar v. Gallery Frames</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the monetary awards are subject to 6% interest per annum from the finality of this decision until fully paid.</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the petition is <strong>GRANTED</strong>.
