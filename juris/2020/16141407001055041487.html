SP No. 136811 be reversed and set aside; and that the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated October 4, 2013 of the Municipal Trial Court (MTC), San Mateo, Rizal in SCA No. 106-2012 for ejectment with damages be affirmed and reinstated.<br><br><center><i>The Antecedents</i><br></center><br>The case stemmed from a Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> for Ejectment with Damages filed by Felix C.

She formally acquired the subject property on May 12, 1983 through a Deed of Absolute Sale<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Deed) executed by and between her and her spouse, as vendees and Carlos Buenviaje, as vendor. The Deed was duly notarized on even date.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Petitioner maintained that respondent was aware of her and her father's previous possession of the subject prope1ty prior to 1983 and her subsequent purchase of it in 1983. After petitioner purchased the subject property from her father, Tax Declaration No. 08-0149 was cancelled and a new one was issued in 1984 in her name and her spouse, Rolando Nabo. From then on, she and her family have been in open and continuous possession and occupancy in the concept of an owner of the subject property; and to which they have been paying real prope1ty taxes thereon since then up to the present as evidenced by the various receipts issued by the Provincial Treasurer's Office of San Mateo, Rizal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>During petitioner's undisturbed possession, she introduced improvements on the ancestral home already built thereon which she declared for real property tax on July 16, 1993 under Tax Declaration No. SM-007-0183, but was exempted from it as evidenced by a certification issued by the Provincial Treasurer of San Mateo, Rizal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Petitioner asserted that sometime in 1998, respondent with Angeles P. Angeles, Local Assessment Operation Officer III of the Municipality of San Mateo, came to convince her to consolidate the subject property with respondent's unregistered adjacent property in a single application for registration of title under the latter's name; that the consolidation would be for the purpose of helping respondent's son, Benjamin Buenviaje, to obtain a loan using the properties as collateral. She declined their proposal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Respondent then suggested to petitioner that they simulate a sale to which the latter would exchange the subject property for another property of respondent. Petitioner did not agree.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Soon thereafter, respondent, through a certain Atty. Almero of the Public Attorney's Office in the Municipality of San Mateo, approached petitioner reiterating the prior request for consolidation and registration of title of the subject property and one of the properties of respondent with an assurance that respondent and his children would execute and sign an agreement stating that once the title over the properties is issued, the respondent would return the subject property to petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Atty. Almero drafted an Agreement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> embodying respondent's offer and furnished petitioner a copy thereof. However, petitioner again turned down the request.<br><br>In 2001, petitioner was informed to attend a hearing in LRC CASE No. 070-2000 (LRA Record No. N-73603) before the MTC of San Mateo, Rizal involving the subject property; she appeared in the hearing without a counsel to enter her opposition in open court and made a statement that the subject property belonged to her. She recalled that the presiding judge informed her that she needed to secure the services of a counsel to formally oppose the Application for Registration of Title of a Parcel of Land filed by respondent. After the hearing, respondent approached petitioner and informed her that he would take care of the dropping of the case and that there was no need for petitioner to attend further hearings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Petitioner, thereafter, did not return to the MTC.<br><br>On May 17, 2012, petitioner was invited to attend a <i>barangay</i> conciliation and mediation proceeding initiated by respondent and his daughter, Elena Buenviaje Valbuena (Elena). Elena alleged that the subject property was already titled under respondent's name notwithstanding, petitioner's purchase of the subject property in 1983 and the latter's continuous possession of it prior to its purchase up to the present. Petitioner then exerted efforts to ascertain the truth behind Elena's claim. She inquired before the courts of San Mateo, Rizal if there was a case filed involving the registration of the subject property, but was told that all of the records were destroyed because of the typhoon Ondoy in 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On October 1, 2012, petitioner received a letter dated July 18, 2012 from respondent's counsel demanding her to vacate the subject property in favor of respondent.<br><br>On November 14, 2012, petitioner sent her reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> informing respondent's counsel that the demand to vacate had no basis in fact and in law because respondent was well aware that the subject property belonged to her as she has been in continuous and open possession thereof from May 12, 1983 up to the present.<br><br><center><i>The Ruling of the MTC</i><br></center><br>On October 4, 2013, the MTC rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dismissing the complaint. In part, the MTC ruled that while respondent sought to acquire physical possession of the subject property on the premise that he is the titled owner and that his ownership carries with it his right to possess it, the plea, however, was unavailing in an ejectment suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><center><i>The Ruling of the RTC</i><br></center><br>On July 10, 2014, Branch 77, Regional Trial Court (RTC), San Mateo, Rizal rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> reversing and setting aside the MTC Decision.

The CA ruled that respondent, being the registered owner, also has the corresponding right to the recovery and possession of the subject property; and that petitioner, who is in physical occupancy of the land belonging to respondent, has no right whatsoever to unjustly withhold the possession of the subject property from the latter and she should immediately vacate it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Petitioner alleged that a motion for reconsideration is not a condition precedent to the filing of a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court following the Court's pronouncement in <i>The Bases Conversion and Development Authority v.

Getaruela, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the Court held that a complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for unlawful detainer if it recites the following:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">initially, possession of the property by the defendant was by contract with or by tolerance of the plaintiff;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">eventually, such possession became illegal upon notice by plaintiff to defendant of the termination of the latter's right of possession;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">thereafter, the defendant remained in possession of the property and deprived the plaintiff of the enjoyment thereof; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> within one year from the last demand on defendant to vacate the property, the plaintiff instituted the complaint for ejectment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>After a perusal of the complaint and the available records of the case, the Court finds that respondent failed to prove the first recital. Respondent utterly failed to substantiate his claim that he merely tolerated petitioner's possession of the subject property. It must be noted that with respondent's averment that petitioner's possession was by his mere tolerance, the acts of tolerance must be proved, for a bare allegation of tolerance will not suffice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> At the very least, respondent should show the overt acts indicative of his tolerance, but he miserably failed to adduce evidence to prove tolerance in this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Moreover, a case of unlawful detainer must state the period when the occupation by tolerance stm1ed and the acts of tolerance exercised by the party with the right of possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In this case, respondent claims that since the issuance of title in his favor, he has already allowed petitioner to remain on the subject property considering that the latter is his niece.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> OCT No. 0-1777 was issued on August 28, 2008 pursuant to the Decision dated February 7, 2003 rendered in LRC Case No. 070-2000 LRA Record No. N-73603.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Petitioner, on the other hand, claims that she has been in continuous possession of the subject property for more than 30 years<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> which, in fact, remains undisputed by respondent.<br><br>Otherwise stated, because respondent is required to state the period when petitioner's occupation by tolerance started, he was able to establish that the tolerance granted to petitioner started only on August 28, 2008, or at the time the OCT No. 0-1777 was issued in his name. Respondent, however, failed to provide essential details of his acts of tolerance as to petitioner's prior physical possession of the subject property for over 30 years, or before the issuance of the title in his name.<br><br>The fact that petitioner has been in continuous possession of the subject property for more than 30 years is evidenced by the following documentary evidence, among others, to wit: (1) <i>Barangay</i> Residence Certificate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> dated December 3, 2012; and (2) Tax Declaration No. 08-0911<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> covering 100-square meter parcel of land, issued by the Municipal Assessor 's Office of San Mateo, Rizal, declared in the name of Spouses Rolando S. Nabo and petitioner, and registered on June 14, 1983.<br><br><i>In the words of the court a quo,</i> "<i>x x x it is unarguable that [petitioner] has been in possession of the subject property since time immemorial. No less than their barangay officials have duly certified that [petitioner] has been there for more than 30 years. In the absence of bias or improper motive to falsely certify, said certifications enjoys the highest respect of truth and credence.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, petitioner submitted as part of her documentary evidence a number of tax declarations in her name and her spouse, and the oldest of which was registered on June 14, 1983.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Also, she has been religiously paying the real property taxes thereon since 1989 as evidenced by a number real property tax receipts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Time and again, the Court ratiocinated that although tax declarations or realty tax payments of property are not conclusive evidence of ownership, they are, however, good <i>indicia</i> of possession in the concept of an owner, for no one in his right mind would be paying taxes for a property that is not in his actual or constructive possession. They constitute at least proof that the holder has a claim of title over the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Notably, the CA erred in ruling that respondent's complaint is one for unlawful detainer and that the requisites were duly met.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> It is likewise wrong for the CA to grant possession of the subject property to respondent, as a matter of right, mainly because of the OCT No. 0-1777 in the latter's name.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Well-settled is the rule that a title issued under the Torrens system is entitled to all the attributes of property ownership, which necessarily includes possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> However, the Court has also emphasized that "<i>an ejectment case will not necessarily be decided in favor of one who has presented proof of ownership of the subject property. Key jurisdictional facts constitutive of the particular ejectment case filed must be averred in the complaint and sufficiently proven.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> In the case of <i>Javelosa vs. Tapus, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the Court explained that:<br><blockquote>It is an elementary principle of civil law that the owner of real property is entitled to the possession thereof as an attribute of his or her ownership. In fact, the holder of a Torrens Title is the rightful owner of the property thereby covered. and is entitled to its possession. This notwithstanding, "the owner cannot simply wrest possession thereof from whoever is in actual occupation of the property." Rather, to recover possession, the owner must first resort to the proper judicial remedy, and thereafter, satisfy all the conditions necessary for such action to prosper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondent, in the present case, hinging on his claim as the owner of the subject property, opted to file an action for ejectment with damages. As previously discussed, a study of the allegations in the respondent's complaint shows that it is one for unlawful detainer. Hence, he has a correlative burden to sufficiently allege, and thereafter prove by preponderance of evidence all the jurisdictional facts required in an action for unlawful detainer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> However, respondent failed to discharge this burden.<br><br>Following the Court's ruling in <i>Quijano v. Atty. Amante</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> in an action for unlawful detainer, respondent must show that the possession was initially lawful, and thereafter, establish the basis of the lawful possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> In the same manner, should respondent claim that petitioner's possession was by his tolerance, then his acts of tolerance must be proved as a bare allegation of tolerance will not suffice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> There must be, at least, showing of respondent's overt acts indicative of his or his predecessor's permission granted to petitioner to occupy the subject property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Failure in which, petitioner's possession could very well be deemed illegal from the beginning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Thus, the respondent's action for unlawful detainer must necessarily fail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Corollary, the complaint may not be treated as an action for forcible entry in the absence of averments that the entry in the subject property had been effected through force, intimidation, threats, strategy or stealth.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>In sum, the Court reiterates its previous ruling in <i>Pajuyo v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> which states:<br><blockquote>Ownership or the right to possess arising from ownership is not at issue in an action for recovery of possession. The parties cannot present evidence to prove ownership or right to legal possession except to prove the nature of the possession when necessary to resolve the issue of physical possession. The same is true when the defendant asserts the absence of title over the property. The absence of title over the contested lot is not a ground for the courts to withhold relief from the parties in an ejectment case.<br><br>The only question that the courts must resolve in ejectment proceedings is - who is entitled to the physical possession of the premises, that is, to the possession <i>de facto</i> and not to the possession <i>de jure</i>. It does not even matter if a party's title to the property is questionable, or when both parties intruded into public land and their applications to own the land have yet to be approved by the proper government agency. <i>Regardless of the actual condition of the title to the property. the party in peaceable quiet possession shall not be thrown out by a strong hand, violence or terror. Neither is the unlawful withholding of property allowed. Courts will always uphold respect for prior possession.</i><br><br><i>Thus, a party who can prove prior possession can recover such possession even against the owner himself. Whatever may be the character of his possession, if he has in his favor prior possession in time, he has the security that entitles him to remain on the property until a person with a better right lawfully ejects him.</i> To repeat, the only issue that the court has to settle in an ejectment suit is the right to physical possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Citations omitted; italics supplied)<br></blockquote>Verily, the act of tolerance, which should have been present right from the very start of petitioner's possession, has not been effectively proven by respondent. Hence, there can be no basis for the action for unlawful detainer. Therefore, both the CA and the RTC erred in reversing the Decision of the MTC which dismissed the complaint and consequently, granting the reliefs prayed for by respondent in his complaint.<br><br>The ruling of the Court does not mean that the Court favors the occupant of the subject property over the person claiming a right of ownership by virtue of a title,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> but rather, this ruling merely emphasizes an important fact that even a legal owner of the subject property cannot simply oust a party who is in peaceable quiet possession thereof through a summary action for ejectment, without having established by a preponderance of evidence the essential requisites of the action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Case law has it, in an action for unlawful detainer, the owner of a property should prove that the possession of the occupant is premised on his permission or tolerance, and failure in which, the owner could pursue other appropriate legal remedies granted to him by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>On a final note, the Court reiterates itself that "<i>the issue of possession between the parties will still remain. To finally resolve such issue, they should review their options and decide on their proper recourses. In the meantime, it is wise for the Court to leave the door open to them in that respect</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
