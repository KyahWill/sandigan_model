				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><center>The Case </center></b><br>This is a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court against the February 26, 2010 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the June 25, 2010 Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 88238, which reversed the Decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 31 of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, in a case for injunction. <br><br><b><center>Antecedents</center></b> <br>Respondent Leopoldo V. Parumog (Parumog) sought to build the Guardian Angel Eternal Garden memorial park on a parcel of land owned by him and located at Barangay Cavite, Guimba, Nueva Ecija. To implement his proposal, Parumog sought the required permits and clearances from respondent Municipality of Guimba Local Government Unit (Guimba LGU) and the local government unit of Barangay Cavite (Barangay LGU).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>However, Parumog's proposal was opposed by the owners of the lots adjoining the proposed memorial park site, including petitioners Reynaldo dela Cruz and Catalino C. Felipe, who filed a complaint for injunction with prayer for temporary restraining order (TRO), dated June 15, 2004,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> seeking to stop the construction of the memorial park. Alongside Parumog, the Guimba LGU was also impleaded as a defendant for allowing the project through its Resolution No. 33-04, despite the alleged violations of petitioners' rights to health and a balanced ecology. The complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 1332-G and raffled off to Branch 31 of the RTC of Guimba. On June 25, 2004, the trial court granted petitioners' prayer for a TRO.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <br><br>Parumog and the Guimba LGU answered that Resolution No. 33-04 was approved and issued only after the former had complied with all the requirements for the establishment of a memorial park under the pertinent regulations. Furthermore, the project was approved by the Sangguniang Barangay of Cavite, Guimba, through its Kapasyahan Big. 02-2004. It was likewise approved by a majority of the adjoining residents<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> - petitioners included - during a consultation with personnel from the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), as shown by their signatures in a manifesto entitled "Pag-endorso at Aming Suporta sa Binabalak ni G. Leopoldo V. Parumog na Gawing Memorial Park ang Kanyang Lote sa Barangay Cavite, Guimba, Nueva Ecija."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> They likewise maintained that petitioners' fears of environmental pollution to be caused by the memorial park were unfounded since the park would observe the proper procedures and standards for ground burials. Parumog and the Guimba LGU further prayed for the lifting of the temporary restraining order and the dismissal of the complaint, as well as an award of exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses. <br><br>After due hearing and consideration of the parties' pleadings on the application for writ of preliminary injunction, the trial court found "serious legal flaws in the legality of Sangguniang Bayan Resolution No. 33-04." It therefore issued an Order, dated July 21, 2004, granting the application. Respondents filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied in an Order, dated November 5, 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Pre-trial was then conducted, where the parties agreed on "the existence of TCT No. NT-3373 in the name of the defendant Leopoldo V. Parumog which covers the property in question."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The case then proceeded to trial on the merits. <br><br><b><center>The Ruling of the Trial Court </center></b><br>In a Decision dated September 29, 2006,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the trial court ruled in favor of Dela Cruz, making the injunction against the construction of the memorial park permanent. <br><br>The trial court observed that Resolution No. 33-04 merely reclassified the proposed memorial park site into commercial land. It did not have the effect of designating the land as a burial ground. The trial court further noted that Barangay Cavite was not among the designated burial areas under the local zoning ordinance of Guimba; therefore, for the construction of Parumog's proposed memorial park to proceed, the Sangguniang Bayan of Guimba had to amend its municipal zoning ordinance. Since Resolution No. 33-04 had no such effect, it cannot, by itself, be considered an approval of the proposed memorial park. Furthermore, a municipal board resolution cannot amend a municipal ordinance. Nevertheless, the defect was cured by the Sangguniang Bayan's passage on October 25, 2004, of Ordinance No. 4-04, which introduced the necessary amendments to the municipal zoning ordinance. <br><br>The trial court thus considered the issue of whether the enactment of said amendatory ordinance satisfied the requirements set by the municipal zoning ordinance, i.e., whether the amendment was subjected to public hearing and was approved by either the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) or the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (SP) of Nueva Ecija.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The court found that while there was sufficient evidence that public hearings were conducted, there was no proof that the amendatory ordinance was approved by the HLURB or the SP of Nueva Ecija. There being no proper amendment of the municipal zoning ordinance to include Barangay Cavite as a burial ground area, the injunction against Parumog's memorial park project was maintained by the trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <br><br><b><center>The Ruling of the CA</center></b> <br>Acting on the appeal filed by Parumog and the Guimba LGU, the CA reversed the trial court's decision and dismissed the complaint for injunction. <br><br>Reducing the arguments raised by the appeal to the main issue of whether Ordinance No. 4-04 was approved by the HLURB or the SP of Nueva Ecija, the appellate court found that Parumog and the Guimba LGU were able to submit a copy of Kapasyahan Big. 181-S-2004 issued by the SP of Nueva Ecija, which categorically states that the provincial legislature approved the act of the Guimba municipal board. The said Kapasyahan reads: <br><blockquote><center>TANGGAPAN NG SANGGUNIANG PANLALAWIGAN <br><br>KIMIS NG KATITIKAN NG IKA-21 <br>PANGKARANIWANG PULONG NG SANGGUNIANG <br>PANLALAWIGAN NA GINANAP SA<br>PANLALAWIGANG BULWAGANG PULUNGAN, <br>PANLALAWIGANG KAPITOLYO, LUNGSOD NG <br>PALAYAN NUONG <br><br>DISYEMBRE 06, 2004 <br><br>XXX&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;XXX&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;XXX <br><br>KAPASIYAHAN BLG. 181-S-2004</center> <br>SAPAGKAT, sa ilalim ng ICodigo ng Lokal na Pamahalaan ng 1991, Kabanata 3 Pangkat 56, ay itinatadhana ang kapangyarihan ng Sannguniang [sic] Panlalawigan upang siyasatin at pag-aralan kung naaayon at napapaloob sa kapangyarihan ng mga Sangguniang Bayan/Lungsod na kanilang nasasakupan, ang mga pinagtibay na Kapasiyahan o Kautusan, <br><br>SAPAGKAT, batay sa masusing pag-aaral ng Lupon sa Kapasiyahan at Kautusan, ang mga sumusunod na Kapasiyahan at Kautusan ay naaayon at napapaloob sa mga alituntuning itinatakda ng batas:<br><br>DAHIL DITO, sa mungkahi ng Kgg.

In the antiquated but still leading case of <i>North Negros Sugar Co. v. Hidalgo,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> we said that: <br><blockquote>... An injunction will not be granted when good conscience does not require it, where it will operate oppressively or contrary to justice, where it is not reasonable and equitable under the circumstances of the case, or where it will tend to promote, rather than to prevent, fraud and injustice. . . ." "... a court of equity may interfere by injunction to restrain a party from enforcing a legal right against all equity and conscience. . . ." ". . . The comparative convenience or inconvenience of the parties from granting or withholding the injunction sought should be considered, and none should be granted if it would operate oppressively or inequitably, or contrary to the real justice of the case. This doctrine is well established."<br><br>"The power of the courts to issue injunctions should be exercised with great caution and only where the reason and necessity therefor are clearly established; and while this rule has been applied more frequently in the case of preliminary and mandatory injunctions, it applies to injunctions of all classes, and to restraining orders. . . ." (citations omitted) <br><br>"The writ of injunction will not be awarded in doubtful or new cases not coming within well-established principles of equity."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> x x x x <br><br>[I]njunction, being an equitable remedy, the granting thereof is dependent upon the sound discretion of the court. It is only in clear cases of abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge that review on appeal would be made. "There is no power the exercise of which is more delicate, which requires greater caution, deliberation, and sound discretion, or more dangerous in a doubtful case, than the issuing an injunction; it is the strong arm of equity, that never ought of law cannot afford an adequate or commensurate remedy in damages. The right must be clear, the injury impending or threatened, so as to be averted only by the protecting preventing process of injunction."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>Jurisprudence has laid down four essential requisites for the issuance of an injunctive writ: (1) That the petitioner applicant must have a clear and unmistakable right; (2) That there is a material and substantial invasion of such right; (3) That there is an urgent and permanent necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage; and (4) No other ordinary, speedy, and adequate remedy exists to prevent the infliction of irreparable injury.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <br><br>In the case at bar, the appellate court found that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing a permanent injunction against the memorial park project after finding that the Guimba LGU had passed a valid amendment to its zoning ordinance which paved the way for the construction of memorial parks in the territory of Barangay Cavite. Ordinance No. 4-04 provides: <br><br><center>SB ORDINANCE NO. 4-04 <br>October 25, 2004 </center><blockquote>BE IT ORDAINED BY THE SANGGUNIANG BAYAN OF GUIMBA, NUEVA ECIJA, IN SESSION ASSEMBLED.<br><br>Section 1. Title and Authority. This ordinance shall be cited as the amendatory ordinance on the proposed location of new cemeteries in Guimba, Nueva Ecija, and is enacted pursuant to the provision of Section 46 (Amendments to the Zoning Ordinance) of Municipal Ordinance No. 15, series of 2000, otherwise known as the Local Zoning Ordinance of Guimba, Nueva Ecija. <br><br>Section 2. Proposed site of new cemetery Barangay Cavite, being within the urban area zone classification, is hereby included as proposed location of new cemeteries in Guimba, Nueva Ecija in the Development Master Plan of Guimba, Nueva Ecija (2001-2005). <br><br>Section 3. Repealing Clause. All ordinances, rules, regulations and promulgations in conflict with the provisions of this resolution are hereby repealed, reversed, amended or modified accordingly. <br><br>Section 4. Effectivity. This ordinance shall take effect upon approval by the [H]LURB or the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Nueva Ecija.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </blockquote>It is clear from the quoted passage that all the ordinance does is to allow new cemeteries to be built in Barangay Cavite. There is nothing in the ordinance amounting to an approval or clearance of Parumog's proposed memorial park project, which must still comply with the applicable regulations, specifically HLURB Resolution No. 681-00, or the Amended Rules and Regulations for Memorial Parks/Cemeteries. Section 2 of said HLURB Resolution sets out the process and documentary requirements for the approval of a memorial park or cemetery project, viz.: <br><blockquote>SECTION 2. Application for Approval of Memorial Park/Cemetery Plan. - Every registered owner or developer of a parcel of land who wishes to convert the same into a memorial park/cemetery shall apply with the Board or city/municipality concerned for the approval of the memorial park/ cemetery plan by filing the following: <br><br>I.

It should not be disputed that the Guimba LGU has the authority to make such approval, as this is clearly provided for not only in the aforequoted Section 2 of HLURB Resolution No. 681-00, but also in Section 447 of the Local Government Code, which vests the Guimba LGU, through its Sangguniang Bayan, with the following powers: <br><blockquote>(2) (vii) Adopt a comprehensive land use plan for the municipality: Provided, That the formulation, adoption, or modification of said plan shall be in coordination with the approved provincial comprehensive land use plan; <br><br>(2) (viii) Reclassify land within the jurisdiction of the municipality, subject to the pertinent provisions of this Code; <br><br>(2) (vii) Adopt a comprehensive land use plan for the municipality: Provided, That the formulation, adoption, or modification of said plan shall be in coordination with the approved provincial comprehensive land use plan; <br><br>(2) (viii) Reclassify land within the jurisdiction of the municipality, subject to the pertinent provisions of this Code; <br><br>x x x x <br><br>(4) (ix) Regulate the establishment, operation, and maintenance of funeral parlors and the burial or cremation of the dead, subject to existing laws, rules and regulations.</blockquote> The Court now goes back to the requisites for an injunctive writ, viewed in the light of the facts established in the record and the allegations of the complaint. As for the first requisite, jurisprudence affirms the existence of the constitutional rights to health, healthful ecology, and due process, which are enforceable without need of legislation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> However, as for the second requisite, i.e.,the existence of a material and substantial invasion of such right, the complaint miserably fails. The records clearly show that the ultimate act complained of and sought to be enjoined by petitioners - the construction of the Guardian Angel Eternal Garden - has not happened yet.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> It must be reiterated that neither Resolution No. 33-04 nor Ordinance No. 4-04 serves as a final approval of Parumog's proposal and there is nothing in the record to show that Parumog's proposal to build the Guardian Angel Eternal Garden has been given final clearance and approval by the Sangguniang Bayan of Guimba in accordance with HLURB Resolution No. 681-00. Without final approval from the Guimba LGU, Parumog's proposal cannot proceed; hence, there cannot be a material and substantial invasion of petitioners' rights, for the realization of the very act alleged to be an invasion of such rights remains contingent upon the submission of the final memorial park plan and the approval thereof by the Guimba LGU. <br><br>Furthermore, both courts <i>a quo</i> have found that petitioners actively participated in the public hearings conducted in the process of reclassifying Parumog's property as a commercial area. They have made their objections known to the Guimba LGU, which, nevertheless, went ahead and reclassified the area to allow the memorial park to be built.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Thus, We concur in the conclusion of both courts <i>a quo</i> that petitioners were not deprived of due process in the matter of the reclassification of Parumog's property. <br><br>Likewise, the fourth requisite, <i>i.e.</i>, the lack of another ordinary, speedy, and adequate remedy to prevent the infliction of irreparable injury has not been satisfied as well. At the risk of being repetitive, it must be reiterated that, under HLURB Resolution No. 681-00, Parumog must submit a preliminary development plan, which must be approved by the LGU. Once the preliminary development plan has been approved, Parumog must then submit a final memorial park plan which must likewise be approved by the LGU. There is no indication in the records that the Guimba LGU has already approved any preliminary development plan or final memorial park plan submitted by Parumog. Among the required components of a final memorial park plan are: <br><blockquote>J. Clearances/Permits/Certifications from other agencies applicable to the Project:<br><br>1. Clearances/Permits from National Water Resources Board (NWRB) <br><blockquote>a. Clearance stating that the memorial park/cemetery is not located on ground where the water table is not higher than 4.50 meters below the ground surface. <br><br>b. Water permit whenever a well within the project site shall be dug. <br><br>c. Permit to operate the well. </blockquote>2. Certified True Copy of Conversion Order or Exemption Clearance from the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) authorizing a change in use from agricultural to non-agricultural, where applicable. <br><br>3. Permit from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) when necessary, e.g., when opening an access to a controlled traffic artery. <br><br>4. Initial and operational clearances from the Department of Health. <br><br>5. Certified True Copy of Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) or Certificate of Non-Coverage (CNC) duly issued by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). </blockquote>Clearly, petitioners may still air their health and ecological concerns over the project before the DENR, DAR or the DPWH, since Parumog still has to obtain permits from these agencies if his memorial park project is to proceed. While, it may be said that the petitioners' grievances have already been heard by the Giumba LGU, there is no showing that they have to completely exhausted their remedies with the pertinent agencies of national government. Verily, records show that Parumog has been summoned to appear before the DENR-EMB because of a complaint filed against him by Justice Narciso Nario. There is nothing preventing petitioners from airing similar complaints before the DENR-EMB or other concerned agencies enumerated in the HLURB Resolution No. 681 -00.<br><br>All told, the CA did not err in dismissing the complaint for injunction, as petitioners have failed to prove that their circumstances warrant the grant of such an extraordinary remedy. <br><br><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING PREMISES,</b> the present petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
