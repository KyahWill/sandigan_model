While he and his brother were drinking, Amado arrived and joined them. Sometime after, he asked Amado to go with him to the rented house of his girlfriend in Guingona Subdivision. His girlfriend's rented house was attached to a store. He decided to see his girlfriend to ask for money to buy additional bottles of "Tanduay" for himself and his companions.

Since he was so confused, he said he would consult a lawyer first.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p>On cross, he stated that Syntyche Litera ("Cheche") had only been his girlfriend for about a month when the buy-bust and search happened.

It relied heavily on the following circumstances: (a) civilian witnesses accompanied the police officers during the search, (b) the inventory of the seized items was signed by appellant and the civilian witnesses; (c) the apprehending officers followed the rules on service of a search warrant and submitted a return thereon together with the request for withdrawal of items for laboratory examination; and (d) as possession may be actual or constructive, it was enough that "the prohibited items were found in [appellant's house], despite his protestation that the store was [only] leased by his girlfriend."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In sum, the trial court found that the prosecution was able to prove all the elements of the offense charged. The trial court disposed, thus:</p><blockquote><p>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds accused Sundaram Magayon y Francisco guilty beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. 10739 for violation of Section 11, of Article II of Republic Act 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002), and considering that the weight of the prohibited drug is three hundred eighty-one point three zero six five (381.3065) grams (par. 2, Section 11, Art.

He argued, in the main:</p><p><em><strong>First</strong></em>, the search was not valid and the items seized during the search were inadmissible in evidence against him. For while the search warrant only authorized the police to search the house, they also searched the store. Considering that an earlier test buy was conducted by the police officers, they should have been already familiar with the place to be searched; hence, they should have included the store in their application for the search warrant. Their failure to do so violated Section 2, Article III of the Constitution which requires the search warrant to describe with particularity the place to be searched.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> More, he did not witness the search as required under Section 8, Rule 126 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><p><em><strong>Second</strong></em>, the prosecution failed to prove that he was the owner of the searched premises or that he exercised control over the place.</p><p><em><strong>Third</strong></em>, the arresting officers failed to comply with the chain of custody requirements. There was allegedly no immediate marking of the seized items nor any showing that appellant witnessed the marking. The Certificate of Inventory lumped all the items together without any segregation <em>vis-a-vis</em> the specific place or places where the specimens were recovered. The Certificate of Inventory was also allegedly irregular because it did not bear the name and signature of PO2 Maderal. It was not PO2 Maderal who identified the seized items in court but the forensic chemist. The chain of custody should include testimony on every link in the chain from the moment the prohibited drugs were confiscated until they were offered in evidence.</p><p>On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) through Assistant Solicitor General Rex Bernardo L. Pascual and Associate Solicitor Christian P. Castro, countered: (a) the search warrant clearly stated that the place to be searched was appellant's "rented residence and its premises located on 6<sup>th</sup> Street, Guingona Subdivision, Barangay 25, Jose P.

The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and for any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.</p></blockquote><p>Appellant argues that the search warrant did not specifically mention the store to be among the places to be searched thereby violating the <em>proviso</em> that the place or places to be searched must be described with particularity.</p><p>The rule is that <strong>a description of the place to be searched is sufficient if the officer with the warrant can, with reasonable effort, ascertain and identify the place intended and distinguish it from other places in the community</strong>. Any <strong>designation or description</strong> known to the locality that <strong>points out the place to the exclusion of all others, and on inquiry, leads the officers unerringly to it, satisfies the constitutional requirement</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> A search warrant is deemed to have <strong>described the place to be searched with sufficient particularity</strong> when <strong>the premises have been identified as being occupied by the accused</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></p><p>As aptly found by the courts below, the <strong>search warrant here stated</strong> that the place to be searched was <strong>appellant's "rented residence and its premises</strong> located [on] 6<sup>th</sup> Street, Guingona Subdivision, Barangay 25, Jose P. Rizal, Butuan City."</p><p>The apprehending officers became and were in fact familiar with the place to be searched as a result of the test buy which they had conducted just hours before the search. Further, appellant <strong>has not denied</strong> that the <strong>store formed part of the "rented residence"</strong> and <strong>was not a separate structure</strong>.</p><p>PO2 Maderal categorically testified that the store was part of the house and it was an open space on which a curtain hung as a divider.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></p><p>We therefore find no cogent reason to disturb the common findings of the courts below that <strong>the house and its appurtenant store were found at the same address indicated in the search warrant</strong>. Hence, appellant's protestation that the search warrant failed to describe the place to be searched with sufficient particularity must fail.</p><p><em><strong>1(c).&nbsp; The&nbsp; police&nbsp; officers&nbsp; fully<br> complied with the Rules on the<br> conduct of a valid search.</strong></em></p><p>Section 8, Rule 126 ordains:</p><blockquote><p>SECTION 8. <em>Search of House, Room, or Premises to Be Made in Presence of Two Witnesses</em>. — No search of a house, room, or any other premises shall be made except in the presence of the lawful occupant thereof or any member of his family or in the absence of the latter, two witnesses of sufficient age and discretion residing in the same locality.</p></blockquote><p>Although appellant does not dispute the fact that there were at least two (2) witnesses who were present during the search, he asserts that <strong>he himself did not witness</strong> it. This claim, however, is <strong>belied by the categorical testimonies of the prosecution witnesses PO2 Maderal and Barangay Kagawad Mangasep that he and his girlfriend/common law wife were actually present</strong> during the search. The Court of Appeals, too, aptly noted that <strong>appellant himself testified that he witnessed the search</strong> conducted by the police. We quote with approval the Court of Appeals' relevant disquisition:</p><blockquote><p>Also, this Court noted that Magayon was able to give a clear sequence of events when he recounted the search, which strongly bespeaks of his presence while the same was ongoing. Pertinent parts of his testimony states:</p><blockquote><p><u>ATTY. RULIDA</u>:</p><p>So, what happened after the search?</p><p><u>MAGAYON</u>:</p><p>After the search, Sir, I noticed that they recovered marijuana from the bag of my girlfriend and a tea bag of marijuana.</p><p>Q: After they discovered those items that you mentioned, what happened next?<br> A: After that, they searched the wallet of my girlfriend.</p><p>Q: After searching the wallet of your girlfriend, what happened next?<br> A: They recovered the P100.00 bill.</p><p>Q: After they recovered the P100.00 bill, what did they do to it, if any?<br> A: After that, they compared the P100.00 bill recovered from the wallet of my girlfriend and the Xerox copy that they have at that time.</p><p>Q: After that, what happened, if any?<br> A: After that, Sir, they placed the items on a table.</p></blockquote><p>The above precise statements of Magayon demonstrate how he actually witnessed the search. He obviously saw how and where the items were recovered thus, negating his claim that the search was not done in his presence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The testimony of <strong>defense witness Amado</strong> that appellant and his girlfriend were outside the house/store when the search was conducted was rejected by both courts below for being <strong>devoid of credence</strong>. Surely, Amado <strong>would not have known better</strong> than appellant himself who testified that he and his girlfriend/wife were in fact present during the search, even as Amado went to the toilet to relieve himself some thirty (30) or fifty (50) meters away.</p><p>Whether to believe the version of the prosecution or that of the defense, the trial court's factual findings thereon is generally viewed as correct and entitled to the highest respect. For it had the opportunity to observe the witnesses' demeanor and deportment on the witness stand as they gave their testimonies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> More so, where the trial court's factual findings on the credibility of witnesses carry the full concurrence of the Court of Appeals, as in this case. No compelling reason exists here to deviate from this rule.</p><p><em><strong>2(a).&nbsp; The&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; on&nbsp; &nbsp;record&nbsp; &nbsp;show<br> that appellant did&nbsp; have&nbsp; dominion&nbsp; and<br> control over the place of subject of the<br> search.</strong></em></p><p>The elements of illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 are: (1) <strong>possession</strong> by the accused of an item or object identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) the possession is <strong>not authorized by law</strong>; and (3) the <strong>free and conscious possession</strong> of the drug by the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p><p><strong>Possession</strong> under the law includes not only <strong>actual possession</strong> but also <strong>constructive possession</strong>. <strong>Actual possession</strong> exists when the drug is in the immediate physical possession or control of the accused. On the other hand, <strong>constructive possession</strong> exists when the drug is under the dominion and control of the accused or when he has the right to exercise dominion and control over the place where it is found.</p><p>Exclusive possession or control is <strong>not</strong> necessary. The accused cannot avoid conviction if his control and dominion over the place where the contraband is located were shared with another.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></p><p>Appellant nonetheless contends that he could not be guilty of illegal possession of dangerous drugs in view of the prosecution's alleged failure to prove that he owned or controlled the house and the store where the confiscated items were found. Appellant asserts that it was his girlfriend who rented the place subject of the search and she lived there alone.</p><p>The Court of Appeals correctly rejected this argument. For it was <strong>plainly stated in appellant's own counter-affidavits that he resided in the address specified in the search warrant and where the search was actually conducted</strong>. Specifically, in his Counter-Affidavit dated August 14, 2004, he stated that he and Cheche were live-in partners. Although, on the witness stand, appellant subsequently disavowed certain portions of his counter-affidavits, <strong>the recanted statements did not include appellant's address nor the fact that he and Cheche were living together</strong>. Appellant is <strong>now estopped</strong> from claiming otherwise. He is bound by the admissions in his sworn statements duly identified and marked in court. An admission in open court is a judicial admission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In fine, appellant cannot disclaim his control and dominion over the place subject of the search where subject drugs were found.</p><p><em><strong>2(b).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Appellant's&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;inculpatory<br> admissions sustain his conviction and<br> Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 will<br> not come into play.</strong></em></p><p>Records indubitably show that <strong>appellant had frankly admitted his possession of the enormous amount of prohibited drugs</strong> which found in and seized from his residence.</p><p>To recall, appellant testified that <strong>during the investigation at the police station</strong> he refrained from answering the police officers' questions and told them he wished to consult with a lawyer first.</p><p><strong>Appellant, thereafter, secured the services of counsel <em>de parte</em>, Atty. Poculan.</strong> With the <strong>able assistance of Atty. Poculan</strong>, he <strong>executed and submitted</strong> his <strong>counter-affidavits</strong> to the Office of the City Prosecutor.</p><p>In his Counter-Affidavit dated February 2, 2005,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> he stated that "the alleged <strong>prohibited drugs found in [his] possession were for [his] personal use</strong> and not for sale or distribution to buyers." Too, in his earlier Counter-Affidavit dated August 14, 2004,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> appellant <strong>tried to absolve his girlfriend from any liability, as he stated, "[his] live in partner, Syntyche Litera y Lumacang alias [Che-che], had nothing to do with the activities that transpired</strong> in [their] residence" and "<strong>[t]he marked money that was found in her possession came from [him]</strong> because [he] handed it to her because [he] was about to take a bath."</p><p>Clearly, appellant <strong>knowingly took full responsibility for the seized drugs</strong> in his counter-affidavits.</p><p>Extrajudicial confessions are admissible in evidence, provided they are: 1) voluntary; 2) made with the assistance of a competent and independent counsel; 3) express; and 4) in writing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Here, <strong>appellant's admissions in his counter-affidavits are binding on him as they were knowingly and voluntarily made with assistance of his counsel of choice</strong>, Atty. Poculan.</p><p>Although appellant later on tried to retract the foregoing statements in court, claiming it was not true that Cheche was blameless and it was in fact her former husband who owned the seized marijuana, his belated attempt to diffuse his past damaging admissions must fail. For courts may believe one part of the testimony of a witness and disbelieve another part. Courts are not required to accept or reject the whole of the testimony of a particular witness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> While case law holds that recantations do not necessarily cancel out an earlier declaration, ultimately, it should still be treated like any other testimony and as such, its credibility must be tested during trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p><p>On this score, <strong>the Court of Appeals correctly took into account that appellant was not an unlettered person but was a third year college student majoring in Elementary Education</strong>; hence, <strong>he readily understood the statements in his counter-affidavits and could have refused to sign them if they were untrue</strong>. He <strong>did not charge</strong> his lawyer with incompetence, neglect or impropriety. He <strong>did not adduce evidence of coercion or intimidation</strong> from anyone. These <strong>counter-affidavits were notarized</strong>, the first, by appellant's own counsel, and the second, by the city prosecutor. It <strong>cannot be gainsaid</strong> then that <strong>appellant's extrajudicial admissions can stand on their own</strong> to support a verdict of conviction.</p><p>In <em><strong>Regalado v. People</strong></em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Regalado admitted that he possessed the seized marijuana but contended that the apprehending officers did not fully comply with Section 21, Article II of RA 9165. The Court held that Regalado's damning admission warranted the affirmance of his conviction, albeit we sternly reminded police officers to be mindful of their duty to comply with the statutorily mandated procedure in drugs cases, lest their lapses become fatal to the prosecution's cause.</p><p>Here, <strong>appellant already admitted several times his possession of a large quantity of marijuana and did not pose substantial objections to the identity and integrity of the drugs confiscated at the place of his arrest</strong>. The case records flatly contradicted his objections to the chain of custody of the seized drugs in question.</p><p>Section 21, Article II of RA 9165 on the chain of custody rule outlines the procedure that police officers must follow in handling the seized drugs in order to ensure the preservation of their integrity and evidentiary value.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> To establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></p><p>Here, the <strong>testimonies of PO2 Maderal and the forensic chemist sufficiently established every link</strong> in the chain of custody <strong>from the time</strong> the prohibited drugs were <strong>seized and inventoried right after</strong> the search <strong>at the place</strong> of the search, <strong>to the time</strong> they were <strong>brought to the police station</strong> for the <strong>booking</strong>, <strong>investigation</strong>, and <strong>forensic analysis</strong>, <strong>up until</strong> the prohibited drugs were <strong>presented in court</strong>.</p><p>Contrary to appellant's claim, the fact that PO2 Maderal's testimony focused on his preparation of the inventory and the documents relative to the investigation did not mean he was not present during the search. In fact, his testimony was replete with details which could have only been known by one who was personally present during the search.</p><p>On the marking of the seized items, <strong>appellant himself admitted</strong> that the <strong>seized drugs were marked and inventoried</strong> at the <strong>time and place of the search</strong>. Surely, he <strong>could not have made</strong> such a confirmation if the marking and inventory <strong>had not been made</strong> in his presence as required by Section 21.</p><p>Further, there is <strong>no law or rule</strong> requiring that the inventory should <strong>segregate</strong> the seized items according to the specific place in the house or store where they were found. The <strong>law simply and solely mandates</strong> that an inventory of <em><strong>all</strong></em> the seized items be made by the apprehending officer/team. Notably, <strong>appellant himself admitted</strong> in court that the <strong>items subject of the inventory</strong> as photographed by the police officers <strong>were indeed recovered from the place</strong> where the search and arrest were made.</p><p>In sum, <strong>appellant admitted the identity and integrity</strong> of the drugs seized from his residence and those presented in court, although appellant did not specify the exact quantity or amount of drugs. In his Counter-Affidavit dated August 14, 2004, he categorically admitted that the police found the prohibited drugs in his residence, thus:</p><blockquote><p>x x x x</p><p>That these marijuana leaves were left at my residence. I was about to report it to the authorities but the policeman must have heard of it because they raid my residence on August 3, 2004.</p><p>x x x x</p></blockquote><p>Five (5) months later, he admitted the prohibited drugs were found in his possession and for his personal use in his second Counter-Affidavit dated February 2, 2005, <em>viz</em>.:</p><blockquote><p>x x x x</p><p>The alleged prohibited drugs found in my possession were for my own personal use and not for sale or distribution to buyers;</p><p>x x x x</p><p>I am executing this affidavit to state that I am only a USER of the prohibited drugs and not a pusher thereof, and that I be admitted to a rehabilitation center.</p><p><strong>I know the legal consequences in executing this affidavit.</strong> (Emphasis added)</p></blockquote><p>As shown, appellant categorically stated that he knew the consequences of his admissions. He was even assisted by counsel when affixed his signature on his counter-affidavit. As the final nail in the coffin, appellant even stressed in open court that he was not a pusher but only a user.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> These admissions are already sufficient to establish that he indeed illegally possessed the prohibited drugs. His belated, nay, self-serving claim that the drugs confiscated by the police belonged to another must, therefore fail. They cannot prevail over his prior categorical admissions which he voluntarily and knowingly made with assistance of counsel.</p><p>It is immaterial that appellant's counter-affidavit did not specify the amount of drugs found in his possession. This does not negate the applicability of <em><strong>Regalado</strong></em>. A plain reading of his second counter-affidavit readily shows that he admitted to owning all 381.3065 grams of marijuana recovered during the search. Notably, when he executed his second counter-affidavit on February 2, 2005, about six (6) months after he got arrested, <strong>he already knew by then that he was being charged with illegal possession of 381.3065 grams of marijuana</strong>. Yet he still admitted ownership thereof <strong>without qualification</strong> as to its quantity.</p><p>Thus, the trial court and the Court of Appeals cannot be faulted for construing the counter-affidavit as an admission of ownership and possession of the entire amount recovered. There was no piecemeal admission here. It was either appellant owned the entire quantity or none at all. As it was, the trial court and the Court of Appeals, in their final evaluation of the evidence before them, found that between appellant's admission, on the one hand, and his recantation, on the other, the former is more deserving of weight and credit.</p><p>There exists no cogent reason to depart from these factual findings of the courts below. At any rate, appellant ought not to be allowed to swing from one version of facts to another. The Court should not condone his act of foisting different narratives to muddle the facts case and confuse the courts.</p><p>Suffice it to state that the large amount of the confiscated drugs involved here and appellant's own inculpatory judicial admissions go against the possibility of planting or substitution by the police. Neither could appellant's mere denial and inconsistent statements overcome the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> This is especially true when there were shown not to have any ulterior motive to falsely testify against him in such grave offense of illegal possession of prohibited drugs.</p><p><strong>ACCORDINGLY</strong>, the appeal is <strong>DENIED,</strong> and the Decision dated January 26, 2018 in CA-G.R.

No. 9165. The denial is primarily premised on the statements in Sundaram's Counter-Affidavits, which were considered as a voluntary confession of the crime charged against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Furthermore, despite the deviations from the chain of custody rule, the <em>ponencia</em> ruled that the integrity and identity of the seized dangerous drugs were sufficiently established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p>I dissent.</p><p>The statements attributed to the appellant in this case do not amount to a confession for the possession of the entire volume of drugs stated in the Information. They are likewise not tantamount to an admission that the apprehending team sufficiently preserved the integrity and identity of the seized drug evidence.</p><p>From the records it appears that a buy-bust operation was conducted on August 3, 2004, in front of the residence of Sundaram. After the poseur buyer, PO2 Jaime delos Santos, exchanged his marked P100.00 for a tea-bag sized packet of suspected marijuana from Sundaram, the police officers moved in to arrest the appellant. His common-law wife, Syntyche Litera (Syntyche), was likewise arrested.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p><p>The police officers thereafter informed Sundaram that they had a search warrant covering his residence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Before proceeding with the search, the police officers waited for the arrival of barangay officials and media representatives to witness the search. The search yielded numerous small sachets of marijuana found inside the house and the adjacent store.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> According to the prosecution, PO2 Rey Gabrielle Maderal (PO2 Maderal) marked the seized items with his initials. He also prepared the Certificate of Inventory to document the following items taken during the implementation of the search warrant: (a) a total of 74 tea-bag sized sachets of marijuana; (b) dried crushed leaves of marijuana inside a plastic container; and (c) one (1) white cellophane containing marijuana. The marked money used for the buy-bust operation, together with its serial number, was also recorded in the inventory. The barangay officials and the media personnel from ABS-CBN Butuan and DXBC all signed the Certificate of Inventory, including the appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p><p>When the police officers returned to their office, PO2 Maderal took custody of the confiscated items from the buy-bust and search warrant operations. He prepared several more documents upon their arrival, including the return on the Search Warrant, the Affidavit of Apprehension, and the indorsement to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Crime Laboratory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p><p>Thereafter, PO2 Maderal delivered the request and the specimen to the PNP Crime Laboratory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The examination of the drug evidence yielded a positive result for marijuana, a dangerous drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p>Sundaram was charged in two (2) separate Informations for the illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, in violation of Sections 5 and 11, Article II, of R.A. No. 9165, respectively. The trial court acquitted Sundaram of the charge of illegal sale of dangerous drugs for insufficiency of evidence, there being no markings or inventory on the packet of marijuana supposedly taken pursuant to the buy-bust operation. However, Sundaram was found guilty for the charge of illegal possession of 381.3065 grams of marijuana.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p>The Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the trial court's decision, which constrained Sundaram to file the present appeal before the Court.</p><p align="center"><strong>I.</strong></p><p>In the Decision, the <em>ponencia</em> affirmed the conviction of Sundaram on the basis of his supposed confession in his counter-affidavits during the preliminary investigation. In particular, the following statements in Sundaram's August 14, 2004 Counter-Affidavit were deemed relevant:</p><blockquote><p>I, SUNDARAM MAGAYON y Francisco, 31 years old, single and a resident of 6<sup>th</sup> St., Guingona Subd., Butuan City, after having been sworn to in accordance with law, do hereby depose and say THAT:</p><p>x x x x</p><p>My live[-]in partner, [Syntyche], alias Cheche, has nothing to do with the activities that transpired in our residence;</p><p>The marked money that was found in her possession came from me because I handed it to her because I was about to take a bath[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The following statement in his February 2, 2005 Counter-Affidavit was likewise considered as a voluntary confession: "[t]he alleged prohibited drugs found in my possession were for my personal use and not for sale or distribution to buyers."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> For the <em>ponencia</em>, these were sufficient to support a verdict of conviction as Sundaram "<strong>knowingly took full responsibility for the seized drugs</strong>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p>In my view, however, these statements do not constitute a confession of Sundaram's guilt to the charge of illegal possession of 381.3065 grams of marijuana.</p><p>Preliminarily, the quoted statements in the August 14, 2004 Counter-Affidavit of Sundaram relate to the marked money that he purportedly received as a result of the buy-bust operation. These statements, therefore, are relevant only as to the charge of illegal sale of dangerous drugs, for which he was already acquitted. Stated simply, they cannot be relied upon to sustain a conviction for possession.</p><p>More importantly, the language of Sundaram's sworn statements lacks a categorical acknowledgment of guilt, particularly with respect to his ownership and possession of the entire volume of drugs found in his residence. In this regard, the Court has always made a distinction between a confession and an admission. A confession refers to the express acknowledgment of guilt of the crime charged, while an admission "is an acknowledgment of some facts or circumstances which, in itself, is insufficient to authorize a conviction and which tends only to establish the ultimate facts of guilt."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> An admission is deemed less than a confession as it acknowledges only factual circumstances that tend to prove the guilt of the accused when connected with proof of other facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p>A careful examination of the statements in Sundaram's Counter-Affidavits would reveal that these were mistakenly characterized as a confession. In his August 14, 2004 Counter-Affidavit, Sundaram stated that the marijuana leaves were left in his residence, presumably by someone else, and that he was about to report this to the authorities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The appellant's passive reference to these drugs indicates an intention to distance himself therefrom. Rather than establishing a categorical admission of ownership on the part of the appellant, there is no discernible awareness in this statement that he freely and consciously possessed them.</p><p>Meanwhile, in his February 2, 2005 Counter-Affidavit, Sundaram stated that "[t]he <strong>alleged</strong> prohibited drugs found in [his] possession"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> were only for his own personal use. He also concluded his sworn statement with the admission that he is a drug user but not a seller of prohibited drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p>The equivocalness in these statements is readily apparent. Aside from using the word "alleged" to refer to the prohibited drugs, the February 2, 2005 Counter-Affidavit does not specify the drugs involved or the amount purportedly found in his possession. The glaring absence of these details fail to lend credence to the <em>ponencia</em>'s ruling that Sundaram "<strong>knowingly took full responsibility for the seized drugs</strong>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> This holds especially true in this case where Sundaram maintained that his acknowledgement of guilt only refers to his drug use. During his cross-examination, he denied the rest of the statements in his February 2, 2005 Counter-Affidavit, <em>viz</em>.:</p><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="3">[Prosecutor Aljay O.

Either the appellant owned the entire quantity or none at all.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> This conveniently disregards the fact that according to the prosecution, two (2) operations were conducted prior to the arrest of the appellant: the buy-bust operation and the implementation of the search warrant. In both instances, the prosecution averred that the police officers were able to recover marijuana from the appellant. Without specific details as to the confiscated drugs referred to in the sworn statements of Sundaram, his admission that "[t]he alleged prohibited drugs found in [his] possession were for [his] own personal use and not for sale or distribution"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> could easily refer to the drugs recovered from either operation. The <em>ponencia</em>'s reliance on this statement to affirm the conviction of the appellant is therefore unwarranted.</p><p>It must be emphasized that in cases involving illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the volume of drugs involved is significant to the charge against the accused.

This includes the Request for Laboratory Examination,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the first document on record that reflects the markings PO2 Maderal purportedly made. However, it should be borne in mind that the Request for Laboratory Examination signals the turnover of the drug evidence to the forensic chemist. As such, it is relevant only for purposes of documenting the status of the confiscated drugs prior to its transfer to the succeeding custodian in the chain of custody. It cannot establish that markings were immediately made thereon because at that stage, a significant amount of time had already passed from the seizure of the dangerous drugs.</p><p>Had PO2 Maderal immediately marked the seized drugs, the first record of these markings should be the Certificate of Inventory, the preparation of which follows right after making these markings. The prosecution could have also shown that the photographs of the confiscated items contain the markings that PO2 Maderal described in his testimony. And yet, the photographs taken at the place of the arrest do not exhibit each of the confiscated plastic sachets and containers of marijuana, or that these were marked accordingly.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The photos of the seized drugs laid out side by side were already taken at the apprehending team's office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Again, none of the items appear to have been marked.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p>Given the foregoing, it is clear that there was no marking made during the inventory-taking, which is apparent from the lack of the marking details in the Certificate of Inventory and the pictures presented in evidence, and that the marking was made only prior to submission of the seized drugs to the laboratory as shown in the Request for Laboratory Examination. The Court could only suppose that the markings were made sometime between the intervening period from the confiscation of the drugs and the preparation of the Request for Laboratory Examination. This is precisely the ambiguity that the chain of custody rule seeks to prevent.</p><p>As the Court explained in <em>People v. Dahil</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the immediate marking of the evidence is a necessary safeguard against the planting, switching, and tampering of the seized dangerous drugs — the failure to do so would cast doubts on the authenticity of the <em>corpus delicti</em>:</p><blockquote><p>"Marking" means the placing by the apprehending officer or the poseur-buyer of his/her initials and signature on the items seized. Marking after seizure is the starting point in the custodial link; hence, it is vital that the seized contraband be immediately marked because succeeding handlers of the specimens will use the markings as reference. The marking of the evidence serves to separate the marked evidence from the <em>corpus</em> of all other similar or related evidence from the time they are seized from the accused until they are disposed of at the end of the criminal proceedings, <strong>thus, preventing switching, planting or contamination of evidence</strong>.</p><p>It must be noted that marking is not found in R.A. No. 9165 and is different from the inventory-taking and photography under Section 21 of the said law. Long before Congress passed R.A. No. 9165, however, <strong>this Court had consistently held that failure of the authorities to immediately mark the seized drugs would cast reasonable doubt on the authenticity of the <em>corpus delicti</em></strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p></blockquote><p>It should be further emphasized that marking is a significant preparatory act to the inventory and photographing of dangerous drugs, as the succeeding links in the chain of custody are supposed to record the marks placed on the confiscated drug evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> A gap in these initial custodial requirements makes it difficult for the court to keep track of the evidence while it moves along the chain of custody. Notably, the police officers in this case were armed with a search warrant and yet, they failed to comply with these requirements. The Court's observations in <em>People v. Gayoso</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> is instructive on this matter:</p><blockquote><p>While marking of the evidence is allowed in the nearest police station, this contemplates a case of warrantless searches and seizures. <strong>Here, the police officers secured a search warrant prior to their operation. They therefore had sufficient time and opportunity to prepare for its implementation. However, the police officers failed to mark immediately the plastic sachets of <em>shabu</em> seized inside appellant's house in spite of an Inventory of Property Seized that they prepared while still inside the said house</strong>. The failure of the arresting officers to comply with the marking of evidence immediately after confiscation constitutes the first gap in the chain of custody.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p></blockquote><p>Under the 1999 PNPDEM, the police officers implementing a search warrant were even required to mark the evidence twice: after it was found by the searching element, and upon turn-over to the duly designated evidence custodian. The apprehending team did not comply with either of these requirements. They likewise failed to indicate the weight of each packet of marijuana in either the inventory or the Request for Laboratory Examination, further engendering doubts in my mind that the drugs presented in court were indeed the same ones taken from the appellant.</p><p align="center"><strong>III.</strong></p><p>Another glaring lapse on the part of the apprehending team is the absence of a DOJ representative during the inventory and photographing of the seized items. The mandatory presence of the witnesses to the inventory and photographing is required in all instances of seizure and confiscation of dangerous drugs. More so when the drug evidence was seized by virtue of a search warrant, which, like a buy-bust operation, requires advance planning and preparation.</p><p>The police officers in this case had time to obtain a search warrant, prepare for the buy-bust operation that preceded the service of the warrant, and to make the necessaiy arrangements for the subsequent enforcement of the search warrant. Clearly, during the planning stage for the operation, the police officers likewise had ample time to secure the presence of the required witnesses. However, the only witnesses at the time of the inventory and photographing were the barangay officials and the representatives from the media.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> They did not obtain the presence of a DOJ representative.</p><p>The Court held in <em>People v. Ramos</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> that when there are lapses in the chain of custody rule, particularly when not all of the mandatory witnesses are present, there must be a "justifiable reason for such failure [to secure the attendance of these witnesses] or a showing of any genuine and sufficient effort to secure the required witnesses."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> None was provided in the decision to justify the absence of the DOJ representative. There is also no indication in the records that the prosecution explained this lapse, or at the very least, that the apprehending team exerted earnest efforts to secure the attendance of the absent witness.</p><p>In <em>Dizon v. People</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> the Court held that the deviation from the requirements of Section 21, coupled by the absence of a justifiable ground therefor, compromised the integrity and evidentiary value of the <em>corpus delicti</em>:</p><blockquote><p>In this case, the apprehending team plainly failed to comply with the witness requirements under the law, <em>i.e.</em>, that the photographing and inventory of the seized items be witnessed by a representative from the media, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official. The records are clear: only two (2) barangay officials were present to witness the operation, as observed by the RTC:</p><p>x x x x</p><p>Worse, there was no indication whatsoever that the apprehending team attempted, at the very least, to secure the presence of the other required witnesses.</p><p>Thus, as a result of the foregoing irregularities committed by the government authorities, the conviction of Dizon now hangs in the balance. In this respect, in order not to render void the seizure and custody over the evidence obtained from the latter, the prosecution is thus required, as a matter of law, to establish the following: (i) that such non-compliance was based on justifiable grounds, and (ii) that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were properly preserved.</p><p>x x x x</p><p>At the outset, the Court finds it brazen of the police officers to recognize their fatal error in procedure and yet at the same time offer no explanation or justification for doing so, which, as stated above, is required by the law. <strong>What further catches the attention of the Court is the fact that Dizon was apprehended pursuant to a search warrant and therefore with more reason, the police officers could have secured the presence of the other witnesses, <em>i.e.</em>, the DOJ representative and media representative.</strong></p><p><strong>However, despite the advantage of planning the operation ahead, the apprehending team nonetheless inexplicably failed to comply with the basic requirements of Section 21 of R.A No. 9165.</strong> x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; emphasis in the original omitted)</p></blockquote><p>Here, the apprehending team committed grave procedural lapses not only in the initial custody and handling of the seized marijuana, but with the witness requirements of Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165. No explanation was alleged or proven to justify these deviations from these statutory requirements. Instead, the <em>ponencia</em> relied heavily on the vague statements in the appellant's Counter-Affidavits to prove that the identity and integrity of the drug evidence were preserved.</p><p>To be sure, the Court has not veered away from affirming the conviction of an accused when the requirements of Section 21 are duly observed. In particular, <em>Santos v. People</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and <em>Concepcion v. People</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> involve the implementation of a search warrant, and in both instances, the arresting officers were easily able to comply with all the requirements of Section 21. These cases exhibit the reasonableness of the custodial requirements in R.A. No. 9165, and that it is entirely within the realm of possibility for law enforcement to perform their duties accordingly.</p><p>The Court would be remiss in its duty to faithfully apply the law if, despite the inattentive and careless manner by which police officers performed their functions, the conviction of the accused would nonetheless be affirmed. The gaps in the chain of custody cannot be justified by the ambiguous admissions of the appellant in this case. The arresting officers were duty-bound to observe the chain of custody rule from the moment that dangerous drugs were supposedly confiscated from the possession of the appellant — regardless of any subsequent admission or confession on his part. <u><strong>Failing this, the Court should not substitute the appellant's sworn statements for the required proof of the integrity and evidentiary value of the drug evidence, especially where, as here, the imprecise language of these statements being extant.</strong></u></p><p>I also respectfully disagree with the <em>ponencia</em>'s conclusion that since the present case involves a large volume of dangerous drugs, this "[goes] against the possibility of planting or substitution by the police."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The amount of drugs involved should not dictate the manner by which the Court must evaluate the guilt of the accused. <u><strong>Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not qualify its application depending on the volume of drugs involved.</strong></u> The only matter under R.A. No. 9165, on which the quantity of drugs depends, is the severity of the imposable penalty for the offense of illegal possession of dangerous drugs. This underscores the necessity for the Court's adherence to the chain of custody rule — to ensure that the accused is charged accurately to the last gram and found guilty only when the identity and integrity of the drug evidence are duly preserved. Considering the police officers' blatant disregard of this rule in this case, I disagree with the finding of the <em>ponencia</em> to affirm the conviction of the appellant.</p>Based on the foregoing, I vote to <strong>GRANT</strong> the present appeal and <strong>ACQUIT</strong> the appellant Sundaram Magayon <em>y</em> Francisco on the basis of reasonable doubt.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <em>Ponencia</em>, p. 17. <p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id. at 18.</p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Records, p. 8.</p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id. at 4; TSN, August 10, 2006, p. 6.</p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> TSN, August 10, 2006, pp. 13-14.</p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Exhibit "D," index of exhibits, p. 9; id. at 13-15.</p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> TSN, August 10, 2006, pp. 21-22.</p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Id. at 23-25.</p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Exhibits "I," "J," index of exhibits, pp. 15-16.</p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <em>Ponencia</em>, pp. 9-10.</p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> CA <em>rollo</em>, p. 26; id. at 17.</p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> CA <em>rollo</em>, p. 25; <em>ponencia</em>, id.</p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <em>Ponencia</em>, id.; emphasis in the original.</p><p><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <em>People v.
