It ruled that the RTC-La Trinidad, Benguet had jurisdiction over the petition for correction of entries in respondent's first birth certificate with the LRC- Itogon, Benguet.

Did the Court of Appeals commit reversible error when it rejected the Republic's challenge against the trial court's jurisdiction to direct the LCR-Carranglan, Nueva Ecija to cancel respondent's second birth certificate as a consequence of its order to correct respondent's first birth certificate?<br><br>Second. Did Republic Act No. 9048 (RA 9048) as amended by Republic Act No. 10172 (RA 10172) divest the regional trial courts of jurisdiction over petitions for correction of entries in the civil registry?<br><br><b><center><br>Ruling<br></center></b><br>The Court of Appeals correctly upheld the trial court's jurisdiction to order the LCR-Carranglan, Nueva Ecija to cancel respondent's second birth certificate.<br><br>It is settled that jurisdiction over the main case embraces all incidental matters arising therefrom and connected therewith under the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction.<br><br>Here, the trial court has jurisdiction over respondent's petition for correction of entries in his first birth certificate on file with the LCR-Itogon, Benguet. The trial court has jurisdiction, as well, to direct the cancellation of respondent's second birth certificate with the LCR-Carranglan, Nueva Ecija as an incident or as a necessary consequence of the action to correct the entries sought by respondent. Indeed, demands, matters, or questions ancillary or incidental to, or growing out of, the main action, and coming within the above principles, may be taken cognizance of by the court and determined, since such jurisdiction is in aid of its authority over the principal matter, <b><i>even though the court may thus be called on to consider and decide matters which, as original causes of action, would not he within its cognizance</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><i><b>Mendez vs. Shari'a District Court, 5th Shari'a District, et al</b></i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> is in point:<br><blockquote>To rule that the ShCC is without jurisdiction to resolve issues on custody after it had decided on the issue of divorce, simply because it appears to contravene Article 143 of P.D. No. 1083, would be antithetical to the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction. "While a court may be expressly granted the incidental powers necessary to effectuate its jurisdiction, a grant of jurisdiction, in the absence of prohibitive legislation, implies the necessary and usual incidental powers essential to effectuate it, and, subject to existing laws and constitutional provisions, every regularly constituted court has power to do all things that are reasonably necessary for the administration of justice within the scope of its jurisdiction and for the enforcement of its judgments and mandates. Hence, demands, matters or questions ancillary or incidental to, or growing out of, the main action, and coming within the above principles, may be taken cognizance of by the court and determined, since such jurisdiction is in aid of its authority over the principal matter, even though the court may thus be called on to consider and decide matters which, as original causes of action, would not be within its cognizance."<br><br>Following the doctrine, the ShCC, in cases involving divorce, possesses the power to resolve the issue of custody, it being a <i>related issue</i> to the main cause of action.<br><br><div align="center">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>A distinction must be made between a case for divorce wherein the issue of custody is an <i>ancillary issue</i> and a case where custody is the <i>main issue</i>. Jurisdiction in the former, as discussed above, lies with the ShCC, as the main cause of action is divorce. The latter on the other hand, where the main cause of action is one of custody, the same must be filed with the ShDC, pursuant to Article 143 of P.D. No. 1083.</blockquote>The Court of Appeals, therefore, correctly affirmed the trial court's directive to cancel respondent's second birth certificate on file with the LCR-Carranglan, Nueva Ecija, as a consequence of the main relief sought by and granted to respondent. To file two (2) separate petitions, one for correction of entries in his first birth certificate with the LCR-Itogon, Benguet and two, for cancellation of his second birth certificate with LCR-Carranglan, Nueva Ecija --- will certainly violate the rule against multiplicity of suits.<br><br>More important, a petition for correction is an action <i>in rem</i>. A decision therein binds not only the parties themselves but the whole world, as well. An in rem proceeding entails publication as a jurisdictional requirement--- to give notice to and bring the whole world as a party into the case. Surely, the LCR-Carranglan, Nueva Ecija is part of the world and based on the records, was in fact duly notified of the petition. Consequently, it is bound by the judgment rendered there in the case.<br><br><b>RA 9048, as amended does not divest<br>the regional trial courts of jurisdiction<br>over petitions for correction of entries<br>in the civil registry.</b><br><br>Relevant to the issue of jurisdiction, the Court now brings to fore what seems to be an overlap of jurisdictions over petitions for correction of entries under Sec. 19 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 (BP 129) in relation to Rule 108 of the Revised Rules of Court, on one hand, and RA Nos. 9048 as amended by 10172 on the other.<br><br>Sec. 19 of BP 129 provides:<br><br><b>Section 19.</b> <i>Jurisdiction in civil cases</i>. — Regional Trial Courts shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction:<br><br>(1) In all civil actions in which the subject of the litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation;<br><center><br>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>Deemed included therein are petitions for correction of entries under Rule 108 of the Revised Rules of Court, being themselves incapable of pecuniary estimation.

No. 9048 was amended by <b>R.A. No. 10172</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> expanding the scope of the entries in the civil registry which may be administratively corrected, viz:<br><br><b>Section 1</b>. Section 1 of Republic Act No. 9048, hereinafter referred to as the Act, is hereby amended to read as follows:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 1. <i>Authority to Correct Clerical or Typographical Error and Change of First Name or Nickname</i>. - No entry in a civil register shall be changed or corrected without a judicial order, except for clerical or typographical errors and change of first name or nickname, <b>the day and month in the date of birth or sex of a person</b> where it is patently clear that there was a clerical or typographical error or mistake in the entry, which can be corrected or changed by the concerned city or municipal civil registrar or consul general in accordance with the provisions of this Act and its implementing rules and regulations."

For while RA 9048 allowed the administrative correction of respondent's first name and the typographical error in his father's surname, it did not allow correction of the entry pertaining to respondent's biological sex.<br><br>For it was only on October 24, 2012 that the amendatory law RA 10172 took effect long before respondent initiated his petition with the court. Had RA 10172 taken effect on or before he initiated his petition, he could have resorted to the administrative process under these twin laws just for the purpose of correcting all at once the three (3) entries in his birth certificate.<br><br>He could have then saved a substantial amount of time and expense which precisely what RA Nos. 9048 and 10172 seek to accomplish, among others.<br><br>But then again, respondent's petition came before RA 10172 took effect, this time allowing correction of erroneous entries pertaining to one's biological sex. Surely, to pursue the administrative procedure prescribed under RA 9048 with respect to his first name and typographical error in his father's name and a judicial procedure under Rule 108 with respect to the correction of his biological sex is anathema to the proscription against splitting a cause of action under Section 4, Rule 2 of the Revised Rules of Court, thus:<br><blockquote><b>Section 4, Rule 2</b>. <i>Splitting a single cause of action; effect of</i> — If two or more suits are instituted on the basis of the same cause of action, the filing of one or a judgment upon the merits in any one is available as a ground for the dismissal of the others.<br></blockquote>The next question is - Does RA 9048, as amended by RA 10172 divest the regional trial courts of its jurisdiction over petitions for correction of entries under BP 129 in relation Rule 108 of the Revised Rules of Court?<br><br><b><i>Republic v. Gallo</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> bears the answer, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Following the procedure in Rule 103, Rule 108 also requires a petition to be filed before the Regional Trial Court.

The administrative officer concerned must be given every opportunity to decide on the matter within his or her jurisdiction. Failing to exhaust administrative remedies affects the party's cause of action as these remedies refer to a precedent condition which must be complied with prior to filing a case in court.<br><br>However, failure to observe the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not affect the court's jurisdiction. Thus, the doctrine may be waived as in <i>Soto v. Jareno</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><b><i>Failure to observe the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not affect the jurisdiction of the court</i></b>. We have repeatedly stressed this in a long line of decisions. The only effect of non-compliance with this rule is that it will deprive the complainant of a cause of action, which is a ground for a motion to dismiss. If not invoked at the proper time, this ground is deemed waived and the court can then take cognizance of the case and try it. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Verily, even with the advent of RA 9048, as amended by RA 10172 prescribing the administrative remedy for correction of entries with the civil registry, the regional trial courts are not divested of their jurisdiction to hear and decide petitions for correction of entries "Even the failure to observe the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not affect the jurisdiction of the court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>So must it be.<br><br>Accordingly, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>.

In <i>Republic v.

Prior to these laws, the controlling provisions on changes or corrections of name were Articles 376 and 412 of the Civil Code.</u><br><br>Article 376 states the need for judicial authority before any person can change his or her name. On the other hand, Article 412 provides that judicial authority is also necessary before any entry in the civil register may be changed or corrected.<br><br>Under the old rules, a person would have to file an action in court under Rule 103 for substantial changes in the given name or surname provided they fall under any of the valid reasons recognized by law, or Rule 108 for corrections of clerical errors.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Applying Article 412 of the Civil Code, <u>a person desiring to change his or her name altogether must file a petition under Rule 103 with the Regional Trial Court</u>, which will then issue an order setting a hearing date and directing the order's publication in a newspaper of general circulation. After finding that there is proper and reasonable cause to change his or her name, the Regional Trial Court may grant the petition and order its entry in the civil register.<br><br>On the other hand, <u>Rule 108 applies when the person is seeking to correct clerical and innocuous mistakes in his or her documents with the civil register</u>. It also governs the correction of substantial errors in the entry of the information enumerated in Section 2 of this Rule and those affecting the civil status, citizenship, and nationality of a person. <u>The proceedings under this rule may either be summary, if the correction pertains to clerical mistakes, or adversary, if it pertains to substantial errors.</u><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Following the procedure in Rule 103, Rule 108 also requires a petition to be filed before the Regional Trial Court. The trial court then sets a hearing and directs the publication of its order in a newspaper of general circulation in the province. After the hearing, the trial court may grant or dismiss the petition and serve a copy of its judgment to the Civil Registrar.<br><br><i>Mercadera </i>clarified the applications of Article 376 and Rule 103, and of Article 412 and Rule 108, thus:<br><blockquote><u>The "change of name" contemplated under Article 376 and Rule 103 must not be confused with Article 412 and Rule 108</u>. A change of one's name under Rule 103 can be granted, only on grounds provided by law. In order to justify a request for change of name, there must be a proper and compelling reason for the change and proof that the person requesting will be prejudiced by the use of his official name. To assess the sufficiency of the grounds invoked therefor, there must be adversarial proceedings.<br><br>In petitions for correction, only clerical, spelling, typographical and other innocuous errors in the civil registry may be raised. Considering that the enumeration in Section 2, Rule 108 also includes "changes of name," the correction of a patently misspelled name is covered by Rule 108. Suffice it to say, not all alterations allowed in one's name are confined under Rule 103. Corrections for clerical errors may be set right under Rule 108.<br><br><u>This rule in "names," however, does not operate to entirely limit Rule 108 to the correction of clerical errors in civil registry entries by way of a summary proceeding. As explained above. Republic v. Valencia is the authority for allowing substantial errors in other entries like citizenship, civil status, and paternity, to be corrected using Rule 108 provided there is an adversary proceeding</u>. "After all, the role of the Court under Rule 108 is to ascertain the truths about the facts recorded therein."</blockquote>However, <u>Republic Act No. 9048 amended Articles 376 and 412 of the Civil Code, effectively removing clerical errors and changes of the name outside the ambit of Rule 108 and putting them under the jurisdiction of the civil registrar</u>.<br><br>In <i>Silverio v. Republic</i>:<br><br>The State has an interest in the names borne by individuals and entities for purposes of identification. A change of name is a privilege, not a right. Petitions for change of name are controlled by statutes. In this connection, Article 376 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>ART. 376.

The intent and effect of the law is to exclude the change of first name from the coverage of Rules 103 (Change of Name) and 108 (Cancellation or Correction of Entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court, until and unless an administrative petition for change of name is first filed and subsequently denied. It likewise lays down the corresponding venue, form and procedure. In sum, the remedy and the proceedings regulating change of first name are primarily administrative in nature, not judicial.</u><br><br>In <i>Republic v. Cagandahan:</i><br><br>The determination of a person's sex appearing in his birth certificate is a legal issue and the court must look to the statutes. In this connection, Article 412 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>ART. 412.

The correction or change of such matters can now be made through administrative proceedings and without the need for a judicial order. In effect. Rep. Act No. 9048 removed from the ambit of Rule 108 of the Rules of Court the correction of such errors. Rule 108 now applies only to substantial changes and corrections in entries in the civil register.</u><br><br>In <i>Republic v.

The local city or municipal civil registrar or consul general has the primary jurisdiction to entertain the petition. It is only when such petition is denied that a petitioner may either appeal to the civil registrar general or file the appropriate petition with the proper court.<br><br>Republic Act No. 9048 also dispensed with the need for judicial proceedings in case of any clerical or typographical mistakes in the civil register or changes in first names or nicknames.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Thus, a person may now change his or her <u>first name or correct clerical errors in his or her name through administrative proceedings.

Given this complicated situation, it appears that respondent would have had to file (in addition to the administrative proceeding already discussed above) two separate judicial proceedings as the correction in respondent's sex had to be undertaken in Benguet while the cancellation of the second birth certificate had to be undertaken in Nueva Ecija, pursuant to Rule 108, Section 1.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <b>This is absurd and could not have been the intention of the law and the rules.</b><br><br>In this regard, I agree with the ponencia that (1) R.A. 9048 as amended was enacted precisely to expedite the process of effecting corrections of entries in the civil registry and to make the same more efficient and cost effective for the people,<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[24]</sup></font> and (2) requiring respondent to file two or even three separate petitions results in delays and in a multiplicity of suits.<br><br>I disagree, however, that complying with the procedure laid down by R.A. 9048 in 2007 and Rule 108 would amount to splitting a cause of action.<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[25]</sup></font> In <i>Chu v.

Seludo</i>,<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[36]</sup> </font>the Court explained the corollary concepts of "primary administrative jurisdiction" and "exhaustion of administrative remedies" in this wise:<br><blockquote>It may not be amiss to reiterate the prevailing rule that the <u>doctrine of primary jurisdiction applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, has been placed within the special competence of an administrative agency</u>. In such a case, the court in which the claim is sought to be enforced may suspend the judicial process pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its view or, if the parties would not be unfairly disadvantaged, dismiss the case without prejudice.<br><br>Corollary to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction is the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies. The Court, in a long line of cases, has held that before <u> a party is allowed to seek the intervention of the courts, it is a pre-condition that he avail himself of all administrative processes afforded him. Hence, if a remedy within the administrative machinery can be resorted to by giving the administrative officer every opportunity to decide on a matter that comes within his jurisdiction, then such remedy must be exhausted first before the court's power of judicial review can be sought</u>. The premature resort to the court is fatal to one's cause of action. Accordingly, absent any finding of waiver or <i>estoppel</i>, the case may be dismissed for lack of cause of action.<br><br>The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is based on practical and legal reasons. The availment of administrative remedy entails lesser expenses and provides for a speedier disposition of controversies. Furthermore, the courts of justice, for reasons of comity and convenience, will shy away from a dispute until the system of administrative redress has been completed and complied with, so as to give the administrative agency concerned every opportunity to correct its error and dispose of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Similarly, in <i>Republic v. Gallo</i><font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[38]</sup></font> the Court explained:<br><blockquote><u>Under the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, a party must first avail of all administrative processes available before seeking the courts' intervention. The administrative officer concerned must be given every opportunity to decide on the matter within his or her jurisdiction. Failing to exhaust administrative remedies affects the party's cause of action as these remedies refer to a precedent condition which must be complied with prior to filing a case in court.</u><br><br>However, failure to observe the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not affect the court's jurisdiction. Thus, the doctrine may be waived as in <i>Soto v. Jareno</i>:<br><blockquote>Failure to observe the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not affect the jurisdiction of the court. We have repeatedly stressed this in a long line of decisions. The only effect of non-compliance with this rule is that it will deprive the complainant of a cause of action, which is a ground for a motion to dismiss. If not invoked at the proper time, this ground is deemed waived and the court can then take cognizance of the case and try it. (Citation omitted)</blockquote><u>Meanwhile, under the doctrine of primary administrative jurisdiction, if an administrative tribunal has jurisdiction over a controversy, courts should not resolve the issue even if it may be within its proper jurisdiction. This is especially true when the question involves its sound discretion requiring special knowledge, experience, and services to determine technical and intricate matters of fact.</u><br><br>In <i>Republic v. Lacap:</i><br><blockquote>Corollary to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is the doctrine of primary jurisdiction; that is, courts cannot or will not determine a controversy involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal prior to the resolution of that question by the administrative tribunal, where the question demands the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special knowledge, experience and services of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact. (Citation omitted)</blockquote>Thus, the doctrine of primary administrative jurisdiction refers to the competence of a court to take cognizance of a case at first instance. Unlike the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, it cannot be waived.<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[39]</sup></font><br></blockquote>In both cases, however, the Court recognized that the foregoing principles are not inflexible rules without exception. <i>Republic v.

It would be the height of inefficiency (even absurdity) to require respondent to file three separate petitions to obtain the relief sought, i.e., for a single birth certificate to reflect his correct personal information. The same could be said in a situation where a person would have to file (1) an administrative proceeding to correct his or her birth day and birth month, and (2) a separate judicial proceeding to correct his or her birth year.<br><br>In this regard, I believe introducing some flexibility may help expedite the process, prevent multiplicity of suits, and prove more cost-effective for the concerned parties. As the <i>ponencia</i> aptly notes, allowing the same will save respondent and other persons similarly situated a substantial amount of time and expense, which was precisely what R.A. 9048, as amended, sought to accomplish.<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[42]</sup></font><br><br>When a petition involves local civil registrars located in different places however — as in this case — the Civil Registrar General should be impleaded as a party under Rule 108, Section 3.

A person may only avail of the appropriate judicial remedies under Rule 103 or Rule 108 in the aforementioned entries <i>after</i> the petition in the administrative proceedings is filed and later denied.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A person seeking 1) to change his or her surname or 2) to change both his or her first name and surname may file a petition for change of name under Rule 103, provided that the jurisprudential grounds discussed in <i>Republic v.

As discussed in Lee v. Court of Appeals and more recently, in <i>Republic v. Cagandahan</i>, R.A. 9048 "removed from the ambit of Rule 108 of the Rules of Court the correction of such errors.

Moreover, RA No. 9048, as amended by RA No. 10172, did not divest the trial courts of jurisdiction over petitions for correction of clerical or typographical errors in a birth certificate.

Hence, demands, matters or questions ancillary or incidental to, or growing out of. the main action, and coming within the above principles, may be taken cognizance of by the court and determined, since such jurisdiction is in aid of its authority over the principal matter, even though the court may thus be called on to consider and decide matters which, as original causes of action, would not be within its cognizance.
