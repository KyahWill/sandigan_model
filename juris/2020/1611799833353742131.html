In NLRC LAC No. 03-001071-13, petitioner Randy Dolojan headed the first group of employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> On the other hand, in NLRC NCR Case No. RAB-III-03-17502-11, petitioner Edwin Adona headed the second group of employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The complaints were consolidated<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and raffled to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) – Branch III, San Fernando City, Pampanga.<br><br>Petitioners essentially averred that in 2000, Highlands hired them as cooks, cook helpers, utility workers, and service crew in its camping site in Iba, Zambales.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> For ten (10) years, they regularly reported for work from January to June. They were on call from July to September. For the entire month of October, they were required to report daily as it was the peak season for campers. In November or December, they were also on call depending on the number of campers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> But Highlands' business was open to the public the whole year round.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Every start of the year, Highlands required them to submit their biodata, medical clearances, medical health card, and Social Security number. In 2011, after submitting the requirements for rehiring, Highlands informed them they will be called once the campers arrive. But Highlands never did. Later, they discovered that new employees got hired instead of them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Their annual rehiring since 2001 and the services they rendered, which were necessary and desirable to Highlands' business, conferred them the status of regular employees. Thus, Highlands' failure to rehire them in 2011 without valid cause constituted illegal dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Too, Highlands failed to pay them holiday pay, overtime pay, and other benefits due them as regular employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Having been illegally dismissed, they prayed for separation pay in lieu of reinstatement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondent Highlands Camp countered it is under the management of Rawlings Foundation, Inc., a non-profit religious organization established to provide a camping site in Lobotluta, Bangantalinga, Iba, Zambales for various religious and civic events. The primary purpose of Highlands' business was to provide a venue for religious training, spiritual growth, and evangelization.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Respondent Jayvelyn Pascal was Highlands' Administrator.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Highlands' camp operations were not a whole year-round business as there were peak seasons only.

To be reemployed, they had to apply anew.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Their reemployment was based on their qualification for the position they applied for. More, petitioners' services as cooks, cook helpers, utility workers, service crew, etc., were not necessary and desirable in Highlands' business and were not, in any way, directly related to its main purpose of evangelization.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It can continue to operate even without kitchen workers, service crew, and utility workers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Labor Arbiter's Ruling</b></center><br><br>By Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated January 16, 2013, Labor Arbiter Reynaldo Abdon ruled that petitioners were regular employees, not mere seasonal workers.

The <i>fallo</i> reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appeals filed by respondents and the complainants are <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b> and the assailed Decision dated January 16, 2013 is hereby <b>MODIFIED</b> in that the computation of the award is <b>SET ASIDE and the</b> Labor Arbiter shall during execution proceedings recompute the same based on the guidelines aforementioned and with the 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, as well as holiday pay for three (3) years accordingly included.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Under Resolution dated October 30, 2013, the NLRC denied respondents' Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court of Appeals' Ruling</b></center><br><br>By Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated May 15, 2015, the Court of Appeals reversed.

An employee may be a utility worker for a particular year but may be rehired as cook or cook helper the following year.

In support hereof, petitioners essentially repeat the arguments they raised before the three (3) tribunals below.<br><br>For their part, respondents Highlands Camp/Rawlings Foundation Inc. and Jayvelyn Pascal similarly reiterate their submissions below against petitioners' plea for affirmative relief.<br><br><center><b>The Core Issues</b></center><br><br>1. Were petitioners seasonal or regular employees?<br>2. Was their dismissal valid?<br><br><center><b>Ruling</b></center><br><br>Article 295 of the Labor Code enumerates the different kinds of employment status, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 295. <i>Regular and casual employment.</i> - The provisions of written agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless of the oral agreement of the parties, <b>an employment shall be deemed to be regular where the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer</b>, except where the employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking the completion or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of the employee or <b>where the work or service to be performed is seasonal in nature and the employment is for the duration of the season. xxx</b> (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Under the law, regular employees are those engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual trade or business of the employer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In <b><i>Abasolo v. National Labor Relations Commission</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court decreed the standard to determine regular employment status, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>The primary standard, therefore, of determining a regular employment is the reasonable connection between the particular activity performed by the employee in relation to the usual business or trade of the employer.</b> The test is whether the former is usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer. The connection can be determined by considering the nature of the work performed and its relation to the scheme of the particular business or trade in its entirety. <b>Also, if the employee has been performing the job for at least one year, even if the performance is not continuous or merely intermittent, the law deems the repeated and continuing need for its performance as sufficient evidence of the necessity if not indispensability of that activity to the business.</b> Hence, the employment is also considered regular, but only with respect to such activity and while such activity exists. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>On the other hand, seasonal employees are those whose work or engagement is seasonal in nature and their employment is only for the duration of the season,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In <b><i>Universal Robina Sugar Milling Corporation v. Acibo</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the Court expounded on the concept of seasonal employment, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>Seasonal employment</b> operates much in the same way as project employment, albeit it <b>involves work or service that is seasonal in nature or lasting for the duration of the season</b>. As with project employment, although the <b>seasonal employment arrangement involves work that is seasonal or periodic in nature,</b> the employment itself is not automatically considered seasonal so as to prevent the employee from attaining regular status. To exclude the asserted "seasonal" employee from those classified as regular employees, <b>the employer <u>must show</u> that: (1) the employee must be performing work or services that are seasonal in nature; and (2) he had been employed for the duration of the season.</b> Hence, when the "seasonal" workers are continuously and repeatedly hired to perform the same tasks or activities <i>for several seasons or even after the cessation of the season</i>, this length of time may likewise serve as badge of regular employment. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><br>To be classified as seasonal employees, two (2) elements therefore, must concur: (1) they must be performing work or services that are seasonal in nature; and (2) they have been employed for the duration of the season.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Here, respondents claim that Highlands' business is seasonal in nature and petitioners were seasonal workers whose employment was limited to a specific season only.<br><br>We are not convinced.<br><br><b><i>Petitioners were not seasonal employees</i></b><br><br>Respondents failed to show that the elements of seasonal employment are present here.<br><br><i>One</i>. Records show that Highlands' business is not seasonal. Highlands may have high or low market encounters within a year, or by its own terms, "peak and lean seasons"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> but its camping site does not close at any given time or season. In fact, Highlands operate and regularly offers its camping facilities to interested clients <i>throughout the year</i>. As the labor tribunals aptly found:<br><br><blockquote><u>The Labor Arbiter:</u><br><br>Actually, we have carefully evaluated the condition of respondents' business. <b>The fact is, it is a camping business; it was not built for one season in a given year. The camp has been there to serve the customers or clients of the respondents, anytime or any period within the given year.</b> xxx<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><u>The NLRC:</u><br><br>Likewise, <b>respondents' summary of reservation/bookings from 2000-2011 shows that respondents had been operating their business not only for a particular season but for a whole year</b>. These documents, rather than sustaining respondents' argument only serve to support complainants' contention that they are regular employees serving respondents for more than a year prior to their dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br><br>In <b><i>Philippine Fruit &amp; Vegetable Industries, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the Court emphasized that an employer's continuous operation throughout the year negates the claim that its business is seasonal in nature, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>It should be noted that complainants' employment has not been fixed for a specific project or undertaking the completion or termination of which has been determined at the time of their appointment or hiring. Neither is their employment seasonal in nature. While it may be true that some phases of petitioner company's processing operations is dependent on the supply of fruits for a particular season, <b>the other equally important aspects of its business, such as manufacturing and marketing are not seasonal. The fact is that large-scale food processing companies such as petitioner company continue to operate and do business throughout the year</b> even if the availability of fruits and vegetables is seasonal. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>As stated, Highlands' camping site is operational throughout the year. The influx of campers may peak during the month of October, but as for eleven (11) other months, it still remains open and ready to accommodate campers. It does not suspend or cease its operations at all. In fact, Highlands' own summary of bookings from 2001-2011 shows it operates not just for a particular season but all throughout the year.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Highlands' business, therefore, is not seasonal but continuous.<br><br><i>Two</i>. Petitioners did not perform work or services that are seasonal in nature; nor for just a specific period.<br><br>They served as cooks, cook helpers, utility workers, and service crew in Highlands' camping site regardless if it was the peak or lean season for campers. From 2000 to 2010, they regularly reported for work from January to June. They were on call from July to September. For the entire month of October, they reported for work on a daily basis. In November or December, they were again on call depending on the number of campers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>As it was, petitioners' services as cooks, cook helpers, utility workers, service crew, etc. could hardly be considered "seasonal." The very nature of Highlands' business operations demonstrate that petitioners' employment was not limited to a specific season only.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><i>Three</i>. Records are bereft of any evidence showing that petitioners freely entered into an agreement with Highlands to perform services for a specific period or season only. Highlands failed to present petitioners' employment contracts, employee files, payrolls, and other similar documents to prove they hired petitioners as seasonal employees<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and they rendered services for a specific season only.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Highlands' failure to submit these documents for scrutiny gives rise to the presumption that their presentation is prejudicial to its cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In <b><i>Omni Hauling Services, Inc. et al. v. Bon, et al.</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> the Court held that the absence of employment contracts raises a serious question whether the employees were properly informed of their employment status at the time of engagement, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>While the absence of a written contract does not automatically confer regular status, it has been construed by this Court as a red flag in cases involving the question of whether the workers concerned are regular or project employees.</b> In <i>Grandspan Development Corporation v. Bernardo and Audion Electric Co., Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, <b>this Court took note of the fact that the employer was unable to present employment contracts signed by the workers</b> xxx. In another case, <i>Raycor v. Aircontrol Systems, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, this Court refused to give any weight to the employment contracts offered by the employers as evidence, which contained the signature of the president and general manager, but not the signatures of the employees. In cases where this Court ruled that construction workers who were repeatedly rehired that retained their status as project employees, the employers were able to produce employment contracts <b>clearly stipulating</b> that the workers' employment was coterminous with the project to support their claims that the employees were notified of the scope and duration of the project. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>To repeat, there is ample evidence on record that Highlands' business operates not for a particular season but for the whole year.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Too, petitioners rendered services regardless of the camping site's occupancy in any given month within the year. Simply put, there is no "season" here to speak of. For whether "peak" or "lean" season, Highlands required petitioners to report for work. Petitioners, therefore, are not seasonal employees.<br><br>The next question: were petitioners regular employees?<br><br>Respondents claim they were not. They argue that petitioners' employment was terminated at the end of each year. To be reemployed, petitioners had to apply anew and meet the qualification for the specific position they are applying for.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Too, petitioners rendered services for an average of less than three (3) months only per year. Their services as cooks, cook helpers, utility workers, service crew, etc. were not necessary in Highlands' business and were not, in any way, directly related to its main purpose of evangelization.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Respondents are mistaken.<br><br><b><i>Petitioners were regular employees</i></b><br><br>Employment status is determined not by the intent or motivations of the parties but by the nature of the employer's business and the duration of the tasks performed by the employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> It does not depend on the will of the employer or the procedure for hiring and the manner of designating the employee. Rather, employment status depends on the activities performed by the employee and in some cases, the length of time of the performance and its continued existence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The fact that Highlands required petitioners to apply for reemployment every year does not bar them from being regularized. Further, even if it were true that petitioners worked for three (3) months only in a given year, their repeated hiring for the same services for the past ten (10) years confers upon them the status of regular employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>In <b><i>Claret School of Quezon City v. Sinday</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> petitioner therein averred that respondent's repeated application every time her temporary employment expired meant she was employed for a specific period only. The Court, however, ruled otherwise. It found that respondent's yearly application and subsequent reemployment did not negate her status as a regular employee.<br><br>In <b><i>Samonte v. La Salle Greenhills, Inc.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the Court elucidated that the repeated renewal of therein petitioner's employment contract for fifteen (15) years despite interruptions during the close of the school year did not bar petitioner from attaining regular employment.<br><br>Meanwhile, in <b><i>Poseidon Fishing v. National Labor Relations Commission</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> the Court ordained that the employer's unscrupulous act of hiring and rehiring an employee in various capacities without an exact period of employment is a mere gambit to thwart the lowly workingman's tenurial protection.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Thus, in <b><i>Claret</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> the Court held that the repeated hiring of employees under a contract less than the six-month probationary period to circumvent regular employment is contrary to law, <i>viz</i>.:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br><blockquote>xxx where from the circumstances it is apparent that the period has been imposed <b>to preclude the acquisition of tenurial security by the employee, then it should be struck down as being contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order and public policy</b>. The pernicious practice of having employees, workers and laborers, engaged xxx <b>short of the normal six-month probationary period of employment, and, thereafter, to be hired on a day-to-day basis, mocks the law</b>. (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Indeed, Highlands' cyclical scheme of hiring and rehiring petitioners year after year manifests its intent to prevent them from attaining regular employment. Highlands failed to prove that petitioners freely entered into agreements with it to perform services for a specified period or season. In fact, there is nothing on record to show there was any agreement at all between Highlands and each of herein petitioners. Respondents never presented petitioners' supposed contracts of employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> In the absence of proof showing that petitioners knowingly agreed on a fixed or seasonal term of employment, we uphold the findings of the labor tribunals that petitioners are regular employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>As for respondents' argument that petitioners' services were not necessary and related to Highlands' main business purpose of providing a venue for evangelization, <b><i>Millenium Erectors Corporation v. Magallanes</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> is <i>apropos</i>. In that case, Millennium argued that Magallanes who worked as a utility man for sixteen (16) years was not a regular employee. His work was not necessary or directly related to petitioner's business as a construction company. The Court, however, ruled that petitioner's repeated and continuing need for respondent's services proved the necessity, if not indispensability, of his services to petitioner's business thereby making him a regular employee.<br><br><b><i>Vicmar Development Corp. v. Elarcosa</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> is also in point, thus.<br><br><blockquote>The test to determine whether an employee is regular is the reasonable connection between the activity he performs and its relation to the employer's business or trade xxx. <b><u>Nonetheless</u></b>, the <b><u>continuous re-engagement of all respondents to perform the same kind of tasks proved the necessity and desirability of their services in the business</u></b> of Vicmar. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><br>It is undisputed that respondents repeatedly hired petitioners as cooks, cook helpers, utility workers, and service crew, among others, from 2000 to 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Even when petitioners were not rehired in 2011, Highlands still engaged other workers to perform the same tasks that petitioners have been performing for the past ten (10) years. Highlands' continuing need for the same services originally performed by petitioners is testament to their necessity and desirability in its business.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Without cooks, cook helpers, utility workers, and service crew, etc., it would be difficult, nay impossible, for Highlands to maintain its camping facilities and cater to its campers' needs. It would not have been able to provide a suitable venue for religious training, spiritual growth, and evangelization. Petitioners' services, therefore, are necessary and directly related to Highlands' camping site business. Verily, they were in fact regular employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br><b><i>Petitioners were illegally dismissed</i></b><br><br>As regular employees, petitioners cannot be terminated from employment without any just and/or authorized cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Surely, Highlands' unilateral refusal to "rehire" them, <i>sans</i> any valid reason amounted to illegal dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Petitioners are thus entitled to the rights and benefits due to illegally dismissed employees under Article 294 of the Labor Code, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 294. Security of Tenure. In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by this Title. An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to <b>reinstatement</b> without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his <b>full backwages</b>, inclusive of <b>allowances</b>, and to his <b>other benefits</b> or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>We, therefore, uphold the labor tribunals' award of full backwages to petitioners. We likewise affirm the award of 13<sup>th</sup> month pay due to them for respondents' failure to show that the same had been paid. As for overtime pay and holiday pay, however, we agree with the labor arbiter's finding<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> that petitioners failed to prove they had actually rendered service in excess of the regular eight (8) working hours a day and that they worked on holidays.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Further, the labor arbiter properly denied petitioners' claim for damages for failure to prove that respondents acted in bad faith in terminating their employment.<br><br>We also affirm the labor tribunals' award of separation pay in lieu of reinstatement. Separation pay is granted when: a) the relationship between the employer and the illegally dismissed employee is already strained; and b) a considerable length of time had already passed rendering it impossible for the employee to return to work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Petitioners filed their complaint in 2011 and prayed for separation pay in lieu of reinstatement. A prayer for separation pay is an indication of the strained relations between the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Too, nine (9) years is a substantial period rendering reinstatement impracticable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Since separation pay is awarded here, petitioners' backwages should be reckoned from the time of illegal dismissal <b>up to the finality of this Decision</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>Finally, since petitioners were compelled to litigate to protect their interests,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> the award of attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award is proper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>As for Jayvelyn Pascal, it is settled that a corporation has a personality distinct and separate from the persons composing it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> As a general rule, only the employer-corporation, and not its officers, may be held liable for illegal dismissal of employees. The exception applies when corporate officers acted with bad faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>There is no showing here that as Highlands' Administrator, Pascal acted with malice, ill will, or bad faith when petitioners got terminated. She was merely identified as Highlands' Administrator, nothing more. She, therefore, cannot be made personally liable for petitioners' illegal dismissal.<br><br><b><i>A final word.</i></b> Ordinary workers, as petitioners here, face each day the unevenness between labor and capital.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> The reality is that they are trapped in a "one scratch, one peck" life or in the vernacular <i>"isang kahig, isang tuka"</i> just so they can provide immediate food for their family, at the expense of job security. This kind of reality needs to change. An essential step towards this change is by putting an end to an employer's obvious circumvention of labor laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> The contract of labor is imbued with public interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> This interest remains protected.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> the <b>PETITIONS are GRANTED</b>.
