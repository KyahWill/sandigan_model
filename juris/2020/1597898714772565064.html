CA, et al., G.R. No. 109307</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Prior to the present controversy, the subject property was subject of a legal dispute involving Lutero and his siblings, the heirs of the late spouses Eugenio Romero (Eugenio) and Teodora Saltiga (Teodora) (collectively referred to as the Sps. Romero). The Sps. Romero begot nine children, <i>i.e.</i>, Lutero, Eutiquio, Ricardo, Generosa, Diosdada, Mindalina, Lucita, Presentacion and Gloriosa. The issue regarding the ownership and possession of the subject property was dealt with in two civil cases tried jointly before the Regional Trial Court of Lanao Del Norte, Branch 7 (RTC):<br><ol><li>Civil Case No. 591, entitled <i>Teodora Saltiga de Romero, et al. v. Lutero Romero, et al.</i> - for Reconveyance with Damages and Cancellation of Registration of Mortgage<br><br></li><li>Civil Case No. 1056, entitled <i>Lutero Romero, et al. v. Spouses Meliton Pacas, et al.</i> - for Annulment of three Affidavits of Sales, Recovery of Possession with Damages<br></li></ol>In sum, it was alleged by the petitioners in Civil Case No. 591, <i>i.e.</i>, Teodora, Presentacion, Lucita, Gloriosa, and Mindalina, that Lutero merely held the subject property in trust for the benefit of the heirs of his father Eugenio since the latter was actually the one who first applied for the homestead, but such application was denied because Eugenio was already disqualified to apply for a homestead, having previously applied for a homestead over another parcel of land with the maximum limit of 24 hectares. Moreover, it was alleged that Lutero employed fraud in procuring the homestead patent covering the subject property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In addition, the petitioners in Civil Case No. 591 also claimed that Lutero subsequently sold the subject property by allegedly executing three affidavits of sale in favor of the respondents in Civil Case No. 1056, <i>i.e.</i>, spouses Lucita and Meliton Pacas, spouses Presentacion and Sabdullah Mama, and spouses Gloriosa and Dionisio Rasonable. Hence, it was alleged that Lutero no longer has any claim over the subject property pursuant to these affidavits of sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The RTC rendered a Decision dated March 11, 1991 in favor of Lutero, declaring the three affidavits of sale null and void and ordering the respondents in Civil Case No. 1056 to surrender possession of the subject property to Lutero. On appeal, the CA affirmed the ruling of the RTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The consolidated cases were then resolved with finality by the Court in <b><i>Teodora Saltiga de Romero, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al</i>.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (<i>De Romero v. CA</i>). In the said case, the Court held that Lutero is the true and lawful landowner of the subject property, having exclusively acquired the subject property after successfully applying for a homestead patent over the land in 1967. Lutero's exclusive ownership over the subject property was even recognized by some of Lutero's sisters, <i>i.e.</i>, Gloriosa, Presentacion, and Lucita.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The Decision in <i>De Romero v. CA</i> likewise found that the family patriarch, Eugenio, never owned the subject property. Eugenio himself tried to apply for a homestead patent over the subject property, but this was denied "because he was disqualified by virtue of the fact that he already had applied for the maximum limit of 24 hectares to which he was entitled [pertaining to land located on the adjacent lot; and the] land in question could not therefore have passed on from him to his children."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the said Decision held that the supposed sale of the subject property by Lutero in favor of the respondents in Civil Case No. 1056 was null and void for being violative of Section 118 of Commonwealth Act No. 141,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> which prohibited the alienation of a homestead within five years from the issuance of the patent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>After the Court's Decision in <i>De Romero v. CA</i> became final and executory, the petitioners Heirs of Lutero filed a Motion for the Issuance of a Writ of Execution before the RTC on March 10, 2003. On June 16, 2003, the RTC issued a Writ of Execution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>However, the implementation of the Writ of Execution was held in abeyance because respondent Sombrino filed a Motion for Intervention, alleging that she was a tenant of the subject property. The RTC allowed the intervention and granted respondent Sombrino the opportunity to present evidence to show good cause why the Writ of Execution should not be implemented against her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>After due hearing and deliberation, the RTC ordered the implementation of the Writ of Execution, as shown by the Sheriffs Report. Subsequently, a Writ of Demolition was issued by the RTC on March 29, 2005. On April 5, 2005, respondent Sombrino was ousted from the subject property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><i>Complaint for Illegal Ejectment and Recovery of Possession before the Office of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board</i><br><br>Because respondent Sombrino failed to successfully assert her right to possess the subject property before the RTC, she sought recourse before the Office of the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (PARAD) of Iligan City by filing a Complaint for Illegal Ejectment and Recovery of Possession (PARAD Complaint) against the petitioners Heirs of Lutero. The case was docketed as DARAB Case No. X-543-LN-2005.<br><br>In the PARAD Complaint, respondent Sombrino alleged that she was the actual tenant-cultivator of the subject property as she and her late husband Valeriano were installed as tenants over the subject property in 1952 by the alleged original owners of the subject property, the Sps. Romero, until the said spouses were succeeded by Lucita and her heirs as landowners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Hence, respondent Sombrino asked that her security of tenure as tenant of the subject property be upheld and that she be allowed to peacefully possess and cultivate the subject property.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the PARAD</b><br></center></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY">In the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated October 28, 2005, the PARAD rule4 in favor of respondent Sombrino and declared her to be a <i><i>de jure</i></i> tenant of the subject property.

The appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 07367-MIN.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the CA</b><br></center><br>In the assailed Decision, the CA denied the appeal for lack of merit.

The late Spouses Eugenio and Teodora Romero are the landowners; respondent, together with her late husband, is their tenant. The subject matter of their relationship is agricultural land, a farm land. They mutually agreed to the cultivation of the land by respondent and share in the harvest. The purpose of their relationship is clearly to bring about agricultural production. After the harvest, respondent pays rental as well as the irrigation fees. Lastly, respondent's personal cultivation of the land was conceded by Lucita Romero Pacas, [who] succeeded her parents the Spouses Eugenio and Teodora Romero, thru a leasehold agreement which became the contract between the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, the CA held that the petitioners Heirs of Lutero are bound to respect the leasehold relationship between the Sps. Romero and respondent Sombrino:<br><blockquote>Given the foregoing, the petitioners are bound to respect the leasehold relationship between the late Spouses Eugenio and Teodora Romero and respondent notwithstanding the transfer of legal possession of the subject agricultural land. Accordingly, respondent cannot be dispossessed of her possession and cultivation of the subject agricultural land without any valid and just cause. Security of tenure is a legal concession to agricultural lessees which they value as life itself and deprivation of their land holdings is tantamount to deprivation of their only means of livelihood. Perforce, the termination of the leasehold relationship can take place only for causes provided by law x x x as specified in Sections 8, 28 and 36 of R.A. No. 3844. A perusal of these provisions will show that no such valid cause exists in the present case warranting the termination of the leasehold relationship. Hence, the rights of respondent as tenant should be respected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>Feeling aggrieved, the petitioners Heirs of Lutero filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated February 7, 2018, which was denied by the CA in the assailed Resolution.<br><br>Hence, the instant Petition before the Court.<br><br>On January 14, 2019, respondent Sombrino filed her Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated December 14, 2018 to the instant Petition wherein she asserted that she was able to duly establish her tenancy with respect to the subject property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Despite the Court's Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated March 13, 2019 requiring the petitioners Heirs of Lutero to file their Reply, the latter failed to do so.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>Stripped to its core, the critical issue is whether there exists an agricultural leasehold tenancy relationship between the petitioners Heirs of Lutero and respondent Sombrino.

Romero, allegedly entered into a tenancy agreement with respondent Sombrino in 1952. And because the leasehold relation subsists and binds the legal heirs of the agricultural lessors even upon the latter's death, Lutero and, subsequently, his heirs are bound by this leasehold relation.<br><br><i>Respondent Sombrino failed to provide substantial evidence on the existence of an agricultural leasehold tenancy relationship between herself and the Sps.

Romero.<br><br>Tenancy relationship cannot be presumed. An assertion that one is a tenant does not automatically give rise to security of tenure. Nor does the sheer fact of working on another's landholding raise a presumption of the existence of agricultural tenancy.

Development Bank of the Philippines­Dagupan Branch, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the Court held that an affidavit of the same nature as the said Joint Affidavit fails to prove consent of the landowner. In the said case, the Court explained that such document in no way confirms that the alleged tenant's presence on the land was based on a tenancy relationship that the landowners had agreed to as "[m]ere occupation or cultivation of an agricultural land does not automatically convert the tiller into an agricultural tenant recognized under agrarian laws."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In believing that respondent Sombrino was able to establish the existence of a tenancy agreement with the Sps.

Citing the findings of the court <i>a quo</i>, the Court held therein that "[o]bviously, the barangay captain x x x whose attestation appears on the document-was not the proper authority to make such determination [because even] certifications issued by administrative agencies and/or officials concerning the presence or the absence of a tenancy relationship are merely preliminary or provisional and are not binding on the courts."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>With respect to acknowledgment receipts presented by respondent Sombrino showing the payment of irrigation fees and rentals to Lucita,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> such pieces of documentary evidence fail to show that the Sps. Romero installed respondent Sombrino as a tenant of the subject property. The said receipts merely establish that, at most, respondent Sombrino entered into an arrangement with Lucita and not with the Sps. Romero.<br><br>More doubt is engendered in the mind of the Court as to the existence of the alleged agricultural tenancy agreement because of the undisputed fact that "<u>Eugenio Romero died sometime in 1948.</u>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> To recall, at the heart of respondent Sombrino's claim of tenancy is her allegation that Eugenio, together with Teodora, installed her as tenant in 1952. Needless to say, with the death of Eugenio in 1948, contrary to the contention of respondent Sombrino, it was <i>impossible</i> for Eugenio to have instituted respondent Sombrino as tenant of the subject property.<br><br>All in all, the Court finds that respondent Sombrino failed to discharge her burden of proving that a tenancy relationship existed between her and the Sps. Romero.<br><br><i>Assuming that it even existed, the supposed tenancy agreement was invalid as it was not entered into with the true and lawful landowner of the subject property</i><br><br>Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the Sps.

Cadiz, et al.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> is on all fours. In the said case, the respondents-farmers therein claimed that the alleged landowner, Nicanor Ibuna, Sr. (Ibuna), validly installed them as tenants. Analogous to the instant case, by virtue of a final and executory judgment recognizing the ownership of the petitioners' predecessor-in-­interest, Teodoro Cadeliña (Teodoro), over the subject property therein as the latter was a holder of a homestead patent, the respondents-farmers were ousted from the land. As in the instant case, the respondents-farmers filed complaints for reinstatement of possession of the land before the DARAB.<br><br>In dismissing the respondents-farmers' claim of tenancy relationship, the Court explained that a tenancy relationship could only be created with the true and lawful landowner who was the owner, lessee, usufructuary or legal possessor of the land. Since Ibuna was not the true and lawful landowner, he could not have validly installed the respondents-farmers as tenants of the land. Further, the Court held therein that upholding Ibuna as the legal possessor of the land was inconsistent with Teodoro's homestead, which was already deemed valid in a final and executory judgment, since a homestead applicant was required to occupy and cultivate the land for his own and his family's benefit, and not for the benefit of someone else, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>In this case, Ibuna's institution of respondents as tenants did not give rise to a tenure relationship because Ibuna is not the lawful landowner, either in the concept of an owner or a legal possessor, of the properties. It is undisputed that prior to the filing of the complaint with the DARAB, the transfers of the properties to Ibuna and his predecessor, Andres Castillo, were declared void in separate and previous proceedings. Since the transfers were void, it vested no rights whatsoever in favor of Ibuna, either of ownership and possession. x x x<br><br>Notably, upholding Ibuna as the legal possessor of the properties is inconsistent with petitioners' homestead since a homestead applicant is required to occupy and cultivate the land for his own and his family's benefit, and not for the benefit of someone else. x x x <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>In the instant case, to reiterate, it has already been decided in the Court's final and executory Decision in <i>De Romero v. CA</i> that:<br><blockquote>x x x Eugenio Romero was never the owner of the land in question because all he bought from the Jaug spouses were the alleged rights and interests, if there was any, to the said land which was then part of the public domain. The Jaugs could not have sold said land to Eugenio as they did not own it. Eugenio Romero was not granted, and could not have been granted, a patent for said land because he was disqualified by virtue of the fact that he already had applied for the maximum limit of 24 hectares to which he was entitled. The land in question could not therefore have passed on from him to his children.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote>Moreover, <i>De Romero v. CA</i> definitely held that Lutero's homestead patent over the subject property was validly acquired and he was the true and lawful landholder of the subject property, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>On the other hand, <u>Lutero Romero applied for a homestead patent over the land in question and his application was duly approved.</u> The appellants have not established that there was any fraud committed in this application. In fact it appears that there was even a hearing conducted by the Bureau of Lands on the application because a certain Potenciano Jaug had been contesting the application. Under the presumption of law, that official duty has been regularly performed, there appears to be no ground to question the grant of the patent to Lutero Romero in 1967.<br><br>His sisters Gloriosa, Presentacion, and Lucita apparently recognized Lutero's ownership of the property when in 1969 they sought the help of the mayor of Kapatagan to convince Lutero to execute affidavits of sale in their favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote>In sum, with the finality of <i>De Romero v. CA,</i> it can no longer be disputed that the Sps. Romero never became the owners of the subject property. Neither did they become the lessee, usufructuary or legal possessor of the subject property. Hence, the Sps. Romero had no capacity whatsoever to install respondent Sombrino as a leasehold tenant on the subject property. Consequently, neither could the heirs of the Sps. Romero (aside from Lutero) validly enter into any tenancy agreement over the subject property.<br><br>Given the foregoing, with the absence of the first essential requisite of an agricultural tenancy relationship, <i>i.e.</i>, that the parties to the agreement are the true and lawful landholders and tenants, respondent Sombrino cannot be considered a <i>de jure</i> tenant who is entitled to security of tenure under existing tenancy laws. And corollarily, there being no agricultural tenancy relationship existing in the instant case, the PARAD and DARAB acted beyond their jurisdiction when they ordered the petitioners Heirs of Lutero, among other things, to restore possession of the subject property to respondent Sombrino.<br><b><br>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
