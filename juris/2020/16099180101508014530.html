No. 9165, otherwise known as the "Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002."<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br><br>On February 16, 2015, Pis-an was placed under surveillance after the police received a tip from a confidential informant that the former was involved in drug dealing. The police then conducted a test-buy operation and was able to recover from Pis-an one transparent plastic sachet which yielded positive results for <i>shabu</i> per Chemistry Report No. 063-15<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated February 16, 2015, issued by Police Chief Inspector Josephine Suico Llena (PCInsp. Llena).<br><br>Thus, on February 18, 2015, Police Officer 3 Derek T. Alcoran (PO3 Alcoran) applied for a search warrant before the RTC of Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> That same day, Search Warrant (SW) No. 10-2015 6 was issued by Executive Judge Gerardo A. Paguio, Jr., authorizing the search of Pis-an's residence located in Barangay (Brgy.) Camanjac, Dumaguete City.<br><br>On February 25, 2015, a team headed by PO2 Eugene A. Calumba (PO2 Calumba) and PO2 Dexter S. Banua (PO2 Banua) discussed their individual assignments and plan of action. After receiving the coordination control number from the local Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), the team marched to implement SW No. 10-2015. Upon reaching the house of Pis-an, the police officers, along with <i>Brgy. Kagawad</i> Raul Dicen (<i>Brgy. Kagawad</i> Dicen), enforced the warrant and seized the following:<br><br><ol><li>One (1) red com purse containing 14 pieces of heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets each containing white crystal line substance; <br></li><li>Four (4) pieces of disposable lighters; <br></li><li>Two (2) pieces of plastic straws; <br></li><li>Two (2) pieces of metal clips; <br></li><li>Three (3) pieces of assorted needles; <br></li><li>Three (3) pairs of scissors; <br></li><li>Seven (7) pieces of tin foil; <br></li><li>Two (2) pieces of improvised tooters; and<br></li><li>A total of P3,050 in various denominations.</li></ol><br><br>All the items were carried out to the porch of the house where PO2 Calumba marked<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> them while PO2 Banua took photos. Afterwards, an inventory was made in the presence of Pis-an and <i>Brgy. Kagawad</i> Dicen; together with media practitioner Juancho Gallarde (Gallarde) and Department of Justice (DOJ) representative Anthony Chilius Benlot (Benlot), who had both arrived by then.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Thereafter, Pis-an and the seized items were brought to the Provincial Intelligence Branch (PIB) satellite office where a Memorandum Request for Laboratory Examination and Drug Test<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and a Return of Search Warrant<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> were prepared and signed by PO2 Calumba.<br><br>That afternoon, at the crime laboratory, PCInsp.

Llena stated that the 14 pieces of transparent plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance have a total aggregate weight of 9.38 grams and all tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>. PCInsp. Llena also examined the urine sample taken from Pis-an and, as inscribed in her Chemistry Report No. DT-068-15,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the same also tested positive for the presence of methamphetamine.<br><br>Consequently, Pis-an was charged under an Amended Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated March 10, 2015, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 25<sup>th</sup> day of February, 2015 in the City of Dumaguete, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused DAVID JAMES PIS-AN y DIPUTADO, without authority of law and legal justification, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously possess or have under his custody and control fourteen [14] pieces transparent plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance weighing 3.25 grams, 4.13 gram[s], 0.28 gram, 0.24 gram, 0.26 gram, 0.23 gram, 0.16 gram, 0.11 gram, 0.15 gram, 0.18 gram, 0.13 gram, 0.07 gram, 0.13 gram, 0.06 gram, with a total aggregate weight of 9.38 grams which substances after examination conducted on specimen were found positive to the test of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, also known as [<i>shabu</i>], a dangerous drug, in violation of [R.A.] No. 9165.<br><br><u>That the accused was found positive for Methamphetamine, a dangerous drug, as reflected in Chemistry Report No. DT-068-15</u>.<br><br>Contrary to Section 11 Article II of [R.A.] No. 9165.

In doing so, the CA held that the prosecution was able to prove all the elements required to secure Pis-an's conviction. Moreover, the CA observed that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs were properly preserved as each link in the chain of custody rule was duly established by the prosecution. Further, the CA opined that Pis-an's allegation that no search warrant was shown to him was belied by the fact that his signature appears thereon.<br><br>Thus, the dispositive portion of the decision states:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Judgment dated September 12, 2016, issued by the [RTC], Branch 30, Dumaguete City in Criminal Case No. 2015-22801 convicting accused-appellant [Pis-an] of Violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A. 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br>With costs against [Pis-an].<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b></blockquote><br><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br>The Court required<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> both parties to file their respective supplementary briefs; however, they opted not to file the same.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b></center><br><br>Here, as in all criminal cases, the primordial issue is whether the guilt of the accused has been established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br><br>The appeal, after a judicious review, fails.<br><br>For the charge of illegal possession of a dangerous drug to prosper, it must be proven that (1) the accused was in possession of an item or an object identified to be a prohibited or regulated drug, (2) such possession is not authorized by law, and (3) the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of the drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, the courts <i>a quo</i> correctly held that all the aforementioned elements are present here, since: <i>(i)</i> by virtue of SW No. 10- 2015, a valid search warrant, the police officers recovered, among others, 14 heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance which later tested positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i>; <i>(ii)</i> such possession is not authorized by law as Pis-an himself admitted during the pre-trial;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and <i>(iii)</i> the prohibited drugs were uncovered from Pis-an's house which was a <i>prima facie</i> evidence of knowledge or <i>animus possidendi</i>. Verily, the factual findings of the CA affirming those of the RTC are binding upon this Court absent any showing that such findings are tainted with arbitrariness, capriciousness or palpable error.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In addition, the Court agrees that the police officers duly complied with the chain of custody rule under Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The Court, in <i>Aranas y Dimaala v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> declared that:<br><br><blockquote>[T]o establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime. As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires, inter alia, that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same. The law further requires that the said inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (a) if prior to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, a representative from the media AND the DOJ, and any elected public official; or (b) if after the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640, an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service OR the media. The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence." (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Records reveal that right after Pis-an was arrested, the police officers immediately took custody of the seized items and marked them right there and then. They also conducted the requisite inventory and photography in the presence of all three (3) insulating witnesses as required by R.A. No. 9165 prior to its amendment, namely: Brgy. Kagawan Dicen; media practitioner Gallarde; and DOJ representative Benlot. Thereafter, PO2 Calumba delivered the confiscated drugs to PCInsp. Llena for laboratory examination. Later, confirmatory tests on all 14 heat-sealed transparent plastic sachets would yield a positive finding for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride or more commonly known as <i>shabu</i>. Clearly, therefore, the chain of custody over the seized drugs remained unbroken as the recovery and proper handling of the <i>corpus delicti</i> were sufficiently shown.<br><br>Undeniably, Pis-an was caught in possession of 9.38 grams of <i>shabu</i> and the illegal possession of such quantity of dangerous drugs is punishable under Section 11, paragraph 2 (2), Article II of R.A. No. 9165, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(2) Imprisonment of twenty (20) years and one (1) day to life imprisonment and a fine ranging from Four hundred thousand pesos (P400,000.00) to Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00), if the quantities of dangerous drugs are five (5) grams or more but less than ten (10) grams of x x x methamphetamine hydrochloride or "<i>shabu</i>"[.]</blockquote><br><br>However, as succinctly pointed out by Justice Mario V. Lopez in his Reflections, the maximum penalty of life imprisonment may only be imposed when the crime of illegal possession was committed in the presence of two or more persons or in a social gathering pursuant to Section 13<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> of R.A. No, 9165. Here, since it was not shown Pis-an was caught possessing the dangerous drugs during a party, or at a social gathering or meeting, or in the proximate company of at least two persons, the maximum imposable penalty should be below life imprisonment which is currently pegged 40 years and 1 day.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, we modify the penalty imposed by the RTC, as affirmed by the CA. Since Pis-an was found to have been in illegal possession of 9.38 grams of <i>shabu</i>, he is meted the penalty of imprisonment ranging from 20 years and one day, as minimum, to 30 years, as maximum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Decision dated March 28, 2018 of the Court of Appeals-Cebu City in CA-G.R.

The four (4) links that should be established in the chain of custody of the confiscated item are as follows: <i>first</i>, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; <i>second</i>, the turnover of the seized illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; <i>third</i>, the turnover by the investigating officer of the same illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and fourth, the turnover and submission of the marked seized illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>These mandatory and strict requirements of the law are set in place as safeguards against the possible tampering, alteration or substitution of the seized drugs and to prevent other possible abuses by police officers because with "the very nature of anti-narcotics operations, the need for entrapment procedures, the use of shady characters as informants, the ease with which sticks of marijuana or grams of heroin can be planted in pockets of, or hands of unsuspecting provincial hicks, and the secrecy that inevitably shrouds all drug deals, the possibility of abuse is great."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In this case, the prosecution was able to prove all the links in the chain of custody.
