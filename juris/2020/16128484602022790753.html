In response, PSALM explained that the 2008 MAB was actually based on AO 402 and CSC Memorandum Circular No. 33. State Auditor Molina nonetheless proceeded to issue Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 2008-002 (2008) dated April 23, 2009 in the total amount of P5,702,517.42.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> PSALM sought a reconsideration but the same was returned to PSALM without action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On November 5, 2009, PSALM appealed to the COA-Office of the Cluster Director, Corporate Government Sector (CGS) - Cluster B.<br><br>Meanwhile, PSALM allegedly requested authority from the Office of the President for the retroactive grant of the following benefits to its officers and employees: 1) corporate performance-based incentive; and 2) medical assistance through purchase of prescription drugs and reimbursement of expenses for emergency and special cases.

Alagon affirmed the disallowance of the 2008 and 2009 expanded MABs in this amount of P5,702,517.42 and P5,586,999.60, respectively.<br><br>In both cases, COA-Cluster Director IV Alagon brought to fore that AO 402 only provided for the grant of annual medical check up for government employees. It specifically stated that the benefit was only for offices which had no existing program yet for free medical check up or supplementary medical allowance to its officers and employees over and above the Medicare benefits. The use of the disjunctive "or" meant the office may avail of one (1) benefit only, either a free medical check-up or supplementary medical allowance to its employees. An office may not avail of both benefits.<br><br>Records revealed, however, that PSALM already entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with Hi-Precision Diagnostic Center Inc. for an annual physical examination for its employees, including eighteen (18) physical and laboratory examinations. Thus, the additional grant for the purchase of prescription drugs and reimbursement expenses on emergency and special cases was in excess of what the law allowed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>True, the <i>last paragraph of Section 3, AO 402 authorizes the increase of benefits upon availability of funds, but the same must be construed to mean additional benefits parallel to the medical services alreacv enumerated therein pursuant to the principle of ejusdem generis, i.e.,</i> medical services pertaining only to physical examination and laboratory or diagnostic examinations. As it was, the bulk of the amounts paid to the officers and employees here referred not to these kinds of medical services but to items not parallel thereto such as the purchase of vitamins, dermatological services like acne surgery and facial treatments, and dental services like braces and retainers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <br><br>More, AO 402 provided for medical services to government employees only.

Records showed that PSALM's 2008 Corporate Operating Budget (COB) had an approved budget of P3,350,000.00 only. But the 2008 MAB which was sourced from this budget amounted to P5,702,517.42.20Too, the CSC did not even approve the 2008 MAB as a negotiated item in the Collective Negotiation Agreement (CNA).

Petitioners essentially assert:<br><br>(a) The expanded MAB was authorized by both AO 402 and CSC Memorandum Circular No. 33.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>(b Section 3 of AO 402 speaks of "<i>initial benefits"</i> for government employees,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[30]</sup></font>&nbsp; which&nbsp;&nbsp; benefits&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> "may&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp;&nbsp; increased&nbsp; upon&nbsp;&nbsp; availability&nbsp;&nbsp; of funds."</i><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[31]</sup></font> Hence, the expanded MABs are well within this proviso.<br><br>(c)&nbsp; The COA-CP's strict interpretation of AO 402 is a retrogressive appreciation of government issuances intended to protect and promote the rights and welfare of workers. It is contrary to the spirit, intent, and purpose of AO 402.&nbsp; Where the provision of the general welfare laws may be reasonably interpreted in two (2) different ways, one prejudicial and the other favorable to labor, the balance must be tilted in favor of labor. When liberally construed, the grant of supplementary medical allowance or medical benefits is left to the sound discretion of the agency's governing Board of Directors, which is in a better position to determine the benefits that would best address the health concerns of its employees, the allowable medical procedure and treatment, and the persons entitled thereto - all with the end purpose of maintaining the employees' work efficiency and effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp;&nbsp; short,&nbsp;&nbsp; PSALM&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; any&nbsp;&nbsp; other&nbsp;&nbsp; government&nbsp;&nbsp; owned&nbsp;&nbsp; or controlled corporation is not strictly limited to the benefits enumerated under Section 3 of AO 402.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>(d) On December 30,&nbsp; 2009,&nbsp; no&nbsp; less&nbsp; than the&nbsp; President of the Philippines approved its request for the retroactive grant of the expanded MAB to its employees.

In any event, Board Resolution Nos. 07-67 and 2008-1124-004 were approved by PSALM's Board of Directors which included members of the President's Cabinet, i.e., Secretary of Finance and Secretary of the Department of Budget and Management, who are the President's <i>alter egos</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>(e) PSALM officials and employees who, respectively, authorized the grant of, and received, the expanded MABs all acted in the honest belief that the same were due them in accordance with AO 402.

As it was, the expanded medical assistance benefits under Board Resolution Nos. 07-67 and 2008-1124-004 now include the purchase of emergency over the counter drugs, <i>purchase of prescription drugs, dental and optometric medications, reimbursement of expenses on emergency and special cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and reimbursement of diagnostic and consultation payment. </i>They also include as beneficiaries the employees' dependents (spouses, descendants, and ascendants) and members of the Board of Directors, Board Review Committee, and their respective alternates in the Health Program's coverage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In the implementation of the 2008 and 2009 MABs, PSALM, among others, approved the reimbursements for <i>dermatological services like acne surgery and facial treatments, and dental services like braces and retainers,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>PSALM claims that although these additional benefits are not diagnostic in nature, they are authorized under Section 3 of AO 402 which allows <i>"not only the grant of "initial" benefits but also an increase thereof upon availability of funds."</i><br><br>The argument does not persuade.<br><br>Section 1 of AO 402 ordains the establishment of an <i>annual medical check-up program</i> only. "Medical check-up" contemplates a procedure which a person goes through to find out his or her state of health, whether he or she is inflicted or is at risk of being inflicted with ailment or ailments as the case may be. This is precisely why AO 402 ordains a health program specifically including the following diagnostic procedures, i.e., physical examination, chest x-ray, routine urinalysis and fecalysis, complete blood count, and electrocardiogram. The COA-CP correctly held that this standard ought to be strictly followed by every GOCC not only in the initial grant of medical benefits but also in any subsequent increase thereof upon availability of funds, thus:<br><blockquote>It is very clear that the medical benefit extended under A.O. 402 is <b>a limited benefit confined to a medical check-up program</b> consisting of procedures that are strictly diagnostic. Nothing in A.O. 402 refers to a <b>prescription drug benefit, a right to reimbursement for hospitalization, </b>or indeed for any procedure or regimen that treats rather than diagnoses an illness. Thus, when Section 2 of A.O. No. 402 says that a GOCC "shall also establish a similar program for their employees," it is clear that the "similar program" refers strictly to a "medical check-up" program, since the A.O. unequivocally establishes nothing more.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[47]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>While it is true that Section 3 allows the GOCCs to increase the initial grant of medical benefits to these employees, the increase depends on <i>availability of funds. </i>As for the 2008 MAB, however, petitioners have not refuted the finding of the COA-CP that PSALM's 2008 Corporate Operating Budget from which the 2008 MAB was sourced had an approved allocation of P3,350,000.00 only, way below the total P5,702,517.00 disbursement for the expanded benefits under Board Resolution No. 07-67.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[48]</sup></font><br><br>In any event, we refer back to the expanded medical assistance benefits granted to PSALM employees in 2008 and 2009 which went beyond the diagnostic procedures specified by AO 402 and PSALM Board Resolution No. 06-46. They even include the purchase of over the counter drugs, prescription drugs, payment of consultation fees, reimbursement of expenses in emergency and special cases and situations, optometric procedures, dental procedures like retainers and braces, and dermatological laser treatments. Notably, petitioners themselves cannot point to any specific provisions of AO 402 or even Resolution Nos. 07-67 and 2008-1124-004 which supposedly grant these benefits. As in fact, there is none. On this score, we quote with concurrence the COA-CP's relevant disquisition:<br><blockquote>xxx But considering that A.O. 402 strictly refers to a "medical check up program" and not a more expanded health services plan, any increased benefits allowed upon the availability of funds must also pertain to diagnostic procedures similar to those enumerated in Section 3. If the interpretation of Petitioners were to be sustained, a cash-flushed GOCC would be free at will to expand benefits x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote>While the COA-CP concedes that the initial medical assistance benefits extended to the employees of the GOCCs may be augmented under Section 3 of AO 402, these augmented benefits must conform with the principle of ejusdem generis: "where a general word or phrase follows an enumeration of particular and specific words of the same class or where the latter follow the former, the general word or phrase is to be construed to include, or to be restricted to persons, things or cases akin to, resembling, or of the same kind or class as those specifically mentioned."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The purpose is to give effect to both the particular and general words, by treating the particular words as indicating the class and the general words as including all that is embraced in said class, although not specifically named by the particular words. For if the lawmaking body intended the general terms to be used in their unrestricted sense, it would have not made an enumeration of particular subjects but would have used only general terms.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In this light, the COA-CP argues that the purchase of over the counter drugs, prescription drugs, payment of consultation fees, reimbursement of expenses on emergency and special cases and situations, optometric procedures, dental procedures like retainers and braces, and dermatological laser treatments under the 2008 and 2009 MABs sharply depart from the principle of ejusdem generis pertaining to the category of diagnostic procedures granted under Board Resolution Nos. 07-67 and 2008-1124-004.<br><br>Surely, optometric procedures, dental procedures like retainers and braces, and dermatological laser treatments are <b><i>non-diagnostic but more of aesthetic or enhancement procedures.</i></b><br><br>The COA-CP, therefore, correctly affirmed the disallowance of these benefits for lack of legal basis.<br><br><b><i>The persons covered by<br>Medical Check-Up Program<br>under AO 402</i></b><br><br>The health program which AO 402 espouses is <b>intended exclusively for government employees. </b>The Whereas Clause of AO 402 bears this intent:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREAS</b>, pursuant to Section 5 of P.D.

What is not included is deemed excluded. <i>Exchisio unios est exclusio alterius.</i><br><br>But as worded, Board Resolution No. 07-67 extended the medical assistance benefits not only to PSALM's plantilla officers but to their so called qualified dependents as well, thus:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREAS, </b>elaborating on the purchase of prescription drugs, it was explained that only Plantilla personnel <b>and their qualified dependents</b> shall be entitled. The maximum availment for each personnel covered shall not exceed PhP25,000.00 for each year. This entitlement is non-cumulative and strictly non-convertible to cash. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Verily, therefore, the grant here of the expanded medical assistance benefits did not only exceed the benefits authorized under AO 402, but also the intended beneficiaries. The inclusion of these beneficiaries, too, is devoid of legal basis.<br><br><b><i>Petitioners' other arguments</i></b><br><br>Petitioners next argue that former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo approved their request for the retroactive grant of the additional benefits borne in the expanded MABs. For this purpose, it submitted to the COA-CP an alleged confidential document from the Malacanan Palace purportedly bearing former President Arroyo's approval. According to petitioners, with the President's approval, no less, PSALM's authority to grant the expanded benefits in question may no longer be assailed. Other government agencies must allegedly respect the President's approval.<br><br>The argument must fail.<br><br>For one, both COA-Cluster Director Alagon and the COA-CP noted that the so-called confidential document <b><i>did not bear</i></b> President Arroyo's signature. It only reflected the word "approved" without the President's signature affixed thereto.

In any case, we agree with the COA-CP that it is not the President's signature, but AO 402 which dictates whether the 2008 and 2009 exapanded MABs were legally authorized.<br><br>Petitioners further invoke the doctrine of operative fact vis-a-vis Board Resolution Nos. 07-67 and 2008-1124-004 when they authorized the expanded medical assistance benefits.<br><br>The docrine of operative fact nullifies the effects of an unconstitutional law, executive act, or similar issuances by recognizing that the existence of a statute prior to a determination of unconstitutionality is an operative fact and may have consequences that cannot always be ignored.

The presence of any of these factors in a case may tend to uphold the presumption of good faith in the performance of official functions accorded to the officers involved, which must always be examined relative to the circumstances attending therein.<br></blockquote><div align="center">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><blockquote>x x x the evolution of the "good faith rule" that excused the passive recipients in good faith from return began in Blaquera (1998) and NEA (2002), where the good faith of both officers and payees were determinative of their liability to return the disallowed benefits - the good faith of all parties resulted in excusing the return altogether in Blaquera, and the bad faith of officers resulted in the return by all recipients in NEA. The rule morphed in Casal (2006) to distinguish the liability of the payees and the approving and/or certifying officers for the return of the disallowed amounts. In MIAA (2012) and <i>TESDA</i> (2014), the rule was further nuanced to determine the extent of what must be returned by the approving and/or certifying officers as the government absorbs what has been paid to payees in good faith. This was the state of jurisprudence then which led to the ruling in Silang (2015) which followed the rule in Casal that payees, as passive recipients, should not be held liable to refund what they had unwittingly received in good faith, while relying on the cases of Lumayna and Quenibin.<br></blockquote><blockquote>The history of the rule as shown evinces that the original formulation of the "good faith rule" excusing the return by payees based on good faith was not intended to be at the expense of approving and/or certifying officers. The application of this judge made rule of excusing the payees and then placing upon the officers the responsibility to refund amounts they did not personally receive, commits an inadvertent injustice.<br></blockquote><div align="center">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><blockquote>The COA similarly applies the principle of solutio indebiti to require the return from payees regardless of good faith, xxx<br><br><div align="center">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>xxx Notably, in situations where officers are covered by Section 38 of the Administrative Code either by presumption or by proof of having acted in good faith, in the regular performance of their official duties, and with the diligence of a good father of a family, payees remain liable for the disallowed amount unless the Court excuses the return. For the same reason, any amounts allowed to be retained by payees shall reduce the solidary liability of officers found to have acted in bad faith, malice, and gross negligence. In this regard, Justice Bernabe coins the term "net disallowed amount" to refer to the total disallowed amount minus the amounts excused to be returned by the payees. Likewise, Justice Leonen is of the same view that the officers held liable have a solidary obligation only to the extent of what should be refunded and this does not include the amounts received by those absolved of liability. In short, the net disallowed amount shall be solidarity shared by the approving/authorizing officers who were clearly shown to have acted in bad faith, with malice, or were grossly negligent.<br></blockquote><blockquote>Consistent with the foregoing, the Court shares the keen observation of Associate Justice Henri Jean Paul B. Inting that payees generally have no participation in the grant and disbursement of employee benefits, but their liability to return is based on solutio indebiti as a result of the mistake in payment. Save for collective negotiation agreement incentives carved out in the sense that employees are not considered passive recipients on account of their participation in the negotiated incentives x x x payees are generally held in good faith for lack of participation, with participation limited to "accepting] the same with gratitude, confident that they richly deserve such benefits."<br><br><div align="center">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>To recount, xxx, retention by passive payees of disallowed amounts received in good faith has been justified on payee's "lack of participation in the disbursement." However, this justification is unwarranted because a payee's mere receipt of funds not being part of the performance of his official functions still equates to him unduly benefiting from the disallowed transaction; this gives rise to his liability to return.<br></blockquote><br><div align="center">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br><blockquote>x x x To a certain extent, therefore, payees always do have an indirect "involvement" and "participation" in the transaction where the benefits they received are disallowed because the accounting recognition of the release of funds and their mere receipt thereof results in the debit against government funds in the agency's account and a credit in the payee's favor.

This, as well, is the foundation of the rules of return that the Court now promulgates.<br><br>In the same case, the Court summarized the rules regarding the liability of the certifying and approving officers and recipient employees, thus:<br><blockquote>E. <i>The Rules on Return</i><br><br>In view of the foregoing discussion, the Court pronounces:<br><br>1.&nbsp; If a Notice of Disallowance is set aside by the Court, no return shall be required from any of the persons held liable therein.<br><br>2.

Liability of certifying and approving officers</b></i><br><br>Section 38, Chapter 9, Book I, of the Administrative Code expressly states that the civil liability of a public officer for acts done in the performance of his or her official duty arises only upon a clear showing that he or she performed such duty with bad faith, malice, or gross negligence. This is because of the presumption that official duty is regularly performed.<br><br>Malice or bad faith implies a conscious and intentional design to do a wrongful act for a dishonest purpose or moral obliquity.55 Gross neglect of duty or gross negligence, on the other hand, refers to negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, or by acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but wilfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to the consequences, insofar as other persons may be affected. It is the omission of that care that even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to give to their own property. It denotes a flagrant and culpable refusal or unwillingness of a person to perform a duty. In cases involving public officials, gross negligence occurs when a breach of duty is flagrant and palpable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Here, it cannot be said that petitioning members and officers of the Board acted with malice and bad faith in approving the grant of the benefits later disallowed. As they claimed, they all acted in the honest belief that the same were due them and the PSALM employees under AO 402. There is also nothing on record to lead us to conclude that they, indeed, granted the excess benefits with a dishonest purpose.<br><br>Nevertheless, we hold that the approving and certifying officers are guilty of gross negligence.<br><br>To reiterate, the provisions of AO 402 are clear and unequivocal. Its singular intention is to grant free annual medical check-up program to government employees. It does not imply in any way the grant of other health benefits outside the free annual medical check-up. It also clearly limited its scope to the government employees themselves. Nowhere in the provisions of the law were the benefits extended to the dependents of the government employees. The members and officers of the Board of Directors, however, carelessly expanded the coverage of the benefits without thought about and without harmonizing the same with the provisions of AO 402. Worse, they expanded the benefits not only once, but twice - in 2008 and in 2009.<br><br>More, in <b><i>Madera, </i></b>the Court adopted Justice Leonen's proposed badges for the determination of whether an authorizing officer exercised the diligence of a good father of a family, to wit:<br><blockquote>x x x (1) <b>Certificates of Availability of Funds</b> pursuant to Section 40 of the Administrative Code, (2) In-house or Department of Justice legal opinion, (3) that there is no precedent allowing a similar case in jurisprudence, (4) that it is traditionally practiced within the agency and<b> no prior disallowance has been issued, </b>[or] (5) with regard the question of law, that there is a reasonable textual interpretation on its legality. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Here, COA-Cluster Director IV Alagon aptly observed that PSALM's 2008 Corporate Operating Budget for 2008 from which the MAB was sourced was only P3,350,000.00. As it was, however, the 2008 MAB amounted to P5,702,517.42,57 clearly in excess of the available funds. But it did not deter the members and officers of the Board of Directors from continuing to grant the expanded benefits.<br><br>More, on January 22, 2009, prior to the full implementation of the 2009 expanded MAB, State Auditor Molina already served PSALM her Audit Observation Memorandum No. 2008-06 stating that the expanded benefits&nbsp;&nbsp; included&nbsp;&nbsp; in the 2008 MAB&nbsp;&nbsp; lacked legal and factual bases.<br><br>Thereafter, State Auditor Molina issued ND No. 2008-002 (2008) dated April 23, 2009.58 From that point onward, the concerned members and officers of the Board of Directors should have already desisted from granting the exapanded benefits under the 2009 MAB. Standing alone, the prior disallowance of the grant under the 2008 MAB may not suffice to negate the presumption of regularity in favor of petitioners, but taken with the other badges, indubitably conveys the presence of gross negligence.<br><br>Indeed, the factors, as heretofore discussed, clearly support the finding that the members and officers of the Board of Directors who approved and authorized the grant of the expanded benefits are liable to return the disallowed amounts. Pursuant to Section 43, Chapter V, Book VI of the 1987 Administrative Code and <b><i>Madera,</i></b> their liability is joint and several for the disallowed amounts received by the individual employees.<br><br><i><b>ii. Liability of the recipient employees</b></i><br><br>As clarified in <b><i>Madera, </i></b>the general rule is that recipient employees must be held liable to return disallowed payments on ground of solutio indebiti or unjust enrichment as a result of the mistake in payment. Under the principle of solutio indebiti, if something is received when there is no right to demand it, and it was unduly delivered through mistake, the obligation to return it arises.<br><br><i><b>Madera,</b></i> however, decrees as well that restitution may be excused in the following instances:<br><blockquote>xxx the jurisprudential standard for the exception to apply is that the amounts received by the payees constitute disallowed benefits that were genuinely given in consideration of services rendered (or to be rendered)" negating the application of unjust enrichment and the <i>solutio indebiti</i> principle. As examples, Justice Bernabe explains that these disallowed benefits may be in the nature of performance incentives, productivity pay, or merit increases that have not been authorized by the Department of Budget and Management as an exception to the rule on standardized salaries. In addition to this proposed exception standard, Justice Bernabe states that the Court may also determine in the proper case <i>bona fide </i>exceptions, depending on the purpose and nature of the amount disallowed. These proposals are well-taken.<br></blockquote><blockquote>Moreover, the Court may also determine in a proper case other circumstances that warrant excusing the return despite the application of <i>solutio indebiti,</i> such as when<b><i> undue prejudice</i></b> will result from requiring payees to return or where social justice or humanitarian considerations are attendant. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Unfortunately for PSALM's employees, none of the exceptions are present in this case. Foremost, the expanded benefits under the 2008 ar. a 2009 MABs were not given in relation to the employees' functions, nor were they given as part of performance incentives, productivity pay, or merit increases. Also, it cannot be said that undue prejudice will result in requiring the recipient employees to return the disallowed amount. On the contrary, it is the Government that would be prejudiced if the recipients will not return what they unduly received. Social justice or any humanitarian considerations also do not call for the grant to the employees of expanded benefits in the form of dermatological and dental treatments to their dependents. In short, there was total lack of basis and justification for the grant of the expanded benefits included in the 2008 and 2009 MABs.<br><br>Verily, therefore, the employees must be held liable to return the amounts that they and their dependents, if any, respectively received. As earlier discussed, the approving and certifying members and officers of the Board of Directors are jointly and severally liable for the disallowed amounts received by the individual employees.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the assailed Decision No. 2014-036 dated March 5, 2014, Resolution dated January 26, 2015, and Decision No. 2012-270 dated December 28, 2012 of the Commission on Audit - Commission Proper are <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION,</b> <i>viz</i>.:<br><br>1.&nbsp; The PSALM employees&nbsp; are&nbsp; individually&nbsp; liable to return the amounts which they and their dependents, if any, respectively received pursuant to the 2008 and 2009 expanded MABs;<br><br>2.&nbsp; The PSALM officers and members of the Board of Directors who took part&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; approval&nbsp; of the&nbsp; unauthorized&nbsp; benefits&nbsp; under&nbsp; Board Resolution Nos. 07-67 and 2008-1224-004 are jointly and solidarity liable for the return of the disallowed amounts in connection with the 2008 and 2009 expanded MABs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Peralta, C.J., Perlas-Bernabe, Leonen, Caguioa, Gesmundo, Hernando, Carandang, Inting,&nbsp; Lopez, Delos Santos,</i> and <i>Gaerlan, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Zalameda, </i>on official leave<i>.<br></i></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Baltazar-Padilla, </i>on leave.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><br><br><div align="center"><b>N O T I C E O F J U D G M E N T</b><br></div><br><b>Sirs/Mesdames:<br><br>Please take notice that on <u>September 22, 2020</u> a Decision, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled cases, the original of which was received by this Office on January 8,2021 at 2:50 p.m.<br><br></b><div align="right"><b>Very truly yours,<br><br>(Sgd.)
