Thereafter, pre-trial and trial ensued.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p> During trial, the prosecution presented: (1) AAA; and (2) Dr. Crizalda Abrigo-Peralta (Dr. Abrigo-Peralta). The CA summarized the version of the prosecution as follows: </p><blockquote> <p>x x x On February 10, 1995, when [AAA] was 15 years old, she went with two of her friends to a <i>peryahan</i> in [Brgy. RTD, XYZ,] Zambales. When her friends went home, she was left alone in the <i>peryahan</i> playing games with bets and promenading when [accused­-appellant], an employee of the <i>peryahan</i> and who she has not met before, introduced himself to her. During her direct examination, she narrated that [accused-appellant] invited her to his place, and that he talked to her in a pleasant manner and she thought that the intention of [accused-appellant] was just to befriend her. [Accused-appellant] forced her to walk with him for more than an hour to his place at [Brgy. NBL, BLT, Zambales] then brought her to a <i>sapaan</i>, or a creek. [Accused-appellant] was holding something which looked like a knife which he pointed at her. [Accused-­appellant] then raped her by inserting his private part to her private part. She cried because of too much pain. After that, her parents saw her in the place where it happened and they took her to the police. Thereafter, her mother accompanied her to the hospital because she was traumatized by the incident. She presented a Medico-legal Certificate dated February 13, 1995. </p> <p> During her cross-examination, she averred that [accused-appellant] was just strolling around the <em>peryahan </em>when, without talking to her, he kissed her and forced her to go with him by threatening her with bodily harm. [Accused-appellant] used a weapon which looked like a stick or a ballpen. Although there were many people at the <i>peryahan</i>, she did not scream, shout nor do any thin g to alarm other people around her because she was already afraid. She could no longer recall at what time they left [RTD] or arrived in [NBL], or for how long and for how far they walked. She likewise did not resist [accused-appellant] while walking to [NBL] because she was taken by fear. She [could not] say if she was taken to a house in [NBL], but they met a few people. She denied being brought to a <i>sapa</i> or a creek. She also [could not] say that the alleged attack happened in a house; in fact she [could not] recall in what area she was raped, but it was a vacant lot and it was dark. [Accused-appellant] forced her, kissed her while holding the stick, and then inserted his penis in her private part. It was at the place of [accused-appellant] where her mother found her.</p> <p> On re-direct examination, private complainant stated that at the time of the incident, she was small and thin, while [accused-appellant] was older and bigger than her.</p> <p> The prosecution also formally offered private complainant's <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> which she executed on February 13, 1995. She narrated therein that on the night of February 10, 1995, while she was on her way to a <i>sayawan</i> in [RTD, XYZ,] Zambales, [accused-appellant] pointed a ballpen-like knife at her, dragged her to a field and they passed by [AGH]. [Accused-appellant then made her ride a tricycle until they reached [STG, BLT,] Zambales. After that, [accused-appellant] made her walk until they reached a place beside a river in [NBL, BLT,] Zambales where [s]he was raped by [accused-appellant]. [Accused-appellant] held both of private complainant's hands, removed her shorts and panties. He then pulled down his pants and inserted his penis to her private part. Because a ballpen-like knife [was] pointed at her, she just followed [accused-appellant] out of fear. She did not shout while they were riding the tricycle because [accused-appellant] warned her not to shout, otherwise he [would] kill her.</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> Dr. Crizalda Abrigo-Peralta appeared before the RTC and identified the Medico-Legal Certificate dated February 19, 1995 of AAA that she issued. The Medico-Legal Certificate states that there was redness and swelling around the vaginal canal which [could] be caused by trauma, tension and pressure. The vaginal canal was also positive for blood clot, meaning that there was something that entered inside the vaginal canal that caused the bleeding, specially that she was a child. She found the hymen to be intact, and that there was no laceration. Dr. Abrigo-Peralta explained that the hymen's elasticity, especially since the private complainant was young at that time, allowed for slight penetration without causing laceration. In her examination of private complainant, her hymen was intact but inside the vaginal canal, there were blood clots which could indicate that there was rubbing of some foreign object inside.</p> <p> On cross-examination, Dr. Abrigo-Peralta negated any hematoma or bruises on the body of the private complainant, or any spermatozoa in her vagina. She also stated that the erythema or redness in private complainant's vaginal canal could also be caused by any foreign body like bottles or vibrators.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> On the other hand, the defense presented the sole testimony of accused-appellant, who alleged that: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x [I]n 1995, he was 18 years old and residing with his parents and sibling at [Brgy. LPB, BLT,] Zambales. At that time, he was working at a <i>peryahan </i>in [Brgy. RTD, XYZ,] Zambales, which was in operation in the place for about two (2) weeks during the fiesta. He courted private complainant for a week before he brought her to his house to introduce [her] to his parents. They left [Brgy. RTD] at about 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock in the evening. At that time, private complainant had not yet accepted him as her boyfriend. He did not know her age. When they reached his house, his parents were awake and he was scolded. Private complainant stayed in their house the whole evening until morning but they did not sleep. [Accused-appellant], his parents and private complainant stayed awake the whole evening just sitting outside their house. His father told him that he [would] bring private complainant home in the morning because her parents might already be looking for her. Between 1995 to 2012 when he was arrested, he claimed to be just in their place in [Brgy. LPB] but he did not receive any notice for him to appear before the [RTC].</p> <p> His Judicial Affidavit dated June 8, 2015 was also offered as part of his testimony. He narrated therein that he met private complainant at a<i> peryahan </i>in [Brgy. RTD, XYZ,] Zambales. He worked at the<i> peryahan</i> while private complainant [was] a bettor who had been playing at the <i>peryahan</i> for about a week. Two days after he saw her, [accused-appellant] asked private complainant if he could court her, to which she acceded. Almost a week later, or on February 10, 1995, he asked her if she wanted to come with him to his place to meet his father. Private complainant agreed. Private complainant waited for [accused-appellant] until the <i>peryahan</i> closed around 11 o'clock PM or 12 o'clock midnight. x x x [Accused-appellant] woke his parents, but only his father woke up. He told his father that there was a girl from [Brgy. RTD] with him. His father scolded him and told him that the girl's parents would surely look for her. His father sat in front of [accused-appellant] and private complainant and watched them until morning. His father told private complainant to go home in the morning because her parents would look for her. Nothing happened between [accused-appellant] and private complainant because his father was watching them. The following day, private complainant asked if there [was] a river where she could take a bath. [Accused-appellant] then took her to a nearby falls about 30 meters away, accompanied by his younger brother and they swam. After only five minutes in the water, people arrived and invited them to the barangay but [accused-appellant] was taken to the police station at the Municipal Hall of [XYZ]. The police told him that be was being charged with rape. x x x <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the RTC</b> </p><p> In its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated September 30, 2015, the RTC convicted accused-appellant of the crime of Rape. The dispositive portion of the said Decision stated: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, foregoing considered, the Com1 finds Noel Dolandolan GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole and is ordered to pay Php50,000.00 as moral damages, Php50,000.00 as civil indemnity and Php20,000.00 as exemplary damages. </p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The RTC held that although the prosecution failed to establish the crime of Kidnapping, it successfully proved the crime of Rape through force and intimidation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p><p> While there were contradictions in AAA's written statement in relation to her testimony, the RTC held that said variance did not alter the essential fact that AAA was raped. Further, the claim of rape was supported by the medical records, which accused-appellant failed to sufficiently refute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p> Finally, the RTC held that while the defense presented a certificate of live birth stating that accused-appellant was born on May 29, 1978, another certification was issued indicating that accused-appellant was actually born on September 15, 1972 and as such, was already 23 years old at the time of the commission of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p> Aggrieved, accused-appellant appealed to the CA.</p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the CA</b> </p><p> The CA affirmed the RTC's Decision but increased the award of exemplary damages to P30,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The CA held that although there were glaring inconsistencies between AAA's <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> and her open court testimony, AAA never wavered in her claim that accused-appellant inserted his private part into her private part after pointing a ballpen-like knife at her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Further, the CA held that the inconsistencies in AAA's testimony (1) referred only to inconsequential matters and (2) were justified, considering that 18 long years had lapsed between the time the incident occurred and the time AAA was presented in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> Hence, the instant appeal. </p><p align="center"> <b>Issue</b> </p><p> Whether the RTC and the CA erred in convicting accused-appellant of the crime of Rape.</p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> The Court finds merit in the appeal. The prosecution failed to prove the guilt of accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt.</p><p> In <i>People v.

Thus, the rule is that when a woman claims that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been committed and that if her testimony meets the crucible test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof</u>. However, the courts are not bound to treat the testimony of the victim as gospel truth. <u><b>Judges a re duty-bound to subject her testimony to the most rigid and careful scrutiny lest vital details which could affect the outcome of the case be overlooked or cast aside.</b></u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The Court has held that "when the issue is the credibility of witnesses and of their testimonies, the trial court is generally deemed to have been in a better position to observe their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> However, appellate courts may review the factual findings of the trial court when the lower court overlooked certain facts of substance and value<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> or when the lower court's findings of fact are contradicted by evidence on record.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p> In <i>People v. Bermas</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the Court discussed the peculiar nature of Rape charges in this wise: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x [I]n rape cases, the <u>accused may be convicted on the basis of the lone, uncorroborated testimony of the rape victim, provided that her testimony is <b>clear, convincing, and otherwise consistent with human nature</b></u>. This is a matter best assigned to the trial court which had the first-hand opportunity to hear the testimonies of the witnesses and observe their demeanor, conduct, and attitude during cross-examination. Hence, the trial court's findings carry very great weight and substance.</p> <p> However, it is equally true that in reviewing rape cases, the Court observes the following guiding principles:</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">an accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but <b><u>more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove</u></b>; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime where <u><b>only two persons arc usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution</b></u>;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">the e<b><u>vidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits</u></b>, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p><u>This must be so as the guilt of an accused must be <b>proved beyond reasonable doubt</b>. Before he is convicted, there should be<b> moral certainty </b> — a certainty that convinces and satisfies the reason and conscience of those who are to act upon it.</u> Absolute guarantee of guilt is not demanded by the law to convict a person of a criminal charge but there must, at least, be moral certainty on each element essential to constitute the offense and on the responsibility of the offender. Proof beyond reasonable doubt is meant to be that, all things given, the mind of the judge can rest at ease concerning its verdict. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> In light of the foregoing principles and after a careful review of the records and transcripts of stenographic notes of the instant case, the Court believes, and accordingly holds, that there are substantial discrepancies between AAA's <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated February 13, 1995 (<i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>) and her testimony, both during her direct examination and her cross-examination, which discrepancies were never reconciled, explained, corrected, or justified by the prosecution. As a result, the Court doubts the credibility of AAA. Thus, the guilt of accused-appellant has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><i>The discrepancies as to circumstances leading up to the alleged rape are substantial</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>In AAA's <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>, she stated that accused-appellant threatened her with a ballpen knife while she was on her way to a <i>sayawan</i> and transported her <i>via</i> tricycle to the purported scene of the crime, <i>viz.</i>: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">08.</div></td> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">T</div></td> <td><div align="justify">-</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Isalaysay mo nga kung paano ka hinalay ni Noel Dolandolan?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><div align="justify">S</div></td> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">-</div></td> <td width="91%"><div align="justify">Ganito po iyon, habang ako ay papunta <b><u>sa may sayawan</u></b> sa [RTD], [XYZ], Zambales ay <b><u>tinutukan ako ni Noel Dolandolan ng isang di baleng ball pen na kutsilyo</u></b>.

After all, errorless statements and testimonies cannot be expected, especially when she is recounting details of a harrowing experience. In accordance with human nature and experience, there can be honest inconsistencies on minor and trivial matters, but these serve to strengthen rather than destroy her credibility, especially when the crime is shocking to the conscience and numbing to the senses. Hence, she is ordinarily not deemed discredited by such discrepancies — for example, whether or not she was able to buy ice before the rape, or whether the accused held both of her hands or only one of them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> While inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony do not necessarily impair her credibility, "for said inconsistencies to be dismissed so as to give full credence to the alleged victim, <b><u>they must be minor, trivial and as far as practicable, few and far between</u></b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p> In the instant case, the transcripts of stenographic notes unequivocally show that AAA gave conflicting accounts in her <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>, direct examination, and cross-examination about the circumstances surrounding the purported rape, specifically as regards: (1) where she met accused-appellant; (2) the circumstances surrounding said meeting; (3) the circumstances leading up to the alleged rape; (4) the place of the alleged rape; and (5) the place where she was eventually found. The allegation that AAA was threatened at knife-point while on her way to a dance (<i>sayawan</i>) is completely inconsistent with the claim that accused-appellant befriended AAA in a carnival (<i>peryahan</i>) and invited her to his house. Similarly, the categorical statement that AAA was raped near a creek or<i> sapaan</i> is completely inconsistent with the statement that she was raped in a dark vacant lot, which statements are inconsistent with her other statement that she did not know where she was raped.</p><p> Contrary to the findings of the RTC and the CA therefore, the discrepancies in AAA's testimony, taken as a whole, cannot be considered minor or trivial. She gave manifestly contradictory accounts of the circumstances surrounding the purported rape and forgot many other details. As a result, the Court cannot help but wonder whether AAA's recollection and narration is truthful or even reliable. This constitutes material doubt as to the credibility of AAA and the guilt of accused-appellant.</p><p> Worse, the prosecution never even attempted to explain, reconcile, or justify the inconsistencies. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Substantial inconsistencies were never reconciled nor justified</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>While the Court recognizes that a "truth-telling witness is not always expected to give an error-free testimony, considering the lapse of time and treachery of human memory"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the prosecution bears the burden of reconciling and explaining any lapses, errors, or inconsistencies in said testimony, in accordance with the principle that the "evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p> In this instant case, the prosecution never bothered to explain or reconcile the evident inconsistencies in AAA's testimony.

Unfortunately, the Court cannot entertain "what-ifs" when the life and liberty of a person is at stake certainly, as "[i]t is not proper to torture the minds of the members of this Court by placing them in the trying position of running the risk of convicting an innocent man, all because of the prosecution's failure to do its duty of gathering evidence to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p><p> The prosecution was remiss in its duty and failed to sufficiently explain, reconcile, or justify the many substantial inconsistencies in AAA's testimony. As such, and given the particular nature of a charge of Rape, <i>i.e</i>., that the court is often called upon to determine the innocence or guilt of an accused based solely on the conflicting testimony of two people, the Court is constrained to acquit accused-appellant on the basis of reasonable doubt. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><i>The prosecution must establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt based on the strength of its own evidence</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The Court, in <i>People v. Lagramada</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> explained: </p><blockquote> <p> In a criminal prosecution, the law always presumes that the defendant is not guilty of any crime whatsoever, and this presumption stands until it is overcome by competent and credible proof. Where two conflicting probabilities arise from the evidence, the one compatible with the presumption of innocence will be adopted. It is therefore incumbent upon the prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused with moral certainty or beyond reasonable doubt as demanded by law.</p> <p> When a person cries rape, society reacts with sympathy for the victim, admiration for her bravery in seeking retribution for the crime committed against her, and condemnation for the accused. However, being interpreters of the law and dispensers of justice, judges must look at each rape charge sans the above proclivities and deal with it with caution and circumspection. Judges must free themselves of the natural tendency to be overprotective of every girl or woman decrying her defilement and demanding punishment for the abuser. While they ought to be cognizant of the anguish and humiliation the rape victim goes through as she demands justice, they should equally bear in mind that their responsibility is to render justice in accordance with law.</p> <p> Hence, accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved. <b><u>Before the accused in a criminal case may be convicted, the evidence must be strong enough to overcome the presumption of innocence and to exclude every hypothesis except that of the guilt of the defendant. If the inculpatory facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his guilt, then the evidence does not pass the test of moral certainty and will not suffice to support a conviction.</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> As already explained, AAA's many contradictory statements, which the prosecution never bothered to explain or justify, raise material doubt on AAA's credibility. In finding for accused-appellant, the Court makes no pronouncement as to the truth or falsity of AAA's claims. It considers only the <em>slightest possibility</em> that the facts are not as the complainant claims. Under the Constitution, however, this <em>possibility</em> — no matter how rare or unlikely — constitutes more than sufficient basis for an acquittal. This is what it means to be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, beyond reasonable doubt. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, in view of the foregoing, the appeal is hereby <strong>GRANTED</strong>.
