Aisa B. Musa-Barrat (Atty. Musa-Barrat), yielded a cash shortage of PI 64,520.00. This represents unremitted collections for the Judiciary Development Fund (JDF), Special Allowance for Judiciary Fund (SAJF), Mediation Fund (MF), Fiduciary Fund (FF), Legal Research Fund (LRF) and Land Registration Authority (LRA).<br><br></li><li> All official receipts (ORs) requisitioned from the Property Division of the Office of Administrative Services (OAS), OCA, were duly accounted for except for three booklets with serial numbers 86677451 -86677500 and 6538201-6538300 which were not presented for examination. As of September 30, 2018, 310 out of 437 booklets had been utilized, with 118 booklets unused.<br><br></li><li> An examination of the Undertakings of Cash Bond Deposit, Release Orders from Detention and original ORs show discrepancies in the data shown in the ORs. The Financial Audit Team found that in some instances when a cash bond was posted, the court only issued an Undertaking of Cash Bond Deposit in lieu of the corresponding OR. In other cases, the OR numbers were falsified while the receipts were tampered. These irregularities resulted in a total amount of P2,342,500.00 in unremitted and un-receipted cash bond collections. These irregularities occurred between 2014 and January 2017 during the incumbency of Atty. Zalsos-Uychiat as Clerk of Court. However, Ms. Del Rosario admitted to tampering and falsifying some of these receipts.</li></ol></blockquote>In view of this discrepancy, the following amounts were restituted by the respective court employees:<br><br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="361" valign="top"><p align="center"><strong> Accountable Officer</strong></p></td><td width="351" valign="top"><p align="center"><strong> Amount Restituted</strong></p></td><td width="386" valign="top"><p align="center"><strong> Date of </strong><strong> Restitution</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6" width="361" valign="top"><p align="center"> Ms. Abba Marie B.

No supporting document for said STF withdrawals was attached to the file copies of the court's monthly financial reports.<br><br></li><li> As to the JDF Collections, Atty.

She likewise admitted that she failed to issue ORs for some bonds because of her failure to replenish the funds therefor. She also asserted that she was not well acquainted with the process of issuance of receipts.<br><br><i>Explanation ofAtty. Zalsos-Uychiat</i><br><br>Atty. Zalsos-Uychiat executed an Affidavit dated December 13, 2018, claiming that she had no knowledge of the irregular practices in the court a quo as well as her surprise that the Financial Audit Team arrived at such findings. She asserted that she delegated all fiscal matters to Ms. Del Rosario, believing in good faith that the latter was performing such functions properly. As proof of her innocence, Atty. Zalsos-Uychiat provided screenshots of Ms. Del Rosario's text messages confessing to the irregularities that were discovered by the Financial Audit Team.<br><br><i>Explanation ofAtty. Musa-Barrat</i><br><br>Atty. Musa-Barrat explained that because she was new to her job, she was not able to submit the monthly reports on time. She alleged that on her first day as Clerk of Court a bond in the amount of P200,000.00 was posted by an accused, which amount she was not able to deposit because the bank closed early. She kept the said amount in her bag for safekeeping but the same was stolen when she had dinner in a fastfood restaurant in Iligan City. She was unable to restitute the said amount on time because it took months before she received her initial salary. As to her other lapses, Atty. Musa-Barrat acknowledged the same and sought the Court's forgiveness.<br><br>On July 1, 2020, the OCA issued a Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> adopting the findings of the Financial Audit Team and recommending the following disciplinary actions to be taken:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> [T]his report be <b>DOCKETED</b> as a regular administrative matter against the following personnel:</li></ol><ol type="a"><li> <b>Ms. ABBA MARIE B.

In ascertaining the intention of a person charged with dishonesty, consideration must be taken not only of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the act committed by the respondent, but also of his state of mind at the time the offense was committed, the time he might have had at his disposal for the purpose of meditating on the consequences of his act, and the degree of reasoning he could have had at that moment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Gross dishonesty on the part of an employee of the Judiciary is a very serious offense that must be severely punished.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Lastly, neglect of duty can be classified into simple neglect and gross neglect. Simple neglect of duty means the failure of an employee or official to give proper attention to a task expected of him or her, signifying a "disregard of a duty resulting from carelessness or indifference."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> On the other hand, gross neglect of duty is defined as "[n]egligence characterized by want of even slight care, or by acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to the consequences, insofar as other persons may be affected. It is the omission of that care that even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to give to their own property."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Gross neglect of duty denotes a flagrant and culpable refusal or unwillingness of a person to perform a duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In accordance with Rule 10, Section 46 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS), the penalty for the offenses of grave misconduct,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> gross or serious dishonesty,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and gross neglect of duty<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> is dismissal from the service, even for first time offenders, and carries with it the forfeiture of retirement benefits, except accrued leave benefits, and the perpetual disqualification for reemployment in the government service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> As to simple neglect of duty, it is a less grave offense punishable by suspension from office for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the first offense, and dismissal for the second offense under Section 46 (D) of the RRACCS.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>With these parameters in mind, We now proceed to the administrative liabilities of Ms. Del Rosario, Atty.

Hence, any loss, shortage, destruction or impairment of those funds and property makes them accountable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> As such, even the mere delay by the Clerks of Court or cash clerks in remitting the funds collected is considered as gross neglect of duty or as grave misconduct.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In delaying the remittance of court collections without advancing any valid or legal justification, and in tampering and falsifying official receipts to make it appear that court payments received were issued the proper receipts, Ms. Del Rosario committed gross dishonesty, grave misconduct and gross neglect of duty.

As Clerk of Court, it was incumbent upon Atty. Zalsos-Uychiat, at the barest minimum, to ensure that Ms. Del Rosario was properly carrying out her tasks. Her lackadaisical management, indifference to the financial status of the court a quo, and overall failure to exercise the required degree of supervision over Ms. Del Rosario ineluctably enabled the latter to sustain her fraudulent machinations for more or less three years. Her theatrical declaration that she was "shocked, surprised, and flabbergasted"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> by the scale of the loss of judiciary funds only lends credence to the proportionate magnitude of her negligence.<br><br>Atty.

Indeed, it is settled that any shortages in the amounts remitted and any delays incurred in the actual remittance of collections shall constitute gross neglect of duty for which the clerks of court concerned shall be held administratively liable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This principle squarely applies to the instant administrative matter.<br><br>In view of her resignation on January 31, 2017, the penalty of dismissal can no longer be imposed against Atty. Zalsos-Uychiat. This, however, does not free her from administrative liability. As the Court declared in a case:<br><blockquote>Neglect of duty is the failure to give one's attention to a task expected of him. Gross neglect is such neglect that, from the gravity of the case or the frequency of instances, becomes so serious in its character as to endanger or threaten the public welfare. The term does not necessarily include willful neglect or intentional official wrongdoing. Those responsible for such act or omission cannot escape the disciplinary power of this Court. The imposable penalty for gross neglect of duty is dismissal from the service.<br><br>Ordonez resigned effective May 4, 2009, purportedly to migrate to Canada. His resignation would not extricate him from the consequences of his gross neglect of duty, because the Court has not allowed resignation to be an escape or an easy way out to evade administrative liability or administrative sanction. Ordonez remains administratively liable, but his resignation prevents his dismissal from the service. A fine can be imposed, instead, and its amount is subject to the sound discretion of the Court. Section 56 (e) of Rule IV of the Revised Uniform Rules provides that fine as a penalty shall be in an amount not exceeding the salary for six months had the respondent not resigned, the rate for which is that obtaining at the time of his resignation. The fine shall be deducted from any accrued leave credits, with the respondent being personally liable for any deficiency that should be directly payable to this Court. He is further declared disqualified from any future government service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote>Prescinding from the foregoing pronouncement, We hereby impose a fine equivalent to Atty. Zalsos-Uychiat's salary for six (6) months in lieu of dismissal from the service. In addition, she is disqualified in perpetuity from holding any future public office.<br><br><i>Liability of Atty. Musa-Barrat</i><br><br>Based on the foregoing discussions on the responsibilities of clerks of court with regard to the safeguarding of judiciary funds, Atty. Musa-Barrat's failure to remit court collections within the prescribed period also constitutes gross neglect of duty. Nevertheless, in <i>Judge Arganosa-Maniego v. Salinas,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the Court held that:<br><blockquote>However, in several administrative cases, the Court has refrained from imposing the actual penalties in the presence of mitigating factors. Factors such as the respondent's length of service, the respondent's acknowledgement of his or her infractions and feeling of remorse, family circumstances, humanitarian and equitable considerations, respondent's advanced age, among other things, have had varying significance in the Court's determination of the imposable penalty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote>Conformably with the above pronouncement, dismissal is too harsh a penalty for Atty. Musa-Barrat. Unlike Ms. Del Rosario and Atty. Zalsos-Uychiat, she sincerely acknowledged her shortcomings, exhibiting genuine remorse and vowing to learn from this undesirable experience. We deem it proper to impose upon her the penalty of suspension for a period of one (1) year without pay, with a stem warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future will be dealt with more severely.<br><br>A final note. Time and again, this Court has made the pronouncement that any act which falls short of the exacting standards for public office, especially on the part of those expected to preserve the image of the judiciary, shall not be countenanced.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Accordingly, "[t]he behavior of all employees and officials involved in the administration of justice, from judges to the most junior clerks, is circumscribed with a heavy responsibility. Their conduct must be guided by strict propriety and decorum at all times in order to merit and maintain the public's respect for and trust in the judiciary. Needless to say, all court personnel must conduct themselves in a manner exemplifying integrity, honesty and uprightness."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> As front liners in the administration of justice, court personnel should live up to the strictest standards of honesty and integrity in the public service, and in this light, are always expected to act in a manner free from reproach. Any conduct, act, or omission that may diminish the people's faith in the Judiciary should not be tolerated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> <b>Ms. ABBA MARIE B.
