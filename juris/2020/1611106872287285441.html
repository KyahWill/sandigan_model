Hence, since complainant's failure to observe his reportorial duty is by reason of alleged mental or psychological condition, it cannot be equated with physical incapacity. Moreover, complainant offered no explanation as to why he did not notify his manning agent by some other means. For these two reasons, his disability compensation — assuming he was entitled thereto — is deemed forfeited.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, the Labor Arbiter directed respondents to pay Toliongco "moral damages for the mental torture that he endured and exemplary damages to dissuade such incident from further occurring."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Attorney's fees were also awarded as Toliongco was constrained to avail the services of a lawyer:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><blockquote>Regardless, complainant was certainly wronged. His resistance to the repeated demands of his CO to masturbate him and suck his penis led to his complaint. In turn, his complaint was met with violent reaction by his superior. It will not escape the attention of this Office that his allegation that he was threatened with death was never really contested by the respondents. In short, his work environment became a hostile, offensive and intimidating environment because he resisted his superior's demand for sexual favor. What was done to him was clear sexual harassment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote>The dispositive portion of the Labor Arbiter's decision reads:<b><br></b><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> evidence and law considered, judgment is hereby rendered holding the respondents liable for the constructive dismissal of the complainant.

This fear triggers many split-second changes in the body to prepare to defend against the danger or to avoid it. This 'fight-or-flight' response is a healthy reaction meant to protect a person from harm. But in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this reaction is changed or damaged. People who have PTSD may feel stressed or frightened even when they're no longer in danger. PTSD develops after a terrifying ordeal that involved physical harm or the threat of physical harm. The person who develops PTSD may have been the one who was harmed, the harm may have happened to a loved one, or the person may have witnessed a harmful event that happened to loved ones or strangers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br></blockquote>He also cites Mayo Clinic:<br><blockquote>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within three months of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event.

Southfield Agencies</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> explained the rationale for the 3-day reportorial requirement:<br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><blockquote>The 3-day mandatory reporting requirement must be strictly observed since within 3 days from repatriation, it would be fairly manageable for the physician to identify whether the disease. . . was contracted during the term of his employment or that his working conditions increased the risk of contracting the ailment.<br><br>...<br></blockquote><blockquote>Moreover, the post-employment medical examination within 3 days from . . . arrival is required in order to ascertain [the seafarer's] physical condition, since to ignore the rule would set a precedent with negative repercussions because it would open the floodgates to a limitless number of seafarers claiming disability benefits. It would certainly be unfair to the employer who would have difficulty determining the cause of a claimant's illness considering the passage of time. In such a case, the employers would have no protection against unrelated disability claims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court also stated in <i>Ebuenga</i> that post-employment medical examination "is a reciprocal obligation where the seafarer is obliged to submit to an examination within three (3) working days from his or her arrival, and the employer is correspondingly obliged to conduct a meaningful and timely examination of the seafarer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>However, some illnesses may take more than three (3) days before its symptoms manifest. There are also illnesses that are asymptomatic. Thus, the application of the 3-day reportorial requirement must also be viewed on a case-to-case basis, depending on the type of illness or disease.<br><br>For instance, petitioner's alleged illness involves mental health. Mental health disorders are not normally detected in laboratory tests that we are accustomed to such as blood extraction. The diagnosis of mental health disorders usually involve an interview with a psychiatrist and the conduct of tests like the Rorschach, Thematic Apperception Test, and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>Petitioner cited the DOH Order No. 2007-0025 (DOH AO No. 2007-0025).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> One of the related documents to DOH AO No. 2007-0025 is entitled "Medical Standards in the Conduct of PEME for Seafarers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> A portion of the Medical Standards provides:<br><blockquote><b>E.

Mental disorders are listed under Section 32 of the POEA Standard Employment Contract, with the specification that the mental disorder resulted from traumatic head injuries:<br>Section 32.

It also implies that only medical findings, not including psychological trauma, are cognizable as work-related.<br><br>Petitioner did not suffer any traumatic head injury, but his alleged illness, post-traumatic stress disorder, is a kind of mental disorder. For other illnesses not listed under Section 32,&nbsp; Section 32-A applies.<br><blockquote>Section 32-A provides:<br><br><b>Section 32 - A.

Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br></blockquote>Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and "[occurs] when the person has experienced an event that is outside the range of usual human experience, that would be-markedly distressing to almost anyone; e.g., serious threat to one's life or physical integrity, etc."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> The current diagnostic features of post-traumatic stress disorder are stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disorders:<br><br>Diagnostic Features<br><blockquote>The essential feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the development of characteristic symptoms <b><i>following exposure to one or more traumatic events. Emotional reactions to the traumatic event</i></b> (e.g., fear, helplessness, horror) are no longer a part of Criterion A. The clinical presentation of PTSD varies. In some individuals, fear-based re-experiencing, emotional, and behavioral symptoms may predominate. In others, anhedonic or dysphoric mood states and negative cognitions may be most distressing. In some other individuals, arousal and reactive-externalizing symptoms are prominent, while in others, dissociative symptoms predominate. Finally, some individuals exhibit combinations of these symptom patterns.<br><br>The directly experienced traumatic events in Criterion A include, but are not limited to, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual physical assault (e.g., physical attack, robbery, mugging, childhood physical abuse),<b><i> threatened or actual sexual violence (e.g., forced sexual penetration, alcohol/drug-facilitated sexual penetration, abusive sexual contact, noncontact sexual abuse, sexual trafficking),</i></b> being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration as a prisoner of war, natural or human-made disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents." (Emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote>A unique circumstance in this case is that the alleged illness is not caused by the duties and responsibilities of a Messman, but is due to the seafarer's work environment. Petitioner was harassed twice in one night. Though he managed to escape in both instances, there was no way for him to avoid CO Oleksiy. The only way he could protect himself from further sexual advances or unwanted sexual contact was to request for repatriation.<br><br>In cases like these, it is possible that the seafarer's fear is heightened because there is no way to escape from the environment where sexual harassment occurred. Being out at sea, the seafarer has to wait for the ship to dock at the nearest port before the seafarer can disembark and be repatriated. Thus, from the time the incident of sexual harassment occurred until the time the seafarer is able to disembark, it is probable that the seafarer is cowered by fear. In addition, the sexual predator, knowing there is no room for the victim to escape, is capable of continuously committing such acts of sexual harassment. The unique condition of working on board a ship empowers the harassment. The unique condition of working on board a ship empowers the sexual predator and leaves the victim feeling helpless because they are in the same enclosed space.<br><br>By no means can petitioner's repatriation be considered as voluntary, for he had been pushed against the wall with no other recourse. Hence, he is entitled to his salary for the unexpired portion of his contract.<br><br>There are several cases decided by this Court involving seafarers who experienced unfortunate and harsh treatment while onboard a vessel.<br><br>In <i>Toquero v. Crossworld Marine Services,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> this Court stated:<br><blockquote>Respondents' argument that the claim is precluded because the injury is due to the willful acts of another seafarer is also untenable. The POEA Standard Employment Contract disqualifies claims caused by the willful or criminal act or intentional breach of duties done by the claimant, not by the assailant. It is highly unjust to preclude a seafarer's disability claim because of the assailant's willful or criminal act or intentional breach of duty.<br><br><b><i>Between the ship owner/manager and the worker, the former is in a better position to ensure the discipline of its workers. Consequently, the law imposes liabilities on employers so that they are burdened with the costs of harm should they fail to take precautions. </i></b>In economics, this is called internalization, which attributes the consequences and costs of an activity to the party who causes them.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[101]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><i>Cabuyoc v. Inter-Orient Navigation Shipmanagement, Inc.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> involved Cabuyoc, a Messman who "was found to be suffering from nervous breakdown and was declared unfit for work at sea."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> He was repatriated after two months and 11 days at sea and "filed a complaint before the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration for non-payment of overtime pay, hospitalization benefit and sickness allowance."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> Cabuyoc alleged that he received hostile treatment from the officers on board the ship. In ruling for Cabuyoc, this Court reasoned:<br><blockquote>Here, petitioner's illness and disability were the direct results of the demands of his shipboard employment contract and the harsh and inhumane treatment of the officers on board the vessel "Olandia." For no justifiable reason, respondents refused to pay their contractual obligations in bad faith. Further, it cannot be gainsaid that petitioner's disability is not only physical but mental as well because of the severe depression, mental torture, anguish, embarrassment, anger, sleepless nights and anxiety that befell him. To protect his rights and interest, petitioner was constrained to institute his complaint below and hire the services of an attorney.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br></blockquote>The present case is unique because the illness involved is a mental health disorder. We should consider the reality that even if petitioner was physically capable of complying with the three-day reportorial requirement, his mental faculties might have hindered him from doing so, because of the possible trauma inflicted on him caused by the two incidents of sexual harassment at the hands of the chief officer.<br><br>A review of the records of this case shows that petitioner was unable to comply with the 3-day reportorial requirement but filed a complaint one week after repatriation. We note the findings of the National Labor Relations Commission on this matter:<br><blockquote>Complainant's belated explanation in his Memorandum in Appeal that his mental state could not even cognize the imperative nature of the requirement fails to persuade [u]s. <b><i>If he is indeed suffering from a debilitating mental incapacity as to deprive him of reason and logic to consult the company designated physician or at least notify his manning agent by some other means, then how come he had the wisdom of filing a complaint with the OWWA a week after he signed off from the vessel?</i></b> How come that in his own Position Paper, he stated in no. 51 thereof that "in 12 July 2014, the complainant was repatriated to the Philippines and the company physicians examined him after his arrival." This statement strongly indicates that he knew he had to be examined after his arrival yet he was not able to produce any medical report of the company physician and instead submitted, very belatedly at that, the medical reports of his self-appointed doctors which, with due respect to the doctors, were wanting in many aspects.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> (Emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote>Perhaps petitioner's mind might have been so confused that he could not fully grasp whatever was happening around him. He might have lost his sense of time because of the trauma, thus rendering him unable to comply with the three-day reportorial requirement. It is also possible that he found it too traumatic to report to his agency upon repatriation.<br><br>To support his claim for disability benefits, petitioner presented a psychiatric report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> and a medical certificate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> These documents only prove that he was diagnosed with PTSD, prescribed to take medication, and recommended for psychotherapy sessions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> However, there was no disability grading.<br><br>The medical certificate states that "[a]t this point in time he cannot return to his work as a seafarer." This statement is not sufficient for this court to conclude that petitioner is permanently and totally disabled to work as a seafarer. It does not instruct us how petitioner's PTSD is work-related or work-aggravated. It also does not tell us whether petitioner underwent psychotherapy sessions, as recommended by his physicians. Assuming that petitioner underwent psychotherapy sessions and took his prescribed medication, no evidence was presented showing how he responded to treatment.<br><br><i>Phil. Transmarine Carriers, Inc. et al. v. Nazam</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> involved a Nazam, a Bosun who requested for voluntary repatriation based on personal reasons. Shortly after he was repatriated, he filed a complaint for "payment of disability benefits, sickness allowance, damages, and attorney's fees" because the humiliation, verbal, and mental abuse he experienced onboard caused "to suffer hypertension and depression."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> The Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of Nazam.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> However, the National Labor Relations Commission reversed the Labor Arbiter's decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> The Court of Appeals reinstated the Labor Arbiter's decision."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> In reinstating the National Labor Relations Commission's decision which dismissed the complaint, this Court reasoned:<br><blockquote>Respondent's claim of having reported to petitioner Transmarine's office within three days from his arrival in the Philippines remains just that. As duly observed by the NLRC, respondent merely consulted a private practitioner more than one month after his arrival - three weeks after he had already filed his complaint for disability benefits; and he already filed his complaint for disability benefits; and he secured a medical certification that he was unfit for sea duty from another private physician only on March, 2005 or six months after his arrival.<br><br>... Aside from a "To whom it may concern" handwritten letter of respondent attached to his Position Paper filed before the arbiter detailing the alleged instances of verbal abuse, which letter bears the alleged signatures of some of respondent's colleagues, respondent failed to proffer concrete proof that, if indeed he was subjected to abuse, it directly resulted in his depression."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup></blockquote>Several months had passed before petitioner sought medical opinion, but we should not blame him for belatedly seeking medical help. Perhaps his dire financial condition is one factor. We note that he filed this Petition as a pauper-litigant"6&nbsp; and he&nbsp; has&nbsp; not found any&nbsp; suitable&nbsp; employment after repatriation.117 It might also have taken him some time to accept that he needed medical help. He knew well enough that he was wronged and immediately filed a complaint before the Overseas Worker's Welfare Administration, but perhaps, at that point, he had no manifest symptoms of any mental health issues yet.<br><br>As found by the Labor Arbiter:<br><blockquote>A week after sign-off, complainant filed a complaint with the Overseas Worker's Welfare Administration (OWWA) claiming that he was sexually abused on board. Respondents denied his accusation and the case was dismissed.<br><br>Sometime around mid-December 2014, complainant filed another complaint against respondents with the National Conciliation &amp; Mediation Board (NCMB) claiming disability as he said he consulted a doctor and he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. No formal case was filed before the NCMB.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup></blockquote>Lest this Court be misunderstood, We recognize that it takes time for victims of sexual harassment to come forward. Perhaps more so if the victim is a male, due to factors such as "fear that he will be considered to have provoked the assault in some way, stigma, a sense of loss of masculinity, either through being penetrated or not having fought hard enough to prevent the attack (or both), . . . and fear of being perceived as homosexual."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup><br><br>It is established that petitioner suffered some form of injury, but the pieces of evidence he submitted are not sufficient to convince this Court that he has been rendered permanently and totally disabled. Thus, this Court is precluded from awarding disability benefits, not because of his non-compliance with the 3-day reportorial requirement, but because there is barely any evidence to support the claim for disability benefits.<br><br>In a separate opinion in <i>Garcia v. Drilon,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> the existence of violence against men and the underreporting of such incidents was recognized. It was discussed that:<br><blockquote>Social and cultural expectations on masculinity and male dominance urge men to keep quiet about being a victim, adding to the unique experience of male victims of domestic abuse. This leads to latent depression among boys and men. In a sense, patriarchy while privileging men, also victimizes them.<br><br>There is now more space to believe that portraying only women as victims will not always promote gender equality before the law. It sometimes aggravates the gap by conceding that women have always been dominated by men. In doing so, it renders empowered women invisible; or, in some cases, that men as human beings can also become victims.<br><br>In this light, it may be said that violence in the context of intimate relationships should not be seen and encrusted as a gender issue, rather it is a power issue. Thus, when laws are not gender-neutral, male victims of domestic violence may also suffer from double victimization first by their abusers and second by the judicial system. Incidentally, focusing on women was the victims entrenches some level of heteronormativity. It is blind to the possibility that, whatever moral positions are taken by those who are dominant, in reality intimate relationships can also happen between men.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup></blockquote>To restate, sexual harassment can happen to anyone and everyone. Our society has often depicted women as being the weaker sex, and the only victims of sexual harassment. It is high-time that this notion is corrected. To consider women as the weaker sex is discriminatory. To think that only women can be victims of sexual harassment is discriminatory against men who have suffered the same plight; men who have been victimized by sexual predators.<br><br><div align="center"><b>III</b><br></div><br>Both the Labor Arbiter122 and the National Labor Relations Commission123 found that petitioner was sexually harassed.

Certainly, a wrongful act was committed against him.<br><br>We also reinstate and increase the award of exemplary damages to P50,000.00 in view of the award of moral damages. In addition, the award of exemplary damages should serve as a warning to shipping companies and manning agencies that it is their obligation to ensure safe working conditions for our seafarers.<br><br>As petitioner was forced to litigate in order to receive compensation for the unexpired portion of his contract and compensation for what he suffered at the hands of CO Oleksiy, attorney's fees are also awarded.<br><br>We must change the notion that injuries refer to only the physical kind. Injuries can come in many forms—physical, emotional, or psychological. It is high-time that we recognize sexual harassment on board vessels as a risk faced by our seafarers. We also cannot disregard the possibility that Toliongco felt shame over what had happened. Victims of sexual abuse usually take time before reporting to the proper authorities. Perhaps, more so if they are male as society has made it hard for male victims of sexual harassment to come out and report.
