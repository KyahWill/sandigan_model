He nevertheless contended that his acquittal in Criminal Case No. 37120-R should be sustained pursuant to his right against double jeopardy.<br><br><div align="center"><i>Ruling of the CA</i><br></div><br>In the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated January 23, 2018, the CA ruled that there was a typographical error in the dispositive portion of the Family Court's Decision; clarified that the verdict clearly referred to petitioner's conviction for Rape by Sexual Assault in Criminal Case No. 37120-R and not in Criminal Case No. 37119-R; and accordingly acquitted petitioner in the latter case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is hereby DENIED. The January 19, 2017 Consolidated Judgment of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 4, Baguio City in Criminal Case Nos. 37118-R, 37119-R, and 37120-R is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS. As modified and corrected, accused-appellant ABC is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. 37120-R of rape by sexual assault under paragraph 2 of Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code and sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years, six (6) months, and twenty (20) days of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as maximum, and is ordered to pay private complainant <i>AAA</i> civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages, each amounting to P30,000.00 which shall earn 6% interest <i>per annum</i> from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid. ABC is found NOT GUILTY by reason of reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. 37119-R. All other aspects of the Consolidated Judgment stand.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>The CA ruled that petitioner should be convicted for Rape by Sexual Assault for his act of inserting his finger into AAA's genitals as charged in Criminal Case No. 37120-R and that the correction of the typographical error in the dispositive portion of the Family Court Consolidated Judgment would not put him in double jeopardy citing the case of <i>Cobarrubias v. People</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (<i>Cobarrubias</i>).<br><br>Undeterred, petitioner filed the instant petition.<br><br><i><center>The Issues before the Court</center></i><br>The issues for the Court's resolution are as follows: (1) whether or not double jeopardy had set in for Criminal Case No. 37120-R; and (2) whether the conviction should be upheld with petitioner's assertion that the victim's testimony was incredible and conflicting. He contended that he was already acquitted in Criminal Case No. 37120-R; hence, his conviction therein violates his right against double jeopardy. Furthermore, petitioner reiterated that the testimony of AAA is full of inconsistencies and lapses that affect her credibility.<br><br><center><i>Our Ruling</i></center><br>The petition is bereft of merit.<br><br>The CA did not commit any reversible error which would warrant the exercise of the Court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction. As correctly ruled by the CA, the clear findings of the Family Court is that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of petitioner in his indictment for Criminal Case No. 37119-R which charged him for his act of insertion of a finger into the victim's anal orifice; and that only one instance of Sexual Assault was established which pertained to Criminal Case No. 37120-R committed by petitioner by his insertion of a finger into AAA's genitalia. Thus, it is only just and proper to correct the dispositive portion to reflect the exact findings and conclusions of the Family Court as the Court already settled in <i>Cobarrubias</i>, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>The general rule is that where there is a conflict between the <i>fallo</i>, or the dispositive part, and the body of the decision or order, the <i>fallo</i> prevails on the theory that the <i>fallo</i> is the final order and becomes the subject of execution, while the body of the decision merely contains the reasons or conclusions of the court ordering nothing. However, where one can clearly and unquestionably conclude from the body of the decision that there was a mistake in the dispositive portion, the body of the decision will prevail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>In <i>Cobarrubias</i>, there was a clerical error in the <i>fallo</i> or the dispositive portion of Presiding Judge Florentino M. Alumbres' Order dated March 20, 2001, which should have dismissed Criminal Case No. 94-5038 for Homicide instead of Criminal Case No. 94-5037 for Illegal Possession of Firearms, as discussed in the body of the order. Accordingly, it was ruled therein that it was only just and proper to correct the dispositive portion to reflect the exact findings and conclusions of the trial court.<br><br>Anent petitioner's claim of violation of his right against double jeopardy, no less than the 1987 Constitution guarantees the right of the accused against double jeopardy, thus:<br><blockquote>Section 7, Rule 117 of the 1985 and 2000 Rules on Criminal Procedure strictly adhere to the constitutional proscription against double jeopardy and provide for the requisites in order for double jeopardy to attach. For double jeopardy to attach, the following elements must concur: <i>(1)</i> a valid information sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction of the crime charged; <i>(2)</i> a court of competent jurisdiction; <i>(3)</i> the accused has been arraigned and had pleaded; and <i>(4)</i> the accused was convicted or acquitted or the case was dismissed without his express consent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>However, the Court finds that the fourth element is wanting. There was indeed a valid Information for the crime of Sexual Assault in Criminal Case No. 37120-R over which the Family Court had jurisdiction and to which petitioner entered a plea of not guilty. After the trial, a judgment was rendered and promulgated, the dispositive portion of which acquitted petitioner in Criminal Case No. 37120-R, but found him guilty beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case No. 37119-R. What is peculiar in this case is that there was a typographical error in the docket number of the criminal cases for Sexual Assault when the Family Court interchangeably and inadvertently mistook and associated Criminal Case No. 37120-R as the Information that indicted petitioner for the act of insertion of his finger in the anal orifice of his victim, although the body of the decision was very clear in its findings that the only crime that was proven was Sexual Assault committed by petitioner in inserting his finger into AAA's genitals. Under the foregoing circumstances, there could be no valid judgment of acquittal in Criminal Case No. 37120-R. Thus, the correction thereof is warranted; hence there is no valid acquittal in Criminal Case No. 37120-R to speak of.<br><br>As regards petitioner's contention that the court <i>a quo</i> failed to consider the inconsistencies in the prosecution's evidence, the Court agrees with the findings of both the Family Court and the CA as to the credibility of AAA who was only 10 years old at the time of the incident. The straightforward and categorical testimony of AAA and her positive identification of petitioner must prevail over the uncorroborated and self-serving denial of the latter. Moreover, AAA, being a child-victim, the Court is inclined to normally give full weight and credit to her testimony, since when a girl of tender age and immaturity says that she has been raped, or as in this case, sexually assaulted, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has in fact been committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> A young girl's revelation that she had been raped or sexually assaulted, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her dignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as mere concoction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Veritably, the Court sees no cogent reason to deviate from the unanimous findings and legal conclusions reached by the trial court and the appellate court with respect to the guilt of petitioner as charged. More specifically, the Court puts great weight on the factual findings of the trial judge who heard the testimonies of the witnesses and observed their demeanor while they testified. Time and again, the Court has stressed that factual findings of the trial court, including its evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies, must be accorded respect and not be disturbed on appeal, except when the trial court is shown to have overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied any fact or circumstance of weight and significance, which, if considered, would have affected the result of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> This is especially true where, as in the case herein, the trial court's findings were affirmed by the appellate court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The Court equally holds that all the elements of Sexual Assault are present in the instant case. Contrary to petitioner's argument, it should be noted that the relationship between petitioner and his victim is sufficient for petitioner to exert "influence" upon AAA, in addition to the latter's minority.<br><br>The foregoing notwithstanding, pursuant to <i>People v. Tulagan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (<i>Tulagan</i>), the nomenclature of the crime should be modified to Sexual Assault under paragraph 2, Article 266-A of the RPC, in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 otherwise known as the <i>Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act</i>, considering AAA was only 10 years old when the crime was committed against her.<br><br>Similarly as to the award for damages, the Court again conforms to Tulagan which pegged civil indemnity for Sexual Assault under paragraph 2, Article 266-A of the RPC, in relation to Section 5(b) of RA 7610 at P50,000.00, P50,000.00 as moral damages, and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
