It thus puzzles this Court why, at that point, DARAB did not order the inclusions of the other heirs should there be absence of authority from them in favor of petitioner Pedro dela Corta. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the petitioners herein are not indispensable parties.</p> <p> As defined, an indispensable party is one who has such an interest in the controversy or subject matter that a final adjudication cannot be made, in his absence, without injuring or affecting that interest. Given the facts of the case, it is the considered opinion of the Court that the petitioners are not "indispensable parties" as they now claim.</p> <p> To reiterate, Valeriano dela Carta <b>had already been disqualified</b> by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 12, Ormoc City in <b>CAR Case No. 1726</b>; and, said findings became final and therefore binding to the parties thereto who happens [sic] to be the predecessors-in-interest of the present parties. Necessarily, the issues raised therein may not be litigated anew. x x x</p> <p> By virtue of the said decision of the Regional Trial Court. Branch 12, Ormoc City in CAR Case No. 1726, Valeriano dela Corta lost any interest or right he may have over the subject farmlot. He thus had no right, so to speak, over the subject farmlot when the petition for cancellation of his emancipation patent was filed. And, so are his heirs (the petitioners herein) who only derived their alleged rights or interests over the subject farmlot from him (Valeriano dela Corta). The spring simply cannot rise higher than its source.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphasis in the original; citations omitted.)</p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> was denied in the CA's assailed Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> dated July 20, 2016.</p><p> Hence, the present petition.</p><p> Petitioners contend that the DAR-Region VIII's Order dated August 9, 2007, the DARAB Regional Adjudicator 's Decision dated October 5, 2009, and the DARAB Central Office's Decision dated May 8, 2013 are all null and void due to lack of jurisdiction and total disregard of the constitutional right to due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Hence, petitioners argue that the CA erred in denying their appeal and affirming the Decision of the DARAB Central Office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <i>The Court’s Ruling</i> </p><p>The petition has no merit. </p><p>Prefatorily, considering that the findings of the DAR-Region VIII, the DARAB Regional Adjudicator, and the DARAB Central Office are similar in all material respects, these should not be disturbed, more so in this case where the CA sustained such findings. "[T]he factual findings of administrative agencies and officials that have acquired expertise in the performance of their official duties and in the exercise of their primary jurisdiction are generally accorded not only respect but, at times, even finality if such findings are supported by substantial evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Such factual findings, especially when affirmed by the CA, are binding on the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p> In the present petition, Pedro contends that the DAR-Region VIII's Order dated August 9, 2007 is absolutely null and void on three grounds: 1) violation of Section 2, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court for failure to implead real parties-in-interest or indispensable parties,<em> i.e.</em>, the registered owners of Lot No. 50; 2) violation of the constitutional requirement of due process; and 3) lack of jurisdiction over the persons of the registered landowners and over the subject matter,<em> i.e.</em>, Lot No. 50.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p>The Court is not persuaded. </p><p>An examination of the records of the case reveals the fact that Valeriano's disqualification as a farmer beneficiary of the subject lot was never contested. It is notable that no copy of the decision of Branch 12, RTC, Ormoc City, allegedly disqualifying Valeriano as a farmer beneficiary of the subject lot and installing Guillerma as the qualified beneficiary with respect to the 1.1000-hectare portion thereof, can be found in the records of the instant case. Likewise, neither petitioners nor respondent attached a copy thereof in their respective pleadings before the Court. </p><p> Upon scrutiny of the records, it appears that a Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> dated October 18, 2006 was issued in relation to CAR Case No. 1726 before Branch 12, RTC, Ormoc City by Atty. Edwin James B. Fabriga, OIC-Clerk of Court, stating that the records of the case are no longer among the existing and available records on file; and it is believed that the case records "have been permanently and irretrievably lost due to the flash flood brought about by typhoon 'Uring' that hit Ormoc City in November 1991." Be that as it may, the Court notes the CAs observation that the RTC Decision was mentioned in the DAR-Region VIII's Order dated August 9, 2007 and remained an uncontroverted fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p><p> It also appears from the record that a petition for <i>certiorari </i>docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 19145 was filed before the CA by the heirs of Valeriano, including Pedro, assailing a Joint Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> issued by Branch 12, RTC, Ormoc City in the same CAR Case No. 1726 for contempt on account of disobedience of a final order and in Civil Case No. 2864-0 for quieting of title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> As to the contempt case docketed as CAR Case No. 1726, the petitioners before the CA contended that therein respondent Judge gravely abused his discretion in issuing the assailed Joint Order, which found Pedro, among others, not guilty of contempt but directed Pedro and Roberto to vacate the subject lot in view of the final and executory decision on the forfeiture of Valeriano's right over the subject lot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> dated April 30, 1993, the CA granted the petition for<i> certiorari</i> and thus ordered the deletion of the portion of the RTC's Joint Order directing Pedro, among others, to vacate the subject lot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p><p> From a thorough reading of the Decision dated April 30, 1993, it can be gleaned that what the CA overturned was merely the RTC's order to vacate the subject lot as this involved the issue of possession and ownership thereof which was not resolved in the aforesaid final judgment disqualifying Valeriano as a farmer beneficiary of the subject lot. Notably, the fact of Valeriano's disqualification remained undisputed.</p><p> In view of the foregoing circumstances, considering that the final judgment of Valeriano's disqualification as a farmer beneficiary was never questioned, it was logical for the CA to rule that, at the time respondent filed a petition for reallocation with the DAR-Region VIII, Valeriano and his heirs were not indispensable parties in the case. Moreover, the contentions of petitioners that they were deprived of due process and that the DARAB lacked jurisdiction over the persons of the registered landowners and over the subject matter, <i>i.e</i>., Lot No. 50, fail. </p><p>Rule 3, Section 7 of the Rules of Court provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 7. <i>Compulsory joinder of indispensable parties</i>. – Parties in interest without whom no final determination can be had of an action shall be joined either as plaintiffs or defendants.</p> </blockquote> <p> Indispensable parties are parties whose legal presence in the proceeding is so necessary that "the action cannot be finally determined" without them because their interests in the matter and in the relief "are so bound up with that of the other parties."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Thus: </p><blockquote> <p> An indispensable party is a party who has such an interest in the controversy or subject matter that a final adjudication cannot be made, in his absence, without injuring or affecting that interest, a party who has not only an interest in the subject matter of the controversy, but also has an interest of such nature that a final decree cannot be made without affecting his interest or leaving the controversy in such a condition that its final determination may be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience. It has also been considered that an indispensable party is a person in whose absence there cannot be a determination between the parties already before the court which is effective, complete, or equitable. Further, an indispensable party is one who must he included in an action before it may properly go forward.</p> <p> A person is not an indispensable party, however, if his interest in the controversy or subject matter is separable from the interest of the other parties, so that it will not necessarily be directly or injuriously affected by a decree which does complete justice between them. Also, a person is not an indispensable party if his presence would merely permit complete relief between him and those already parties to the action, or if he has no interest in the subject matter of the action. It is not a sufficient reason to declare a person to be an indispensable party that his presence will avoid multiple litigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Applying the foregoing definition, the Court finds that Valeriano and his heirs were not indispensable parties as they no longer stood to be directly benefited or injured by the judgment in the petition for reallocation filed by respondent. Valeriano and his heirs ceased to have an interest in the subject lot after the issuance of the final judgment disqualifying Valeriano as a farmer beneficiary thereof. Thus, contrary to petitioners' contention, the failure to implead Valeriano or his heirs (<i>i.e</i>., herein petitioners) did not deprive the DAR-Region VIII, the DARAB Regional Adjudicator, and the DARAB Central Office of jurisdiction over the cases filed before them. </p><p> Notably, Pedro, while invoking lack of jurisdiction and non-observance of due process, had admitted having received in behalf of Valeriano a copy of the DAR-Region VIII's Order dated August 9, 2007; in fact, he had intervened in the case by subsequently filing a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> of the Order. Significantly, the Regional Director duly heard Pedro's motion but ruled to deny it for lack of merit, having found "no material and substantial evidence to warrant the reversal or modification of the assailed Order x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><p> Due process, in its classic formulation, means that any person having interest to the thing in litigation, or the outcome of the judgment, must be notified and given an opportunity to defend that interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Conforming to the constitutional guarantee of due process of law is the principle that a person cannot be prejudiced by a ruling rendered in an action or proceeding in which he was not made a party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p><p> The Court has ruled that the essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard or, as applied to administrative proceedings, an opportunity to explain one's side or an opportunity to seek reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In this case, even assuming that Pedro was an indispensable party, he cannot claim denial of due process for the simple reason that he had the opportunity to question the judgment of the DARAB-Region VIII.</p><p> On the contrary, it is noteworthy that the qualifications of respondent as a farmer beneficiary of the subject lot were confirmed and the reallocation she prayed for was granted in the DAR-Region VIII's Order dated August 9, 2007. Since Pedro failed to timely file an appeal from the DAR-Region VIII's Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> dated February 12, 2008 denying his motion for reconsideration of the Order dated August 9, 2007, a Certificate of Finality<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> was issued on October 22, 2008.</p><p> It is settled that when a decision has acquired finality, it becomes immutable and unalterable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Public policy also dictates that when a judgment becomes final, executory, and unappealable, the prevailing party should not be denied the fruits of his or her victory through any form of subterfuge which may be devised by the losing party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> "<i>Unjustified delay in the enforcement of a judgment sets at naught the role of courts in disposing justiciable controversies with finality</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on <i> Certiorari </i> is <b>DENIED</b>.
