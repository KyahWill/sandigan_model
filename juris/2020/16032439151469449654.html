Trial on the merits proceeded even in the absence of co-accused Marianito Bagon (<i>Bagon</i>) and Paul Justin Ventura (<i>Ventura</i>), who are both at-large.<br><br>The facts, as established by the prosecution, and as culled from the CA Decision, are as follows:<br><blockquote>The prosecution presented three witnesses, namely: (1) PO2 Maria Cecilia Fajardo [<i>PO2 Fajardo</i>]; (2) Police Chief Inspector Joseph Palmero, M.D. [<i>PCI Palmero</i>]); and (3) the victim AAA.<br><br>PO2 Fajardo was the police investigator assigned at the Women's Desk, who interviewed AAA. Private complainant AAA narrated what transpired; and while she answered some questions, she looked tired, scared and worried.

She narrated that on August 3, 2009, she and her friends attended a wake.

As soon as [Bagon] got hold of her, accused­-appellant Nocido and accused [Ventura] approached her. Fearing for her life, she struggled to free herself. Unfortunately, [Ventura] and [Bagon] were able to forcibly bring her to an alley that leads to a vacant house. It was accused-appellant who guided them to the secluded area.<br><br>Inside the vacant house, all of the accused simultaneously hit AAA. Accused-appellant slapped her several times while [Ventura] punched her in the stomach to stop her from further resisting. As a consequence, AAA fell down. To prevent them from further harming her, AAA pretended to have fainted. At that point, [Bagon] pinned her down. Taking advantage of the situation, [Bagon] and accused-appellant removed her clothes, while [Ventura] held a lighter to illuminate the area. [Bagon] removed AAA's shorts and panties, kissed her lips, and proceeded downwards her body to lick her vagina. Afterwards, [Ventura] lifted AAA and mounted her on top of [Bagon]. After [Bagon] inserted hi s finger into AAA's vagina, he pushed his penis inside AAA's vagina. While [Bagon] was mashing AAA's breasts, accused-appellant also tried to insert his penis into AAA's vagina. Accused-appellant then tried to enter (sic) his penis into AAA's anus, but failed; he used his finger instead. Thereafter, [Bagon] tried to insert his penis into the mouth of AAA, but since AAA feigned unconsciousness, he was not able to open her mouth.<br><br>Since dawn was already breaking, the three accused transferred AAA to the comfort room as someone might see her. Afterwards, they put on her jumper and gave her a t-shirt. [Bagon] carried her towards an alley. xxx. She attempted to shout for help but [Bagon] covered her mouth. [Bagon] threatened to kill her if she would tell anybody of what just happened. Thereafter, she immediately gathered her clothes and ran away without wearing any bra. She proceeded to the house of <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span>, a friend in <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> Street.

In no time, they went to the barangay ball to lodge a complaint against accused-appellant Nocido, accused [Bagon] and accused [Ventura]. At around 1:30 in the afternoon, AAA's father was informed by one <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> that his daughter was in the barangay hall looking for him. AAA 's father immediately proceeded to the place.

While they were walking along <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> St., they met AAA. [Bagon] and [Ventura] talked to her and were able to convince her to go to an alley that leads to a vacant house. After some time, AAA tried to leave but she was prevented by [Bagon] and [Ventura]. When she tried to escape, [Bagon] held her and pushed her to a wall causing her to fall down. Accused-appellant tried to stop [Bagon] and [Ventura] but the latter prevailed. [Ventura] then carried AAA to the vacant house. [Ventura] lit his lighter and watched [Bagon] having sexual intercourse with AAA. Thereafter, [Bagon] and [Ventura] switched places. Accused-appellant further alleged that out of fear, he was not able to leave the place and seek help; and that the door was also blocked by [Bagon] and [Ventura]. Later on, [Ventura] brought AAA outside the house, while [Bagon] threatened her not to tell the incident to anybody. Accused-appellant slightly slapped AAA's face to awaken her. When she regained consciousness, he assisted her to the nearest store. He left the place, went home and slept until 8:00 o'clock in the evening. Upon waking up, he was surprised about the presence of police officers in his house. They forcibly boarded him to a van and told him that he was being charged with the rape of AAA. Subsequently, he was brought to the police station and incarcerated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote><div align="center"><b><i>RTC Ruling</i></b><br></div><br>On August 5, 2015, the RTC issued a Partial Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court renders judgment finding accused Niel Raymond A.

He was also held liable for rape through sexual intercourse committed by the other two accused. The RTC explained that Nocido's cooperation in the consummation of the rape through sexual intercourse made him a co-conspirator.<br><br>The RTC gave full weight and credit to the testimony of AAA, a minor victim. The categorical testimony of a minor victim as to how she was physically and sexually abused and raped, deserves full credit. The RTC saw or itself how traumatic it was for a minor to testify in court of the abuse done to her. With her willingness to undergo the trouble and the humiliation of a public trial, she could only have been impelled to tell the truth.<br><br>With regard to the circumstance affecting criminal liability, the RTC considered the aggravating circumstance of ignominy as attendant in this case, even if it was not alleged in the Informations. With ignominy as an aggravating circumstance, the RTC awarded P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>Nocido filed his appeal with the CA.

According to the CA, the credibility of AAA's testimony is not affected by minor inconsistencies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10] </sup>The alleged inconsistencies in AAA's testimony with respect to who held her arms when she was forcibly taken at the alley, and her failure to scream despite the presence of neighbors which allegedly made her testimony contrary to human experience, are minor details which have nothing to do with the elements of the crime of rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> There was nothing substantial on the records that will warrant a reversal of the assessment made by the RTC on AAA's narration of the incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>As regards the crimes of rape through sexual intercourse, and by sexual assault, all the elements of these crimes were proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In a clear, candid, and straightforward manner, AAA narrated to the trial court how Nocido and Bagon forcibly penetrated her vagina and anus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Further, AAA's convincing narration of facts and her positive identification of Nocido prevail over Nocido's weak defense of denial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It was also established that the three accused acted in concert in raping AAA, to wit:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">accused [Bagon] poked [the] knife at AAA's neck;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td> <div align="justify">accused-appellant and accused [Bagon] held her arms and dragged her to a secluded area;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">all of the accused slapped and punched AAA to overpower her;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4) </div></td><td><div align="justify">accused-appellant and accused [Bagon] removed AAA's clothes while accused [Ventura] was holding a lighter to illuminate the place;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(5) </div></td><td><div align="justify">all the accused simultaneously abused her until they were satisfied.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>On the issue of the absence of proof of hymenal laceration, this does not negate the commission of rape, as the slightest penetration of the male organ within the <i>labia</i> or <i>pudendum</i> of the female organ is sufficient to convict the rapist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>For the aggravating circumstance of ignominy, the CA ruled that it cannot be appreciated because it was not alleged in the Informations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition for review.<br><br><center><b><i>Issues</i></b></center><blockquote><ol><li>Whether the CA erred in giving due weight and credence to AAA's testimony.<br><br></li><li>Whether the CA erred in convicting Nocido guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of rape through sexual intercourse and rape by sexual assault under Articles 266- A(1)(A) and 266-A(2), respectively.<br><br>a.

According to Nocido, a closer scrutiny of AAA's testimony would show that there are discernible improbabilities that strongly militate against being accorded the full credit it was given by the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Aside from the improbabilities in AAA's testimony, Nocido posits that the prosecution failed to establish the element of carnal knowledge based on the remaining evidence, which is the Medico-Legal Report.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> According to Nocido, the Medico-Legal Report belies a finding of rape through sexual intercourse or by sexual assault because PCI Palmero failed to see any laceration, or genital wound that support a finding of penetration of any blunt object.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>As regards being a conspirator in the crime of rape by sexual assault, Nocido interposed the defense that mere presence at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission without proof of cooperation or agreement to cooperate, is not enough to establish that a person is a party to the conspiracy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> According to Nocido, the evidence failed to establish that his acts, and that of his co-accused's were motivated by a common purpose to commit the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Our Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>The appeal has no merit. However, there are modifications as regards the damages to be awarded in Criminal Case No. 09-1772; and the nomenclature, the penalty, and the damages to be awarded for the crime charged in Criminal Case No. 09-1773.<br><br><b><i>AAA's testimony must be given due weight and credence.</i></b><br><br>As to whether AAA's testimony should be given due weight and credence, it is important to take into consideration the <i>Women's Honor</i> doctrine. The doctrine recognizes the "well-known fact that women, especially Filipinos, would not admit that they have been abused unless that abuse had actually happened, [because it is] their natural instinct to protect their honor."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>However, as discussed in <i>People v. Amarela</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the opinion enshrined under the <i>Women's Honor</i> doctrine borders on the fallacy of <i>non-sequitur</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote>While the factual setting back then would have been appropriate to say it is natural for a woman to be reluctant in disclosing a sexual assault; today we simply cannot be stuck to the <i>Maria Clara</i> stereotype of a demure and reserved Filipino woman. We should stay away from such mindset and accept the realities of a woman's dynamic role in society today; she who has over the years transformed into a strong and confidently intelligent and beautiful person, willing to fight for her rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>Through this, the Court can evaluate the weight and credibility of a private complainant of rape without gender bias or cultural misconception.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>It is a settled rule that rape may be proven by the sole and uncorroborated testimony of the offended party, provided that her testimony is clear, positive, and probable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The Supreme Court is guided by jurisprudence in addressing the issue of credibility of witnesses. <i>First</i>, <b>the credibility of witnesses is best addressed by the trial court</b>, considering that it is in a unique position to directly observe the demeanor of a witness on the stand.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Since the trial judge is in the best position to determine the truthfulness of witnesses, the judge's evaluation of the witnesses' testimonies is given the highest respect, on appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <i>Second</i>, <b>in the absence of substantial reason to justify the reversal of the RTC's assessments and conclusions, the reviewing court is generally bound by the lower court's finding</b>, particularly when no significant facts and circumstances, affecting the outcome of the case, are shown to have been disregarded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <i>Third</i>, <b>the rule is even more stringently applied if the CA concurred with the RTC.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In this case, according to accused-appellant Nocido, there were discernible improbabilities in AAA's testimony which would militate against giving full credit to AAA's testimony.<br><br>According to Nocido, the discrepancies lie in regard to AAA's testimony, as to who were holding AAA's arms when she was pulled into a vacant house. During her direct examination, she testified that Ventura and Bagon were holding her:<br><blockquote>Q: Will you please tell the Honorable Court how you were brought to that vacant house from that alley you were mentioning before?<br>A: [Ventura] and [Bagon] were holding me sir.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>Q: You mentioned that the two held you, how about the other, what did he do while the two you mentioned here [were] holding you?<br>A: He was holding a speaker because he was walking ahead of us, sir.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>Q: So both your hands or arms were being held by the two, [Bagon] and [Ventura] and you were pulled, correct?<br>A: It was [Bagon] who was pulling me, sir.<br><br>Q: How about [Ventura]? He was just holding your hand?<br>A: Yes, sir.<br><br>Q: How about Neil Raymond Nocido alias Arabo, what was his participation in transferring or in bringing you to the vacant house from there?<br>A: He was going ahead of us and he was the one who opened the door, sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>However, during her cross-examination AAA testified that it was Bagon and Nocido who held her arms:<br><blockquote>Q: Nung naglalakad na kayo hawak-hawak ka ba nila?<br>A: Si [Bagon] po.<br><br>Q: Si [Bagon] lang ang naghahawak sa iyo?<br>A: At saka po si [Nocido].<br><br>Q: Silang dalawa ang naghahawak sa iyo?<br>A: Opo tapos nasa liked po si [Ventura].<br><br>Q: Ano ang ginagawa ni [Ventura] kung alam mo?<br>A: Nasa likod lang po siya sumusunod.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote>The alleged inconsistency is a trivial matter which cannot be a basis for acquittal. This is because the inconsistency does not hinge on any essential element of the crime of rape or lascivious conduct.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The fact is that, AAA was pulled and led by appellant, together with the other two co-accused, in a vacant house, where AAA was raped and sexually abused.<br><br>For as long as the testimonies of AAA are coherent and intrinsically believable, the minor inconsistencies in her narration of facts do not detract from their essential credibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Rather, the minor inconsistencies enhance credibility as they manifest spontaneity and lack of scheming.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Nocido also pointed out AAA's testimony when she mentioned that during her ordeal, she neither screamed nor offered any tenacious resistance. According to Nocido, AAA did not seek help or resisted, even if she was capable of doing so:<br><blockquote>Q: How far is the nearest neighbor of that vacant house?<br>A: <i>Dikit-dikit po ang mga bahay.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>xxxx<br><br>Q: <i>Pero sa itaas noon may tao?</i><br>A:Opo.<br><br>Q: Habang ikaw ay hin[a]h[a]lay nila hindi sila nagsalita?<br>A: Opo.<br><br>Q: Hindi ka rin nagsalita?<br>A: Opo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote>The failure of AAA to shout and resist while the three accused committed rape and acts of lasciviousness, is not tantamount to her consent.<br><br>Neither tenacious resistance nor a determined or a persistent physical struggle on the part the victim of rape and/or lascivious conduct, is necessary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Moreover, failure to cry for help or attempt to escape during the rape and/or sexual abuse, is not fatal to the charge of rape or lascivious conduct.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> It does not make voluntary the victim's submission to the lusts of the perpetrators.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> For as long as threats and intimidation are employed, and the victim submits herself to her perpetrators because of fear, her physical resistance need not be established in the said crimes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Here, AAA did not scream or offered tenacious resistance because of the threat and intimidation employed against her. AAA testified that whenever she struggled to get free from the three accused, the latter beat her up, and when she was about to scream for help, Bagon covered her mouth and threatened to kill her, <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>Q: Tapos nung nilapitan ka nya, ano ang nangyari?<br>A: Tinutukan nya po ko.<br><br>Q: Tinutukan ka ng? <br>A: Kutsilyo po.<br><br>Q: Saan ka tinutukan? <br>A: Sa leeg po una.<br><br>Q: Sinabi mo una.

In contrast, in case of sexual intercourse with a child who is 12 years old or below 18 and who is deemed "exploited in prostitution or other sexual abuse," the crime could not be rape under the RPC, because this no longer falls under the concept of statutory rape, and the victim indulged in sexual intercourse either "for money, profit or any other consideration or due to coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group," which deemed the child as one "exploited in prostitution or other sexual abuse."<br></blockquote>Applying these principles to the case at bar, the Court affirms the ruling of the CA in convicting Nocido of rape under Article 266-A(1)(a) of the RPC.<br><br>Under Article 266-A(1)(a), rape through sexual intercourse is committed: (1) by a man; (2) who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman; (3) through force, threat or intimidation.<br><br>On the other hand, the proper designation of the crime of rape by sexual assault committed against a victim who is twelve (12) years old or below eighteen (18) or eighteen (18) under special circumstances, is lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610, to wit:<br><blockquote>xxxx<br><br>(b) Those <b>who commit the act of</b> sexual intercourse or <b>lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution <u>or subject to other sexual abuse</u></b>; Provided, That when the victims is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period.<br></blockquote>The penalty for Lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610 is <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, which is higher than the prescribed penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> to <i>reclusion temporal</i> as provided under Article 266-B of the RPC, for the crime of rape by sexual assault committed by two (2) or more persons.

Nocido (Nocido) for the crimes he was charged with.<br><br>I disagree, however, that the nomenclature of the crime should be modified from "rape by sexual assault" to "lascivious conduct under Section 5(b), Republic Act No. 7610," and the penalty increased from "<i>prision mayor</i> to <i>reclusion temporal</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> to "<i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>I reiterate and maintain my position in <i>People v. Tulagan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> that Republic Act No. (RA) 7610 and the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by RA 8353, "have different spheres of application; they exist to complement each other such that there would be no gaps in our criminal laws. They were not meant to operate simultaneously in each and every case of sexual abuse committed against minors."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Section 5(b) of RA 7610 applies only to the <u><b>specific</b></u> and <u><b>limited instances</b></u> where the child-victim is "exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse" (EPSOSA).<br><br>In other words, for an act to be considered under the purview of Section 5(b), RA 7610, so as to trigger the higher penalty provided therein, "the following essential elements need to be proved: (1) the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (2) the said act is performed with a child 'exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse'; and (3) the child whether male or female, is below 18 years of age."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Hence, it is not enough that the victim be under 18 years of age. The element of the victim being EPSOSA - <i>a separate and distinct element</i> - must first be both alleged and proved before a conviction under Section 5(b), RA 7610 may be reached.<br><br>Specifically, in order to impose the higher penalty provided in Section 5(b) as compared to Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353, it must be <b>alleged</b> and <b>proved</b> that the child - (1) for money, profit, or any other consideration or (2) due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group-indulges in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Information only alleged that the victim was a 12-year­old minor, but it did not allege that she was EPSOSA. Likewise, there was no proof or evidence presented during the trial that she indulged in sexual intercourse of lascivious conduct either for a consideration, or due to the coercion or influence of any adult.<br><br>Thus, while I agree that Nocido's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt, it is my view that his conviction in Criminal Case No. 09-1773 should be for Rape by Sexual Assault, defined and punished under Article 266-A(2), in relation to Article 266-B, of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353 - not Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b), RA 7610.
