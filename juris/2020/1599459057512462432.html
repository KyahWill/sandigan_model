While she was at the center of the road and attempting to cross its second half, she was sideswiped by a 14-wheeler prime mover truck at the junction of Gov. Ramos Street and Sta.

No cost. </p> <p><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The RTC found no evidence of recklessness that can be attributed to the driver of the truck. PO3 Marlon V. Agbalos (PO3 Agbalos) testified that he cannot point to any negligent act of the driver, since the truck was coursing through the proper lane when the incident happened. The RTC concluded that Catalina was not bumped on the front side of the truck but most probably on the left side of the vehicle, as she appeared not to have been run over by its front tire. The RTC surmised that the victim may have attempted to cross the street while the truck was already in motion and traffic was already moving on both sides of the street when she was sideswiped. Since there is no finding of negligence or recklessness on the part of the driver, the RTC concluded that the action for quasi-delict based on ES Trucking's vicarious liability must fail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p align="center"><b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b> </p><p> In the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> dated February 15, 2018, the CA affirmed the ruling of the RTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The CA held that it was incorrect for the Heirs of Catalina to conclude that a criminal conviction will establish ES Trucking's civil liability. For the CA, even if there is such negligence, the employer may defend itself through proof that it exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of its employees. To rule otherwise will create an absurd result, where the case for quasi-delict is already prejudged and predetermined by the guilty verdict in the Reckless Imprudence case, thus rendering the proceedings in the former without purpose at all.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It was ruled that judicial notice of the subsequent finality of the judgment of the MTCC in the Reckless Imprudence case is discretionary only.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p>Based on the records, the CA found that there was no sufficient evidence of negligence because: (1) none of the petitioners' witnesses saw the moment of impact; (2) ES Trucking's witnesses saw no person walk across the street or in front of the truck; (3) there was no warning beforehand that a person could have crossed the street as there was no possible threat or obstacle in front of the truck; and (4) the police investigator confirmed that he saw no evidence of negligent driving. The CA concluded that the death of Catalina was brought a bout by a terrible accident, which could only be blamed on being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The CA noted that caution and exercise of due diligence must be exercised by all persons, drivers, and pedestrians alike in the use of streets.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> The Heirs of Catalina filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> in the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated September 25, 2018. </p><p> In the present petition, the Heirs of Catalina maintain that ES Trucking did not exercise due diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of the driver because it hired a driver who did not have the necessary training for driving a trailer truck pursuant to Department Order No. 2011-25 issued by Department of Transportation (DOTr).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The Heirs of Catalina further argue that the Court should take cognizance of the existence of negligence established from the driver's conviction. As the Heirs of Catalina argue on the belief that ES Trucking is a common carrier, there is a presumption of negligence that may only be defeated if evidence of observance of the diligence required by law is presented. Due to the alleged failure of ES Trucking to present such evidence, the Heirs of Catalina insist that they are entitled to damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> On the other hand, ES Trucking insists in its Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> that it cannot be held vicariously liable for damages as there is no sufficient evidence that Timtim was negligent. ES Trucking argues that it had successfully proven its diligence not only in the selection but also in the supervision of its driver.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p align="center"><b>Issues</b> </p><p> The issues to be resolved are: </p><blockquote> <p> (1) Whether Clin Timtim was negligent in driving the vehicle that caused the death of Catalina to hold his employer ES Trucking liable under Article 2180 of the New Civil Code; <br> (2) Whether the complaint for quasi-delict against ES Trucking, Timtim's employer, may proceed independently of the criminal action for Reckless Imprudence resulting to Homicide;<br> (3) Whether ES Trucking is a common carrier required by law to observe extraordinary diligence in the carriage of passengers and goods.<br> (4) Whether ES Trucking exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of its driver, Timtim; and<br> (5) Whether the Heirs of Catalina are entitled to damages. </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> <b><i><u>Timtim was recklessly driving<br> the prime mover truck that caused <br> the death of Catalina Mendoza.</u></i></b> </p><p> It would be a grave injustice to simply accept the testimony of PO3 Agbalos and adopt the conclusion of the CA that the terrible incident "could only be blamed on being in the wrong place at the wrong time."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> This incident would not have happened had Timtim been vigilant in checking his front, rear, and side mirrors for any obstruction on the road, and had he timely stepped on his breaks to avoid hitting Catalina. </p><p> Contrary to the ruling of the lower courts, the fact that the truck was traveling on the right lane when the incident happened does not automatically mean that the driver was not negligent. Catalina had already crossed half of the road when she was sideswiped by the vehicle driven by Timtim. This is the reason why her body was found under the fuel tank behind the left front wheel of the truck.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Had he been driving with caution, he would have seen that Catalina was already attempting to cross the second half of the road in front of him. A prudent driver would have immediately slowed down and stopped the vehicle to give way to the pedestrian crossing the road.</p><p> It is also worthy to point out that in the Appellee's Brief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which ES Trucking filed with the CA, the conviction of Timtim for Reckless Imprudence resulting in Homicide in Criminal Case NO. 50864 (1-6564) was admitted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The finding of negligence on the part of Timtim made by the MTCC is consistent with Our pronouncement that Timtim was negligent at the time of the incident. </p><table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i><u>A civil case for quasi-delict may proceed independently against Timtim's employer, ES Trucking.</u></i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Under the Rules, when "a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged shall be deemed instituted with the criminal action unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves the right to institute it separately or institutes the civil action prior to the criminal action."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> However, the civil action referred to in Articles 32, 33, 34, and 2176 of the New Civil Code shall "proceed independently of the criminal action and shall require only a preponderance of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p>Furthermore, it is explicitly stated in Article 2177 of the Civil Code that responsibility arising from quasi-delict "is entirely separate and distinct from the civil liability arising from negligence under the Penal Code."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The same rule finds support from Article 31 of the same Code which states that when "the civil action is based on an obligation not arising from the act or omission complained of as a felony, such civil action may proceed independently of the criminal proceedings and regardless of the result of the latter."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the criminal case for reckless imprudence resulting to homicide instituted against Timtim, a civil case for quasi-delict may proceed independently against Timtim's employer, ES Trucking, under Article 2180 of the New Civil Code. </p><table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i><u>ES Trucking is considered a common carrier required to secure a Certificate of Public Convenience.</u></i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Article 1732 of the Civil Code defines common carriers as persons, corporations, firms or associations engaged in the business of carrying or transporting passengers or goods or both, by land, water, or air, for compensation, offering their services to the public. </p><p> The Land Transportation and Traffic Code distinguished the classification of vehicles as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x x</p> <p> (a) <i>Private</i>. - Motor vehicles registered under this classification shall not be used for hire under any circumstance.<br> (b) <i>For Hire</i>.- Motor vehicles registered under this classification are those covered by certificates of public convenience, or special permits issued by the Board of Transportation, and shall be subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder, as well as the provisions of this Act.</p> <p>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The requirement for vehicles for hire to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) was emphasized in LTFRB Memorandum Circular Number 98-027 which explicitly states: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="24%" valign="middle"><div align="left">Subject: </div></td> <td width="76%"><div align="justify"><b>FRANCHISE FOR DUMP TRUCK AND OTHER PRIVATE VEHICLES USED AS "FOR HIRE"</b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Pursuant to the provisions of Section 13 of C.A.

Noticeably, Edgardo Ruste admitted that they filed an application to have the vehicle included in their Certificate of Public Convenience yet their application was never granted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> This is inconsistent with his own claim that ES Trucking does not need to register with the LTFRB because it is not a common carrier but a private company.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The fact that they considered applying for the inclusion of the vehicle in their Certificate of Public Convenience signifies that they are aware of the franchise requirement of the LTFRB. ES Trucking cannot be excused simply because it is not registered with the LTFRB and it is a private company. ES Trucking cannot be exonerated from liability and benefit from its own violation of the laws and rules governing trucks for hire.</p> <p> As an entity engaged in the truck for hire business, it should have complied with the requirements of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code and the issuances of the LTFRB. Despite being registered as a private vehicle, the actual use of the vehicle and the clientele to whom ES Trucking offers its services remain controlling. The failure to register the vehicle as a public vehicle or a common carrier does not negate the true nature of the vehicle. It is settled that: </p><blockquote> <p> A certificate of public convenience is not a requisite for the incurring of liability under the Civil Code provisions governing common carriers. That liability arises the moment a person or firm acts as a common carrier, without regard to whether or not such carrier has also complied with the requirements of the applicable regulatory statute and implementing regulations and has been granted a certificate of public convenience or other franchise. To exempt private respondent from the liabilities of a common carrier because he has not secured the necessary certificate of public convenience, would be offensive to sound public policy; that would be to reward private respondent precisely for failing to comply with applicable statutory requirements. The business of a common carrier impinges directly and intimately upon the safety and wellbeing and property of those members of the general community who happen to deal with such carrier. The law imposes duties and liabilities upon common carriers for the safety and protection of those who utilize their services and the law cannot allow a common carrier to render such duties and liabilities merely facultative by simply failing to obtain the necessary permits and authorizations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Moreover, a careful scrutiny of the vehicle reveals that, while the plate number of the trailer was in the color yellow, signifying that it is a public utility vehicle, the prime mover truck's plate number was in the color green, signifying that it is registered as a private vehicle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> As admitted by PO3 Agbalos and Edgardo Ruste, vehicles covered by a Certificate of Public Convenience are issued yellow plates, while private vehicles are issued green or white plates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In this case, the prime mover truck was issued a green plate, while the trailer attached to it at the time of the incident had a yellow plate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> We cannot simply ignore the vital information that the trailer attached to the prime mover truck carried a yellow plate. It would be absurd to consider the prime mover truck private when it is offered for hire to the public. It would also be contrary to logic to consider only the trailer with the yellow plate as public utility vehicle, because the trailer cannot be moved and utilized for its intended purpose without being attached to the prime mover truck. It is more sensible to conclude that ES Trucking is a common carrier and that the prime mover truck should have been covered by a Certificate of Public Convenience.</p><p> It is also important to point out that the vehicle had been registered under the name of ES Trucking as early as September 17, 2009, yet the vehicle remained unregistered with the LTFRB at the time of the incident. The Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> dated July 29, 2013 of the LTFRB showed that ES Trucking failed to register the subject vehicle as "FOR HIRE" within one month from the receipt of the approved franchise in accordance with the conditions of the certificate of public convenience, particularly paragraph 2 therein. Thus, the certificate of public convenience granted in favor of ES Trucking on April 27, 2011 was cancelled on February 3, 2012. </p><table width="50%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i><u>ES Trucking is required to observe due diligence in the selection and supervision of employees pursuant to Article 2180 of the Civil Code.</u></i></b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The basis for the liability of an employer of an erring driver resulting to injury or damage to a stranger may be found in Articles 2176 and 2180 of the New Civil Code, which state: </p><blockquote> <p> Art. 2176. Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done. Such fault or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is called a quasi-delict and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter. (1902a)</p> <p> Art. 2180. The obligation imposed by Article 2176 is demandable not only for one's own acts or omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one is responsible. </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> The owners and managers of an establishment or enterprise are likewise responsible for damages caused by their employees in the service of the branches in which the latter are employed or on the occasion of their functions. </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p>The responsibility treated of in this article shall cease when the persons herein mentioned prove that they observed all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage. (1903a) </p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, it has been proven by preponderant evidence that Timtim recklessly drove the prime mover truck which caused the death of Catalina. Although the employer is not the actual tortfeasor, the law makes the employer vicariously liable on the basis of the civil law principle of <i>paterfamilias</i> for failure to exercise due care and vigilance over the acts of one's subordinates to prevent damage to another. When the employee causes damage due to his own negligence while performing his own duties, there arises a presumption that the employer is negligent. This may be rebutted only by proof of observance of the diligence of a good father of a family. The "diligence of a good father" referred to in the last paragraph of Article 2180 means diligence in the selection and supervision of employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p><p> In the selection of its prospective employees, the employer is required to examine them as to their qualifications, experience, and service records. ES Trucking did not require Timtim to present any document other than his professional driver's license and job application form.

Having failed to present proof that Timtim possesses the requisite certification from TESDA, ES Trucking cannot claim to have exercised due diligence in the selection and supervision of its employees.</p> <p> ES Trucking was not only negligent in hiring Timtim but even in supervising the latter. ES Trucking permitted Timtim to drive the subject vehicle to transport goods of its customers knowing that the vehicle is not duly registered with the LTFRB.</p><p> In addition, it must be highlighted that ES Trucking is not only at fault for blatantly disregarding pertinent laws and rules governing trucks for hire but is also guilty of violating its undertaking to preserve the vehicle in its original state while the case is pending.
