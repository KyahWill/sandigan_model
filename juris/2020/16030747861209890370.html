Respondents posit that since Hepatitis C infection is transferred only through blood to blood transfusion, he should have stated the concrete instance or event when he contracted his illness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>Issues</b> </p><p> The issues to be resolved in this petition are: </p><ol><li> Whether Rosales' Chronic Hepatitis C and fatty liver are work-related and compensable; and</li><li> Whether Rosales is entitled to full disability benefits on account of his medical condition. </li></ol> <p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the Court</b> </p><p> Rosales' Chronic Hepatitis C and fatty liver are work-related, thus compensable.</p><p> Chronic Hepatitis C is an ailment caused by a bloodborne virus. The World Health Organization explained the various modes of infection of Hepatitis C virus as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x [T]he most common modes of infection are through exposure to small quantities of blood. This may happen through injection drug use, unsafe injection practices, unsafe health care, transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products, and sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood.</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> HCV can also be transmitted sexually and can be passed from an infected mother to her baby; however, these modes of transmission are less common.</p> <p> Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, water or casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The enumerated causes are just several modes of transmitting the virus to another individual. The enumeration did not necessarily exclude other modes of transmitting the virus. Although less common, the virus may even be transmitted by sharing a razor or a toothbrush with one who is infected with the virus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> Viral Hepatitis is listed as an occupational disease under the POEA-SEC that is work-related and compensable when contracted during the term of the employee's contract. Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC states: </p><blockquote> <p> Sec. 32-A. <i>Occupational Diseases.</i> </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> 23. Viral Hepatitis.<br> In addition to working conditions already listed under Philippine Decree No. 626, as amended, any occupation involving exposure to a source of infection through ingestion of water, milk, or other foods contaminated with hepatitis virus; Provided that the physician determining the causal relationship between the employment and the illness should be able to indicate whether the disease of the afflicted worker manifested itself while he was so employed, knowing the incubation period thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, it was established through the February 25, 2015 Letter of the company-designated physician that the illness of Rosales, chronic Hepatitis C, "is acquired by exposure to infected blood through needle or instruments, blood transfusion, vertical transmission from mother to unborn child, sexual intercourse."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> While the viral Hepatitis considered occupational disease in the POEA-SEC is limited to those "spread through ingestion of water, milk, or other foods contaminated with hepatitis virus,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Section 20(A)(4) of the POEA-SEC provides that even those illnesses not listed in Section 32 are still disputably presumed work-related.</p><p> Despite not being a listed illness in Section 32, Chronic Hepatitis C is disputably presumed to be work-related. The conditions for compensability in Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC also apply to non-listed illnesses given that: (1) the legal presumption under Section 20(B)(4) accorded to the latter is limited only to "work-relatedness;" and (2) for its compensability, a reasonable connection between the nature of work on board the vessel and the illness contracted or aggravated must be shown. In <em>Romana v. Magsaysay Maritime Corporation</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> the Court explained that: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x [T]he presumption provided under Section 20 (B) (4) is only limited to the "work-relatedness" of an illness. It <b><u>does not cover and extend to <i>compensability</i>. In this sense, there exists a fine line between the work-relatedness of an illness and the matter of compensability</u></b>. The former concept merely relates to the assumption that the seafarer's illness, albeit not listed as an occupational disease, may have been contracted during and in connection with one's work, whereas compensability pertains to the entitlement to receive compensation and benefits upon a showing that his work conditions caused or at least increased the risk of contracting the disease. This can be gathered from Section 32-A of the 2000 POEA-SEC which already qualifies the listed disease as an "occupational disease" (in other words, a "work-related disease"), but nevertheless, mentions certain conditions for said disease to be compensable:</p> <p> SECTION 32-A OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES </p> <p> For an <b><i>occupational disease and the resulting disability or death to be compensable, all of the following conditions must be satisfied</i>:</b> </p> <p> 1. The seafarer's work must involve the risks described herein; <br> 2. The disease was contracted as a result of the seafarer's exposure to the described risks; <br> 3. The disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it;<br> 4. There was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer.</p> <p> As differentiated from the matter of work-relatedness, no legal prescription of compensability is accorded in favor of the seafarer. As such, he bears the burden of proving that these conditions are met.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>(Emphasis, italics, and underscoring supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Therefore, while Chronic Hepatitis C is not a listed occupational disease, the same standards laid down in Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC should be applied in determining the compensability of Rosales' illness. </p><p> There are two phases of Hepatitis C, "acute," meaning a new infection, and "chronic," meaning lifelong infection. Acute Hepatitis C "occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C can be a short-term illness, but for most people, acute infection leads to chronic infection."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> After this period has lapsed, "the hepatitis C virus enters what is known as the 'chronic phase'. This is when hepatitis C becomes a chronic of long-term infection."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> </p><p> In this case, it is clear, as it is highly probable, that Rosales contracted the Hepatitis C virus while he was on board the vessel. The incubation period or the time from the moment of exposure to an infectious agent until signs and symptoms of the disease appear for Hepatitis C ranges from two weeks to six months.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> It should be pointed out that Rosales boarded the vessel Queen Mary 2 on November 26, 2012<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and that he began complaining of abdominal muscle and joint pains on June 25, 2013, or more than six months from the time he boarded the vessel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Regardless of the phase or stage of his illness at the time he consulted the physician on board and began manifesting the symptoms of the illness, the chronology of the events leading to his repatriation and his medical treatments in the Philippines coincide with the incubation period of the illness. Considering the nature of his work - where he had to clean rooms, handle, segregate, and dispose waste materials including syringes and other bio-medical wastes - and the timeline leading to the diagnosis of illness, it can be safely concluded that he contracted Chronic Hepatitis C while on board Queen Mary 2. There is a reasonable connection between the nature of his work and the Hepatitis C virus he acquired during the period of his employment to justify the compensability of his illness. Thus, the company-designated physician's declaration that Rosales' Hepatitis C infection is not work-related is erroneous. </p><p> With regard to Rosales' fatty liver, We find the illness to be work-related too. Fatty liver (Steatosis) is common in people afflicted with Hepatitis C as a consequence of viral infection.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Considering that his fatty liver is attributed to his Chronic Hepatitis C illness, it is also work-related. </p><p><em><strong> Rosales is entitled to permanent total disability benefits.</strong></em> </p><p> We find basis for the award of permanent total disability benefits in favor of Rosales. The assessment should take into consideration the nature and severity of the work related illness in order to arrive at a disability grading that is commensurate to the illness sustained. In<i> Talaroc v. Arpaphil Shipping Corp</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> the Court summarized the rules governing claims for permanent and total disability benefits in relation to the 120-day and 240- day rule as follows: </p><ol><li> The company-designated physician must issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer's disability grading within a period of 120 days from the time the seafarer reported to him; <br></li><li> If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable reason, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total;<br></li><li>If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days with a sufficient justification <i>(e.g.</i>, seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be extended to 240 days. The employer has the burden to prove that the company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the period; and<br></li><li>If the company-designated physician still fails to give his assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total, regardless of any justification.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (Citation omitted) </li></ol> <p> The POEA-SEC, which is incorporated in the contract or the governing law between a seafarer and his employer, provides that the disability assessment shall be based on the schedule of disability suffered and disease contracted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> It must be pointed out that the grade 12 medical assessment given by the company-designated physician was made known to Rosales on February 25, 2014, or 218 days from his repatriation on July 22, 2013. A careful study of the February 25, 2014 Letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> of the company-designated physician stating the assessment and disability grading recommended shows that it is not the final and definitive assessment contemplated by the POEA-SEC. The relevant paragraph of the February 25, 2014 Letter states: </p><blockquote> <p> As per our Private and Confidential report dated January 9, 2014,<strong> the specialist recommends the patient to undergo Peg Interferon Therapy weekly with Ribavirin once daily for 6 months depending on his response to treatment.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Based on the cited paragraph, it is clear that the company-designated physician only issued an interim assessment. The February 25, 2014 Letter did not indicate whether the illness of Rosales was resolved. Instead, Rosales was recommended to undergo treatment for approximately six (6) months, depending on his response to the treatment. </p><p> In <i>Sunit v. OSM Maritime Services, Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> the Court emphasized: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>A final and definite disability assessment is necessary in order to truly reflect the true extent of the sickness or injuries of the seafarer and his or her capacity to resume work as such.</b> Otherwise, the corresponding disability benefits awarded might not be commensurate with the <b>prolonged effects of the injuries suffered</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Rosales properly commenced his complaint for disability compensation. To note, 254 days had already lapsed from the date of Rosales' repatriation on July 22, 2013 to the date of filing of the complaint on April 2, 2014. Without a final and definitive medical assessment from the company-designated physician within the 240-day extended period, the law steps in to consider the seafarer's disability as total and permanent. The inconclusive assessment and Rosales' prolonged illness highlighted that the company-designated physician failed to render a definitive assessment of his disability. There was no medical assessment for Rosales to challenge. Thus, there is no need to comply with the third-doctor referral provision under the POEA-SEC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Accordingly, Rosales is considered permanently and totally disabled.</p><p> Rosales should also be paid his sickness allowance during the period of his treatment with the company-designated physician pursuant to Section 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC, which states: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS. - </p> <p>A.

The period within which the seafarer shall be entitled to his sickness allowance shall not exceed 120 days.

Consistent with this mandate, the NLRC shall endeavor to update and keep abreast with the developments in the global services industry.</p> <p> The liability of the principal/employer and the recruitment/placement agency for any and all claims under this section shall be joint and several. This provision shall be incorporated in the contract for overseas employment and shall be a condition precedent for its approval. The performance bond to de filed by the recruitment/placement agency, as provided by law, shall be answerable for all money claims or damages that may be awarded to the workers. <u>If the recruitment/placement agency is a juridical being, the corporate officers and directors and partners as the case may be, shall themselves be jointly and solidarily liable with the corporation or partnership for the aforesaid claims and damages</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The Secretary's certificate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> attached to the Position Paper with Compulsory Counterclaim respondents filed in the NLRC states that she is the president of Singa Ship Management, Phils., Inc.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
