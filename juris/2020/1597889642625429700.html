Raymundo, Emerson D. Angeles, Lloyd T. Ison, Sherwin M. Odoño, Lemuel D. Venzon, and Ronald F. Caling (respondents) against respondent HZSC Realty Corporation (HZSC) and its President, herein petitioner, arising from HZSC's failure to rehire them after more than six (6) months from the temporary shutdown of its business operation due to business losses on January 23, 2015.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated April 29, 2016, the Labor Arbiter (LA) declared HZSC and petitioner guilty of illegal (constructive) dismissal for HZSC's failure to comply with the procedural requirements under Article 283 (now Article 298)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of the Labor Code, and ordered them to pay respondents their respective unpaid salary, separation pay, nominal damages, plus ten percent (10%) of the total monetary awards as attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, HZSC and petitioner appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).<br><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated June 30, 2016, the NLRC dismissed the appeal of HZSC and petitioner,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and thereafter, denied their motions for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated August 31, 2016.<br><br>Petitioner filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> before the CA, praying to be absolved from liability in the absence of any finding of malice and fraud on his part.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated September 23, 2016, the CA dismissed the petition for failure to comply with the required contents thereof, and the documents which should accompany it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Petitioner received his personal notice of the September 23, 2016 Resolution on October 5, 2016.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> On October 26, 2016, he filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> claiming that: (a) he received (referring to his counsel's receipt) notice of the September 23, 2016 Resolution on <u>October 11, 2016</u>; and (b) he had already remedied the procedural defects in his petition,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> attaching therewith an Amended Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated November 28, 2016, the CA denied the motion for reconsideration for having been belatedly filed. Hence, this petition claiming that petitioner's counsel, Atty. Ariel C. Santos (Atty. Santos), received notice of the September 23, 2016 Resolution on <u>October 17, 2016</u>, and as such, the motion for reconsideration was timely filed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated January 25, 2017, the Court required respondents to file their comment to the petition, and issued a TRO enjoining the NLRC from implementing its June 30, 2016 Decision and August 31, 2016 Resolution. Considering the discrepancy in petitioner's statements as to his counsel's receipt of notice of the September 23, 2016 Resolution, the Court resolved to direct the CA to elevate the complete records of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The sole issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA erred in dismissing the motion for reconsideration for having been belatedly filed.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Section 2, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court (Rules) provides that "[i]f any party has appeared by counsel, service upon him shall be made upon his counsel or one of them, unless service upon the party himself is ordered by the court." <b>Thus, even if a party represented by counsel has been actually notified, said notice is not considered notice in law.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> "The reason is simple - the parties, generally, have no formal education or knowledge of the rules of procedure, specifically, the mechanics of an appeal or availment of legal remedies; thus, they may also be unaware of the rights and duties of a litigant relative to the receipt of a decision. More importantly, it is best for the courts to deal only with one person in the interest of orderly procedure - either the lawyer retained by the party or the party him/herself if [he/she] does not intend to hire a lawyer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>As to service of court resolutions, Section 9, Rule 13 of the Rules pertinently provides:<br><blockquote>Section 9. <i>Service of judgments, final orders or resolutions</i>. - Judgments, final orders or resolutions shall be served either personally or by registered mail. When a party summoned by publication has failed to appear in the action, judgments, final orders or resolutions against him shall be served upon him also by publication at the expense of the prevailing party.<br></blockquote>In the case at bar, a copy of the September 23, 2016 Resolution was sent to Atty. Santos at his registered address in Meycauayan, Bulacan through registered Letter No. BDN-2291.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> On November 8, 2016, the CA sent a tracer<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> to the Postmaster of Meycauyan, Bulacan directing him to inform the court of the exact date when the said letter was delivered to and received by the addressee. However, prior to the receipt of the Postmaster's reply, the CA already issued its assailed November 28, 2016 Resolution denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration for having been belatedly filed, apparently reckoning the same from petitioner's receipt of his personal notice of the September 23, 2016 Resolution on October 5, 2016.<br><br>On December 2, 2016, the CA received the Postmaster's reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> to tracer informing the court that Atty. Santos received registered Letter No. BDN-2291 on <u>October 11, 2016</u>. Consequently, petitioner had fifteen (15) days from such receipt,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> or until October 26, 2016, within which to file his motion for reconsideration. Thus, petitioner's motion for reconsideration was timely filed, contrary to the ruling of the CA.<br><br>Accordingly, there is a need to remand the case to the CA to resolve the motion for reconsideration on the merits. Notably, petitioner had submitted, together with the said motion, an Amended Petition for <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> which he claims to have already rectified the procedural deficiencies cited by the CA in its September 23, 2016 Resolution. In view thereof, the other issues raised in this petition which involve mixed questions of fact and law on the substantive merits of the petition should properly be addressed to and resolved by the CA.<br><br>Finally, considering that petitioner raises as an issue the propriety of the order adjudging him solidarily liable with the non-operating<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> respondent, HZSC, for the individual respondents' money claims,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> which is yet to be resolved by the CA, the TRO<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> issued by the Court on January 25, 2017 enjoining the NLRC from implementing its June 30, 2016 Decision and August 31, 2016 Resolution stands until further orders from the Court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
