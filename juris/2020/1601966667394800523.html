Her mother, CCC, has a history of substance abuse; while her father, DDD, is nowhere to be found. Thus, AAA was left in the care of her maternal grandmother, BBB.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> On December 2007, BBB temporarily left AAA with her other daughter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Unbeknownst to BBB, her other daughter left AAA with accused appellant Eliseo, and his common-law wife, Teresita Catanjal (Teresita), at Pacita, San Pedro Laguna. BBB's sixteen-year-old nephew; Edward, resided with them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> On March 26, 2008, a day after her sixth birthday, AAA was dragged by Edward, into his bedroom where he raped her. Edward removed her shorts and underwear and inserted his penis into her vagina. AAA screamed in pain and bit Edward, but he covered her mouth then proceeded to shove his penis into her mouth. Upon removing his penis from her mouth, a white substance spilled onto her chest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Not contented, he also inserted his penis into her anal orifice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> On the evening of August 13, 2008, Teresita was confined in the hospital. On the same night, Eliseo entered the room where AAA was sleeping, laid beside her, removed her red blouse and shorts, and went on top of her. He then inserted his penis into her vagina and then her mouth. Afterwards, Eliseo told her to lie on her belly and inserted his penis into her anal orifice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p> AAA never told anyone of how Edward and Eliseo raped her while she was in their care. As a threat, Edward told her that he will place her inside a sack and throw her into the garbage truck or to the river, while Eliseo threatened her by saying that she will not be given any food.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p> Sometime in April 2009, BBB picked up AAA to bring her to Leyte where her half-siblings lived. At that time, Edward was also residing there to study college. One afternoon, Edward brought AAA to the river where he raped her and left her to drown with her head submerged in the water. Fortunately, her older cousin saw her drowning in the river and saved her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p> Sometime in June 2009, AAA started having difficulties sitting on the chair and suffered from a very high fever. She was then taken to the Eastern Visayas Medical Center in Tacloban City, where it was discovered that: (1) her sexual genitalia was infected; (2) her hymen had several lacerations; and (3) spermatozoa was found in the area."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p><p>On July 1, 2009, Edward raped AAA once again, this time in BBB's house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> At this point, AAA revealed to BBB that she was raped by Edward and Eliseo multiple times. Enraged by what she had heard, BBB went to the Department of Social Welfare and Development, which referred her to the Philippine General Hospital Child Protection Unit where AAA underwent several sessions with child psychiatrist Dr. Del Mundo-Nepumoceno.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> In the multiple sessions AAA had with Dr. Del Mundo-Nepumoceno, she consistently described the separate occasions when she was raped by both Edward and Eliseo. Consequently, Dr. Del Mundo-Nepumoceno confirmed in her psychiatric report that AAA was sexually abused but did not show signs of any post-psychological trauma.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p>BBB also brought the matter to the National Bureau of Investigation. Subsequently, Edward and Eliseo were charged with rape and rape by sexual assault.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p> For the defense, the witnesses presented were Edward and Eliseo, Ma.

Zenaida, Annalee's mother-in-law, likewise testified that she had no knowledge of what happened, but testified that Eliseo was not capable of committing rape as he was a retired ship captain and given his reputation as a good person.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> Edward, on the other hand, denied raping AAA sometime from April 2008 to May 2008, since he was enrolled in the Eastern Visayas State University in Leyte. He also stated that he could not have raped her on March 2008 since he was living with his parents at Chrysanthemum Village, San Pedro, Laguna at that time, while AAA was living with Eliseo at Olympia Village, San Pedro, Laguna. He, however, admitted that the two (2) houses were only 500 meters apart and would only take 15 minutes to get from one house to another on foot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p><p> After trial, the Regional Trial Court rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> convicting both Edward and Eliseo of the crimes charged.

Furthermore, the Court of Appeals ruled that between the positive and categorical statements of AAA and the bare denial of Edward and Eliseo, the former prevailed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> Aggrieved, Edward and Eliseo filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> with the Court of Appeals.</p><p> On October 19, 2016,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the Court of Appeals gave due course to Edward and Eliseo's appeal and forwarded the records of the case to this Court.</p><p> On June 7, 2017, this Court required the parties to simultaneously file their respective supplemental briefs and directed the Superintendent of the New Bilibid Prison, Bureau of Corrections, Muntinlupa City to confirm the confinement of both accused-appellants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p> In a Letter dated July 20, 2017, the Superintendent of the New Bilibid Prison, Roberto R.

Consequently, in this Court's January 17, 2018 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the case was considered closed and terminated as to him. An Entry of Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> was then issued certifying that the Resolution had become final and executory on April 2, 2018.</p><p> In his Appellant's Brief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> accused-appellant Eliseo put private complainant AAA's credibility in question, contending that the Regional Trial Court erred in basing their conviction on her testimony given that her allegations were contrary to common experience. He asserted that private complainant's lack of struggle, resistance, or the fact that she did not cry during the rapes was unnatural. He also claimed that the finding that she did not develop psychiatric problems afterwards posed further doubt on her testimony.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p> On the other hand, plaintiff-appellee, through the Office of the Solicitor General, argued in its Appellee's Brief<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> that the prosecution's evidence proved accused-appellants' guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It stressed that the candid and consistent testimony of private complainant, coupled with the physical examination report of Dr. Senado and psychiatric report of Dr. Del Mundo-Nepomuceno, prevails over the alibi and denial of accused-appellants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Plaintiff-appellee emphasized that this Court has held that a victim's revelation of being raped, along with a voluntary submission for a medical examination, with the willingness to endure public trial where one's dignity would be attacked, is more likely to be true than a mere concoction<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> as accused-appellants would have it.</p><p> Considering accused-appellant Edward's withdrawal of his appeal and the subsequent finality of his case as to him, the only question for this Court's resolution is whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in affirming accused-appellant Eliseo's conviction for one (1) count of rape and one (1) count of sexual assault. </p><p> We affirm accused-appellant Eliseo's conviction with modification considering recent jurisprudence.</p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> Article 266-A, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353 or the Anti-Rape Law of 1997, provide the following elements for the crimes of statutory rape and rape by sexual assault: </p><blockquote> <p> ARTICLE 266-A. <i>Rape: When and How Committed.</i> — Rape is committed: </p> <p> 1. By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: </p> <ol start="" type="a"><li> Through force, threat, or intimidation; <br><br></li><li>When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; <br><br></li><li>By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and<br><br></li><li><b><i>When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.</i></b> </li></ol> <p> 2. By any person who, under any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person. (Emphasis supplied). </p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>People v. Gutierez</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> this Court explained the elements of statutory rape: </p><blockquote> <p> Statutory rape is committed when (1) the offended party is under 12 years of age and (2) the accused has carnal knowledge of her, regardless of whether there was force, threat or intimidation; whether the victim was deprived of reason or consciousness; or whether it was done through fraud or grave abuse of authority. It is enough that the age of the victim is proven and that there was sexual intercourse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, private complainant's minority is not in debate. Her birth certificate was presented before the trial court to prove that she was six (6) years old at the time of the rape incidents, which was admitted by the trial court without any dispute from accused-appellants. Accordingly, the only issue at hand is whether accused-appellant Eliseo had carnal knowledge of the child. </p><p> This Court has held time and again that the trial court's factual findings and the conclusions of law based on these are given the highest respect due to its unique opportunity to observe the demeanor, attitude, and conduct of the witnesses while on the stand. In turn, the appellate courts will not disturb the trial court's factual findings unless it is shown that certain facts or circumstances that would substantially affect the result of the case have been overlooked or misinterpreted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In this case, both the trial court and appellate court found that the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellants had committed the crimes of statutory rape and rape by sexual assault.</p><p> The defense would have this Court strike down private complainant's testimony for being doubtful and against common human experience, since there was no narration of any form of struggle or resistance on her part during the commission of the rapes. They question her credibility due to her inaction during and after the commission of the crimes as well as the long interval between the alleged criminal acts and the reporting to the authorities.</p><p> The defense's contention has no merit whatsoever. </p><p> It has long been established that a victim's failure to struggle or resist an attack on his or her person does not, in any way, deteriorate his or her credibility. This Court has ruled that physical resistance need not be established to prove the commission of a rape or sexual assault, as the very nature of the crime entails the use of intimidation and fear that may paralyze a victim and force him or her to submit to the assailant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Furthermore, different people have varying reactions during moments of trauma; more so, a six (6) year old child being attacked by people whom she believed to be her protectors. In <i>Perez v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> this Court emphasized the reaction of a minor when faced with an event so traumatizing: </p><blockquote> <p> Behavioral psychology teaches us that, even among adults, people react to similar situations differently, and there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a startling or frightful experience. Let it be underscored that these cases involve victims of tender years, and with their simple, unsophisticated minds, they must not have fully understood and realized at first the repercussions of the contemptible nature of the acts committed against them. This Court has repeatedly stated that no standard form of behavior could be anticipated of a rape victim following her defilement, particularly a child who could not be expected to fully comprehend the ways of an adult.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> It must be emphasized that a six-year-old child cannot be expected to react similarly as an adult, given her limited understanding of the evils of this world and the desires of men who have no bounds. It is for the same reason that this Court cannot subscribe to the defense's assertion that private complainant's testimony should not be given weight. It is unfathomable that a six-year-old child would be able to describe in such detail how she was ravaged by men she considered protectors unless her statements were true. Her candid, straightforward, and consistent testimony must prevail over the self-serving allegations of the defense. Even when she was intimidated by the defense attorney, private complainant, who was then eight (8) years old, did not falter, proving the attorney's attempt to disparage her futile. Pertinent portions of private complainant's cross-examination by the defense attorney read as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> Atty. Navarroza: [AAA], you said the last time you were raped by [Eli]?<br> A: Opo<br> Q: Particularly, tell us specifically what do you really mean that you were raped by [Eli]? </p> <p>. . . . </p> <p> A: Hiniga n[i]ya po ako sa kama. <br> Atty. Navarroza: Is that all that [Eli] did to you? <br> A: Hindi po. <br> Q: What do you mean by ''hiniga n[i]ya po ako sa kama". Specifically what did he do[?] <br> A: Ginalaw niya po ako. <br> Q: When you said "ginalaw niya po ako", you mean [Eli] moved you? <br> A: Hindi po. <br> Q: What do you mean? <br> A: Nirape po. <br> Q: For the first time in your life [AAA], when did you hear the word rape? <br> A: Kay [Eli] po. </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Q: Is that the same complaint that you are now complaining before this Honorable Court against [Eli] the telling of you [Eli] about the word rape? [sic] <br> A: Hindi po. <br> Q: What is [it] that you are complaining about? <br> A: Kasi po nirape niya po ako. <br> Q: But do you not know what rape is all about. <br> A: Hindi po. <br> Q: So you merely do not understand the word rape? <br> A: Naiintindihan ko po.<br> Q: How do you understand, what do you mean by the word rape?<br> A: Ginalaw po. <br> Q: When you say "ginalaw" what do you mean by the word ginalaw? <br> A: Ni-rape po. </p> <p> Court: Anong ginalaw ni [Eli] sa katawan mo?<br> A: Yong ano po. <br> Q: Sabi mo ginalaw ka ni [Eli], sinabi mo ba iyon? <br> A: Opo. <br> Q: Anong ginalaw ni [Eli]? </p> <p> Court[:] <br> Ituro mo na lang, [AAA].<br> (Witness pointing to her private part) </p> <p>Atty.

Navarozza: By what part of the body of [Eli] you said was used to "ginalaw" your private part?<br> A: Yung ano po niya. <br> Q: What is that "ano" that you are referring to, Madam witness? <br> A: Yong titi niya po.<br> Q: When you said titi, what do you understand about it? <br> A: Yong ano po.</p> <p> [Prosecutor] De Leon[:] <br> Maybe we can use the sketch from the record of this case, representing the boy and the girl.</p> <p>. . . .</p> <p> Court: <br> Q: Okay, [AAA] tingnan mo ang picture na ito asan diyan ang titi? <br> A: (witness is pointing to the genitalia in the photograph) </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Atty. Navarozza: The actual thing that you said "titi", Madam Witness, how does it [look] like?<br> A: Mahaba po. <br> Q: When you said mahaba, how long? <br> A: (Witness depicting a length of four (4) inches). </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Atty. Navarroza: What did [Eli] do with that four inches [diameter] long object? <br> A: Pinasok po sa ano ko.<br> Q: When you said "pinasok po sa ano ko", what exactly did [Eli] do with that?<br> A: Pinasok po sa pepe ko po. <br> Q: How many times?<br> A: Madami po. </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Atty. Navarroza: When was that?<br> A: Noong pagka ospital ni [Teresita] <br> Q: How many days?<br> A: Isa lang po.<br> Q: When you said thing, that titi that you said was inserted in your vagina that was inserted in its entirety? [sic] <br> A: Hindi po. <br> Q: What part of that thing was inserted to your vagina? <br> A: Unahan po. </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Q: Aside from inserting the same into your vagina, no other else was done to you? <br> A: Meron pa po. <br> Q: What is that? <br> A: Pinasok niya po sa bibig ko po. <br> Q: Aside from that, no more else? <br> A: Meron pa po. <br> Q: What is that? <br> A: Pinasok sa puwet ko. <br> Q: When you said it was inserted or placed inside your mouth, what portion of that thing that was actually accommodated by your mouth? [sic] <br> A: Kaunti l[a]ng po. </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> Atty. Navarrozza: How were you able to say that it was inserted to your anus when as objected to and ruled upon by the court, you were not able to see the thing inserted? <br> A: Naramdaman ko [p]o. <br> Q: What did you feel when you said naramdaman?<br> A: Masakit po.<br> Q: So you presumed that it was the penis of the accused that was inserted to your anus? <br> A: Opo. <br> Q: How about when you said it was inserted to your vagina, did you see it? <br> A: Opo. <br> Q: What did you say to [Eli] about that? <br> A: Wala po. <br> Q: How about when you said it was inserted or placed into your mouth, did you also see it? <br> A: Opo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The excerpt of private complainant's testimony upon cross-examination shows her understanding of how she was touched and raped by accused-appellant Eliseo despite the defense's attempts to mislead and discredit her. Notwithstanding the many ways the questions were twisted, she remained consistent and categorical with her answers.</p><p> The fact that it took private complainant more than three (3) months to report the incidents of assault on her does not affect her credibility<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> in the slightest. She was left under accused-appellant Eliseo's care, lived in his house for months, and depended on him for the basic necessities of life. The moral ascendancy accused-appellant Eliseo had over her is enough to explain why she neither resisted the abuse as it was happening nor reported it afterwards for fear of being deprived of food, water, or a roof over her head. </p><p> Aside from private complainant's testimony, the prosecution also presented Dr. Senado, the medico-legal who conducted the physical examinations on private complainant and found that she sustained multiple injuries and lacerations in her hymen. In addition to this, Dr. Del Mundo-Nepomuceno, the child psychiatrist who interviewed private complainant, confirmed that her demeanor while recounting the events that transpired showed she was being truthful. Even BBB testified and initiated the filing of the complaints against him. Surely, she would not allow accused-appellant Eliseo to be subjected to the rigors and humiliation of a rape trial if she believed that the child's stories were mere concoctions. </p><p> Here, accused-appellant Eliseo's assertions were insufficient to show that the trial court erred and misapprehended any fact or evidence. He testified that on the night in issue, he was sleeping at the hospital to accompany his common-law wife. Yet, he did not present any witnesses to confirm that he was indeed at the hospital during the commission of the rape. His entire case relied on the twin defenses of denial and alibi. However, it has long been established that denial and alibi are not enough to overcome the victim's positive and categorical statements. For his defense of alibi to be credible, he must show that it was physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene when the crime was committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> This, he failed to do. </p><p> Given the concurrence of multiple circumstances which were attested to by a credible witness and corroborated by other evidence, this Court finds no reason to reverse the finding that accused-appellant Eliseo raped and sexually assaulted the victim. </p><p> Accordingly, this Court affirms the conviction of accused-appellant Eliseo for one (1) count of statutory rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code and the imposition of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. As to his civil liabilities for the crime of statutory rape, this Court reduces the award of damages to P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; P75,000.00 as moral damages; and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages in accordance with <i>People v. Jugueta</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p><p> As to the charge of one (1) count of rape by sexual assault under Article 266-A, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code, this Court affirms accused-appellant Eliseo's conviction subject to modification of its nomenclature to Sexual Assault under Article 266-A, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Section 5 (b) of Republic Act No. 7610 pursuant to the recent case of <em>People v. Tulagan</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> where this Court took the opportunity to reconcile the provisions of Acts of Lasciviousness, Rape, and Sexual Assault under the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353 <i>vis-à-vis</i> Sexual Intercourse and Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of Republic Act No. 7610 also known as the "Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act." It was held: </p><blockquote> <p> Concededly, R.A. No. 8353 defined specific acts constituting acts of lasciviousness as a distinct crime of "sexual assault," and increased the penalty thereof from <em>prision correccional</em> to <em>prision mayor</em>. But it was never the intention of the legislature to redefine the traditional concept of rape. The Congress merely upgraded the same from a "crime against chastity" (a private crime) to a "crime against persons" (a public crime) as a matter of policy and public interest in order to allow prosecution of such cases even without the complaint of the offended party, and to prevent extinguishment of criminal liability in such cases through express pardon by the offended party. Thus, other forms of acts of lasciviousness or lascivious conduct committed against a child, such as touching of other delicate parts other than the private organ or kissing a young girl with malice, are still punished as acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to R.A. No. 7610 or lascivious conduct under Section 5 of R.A. No. 7610. </p> <p>. . . .</p> <p> Considering the development of the crime of sexual assault from a mere "crime against chastity" in the form of acts of lasciviousness to a "crime against persons" akin to rape, as well as the rulings in <em>Dimakuta</em> and <em>Caoili</em>, We hold that if the acts constituting sexual assault are committed against a victim under 12 years of age or is demented, the nomenclature of the offense should now be "Sexual Assault under paragraph 2, Article 266-A of the RPC in relation to Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610" and no longer '"Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610," because sexual assault as a form of acts of lasciviousness is no longer covered by Article 336 but by Article 266-A (2) of the RPC, as amended by R.A. No. 8353. Nevertheless, the imposable penalty is still <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period, and not <em>prision mayor</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> The penalty imposed is likewise modified to <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period instead of <em>prision mayor</em> as prescribed in Article 266-A, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code pursuant to the aforequoted <em>People v. Tulagan </em>and <em>People v. Chingh y Parcia</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> which applied the penalty under Article III, Section 5 (b) of Republic Act No. 7610. Accordingly, after applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, accused-appellant Eliseo is thereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of 12 years, 10 months and 21 days of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years, six (6) months and twenty (20) days of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, as maximum. This Court also modifies the awards of civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages to P50,000.00 pursuant to <em>People v. Tulagan</em>. </p><p> Finally, this Court affirms that all damages shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the finality of judgment until fully paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p> WHEREFORE, the guilt of accused-appellant ELISEO SUMAYOD Y LAGUNZAD having been proved beyond reasonable doubt, his conviction for statutory rape and rape by sexual assault by the court a quo is <b>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</b> as follows: </p><ol start="" type="a"><li> In Crim.
