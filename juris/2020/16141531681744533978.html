				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before the Court is an ordinary appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by accused-appellant Ranie Estonilo y De Guzman (Estonilo) assailing the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated November 23, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 08617, which affirmed with modification the Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated, July 28, 2016 of the Regional Trial Court of <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span>, Pampanga, Branch 61 (RTC) in Criminal Case Nos. 10-5R94 and 10-5895, and accordingly, found Estonilo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of violation of Section 5 (a) (5), Article III of Republic Act No. (RA) 7610,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> otherwise known as the "Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation, and Discrimination Act."<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>This case stemmed from two (2) separate Informations filed before the RTC, each charging Estonilo of Qualified Trafficking in Persons, defined and penalized under Section 4, in relation to Section 6 (a) of RA 92058,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> otherwise known as the "Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003," the accusatory portions of which read:<br><blockquote><center><u><b>Criminal Case No.10-5894</b></u><br></center><br>e period from March 6, 2010 to March 13, 2010, in the <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span>, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and harbor, maintain, hire, provide and/or receive <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span>, a minor 12 years old, by any means or under the pretext of domestic employment or sexual exploitation taking advantage of the vulnerability of the minor in violation of Section 4 in relation to Sec. 6 (a) Republic Act No. 9208.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><center><u><b>Criminal Case No.10-5895</b></u><br></center><br>The period from March 6, 2010 to March 13, 2010, in the <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span>, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and harbor, maintain, hire, provide and/or receive <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> a minor 11 years old, by any means or under the pretext of domestic employment or sexual exploitation taking advantage of the vulnerability of the minor in violation of Section 4 in relation to Sec. 6 (a) Republic Act No. 9208.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>The prosecution claimed that sometime in January 2010, Estonilo approached AAA,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> then 12 years old, in an effort to convince the latter to "<i>mamakla</i>" in exchange for money. For this purpose, Estonilo even introduced him to a "client" who offered P2,000.00 for AAA's sexual services, but AAA refused. However, Estoni1o was persistent with his recruiting efforts, and this culminated in the evening of March 6, 2010. On that night, AAA was on his way home with his friend, BBB, then 11 years old, when Estonilo called their attention. Estonilo persistently coerced AAA to have sex with BBB at a nearby vacant lot in exchange for P300.00 so that they will learn how to perform sexual acts. The children acceded and had sexual contact with each other with AAA inserting his penis into BBB's mouth and anus. About a week later, or on March 13, 2010, AAA, BBB, and their friends were frolicking at a swimming pool when Estonilo arrived with his bicycle. Estonilo called AAA and told him to have sexual contact with BBB at a nearby bathroom. Fearing that Estonilo might get mad, AAA and BBB again had sexual contact with each other. At that time, Estonilo even suggested that AAA have sex with BBB's 11-year old aunt who was with them, but AAA refused. The next day, AAA felt pain while urinating, prompting his mother to bring him to a doctor. After examination, the doctor revealed that AAA contracted an infection because of anal intercourse and the same might progress into a sexually transmitted disease if left untreated. This resulted in AAA divulging his ordeal to his mother.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>For his part, Estonilo mainly relied on denials, averring that he does not know AAA or BBB personally, and that he is busy with his maintenance job in a hotel during weekdays and his <i>carinderia</i> during weekends.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated July 28, 2016, the RTC found Estonilo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of Qualified Trafficking in Persons, and accordingly, sentenced him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P2,000,000.00 for each count, and to pay AAA and BBB P20,000.00 each as moral damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The RTC found that the prosecution was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Estonilo took advantage of the vulnerability of two (2) minors, namely, AAA and BBB, to engage in sexual acts with one another in exchange for money. On this note, the RTC found untenable Estonilo's bare defenses of denial in the face of the clear and categorical testimonies made by both AAA and BBB describing their ordeal under the hands of Estonilo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Estonilo appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated November 23, 2017, the CA modified the RTC ruling, finding Estonilo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of the crime of violation of Section 5 (a), paragraph (5), Article III of RA 7610. Accordingly, the CA sentenced him to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as minimum, to twenty (20) years of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as maximum for each count, and ordered him to pay AAA and BBB each the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The CA held that the prosecution had indeed established beyond reasonable doubt the fact that Estonilo, through coercion and for monetary consideration, ordered AAA and BBB to engage in sexual conduct with one another. However, it opined that Estonilo could not be held criminally liable for Qualified Trafficking in Persons, as it was not shown that Estonilo committed acts of trafficking, <i>i.e.</i>, how he recruited, obtained, hired, provided, offered, transported, transferred, maintained, harbored, or received AAA and/or BBB for the purpose of trafficking. This notwithstanding and applying the variance doctrine as enunciated in Sections 4 and 5, Rule 120 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, the CA ruled that Estonilo's acts of offering money and imposing his will on the victims constitute a violation of Section 5 (a), paragraph (5), Article III of RA 7610, and as such, he must be held criminally liable therefor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not Estonilo should be held criminally liable for his supposed acts against AAA and BBB.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>As a preliminary matter, the general rule is that appeals of criminal cases shall be brought to the Court by filing a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> before it under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> except when the CA imposed the penalty of "<i>reclusion perpetua</i>, life imprisonment or a lesser penalty," in which case, the appeal shall be made by a mere notice of appeal filed before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> In this case, Estonilo clearly availed of a wrong mode of appeal by filing a Notice of Appeal before the CA<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> despite the latter court modifying his conviction to a crime not punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or life imprisonment. Nonetheless, in the interest of substantial justice, the Court will resolve this case on the merits in order to resolve the substantial issue at hand with finality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Guided by the foregoing consideration, and as will be explained hereunder, the Court deems it proper to reinstate the RTC ruling convicting Estonilo of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 4 (a) in relation to Section 6 (a) of RA 9208.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Section 3 (a) of RA 9208 defines the term "Trafficking in Persons" as the "recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the persons, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs." The same provision further provides that "[t]he recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered as 'trafficking in persons' even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph." In this regard, Section 4 of the same law provides the acts constituting "Trafficking in Persons."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Portions of this provision pertinent to this case read:<br><blockquote>SECTION 4. <i>Acts of Trafficking in Persons</i>. - It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts:<br><br>(a) To recruit, transport, transfer, harbor, provide, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage; xxx<br></blockquote>For a successful prosecution of Trafficking in Persons, the following elements must be shown: (<i>a</i>) the <i>act</i> of "recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders"; (<i>b</i>) the <i>means</i> used which include "threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another;" and (<i>c</i>) the <i>purpose</i> of trafficking is exploitation which includes "exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In addition, Section 6 of RA 9208 provides that the crime is qualified when, <i>inter alia</i>, the trafficked person is a child, to wit:<br><blockquote> SECTION 6. <i>Qualified Trafficking in Persons</i>. - The following are considered as qualified trafficking:<br><br>(a) When the trafficked person is a child; xxx<br></blockquote>In this case, the courts <i>a quo</i> found that the prosecution, through the testimonies of both AAA and BBB, was able to establish that Estonilo had indeed befriended the two (2) minors in order to recruit them and thereafter, pimp them to his clients. For this purpose, he was able to take advantage of AAA and BBB's minority and coerce them into committing sexual acts with one another, under the pretext that they needed to learn how to perform such acts with fellow males so that they can earn monetary consideration for the same. Hence, the Court finds no reason to overturn the findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, as there was no showing that they overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case. It bears pointing out that the RTC was in the best position to assess and determine the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> As such, Estonilo's criminal liability for the aforesaid acts must stand.<br><br>In this regard, the CA erred in opining that no trafficking existed as "there was no person to whom [Estonilo] endorsed or recruited his victims,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and further stressing that the sexual acts transpired not between AAA or BBB and any of Estonilo's clients, but between AAA and BBB themselves.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> As aptly pointed out by Associate Justice Ramon Paul L. Hernando, neither the presence of the trafficker's clients, nor their intercourse with the victim/s, is required to support a finding of trafficking. As held in <i>People v. Aguirre</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><blockquote>Furthermore, <b>the presence of the trafficker's clients is not an element of the crime of recruitment or transportation of victims</b> under Sections 3 (a) and 4 (a) of RA 9208. In the same vein, the law does not require that the victims be transported to or be found in a brothel or a prostitution den for such crime of recruitment or transportation to be committed. In fact, it has been held that the act of sexual intercourse need not have been consummated for recruitment to be said to have taken place. <u><b>It is sufficient that the accused has lured, enticed[,] or engaged its victims or transported them for the established purpose of exploitation, which includes prostitution, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, and the removal or sale of organs.</b></u> In this case, the prosecution has satisfactorily established accused-appellants' recruitment and transportation of private complainants for purposes of prostitution and sexual exploitation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, the fact that neither AAA nor BBB had sexual contact with any of Estonilo's clients will not affect the latter's criminal liability for Qualified Trafficking in Persons. To be sure, the gravamen of the crime of trafficking is "the act of recruiting or using, with or without consent, a fellow human being for [<i>inter alia</i>,] sexual exploitation"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> - which, as already discussed, was established to have been committed by Estonilo.<br><br>Anent the proper penalty to be imposed on Estonilo, Section 10 (c) of RA 9208 states that persons found guilty of Qualified Trafficking shall suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than P2,000,000.00 but not more than P5,000,000.00, for each count thereof. Finally, and pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence, Estonilo must also pay AAA and BBB each the amounts of P500,000.00 as moral damages and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages, plus legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum from finality of judgment until full payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>.
