SP No. 03926-MIN, filed by petitioner Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).<br><br><center><b>Antecedents</b><br></center><br>The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) placed a parcel of land consisting of 42.046 hectares, owned by respondents Heirs of Bartolome J.

The properly was valued at P623,725.35, which the Heirs of Sanchez found unreasonable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Hence, in 2002, the Heirs of Sanchez filed a complaint for the determination of just compensation in the Regional Trial Court (RTC) sitting as a Special Agrarian Court (SAC).<br><br>During pre-trial the parties agreed to appoint commissioners for the valuation of the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Thereafter, the appointed commissioners manifested their request for the full payment of their fees in the amount of P120,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Special Agrarian Court</b><br></center><br>On December 15, 2009, the SAC issued its Order,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>IN VIEW THEREOF, the foregoing manifestation is hereby noted.

Invoking the Pre-Trial Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated December 8, 2004 of the RTC, they insist that both parties agreed to refer the matter of land valuation to independent commissioners. They also aver that the amount of P120,000.00 is fair and just, considering the scope and complexity of the job of commissioners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>(1) Whether LBP, in the exercise of its governmental functions as a financial intermediary of the agrarian reform program of the government, is exempt from paying commissioners' fees; and<br><br>(2) Assuming arguendo that LBP is liable to pay commissioners' fees, whether the amount of P120,000.00 is legally justified.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br><b><i>Petitioner LBP is exempt from paying commissioners' fees.</i></b><br><br>The role of LBP in agrarian refom1 is more than just the ministerial duty of keeping and disbursing the Agrarian Reform Funds. LBP is also primarily responsible for the valuation and determination of just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In the case of <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Gonzales</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Ibarra</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> We ruled that LBP is exempt from paying the costs of the suit pursuant to Section 1, Rule 142 of the Rules, since it is an instrumentality performing a governmental function in agrarian reform proceedings charged with the disbursement of public funds. Recently, in the case of <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Baldoza</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> We reiterated that since LBP is performing a governmental function in an agrarian rcfonn proceeding, it is exempt from payment of costs of suit, including commissioners' fees, as it is considered part of costs of suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Section 12, Rule 67 of the Rules states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 12. <i>Costs, by whom paid</i>. - The fees of the commissioners shall be taxed as a part of the costs of the proceedings. All costs, except those of rival claimants litigating their claims, shall be paid by the plaintiff, unless an appeal is taken by the owner of the property and the judgment is affirmed, in which event the costs of the appeal shall be paid by the owner.<br></blockquote>It must also be pointed out that the conclusion of the CA that the "plaintiff" referred to in Section 12 of Rule 67 of the Rules is the DAR, through LBP, is erroneous.<br><br>In the case of <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Baldoza</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Court explained that it is the Republic of the Philippines (Republic), which is referred to as the "plaintiff" for it initiates complaints for eminent domain. The complaint is filed by the Republic to determine the propriety of the exercise of the power of eminent domain in the context of the facts involved in the suit. After determining the right of the Republic to exercise the power, determination of just compensation shall proceed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> However, the Court pointed out that:<br><blockquote>x x x [I]n agrarian expropriation cases, the owner of the property may voluntarily offer to sell his land as sanctioned in DAR A.O. No. 03, series of 1989. Appropriately, <b>the initial case filed with the RTC-SAC</b> is not for the determination of the propriety of the exercise of the power of eminent domain, but <b>for the resolution of the proper valuation of the property if the landowner disagrees with the findings of the DAR</b>[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>In this case, the "plaintiff," who initiated the complaint for the determination of just compensation, is not the Republic, but the Heirs of Sanchez, who found the valuation of the property made by DAR unacceptable. Therefore, even applying Section 12, Rule 67 of the Rules to the agrarian reform proceeding, the conclusion remains the same. LBP is not liable to pay commissioners' fees.<br><br><b><i>It is premature to declare the amount of P120,000.00 commissioners' fees legally justified.</i></b><br><br>Section 16, Rule 141 of the Rules states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 16. <i>Fees of commissioners in eminent domain proceedings</i>. - The commissioners appointed to appraise land sought to be condemned for public uses in accordance with these rules shall each receive a compensation to be fixed by the court of NOT LESS THAN [THREE HUNDRED] (P300.00) [PESOS] per day <b>for the time actually and necessarily employed in the performance of their duties and in making their report to the court</b>, which fees shall be taxed as a part of the costs of the proceedings. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>In this case, a declaration that the amount of P120,000.00 commissioners' fees is legally justified, at this stage of the proceedings, would be premature, and requires the remand of the case to the SAC. As pointed out by LBP, the case is still in the trial stage. Moreover, the commissioners have not submitted their report up to now, since the other commissioners have not taken their oath yet. The proper amount of commissioners' fees to be paid by the Heirs of Sanchez must be based on time actually spent by the commissioners in performing their duties and in making their report, as stated in Section 16, Rule 141 of the Rules.<br><br>Accordingly, We disagree with the ruling of the CA ordering LBP to pay for the commissioners' fees. Nevertheless, We find that the CA correctly directed the SAC to make a detailed computation of the commissioners' fees based on the time actually and necessarily devoted by the commissioners in the performance of their duties, consistent with Section 16, Rule 141 of the Rules.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated September 16, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
