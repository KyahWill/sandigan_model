Petitioners merely alleged that they were terminated by their chief cook and were barred from entering the restaurant, without offering any evidence to prove the same. They failed to provide any document, notice of termination or even any letter or correspondence regarding their termination. Aside from their bare allegations, they did not present any proof which would at least indicate that they were in fact dismissed. </p><p> <b>On the contrary, the evidence on record points to the fact that after petitioners failed to report on December 25,2011, and after they went back to their workplace merely to get their share in the tips the following day, they refused to return to work and continued to be on AWOL thereafter.</b> <i>First</i>, it is undisputed that petitioners went on AWOL on December 25, 2011 (half day for Salmasan).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> <i>Second</i>, they in fact returned the following day to claim and receive their share in the tips as shown from the uncontroverted sign up sheet they signed,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> which belies their assertion that they were banned from entering the premises after being absent on December 25, 2011. <i>Third</i>, petitioners themselves admitted that they continued to be on AWOL during "the Christmas season of 2011".<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> This was likewise reflected on their time cards.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></p><p> As correctly found by the NLRC: </p><blockquote> <p> In their Position Paper, complainants describe the manner by which they were allegedly dismissed, as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p> <i>"x x x Complainant Santos went to work only for half day only on December 25, 2011 so that they could celebrate Christmas with his family in Pampanga. When he reported to work on December 27, 2011, he was verbally informed by the supervisor and chief cook Joel Aroy not to report to work anymore because he was already terminated from his employment due to his one day absence. Complainant Salmasan on his part absented himself on December 25, 2011 to likewise celebrate Christmas with his family. The following day, he immediately reported back to work and started doing his work assignment. However, when he was seen by their supervisor and chief cook Joel Aroy, he, same with complainant Santos was verbally terminated from his employment. </i></p> <p> <i>No valid explanation was given to complainants why they were being terminated from employment. Despite the same, they still tried to report to work and even made follow-ups through telephone calls. They were banned from entering the premises of King Chef hence on January 20, 2012; they filed this labor complaint against respondents."</i> (p. 10, Records) </p> </blockquote> <p> However, when Respondents declared that despite Complainants' absences on December 25, 2011 (half day for Complainant Efren Santos), <b><u>both Complainants reported on December 26, 2011 merely to collect their share of the tips for the period 11 to 25 December 2011, and exhibited proof to this claim by the document which Respondents describe as the December 26, 2011 "Sign Up Sheet", Complainants simply kept a silent stance.</u></b> </p> <p> By these alone, three (3) facts are established: (1) that both Complainants absented themselves on December 25, 2011[,] a Christmas Day, without leave, hence, they were on Absence Without Leave or AWOL on that day; <b><u>(2) that nevertheless, both came on December 26, 2011 merely to get their share of the period's tips; (3) that it is not true that Complainant Santos reported for work on December 27, 2011, and Complainant Salmasan reported on December 26, 2011 to work: as Complainants have not presented any proof to this claim.</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Even worse, petitioners made untruthful allegations in their pleadings. They claimed that they filed the complaint for illegal dismissal on January 20, 2012, but the NLRC found that it was filed earlier, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> The correct date Complain[an]t filed their complaint is of interest to Us. Complainants claim that they filed this case on January 20, 2012 (p. 10, Records), while Respondents reckon the date as January 2, 2012 (p. 21, Records). Carefully examining the records, We find Complainants['] claim as at best evasive. The Minutes of the Single Entry Approach (SENA) is dated January 19, 2012 (p. 4, Records) with the parties already in attendance. <b><u>This can only lead to the conclusion that Complainants had actually gone to NLRC earlier as claimed by Respondents, that is on January 2, 201[2]</u></b>. So that by January 19, 2012, the Respondents had already been notified of Complainants' action, and had appeared in the conciliation hearing. </p> <p> <b><u>This gives credence to the claim of Respondents that then they had no time yet to discipline Complainants, when the latter filed this case. As noted above, "the Christmas season" during which complainants incurred their "only infraction" of having been "absented themselves"</u></b> x x x started from December 24, 2011 and ended on January 1, 2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Considering the above circumstances and taking them all together, We are inclined to agree with respondents that before they could even impose disciplinary action upon the petitioners, they already filed the complaint for illegal dismissal on January 2, 2012, just when the Christmas season was over.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></p><p> <b>"Without substantial evidence that petitioners were indeed dismissed, it is futile to determine the legality or illegality of their supposed dismissal."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> We are thus constrained to uphold the NLRC's ruling, as affirmed by the CA, that there was no illegal dismissal in this case.</b> </p><p> Be that as it may, respondents are not correct in arguing that there was abandonment on the part of the petitioners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> "Abandonment is a matter of intention and cannot lightly be presumed from certain equivocal acts."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The employer must prove that <i>first</i>, the employee "failed to report for work for an unjustifiable reason," and s<i>econd</i>, the "overt acts showing the employee's clear intention to sever their ties with their employer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> </p><p> There was no showing here that petitioners' absences were due to unjustifiable reason, or that petitioners clearly intended to terminate their employment. It does not suffice that petitioners pre-empted respondents by filing the complaint for illegal dismissal before respondents can impose disciplinary action. "The operative act is still the employees' ultimate act of putting an end to their employment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> </p><p> "In cases where there is both an absence of illegal dismissal on the part of the employer and an absence of abandonment on the part of the employees, the remedy is reinstatement but without backwages."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> However, considering that petitioners do not pray for such relief, "each party must bear [their] own loss," placing them on equal footing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Thus, the NLRC, as affirmed by the CA, is correct in deleting the award of separation pay to petitioners. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
