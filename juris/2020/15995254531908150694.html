On September 7, 1994, VSD bought the said property from Felisa Bonifacio, whose title thereto, TCT No. 265777, was registered by virtue of an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated October 8, 1992 of Judge Geronimo S. Mangay, RTC of Caloocan City, Branch 125, authorizing the segregation of two lots, Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A (the subject property in this case) and Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-B, Psd-706, in Land Registration Commission (<i>LRC</i>) Case No. C-3288, entitled "<i>In the Matter of Petition for Authority to Segregate an Area of 5,630.1 Sq. mtrs. From Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-B, Psd 706 (Psu-2345) of Maysilo Estate and Issuance of Separate Certificates of Title in the name of Felisa D. Bonifacio</i>." VSD alleged that its right to the subject property, and the validity and correctness of the technical description and location of the property are duly established in LRC Case No. C-3288. VSD claimed that its title, TCT No. T-285312, is the correct, valid and legal document that covers the subject property since it is the result of land registration proceedings in accordance with the law.<br><br>Petitioner VSD alleged that the technical description of respondent Baello's title, TCT No. (35788) 12754, is so general that it is impossible to determine with certainty the exact location of the property covered by it and the technical description has no legal basis per the records of the Land Management Bureau and the Bureau of Lands. Moreover, Baello's title described the property to be Lot 3-A of subdivision plan Psd-706, but an examination of Psd-706 shows that there is no Lot 3-A in plan Psd-706. Thus, VSD contends that Baello has no legal basis to claim the subject property and Baello's title is spurious and illegal, and should be annulled. Hence, VSD sought recovery of possession of the subject property and the payment of rent from respondents.<br><br>In her Answer, Baello alleged that the subject property was bequeathed to her through a will by her adoptive mother, Jacoba Galauran. She alleged that during the lifetime of Jacoba Galauran, the subject property was originally surveyed on January 24-26, 1923<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and, thereafter, on December 29, 1924.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Baello alleged that after Jacoba Galauran died in 1952, her will was duly approved by the probate court, the Court of First Instance, Pasig, Rizal. Baello averred that she registered the subject property in her name, and TCT No. (35788) 12754<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> was issued in her favor on September 6, 1954. In 1959, she had the subject property surveyed. On July 15, 1988, she entered into a Contract of Lease<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> with respondent Uniwide which erected in full public view the building it presently occupies. Baello stated that she has been religiously paying realty taxes for the subject property,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and that VSD's complaint should be dismissed as she enjoys a superior right over the subject property because the registration of her title predates the registration ofVSD's title by at least 40 years.<br><br>On October 2, 2000, the trial court rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in favor of petitioner VSD. The trial court held that the evidence for VSD showed that it is the rightful owner of the subject lot covered by TCT No. T-285312 of the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City. The lot was purchased by VSD from Felisa Bonifacio, who became the owner thereof by virtue of her petition for segregation of the subject property from OCT No. 994 of the Register of Deeds of Rizal in LRC Case No. C-3288. TCT No. 265777 was issued to Felisa Bonifacio pursuant to an Order dated October 8, 1992 by the RTC of Caloocan City in LRC Case No. C-3288. The trial court found that the technical description in respondent Baello's title is not the same as the technical description in VSD's title, and that a mere reading of the technical description in VSD's title and that in Baello's title would show that they are not one and the same. Moreover, the technical description of the subject lot in VSD's title is recorded with the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The trial court stated that in the face of documentary and testimonial evidence of competent government witnesses who affirmed VSD's right to the technical description, it was incumbent on Baello to present credible evidence to overcome the same, but she failed to do so. The trial court held that VSD proved its ownership and the identity of the subject property that it sought to recover, which is an essential requisite in its action for annulment of title and recovery of possession of property. The trial court also held that Baello is the holder of a title over a lot entirely different and not in any way related to VSD's title and its technical description. The dispositive portion of the trial com1's Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing considerations, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the following:<br><br>1. Declaring TCT No. 35788 [12754] to be null and void;<br><br>2. Defendant Baello and all persons/entity claiming title under her, including UNIWIDE, to convey and to return the property to plaintiff VSD on the basis of the latter's full, complete, valid and legal ownership;<br><br>3. Defendant Baello and UNIWIDE, jointly and severally, to pay a just and reasonable compensation per month of P1,200,000.00 with legal interest for the occupancy and use of plaintiffs land from September 12, 1994, until actually vacated by them;<br><br>4. Defendants, jointly and severally, to pay attorney's fees of P200,000.00.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondents Uniwide and Baello appealed the trial court's decision to the Court of Appeals.<br><br>In a Decision dated May 30, 2005, the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of respondents Uniwide and Baello. The <i>fallo</i> of the Decision of the Court of Appeals reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the assailed Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City, Branch 126, in Civil Case No. C-16933 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one entered DISMISSING the instant complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals stated that the main issue to be resolved was whether or not there was a valid ground to annul Baello's title, TCT No. (35788) 12754, to warrant the reconveyance of the subject property to VSD. The Court of Appeals said that while VSD sought to annul Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 on the ground that the same was spurious, it failed to prove that Baello's title was indeed spurious. It held that since there was no legal basis for the annulment of Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754, the trial court erred in declaring the said title null and void. It stated that a Torrens title is generally conclusive evidence of ownership of the land referred to therein, and a strong presumption exists that it was regularly issued and valid. Hence, the Court of Appeals held that Baello's title enjoys the presumption of validity.<br><br>VSD's motion for reconsideration was denied by the Court of Appeals in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated December 6, 2005.<br><br>VSD filed a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the Court of Appeals' decision before this Court. The Court discussed the pertinent issues raised with the main issues: whether or not VSD is entitled to recover possession of the subject property and whether or not the title of Baello may be annulled.<br><br>The Court stated that Article 434<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of the Civil Code provides that to successfully maintain an action to recover the ownership of a real property, the person who claims a better right to it must prove two (2) things: <i>first</i>, the identity of the land claimed; and <i>second</i>, his title thereto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>As Baello failed to clearly establish that the technical description of her title pertains to the subject property, the Court upheld the decision of the trial comt that VSD was able to establish through documentary and testimonial evidence that the technical description of its Torrens title, embodying the identity of the land claimed, covers the property that is being occupied by Uniwide by virtue of a lease contract with Baello, and that a comparison of the technical description of the land covered by the title of VSD and the technical description of the land covered by the title of Baello shows that they are not the same. The dispositive portion of the Court's Decision dated October 24, 2012 reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Decision of the Court of Appeals dated May 30, 2005 and its Resolution dated December 6, 2005, in CA-G.R. CV No. 69824, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City, Branch 126, in Civil Case No. C-16933 is REINSTATED with MODIFICATION as follows:<br><br>(1) Paragraph 1 of the dispositive portion of the Decision dated October 2, 2000 of the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City, Branch 126, in Civil Case No. C-16933, is deleted;<br><br>(2) Respondent Dolores Baello and all persons/entities claiming title under her, including respondent Uniwide Sales, Inc., are ordered to convey and to return the property or the lot covered by TCT No. T-285312 to petitioner VSD Realty and Development Corporation upon finality of this Decision;<br><br>(3) Respondent Dolores Baello is ordered to pay just and reasonable compensation for the occupancy and use of the land of petitioner VSD Realty and Development Corporation in the amount of P58,333.30 per month from September 12, 1994 until the Decision is final and executory, with legal interest of six percent (6%) per annum reckoned from the filing of the Complaint on June 8, 1995 until the finality of this Decision. Thereafter, respondent Uniwide Sales, Inc. is jointly and severally liable with Dolores Baello for the payment to petitioner VSD Realty and Development Corporation of monthly rental in the amount of P58,333.30 from the finality of this Decision until the land is actually vacated, with twelve percent (12%) interest per annum.<br><br>(4) The award of attorney's fees is deleted.<br><br>No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Respondent Baello filed a motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of the Court's decision, contending that the Court erred (1) in not holding that petitioner VSD's TCT No. T-285312 is null and void, having been derived from the fake and non-existent OCT No. 994 dated April 19, 1917; (2) when it made a finding that Baello's title (TCT No. [35788] 12754) does not cover the subject property; (3) in finding that VSD was able to prove that it has a better right to the subject property by mere presentation of its TCT No. T-285312 and by showing that the title's technical description conectly described the subject property; (4) in not holding that Baello enjoys a superior right to the disputed property because the registration of her title predated the registration of VSD's title by at least 40 years; and (5) in ordering Baello to pay monthly compensation to VSD.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On February 13, 2013, Baello,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> by counsel, filed a <i>Motion for Leave and Time to File Judicial Affidavit of Mr. Felino Cortez and Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Decision dated 24 October 2012)</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In the said motion, Baello contended that subsequent to the filing of her motion for reconsideration, she discovered new evidence, not available at the time of trial and of the filing of her motion for reconsideration, which established that VSD's TCT No. T-285312 cannot be traced to the legitimate and authentic OCT No. 994; hence, VSD's title is null and void. Baello's daughter, Ma. Bernadette Flores, requested Mr. Pelino Cortez, retired and former Director on Registration of the Land Registration Authority (LRA), to conduct an investigation on VSD's TCT No. T-285312. Mr. Cortez examined the documents with the LRA and the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City, and he allegedly found that the copy of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 that was presented to the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City, for the purpose of the issuance of VSD's TCT No. T-285312, was tampered to fraudulently reflect that it was derived from the legitimate and authentic OCT No. 994 dated May 3, 1917. It is alleged that the original microfilm copy retained by the LRA shows that the same TCT No. 265777/T-1325 did not originate from the legitimate and authentic OCT No. 994 dated May 3, 1917, but was instead derived from a certain OCT No. 994 dated April 19, 1912. In view of this development, in the interest of justice, and to protect Baello's constitutional right to property, as well as to avoid a conflicting ruling by the Court, Baello begged the indulgence of the Court to grant her motion, which was granted by the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On March 14, 2013, Baello, by counsel, filed a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Decision dated 24 October 2012)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> on the following grounds: (1) Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325, from which VSD derived its title, is null and void, having been derived from a fake and non­ existent OCT No. 994, and Felisa Bonifacio's title cannot be traced back to the legitimate and authentic OCT No. 994 dated May 3, 1917; (2) a careful examination of Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 and VSD's TCT No. T-285312 will show that the technical descriptions of the land referred to in those titles both refer to the same parcel of land; and (3) Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 can be traced back to the legitimate OCT No. 994 dated May 3, 1917.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Petitioner VSD was required to file a comment on the motion for reconsideration. In its Comment on the motion for reconsideration and the supplemental motion for reconsideration, VSD contends that a valid title can arise even from an allegedly void title if a buyer in good faith, like VSD, intervenes; that the alleged nullity of its title cannot be raised for the first time on appeal; that additional evidence cannot be presented for the first time on appeal, more so in a motion for reconsideration before the Court; and that respondent Baello failed to prove that her title covers the subject property, among others.<br><br>The Court noted that <b><i>Manotok Realty, Inc. v. CLT Realty Development Corp.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> ruled that there is only one OCT No. 994, which is correctly registered on May 3, 1917, and that any title that traces its source to OCT No. 994 dated April [19],<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> 1917 is void, for such mother title is inexistent.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br>Considering the importance of protecting our Torrens system from fake land titles and deeds, and in the interest of justice, the Court, which is not a trier of facts, issued the Resolution dated July 31, 2013, remanding the case to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings to determine which of the parties derived valid title from the legitimate OCT No. 994 registered on May 3, 1917, and who is entitled to claim ownership over the disputed lot.<br><br>Pursuant to the Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, the case was raffled station wide to Associate Justice Carmelita S.

Moreover, Felisa Bonifacio could not validly sell the lot to VSD because her predecessors-in-interest, Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio and Maria de la Concepcion Vidal, did not have a legal right to the subject property, since the shares of Maria de la Concepcion Vidal in the Maysilo Estate were Lot 6 and portions of Lots 10 and 17, but not Lot 23-A from which the subject property, Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A, originated.<br><br>VSD derived its title to the disputed lot from Felisa Bonifacio through a sale on September 7, 1994. Felisa Bonifacio's title, TCT No. 265777/T-1325, was issued by the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City on March 29, 1993, pursuant to the Order dated October 8, 1992 of Judge Geronimo S.

However, based on the findings contained in the Order dated October 8, 1992 of Judge Geronimo S. Mangay, RTC of Caloocan City, Branch 125, in LRC Case No. C-3288, Felisa Bonifacio's title stemmed from Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio through a Deed of Assignment, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>From the evidence presented the Court finds that in Case No. 4557 for Petition for Substitution of Names, in the Court of First Instance of Rizal Branch 1, the then Presiding Judge Cecilia Munoz Palma, issued an order dated May 25, 1962 (EXHIBIT "N") substituting Maria de la Conception Vidal as one of the registered owners of several parcels of land forming the Maysilo Estate and covered by among others Original Certificate No. 994 of the Register of Deeds of Rizal with among others Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio to the extent of 1/6 of 1-189/1,000 per cent of the entire Maysilo Estate. <b>On January 29, 1991 Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio executed in favor of Felisa D.

As requested by petitioner, Elpidio T. de Lara, Chief, Technical Services Section, Lands Management Sector, DENR, NCR, issued on June 20, 1990 two technical descriptions (EXHIBIT "J" and "K") covering the two lots. After the issuance of the technical descriptions, the petitioner requested Geodetic Engineer Jose R. Rodriguez to prepare a sketch plan of the two lots subject of this petition. As requested, Engr.

Thus, Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio had no right to substitute Maria de la Concepcion Vidal over Lot 23-A, and Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio could not validly convey any right to Lot 23-A or the subject property, known as Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A, Psd-706, covered by OCT No. 994, to Felisa Bonifacio by Deed of Assignment.<br><br>The Court of Appeals said:<br><blockquote>In <i>Phil-Ville Housing and Development Corporation v. Bonifacio</i> (2011), the Supreme Court, Third (3rd) Division already concluded that Maria de la Concepcion Vidal has no share in Lot 23-A, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Moreover, the Partition Plan of the Maysilo Estate shows that <b>Lot 23-A was awarded, not to Maria de la Concepcion Vidal, but to Isabel Tuason, Esperanza Tuason, Trinidad Jurado, Juan O Farrell and Angel O Farrell</b>. What Vidal received as her share were Lot 6 and portions of Lots 10 and 17, all subject to the usufructuary right of her mother Mercedes Delgado. This was not at all disputed by respondents.<br></blockquote>This finding is supported by the Department of Justice's August 18, 1997 Committee Report (Exhibit "20") which ascertained that Maria de la Concepcion Vidal's share in the Maysilo Estate pertains to Lot 6 and portions of Lots 10 and 17 only based on the document <i>Proyecto de Particion de la Hacienda de Maysilo</i> dated June 12, 1917.<br><br>Applying the foregoing, Felisa D. Bonifacio's claim of ownership over Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A is highly anomalous. Maria de la Concepcion Vidal did not have an interest or right over Lot 23-A pursuant to the <i>Proyecto de Particion de la Hacienda de Maysilo</i>. In that regard, Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio could not have acquired title over Lot 23-A by mere substitution. And, what Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio did not acquire, she cannot convey by Deed of Assignment to Felisa D. Bonifacio.<br><br>Furthermore, in <i>Syjuco v. Bonifacio</i> (2015), the Supreme Court First (1st) Division, relying on the Phil-Ville case, held, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>The same is true in this case. The Death Certificate of Eleuteria Rivera reveals that she was 96 years old when she died on February 22, 1997. That means that she must have been born in 1901. That makes Rivera two years older than her alleged grandmother Maria de la Concepcion Vidal who was born in 1903. Hence, it was physically impossible for Eleuteria Rivera to be an heir of Maria de la Concepcion Vidal.<br></blockquote>The foregoing pronouncement is in light of the CFI of Rizal's Order dated May 25, 1962 in LRC Case No. 4557 which allowed the substitution of Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio <i>et al.</i> in lieu of Maria de la Concepcion Vidal. Considering that it is physically impossible for Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio to be an heir of Maria de la Concepcion Vidal, this compounds the proposition that Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio could not have validly assigned her purported rights over the subject lot to Felisa D.

Q: What irregularities did you discover in Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 on file with the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City?<br><br>A: The copy of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 now on file with the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City is not the same as the microfilm of the same title on file in the Micrographic and Computer Division of the LRA.<br><br>46. Q: How is the copy of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 now on file with the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City different from the microfilm of the same title on file in the Micrographic and Computer Division of the LRA?<br><br>A: The microfilm of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 on file in the Micrographic and Computer Division of the LRA states that the land covered by said title was originally registered on 19 April 1912 as OCT No. 994.<br><br>On the other hand, the copy of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 on file with the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City indicates that the land covered by said title was originally registered on 3 May 1917 as OCT No. 994.<br><br>46.1. Q: You said that the microfilm of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 on file in the Micrographic and Computer Division of the LRA and the one on file with the Register of Deeds are different. If a copy of the microfilm of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 on file in the Micrographic and Computer Division of the LRA is shown to you, will you be able to identify the same?<br><br>A: Yes.<br><br>46.2. Q: I am showing to you a certified true copy of the microfilm of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 on file with the Micrographic and Computer Division of the LRA consisting of two (2) pages, which is attached to this Judicial Affidavit as Exhibit "9" and made an integral part thereof. What is the relation of this document to the microfilm of TCT No. 265777-T-1325 you previously mentioned?<br><br>A: It is the same document. It is a faithful reproduction of the certified true copy of the document I mentioned.<br><br><center>xxxx<br></center><br>47. Q: You mentioned that the copy of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 now on file with the Register of Deeds and the microfilm of the same title on file with the Micrographic and Computer Division of the LRA state different dates on when the land was originally registered as OCT 994, what is the significance of the difference in dates, if any?<br><br>A: In the case of <i>Phil-Ville Development Housing Corp. v. Maximo Bonifacio, [et al.] and Manotok Realty, Inc., and Manotok Estate Corporation vs. CLT Realty Development Corporation</i>, the Supreme Court held that "that there is only one OCT No. 994" and the same "was received for transcription by the Register of Deeds on 3 May 1917." Thus, in order to guide the proceedings before the Special Division which was tasked to hear and receive evidence, the Supreme Court laid down the following definitive conclusions:<br><br>... First, there is only one OCT 994. As it appears on the record, that mother title was received for transcription by the Register of Deeds on 3 May 1917, and that should be the date which should be reckoned as the date of registration of the title. It may also be acknowledged, as appears on the title, that OCT No. 994 resulted from the issuance of the decree of registration on [19] April 1917, although such date cannot be considered as the date of the title or the date when the title took effect.<br><center><br><center>xxxx<br></center></center><br>48. Q: In the course of your investigation of VSD's TCT No. 285312, what other irregularities did you find, if any?<br><br>A: In Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 that was reproduced from the microfilm of the same title on file with the LRA, it states that the land was originally registered in the Registration Book of the Office of the Register of Deeds of Manila and the volume and page no. are left blank. On the other hand, Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 now on file with the Register of Deeds of Caloocan states that the land was originally registered in the Registration Book of the Office of the Register of Deeds of Rizal and the volume and page number have corresponding entries.<br><br>In addition, in Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 on file with the LRA and the Register of Deeds, it states that the title was directly derived from OCT No. 994.<br><br>49. Q: Why do you say that the above entries are irregular?<br><br>A: First, they are irregular because the entries appearing in the microfilm of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 on file with the LRA and the one on file with the Register of Deeds of Caloocan are not the same. Second, the microfilm of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 on file with the LRA does not have the volume and page no. as entered in the Registration Book. Lastly, it states that Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 was derived directly from OCT 994, which is impossible considering that Lot 23-A has already been subdivided many times.<br><br>50. Q: Why do you say that Lot 23-A has been subdivided many times?<br><br><br>A: One of the lots covered by OCT 994 is Lot 23-A. On the other hand, the lot covered by Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 is referred to as Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A. A look at the lot description, referred to as Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A, shows that it has been subdivided many times. Every time a lot is subdivided, a corresponding number and /or letter is added to the lot description and a certificate of title is issued in favor of the owner. As an illustration, when Lot 23-A referred to in OCT 994 was subdivided, a number, in this case, the number 4, was added to the lot description. When it was further subdivided, a letter was added to the lot description, in this case, the letter B. Therefore, the lot description referred to in Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 (Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A) shows that it has been subdivided many times. If Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 was indeed derived directly from OCT 994, the lot description should have only been Lot 23-A-4. Thus, based on the lot description appearing on Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 itself, it is impossible that her title was directly derived from OCT 994.<br><br>51. Q: How does Lot 23-A having been subdivided many times make it impossible for Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 to have been directly derived from OCT 994?<br><br>A: As discussed above, since Lot 23-A has been subdivided many times, if Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 was indeed derived directly from OCT 994, then the lot description should have only been Lot 23-A-4. The addition of a corresponding number and/or letter to the lot description every time the lot is subdivided shows that Lot 23-A has been subdivided many times and it is impossible for Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 to have been derived directly from OCT 994.<br><br>52. Q: Do you know when a copy of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 was microfilmed by the LRA?<br><br>A: It was microfilmed by the LRA on 22 February 1994.<br><br>53. Q: When was the decision of the Supreme Court holding that "there is only one OCT No. 994" and the same "was received for transcription by the Register of Deeds on 3 May 1917" promulgated?<br><br>A: It was promulgated on 14 December 2007 and reiterated in a Decision dated 8 June 2011.<br><br>54. Q: Do you know why the copy of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 on file with the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City contains a different date as to the original registration of the property covered by said title?<br><br>A: If you look closely at the copy of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325, you will notice that the date 3rd May nineteen hundred and seventeen was superimposed on the date 19th April nineteen hundred and twelve. In fact, there are still faint markings of the original registration date on the face of the title. It is therefore clear that the date 3 May 1917 appearing on Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 was altered to make it appear that it originated from the legitimate and authentic OCT No. 994.<br><br>55. Q: Would you know the reason why the date 3rd May nineteen hundred and seventeen was superimposed on the date 19th April nineteen hundred and twelve on the copy of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325?<br><br>A: The obvious reason is to avoid the consequence of the Supreme Court's rulings in Manotok Realty, Inc., and Manotok Estate Corporation vs. CLT Realty Development Corporation and Phil-Ville Development Housing Corp. v. Maximo Bonifacio, [et al.] that there is only one OCT No. 994 xxx and the same "was received for transcription by the Register of Deeds on 3 May 1917". As early as December 1979, complaints for recovery of possession of propetiies covered by OCT 994 were tiled. The perpetrators of the alteration logically anticipated that their scheme will be discovered; hence, they caused the alteration to make it appear that their title was derived from the legitimate and authentic OCT 994 even before the Supreme Court Decisions were promulgated.<br><br>56. Q: You mentioned that VSD's TCT No. 285312 is derived from Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325. What date is indicated in VSD's TCT No. 285312 as the date when the property covered therein was originally registered as OCT No. 994?<br><br>A: VSD's TCT No. 285312 states that the property covered therein was originally registered as OCT No. 9[9]4 on 3rd May nineteen hundred and seventeen.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>According to the Court of Appeals, VSD did not offer any explanation in regard to the discrepancies in Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 on file with the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City and the microfilm thereof in the Micrographic and Computer Division of the LRA. However, VSD refuted Engr. Cortez's testimony insofar as he concluded that the alteration was done to evade the effects of the <i>Manotok</i> and <i>Phil-Ville</i> cases. The Court of Appeals reported:<br><blockquote>Adopting its expert witness' testimony, (Engr. Godofredo Limbo, Jr.['s] Reply-Affidavit), VSD rebuts Engr. Cortez'[s] conclusion, to wit:<br><br>90. Q: In Answer No. 55 of his Judicial Affidavit, Engr. Cortez concluded that the reason why the dates 3rd May nineteen hundred and seventeen was supposedly superimposed on the 19th April nineteen hundred and twelve on the copy ofFelisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 is to allegedly avoid the consequence of the Supreme Court's ruling in Manotok Realty, Inc. and Manotok Estate Corporation vs. CLT Realty Development Corporation, 540 SCRA 304 (2007) and Phil-Ville Development Housing Corp. vs. Maximo Bonifacio, et al., 651 SCRA 327 (2011) that there is only one OCT No. 994 and the same was received for transcription by the Register of Deeds on 03 May 1917. What is your reaction to this, if any?<br><br>A: I do not agree with Engr. Cortez's conclusion. Assuming arguendo that there was an alteration in TCT No. 265777/T-1325 which was registered on 29 March 1993, the alteration could have only been made between 22 February 1994, the date when TCT No. 265777/T-1325 was supposedly microfilmed in the LRA, and 08 September 1994, the date when TCT No. 285312 in the name ofVSD was registered. There is no issue as any alleged alteration in the title in the name of VSD.<br><br>Between 22 February and 08 September 1994, of the prevailing ruling was Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage Systems vs. Court of Appeals, 215 SCRA 783 (1992) ("the MWSS case") where it was held that the true and valid OCT No. 994 was registered on 19 April 1917, thus, there was no benefit when the date of TCT No. 265777/T-1325 was altered to reflect 03 May 1917. On the contrary, this was detrimental to Bonifacio since at that time, the true OCT No. 994 should have referred to 19 April as its registration date and not 03 May 1917.<br><br>There was no way it could have been anticipated that after almost fifteen (15) years, the Supreme Court would reverse its decision and hold that 03 May 1917 is the true date of registration of OCT No. 994.<br><br>Otherwise stated, the supposed alteration was intended to render TCT No. 265777/T-1325 invalid. However, the effect was actually opposite as it confirmed the fact that the OCT No. 994, upon which an annotation of the title is included, was actually registered on 03 May 1917.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals stated that VSD is insistent in pointing out three matters regarding the tampered title: (1) that the alteration or tampering is only apparent in Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325; (2) that the tampering or alteration, which was made to reflect TCT No. 265777/T-1325 as having originated from OCT No. 994 dated May 3, 1917, was done during the period when the MWSS case (1992) was the controlling Supreme Court ruling (OCT No. 994 dated April 19, 1917 was deemed legitimate/authentic); and (3) VSD is a purchaser for value and in good faith; thus, it must be accorded protection by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals asserted that notwithstanding the parties' disquisition, it is nevertheless conclusively established that the microfilmed version of TCT No. 265777/T-1325 reflects that its derivative title is OCT No. 994 dated April 19, 1912, while the title on file with the Caloocan Registry of Deeds reflects that its derivative title is OCT No. 994 dated May 3, 1917.<br><br>The Court of Appeals averred that the foregoing discrepancy in the certification of registration entries is evident proof of tampering and/or alteration (<i>res ipsa loquitur)</i>, but material evidence that would establish the author of the fraudulent act has not been adequately substantiated.<br><br>This Court agrees with the finding of the Court of Appeals that the discrepancies in the certification of registration entries in Felisa Bonifacio's title on file with the Caloocan Registry of Deeds and its microfilmed version in the Micrographic and Computer Division of the LRA are evident proof of tampering and alteration.<br><br><i>IV. Whether respondent Baello's TCT No. (35788)12754 can be traced back to the legitimate and authentic OCT No. 994 dated May 3, 1917.</i><br><br>The Court of Appeals found that respondent Baello's title to the disputed property can be traced back to the legitimate OCT No. 994 registered on May 3, 1917. It reported thus:<br><blockquote>Baello's title to the disputed lot is evidenced by TCT No. (35788) 12754 (Exhibits "1" and "28") which was issued on September 6, 1954. Baello derived her title from Jacoba Jacinto Galauran by way of succession as shown in Entry No. 65325 Fil. T-35788 annotated on the latter's title TCT No. 10300, to wit:<br><blockquote>Entry No. 65325 Fil.

TCT No. 8318 contains an annotation (number illegible and contents written in Spanish) dated February 16, 1926 which, by context, cancelled said title and issued TCT No. 10300 to TCT No. 10303.<br><br>For record purposes, TCT No. 10301 (Exhibit "22") was issued in the name of Monica Jacinto Galauran, TCT No. 1 0302 (Exhibit "23") was issued in the name of Candido J.

Reference to TCT No. 8004 is inscribed in OCT No. 994 (Exhibit "15-F") albeit the name of Vedasto Galino is not legible or does not appear.<br><br>On this matter, Baello cites <i>Phil-Ville Development and Housing Corporation v. Maximo Bonifacio et al.</i> (2011) where the Supreme Court recognizes the title of Vedasto Galino over TCT No. 8004, finding <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>On the other hand, Vedasto Galino, who was the holder of TCT No. 8004 registered on July 24, 1923 and to whom petitioner traces its titles, was among the successful petitioners in Civil Case No. 391 entitled <i>Rosario Negrao, et al. v.

Whether the technical description of the title of Baello covers the subject property.</i><br><br>Another important issue that was not ascertained with clarity in the lower court is whether the technical description in the respective titles of petitioner VSD and respondent Baello referred to the same property in dispute. To reiterate, Article 434 of the Civil Code provides that to successfully maintain an action to recover the ownership of a real property, the person who claims a better right to it must prove two (2) things: <i>first</i>, the identity of the land claimed; and <i>second</i>, his title thereto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> As stated by the trial court, documentary and testimonial evidence of competent government witnesses affirmed VSD's right to the technical description of the disputed lot, while Baello failed to overcome the same. She merely asserted, without more, that the technical description in her title covered the disputed property. (She failed to adduce in evidence TCT No. 10300/T-42, which contained the full technical description [boundary measurements] ofher property, and she failed to establish that the said technical description pertains to the same property in dispute.) The trial court found that a mere reading of the respective technical description in VSD's title and in Baello's title would show that they are not one and the same; hence, it held that Baello is the holder of a title over a lot entirely different and not in any way related to VSD's title and its technical description. The trial court, among others, annulled the title of Baello. The Court of Appeals held that there was no valid ground for the trial court to annul the title of Baello; hence, Baello's title enjoys the presumption of validity. This Court affirmed the trial court's ruling, but held that the nullification of Baello's title, without proof that it was procured through fraud, was void.<br><br>In the face of documentary evidence, as well as testimonial evidence of competent government witnesses affinning VSD's right to the technical description in its title to the disputed lot, and the insistence of Baello that the respective technical description in her title and VSD's title both refer to the same parcel of land, the Court of Appeals was tasked to determine whether or not the technical description in the title ofBaello covers the disputed lot.<br><br>In its Investigation Report, the Court of Appeals submitted that the technical description in the respective titles of Baello and VSD refer to the same lot, subject of the dispute. The Court of Appeals reported on the fifth issue thus:<br><blockquote><center><b>V.<br><br>Whether the technical description of the title of Baello covers the subject property</b><br></center><br>The subject property referred to for investigation of this Court is referred to as follows:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="10%"><div align="justify">In VSD's Title: </div></td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">Lot No. 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A of the subd.

Felino M. Cortez examined the entries in TCT No. (35788) 12754 (Exhibit "1"). Appearing thereon is the technical description of the land which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"Un terreno (Lote No. 3-A del plano de subdivision Psd-706, parte del Lote No. 23-A, plano original Psu-2345 de la Hacienda de Maysilo), situado en al Barrio de Balintawak, Municipio de Caloocan, Provincia de Rizal.

(Full technical description appears on Transfer Certificate of Title No. 10300/T-42).<br></blockquote>Pursuant to Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754, the full technical description (boundary measurements) is indicated in the derivative title TCT No. 10300/T-42. According to Engr. Cortez, after comparing the full technical description in the Baello Title and TCT No. 10300 with VSD's TCT No. 285312, he concludes that the property described therein pertains to one and the same lot, to wit:<br><blockquote>61. Q: What is your basis in saying that the lot numbers are the same?<br><br>A: The lot number of the land referred to in Ms. Baello's TCT No. (35788)12754 is 3-A, Psd-706 part of Lot 23-A of original plan PSU-2345, Hacienda de Maysilo. It is actually an abbreviation for Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A.<br><br>62. Q: What is your basis in saying that Lot No. 3-A, Psd-706 part of Lot 23-A of original plan PSU-2345, Hacienda de Maysilo appearing in Ms. Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 is actually an abbreviation of Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A?<br><br>A: Ms. Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 states that it refers to Lot 3-A, Psd-706 part of Lot 23-A of original plan PSU-2345, Hacienda de Maysilo. Ms. Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 is a derivative of TCT No. 10300, which also refers to Lot 3-A. As discussed above, TCT No. 10300 came from TCT No. 8318, which refers to "Lot No. 3 of the subdivision plan being a portion of Lot No. 23-A-4-B-2-A part of Lot No. 23-A of PSU 2345 - Amd-2, Maysilo Estate." This means th[a]t the land referred to in Ms. Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 forms a part of Lot 3, which is described in TCT No. 8318 as a pati of Lot No. 23-A-4-B-2-A. Thus, the land referred to in Ms. Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 can be completely described as Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A.<br></blockquote>To prove that Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 and VSD's TCT No. 285312 pertain to one and the same lot, Engr. Cortez, presents a comparative table of the adjoining boundaries contained in the technical description of the aforesaid titles, to wit:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="30%">&nbsp;</td><td width="35%"><div align="center">Ms. Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754</div></td><td width="35%"><div align="center">VSD's TCT No. 285312</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="middle"><div align="center">Northeast/East</div></td><td><div align="justify">On the NE (Northeast) along lines 1-2 by Lot 23- A-4-B-2-A-3-D, which is the lot number of 3-D</div></td><td><div align="justify">On the E (East) along lines 1-2 by Lot 23-A-4- B-2-A-3-D, which is the lot number of 3-D</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="middle"><div align="center">Southeast</div></td><td><div align="justify">On the SE (Southeast) along lines 2-3 by Lot 23- A-4-B-2-A-3-B, which is the lot number of lot 3-B</div></td><td><div align="justify">On the SE (Southeast) along lines 2-3 by Lot 23- A-4-B-2-A-3-B, which is the lot number of lot 3-B</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="middle"><div align="center">Southwest</div></td><td><div align="justify">On the SW (Southwest) and NW (Northwest) along lines 3-4-1 by Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-6, which are the lot numbers of lot 1 and lot 6, respectively</div></td><td><div align="justify">On the SW (Southwest) and NW (Northwest) along lines 3-4-1 by Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-6, which are the lot numbers of lot 1 and lot 6, respectively</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Engr.

Cortez plotted the technical description contained in Baello's TCT No. (35788)127544 and TCT 10300 and ofiered the plan thereof for consideration of the Court (Exhibit "13"). Engr. Cortez likewise plotted the technical description contained in VSD's TCT No. 285312 and offered the plan thereof for comparison (Exhibit "14"). Finally, Engr. Cortez presents a common plan showing that the technical description of the property in the Bae11o and VSD titles refer to one and the same lot (Exhibit "12").<br><br>As is apparent on the face of the titles, Engr. Cortez pointed out that the land referred to in Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 and the land referred to in VSD's TCT No. 285312 are of the same area, which is 2,834.8 square meters.<br><br>He further testified that the land covered by the technical description contained in Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 is located at Rizal Avenue Extension, Manila, Philippines, where Uniwide Caloocan can be found while the land covered by the technical description contained in VSD's TCT No. 285312 is also located at Rizal Avenue Extension, Manila[,] Philippines, where Uniwide Caloocan can also be found.<br><br>In conclusion, Engr. Cortez posits, to wit:<br><blockquote>74. Q: Based on your findings, what conclusion did you reach, if any?<br><br>A: Based on my findings, the land covered by the technical description of Ms. Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 is the same land covered by the technical description of VSD's TCT No. 285312. Therefore, considering that Ms. Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 came from TCT No. 10300, which was issued on 16 February 1926 while Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325, from which VSD derived its title, was issued only on 29 March 1993, there is no doubt that the technical description of Felisa Bonifacio's TCT no. 265777/T-1325 was merely copied from TCT 10300. It is significant to note TCT No. 10300 (from which Ms. Baello derived her title) predates Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325 (from which VSD derived its title) by at least sixty[-]seven (67) years.<br><br><center>xxxx<br></center></blockquote>For its part, VSD opposes the findings and the conclusion reached by Engr. Cortez. It posits that the Honorable Supreme Court already made a finding that the property covered by the Baello Title is not the same as that covered by the VSD Title.<br><br>VSD contends that the VSD and the Bonifacio (sic) *Baello Titles do not have the same adjoining boundaries and that considering that VSD's TCT No. 285312 refers to Lot No. 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A while the lot number referred to in the Baello's TCT No. (35788)12754 is only Lot No. 3-A of subdivision plan Psd-706, part of the original plan Psd-706, necessarily, the two titles pertain to different lots.<br><br>VSD also points out that Baello's TCT No. (35788)12754's full technical description obtained its bearings from its predecessor title, <i>i.e.</i>, TCT No. 10300 which in turn was derived from TCT No. 8318 where the description "Lot No. 3 of the subdivision plan being a portion of Lot No. 23-A-4-B-2-A part of Lot No. 23-A of Psu-2345-Amd-2, Maysilo Estate xxx" can be found.<br><br>VSD theorizes that the inclusion of Amd-2 in Psu-2345 means that the original plan had been amended twice. Being two different plans, it is possible that even if the lot numbers found in the title are the same, it may pertain to different properties.<br><br>VSD challenges the validity of Baello's title considering that upon plotting, TCT No. (35788) 12754 and its predecessor title does not constitute a closed polygon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals reported thus:<br><blockquote>After a thorough perusal of the evidence on record, the weight of evidence tilts in favor of Baello. Evidently, the plot plan for TCT No. (35788)12754/TCT 10300 and TCT No. 285312 sufficiently demonstrated the common location of the subject lot.<br><br>The issue on whether the technical description contained in Baello's title results in a closed polygon or not is shown to be human error on the part of Engr. Cortez. However, it does not change the fact that by preponderant evidence, the lot number, adjoining boundaries, Point-of­Beginning, boundary lines, area in square meters and actual location of the property in consideration is similar. That, the Baello's TCT No. (35788) 12754 and VSD's TCT No. 285312 refer to the same property where Uniwide Caloocan is actually situated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court has reviewed the records of the case, and adopts and agrees with the finding of the Court of Appeals that the technical description in the respective titles ofVSD and Baello indeed refer to the same lot, subject of the dispute.<br><br>In addition, the Court of Appeals said that in its memorandum, VSD prayed that the appellate court includes in its report that its (VSD's) purchase of the disputed lot was for value and made in good faith.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, however, aptly stated that VSD is not an innocent purchaser of the disputed lot, thus:<br><blockquote>VSD is not an innocent purchaser of the subject lot. An innocent purchaser for value is one who buys the property of another without notice that some other person has a right to or interest therein and who then pays a full and fair price for it at the time of the purchase or before receiving a notice of the claim or interest of some other persons in the property. Buyers in good faith buy a property with the belief that the person from whom they receive the thing is the owner who can convey title to the property. Such buyers do not close their eyes to facts that should put a reasonable person on guard and still claim that they are acting in good faith.<br><br>In VSD's case, at the time it purchased the subject lot via Deed of Absolute Sale on September 12, 1994, the subject lot was occupied by Uniwide pursuant to a Contract of Lease it executed with Dolores Baello on July 15, 1988, or six (6) years prior. VSD cannot raise as defense that it has the right to rely on the correctness of the certificate of title. The rule, as enunciated in <i>Philippine National Bank v. Militar</i>, states, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>xxx, where the land sold is in the possession of a person other than the vendor, the purchaser must go beyond the certificate of title and make inquiries concerning the actual possessor. A buyer of real propetiy which is in possession of another must be wary and investigate the rights of the latter. Otherwise, without such inquiry, the buyer cannot be said to be in good faith and cannot have any right over the property.<br></blockquote>VSD cannot be considered an innocent purchaser for value in light of its failure to investigate the occupant's (Uniwide/Baello's) right prior its purchase of the subject lot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals (Special Division) concluded its Investigation Report with this recommendation:<br><blockquote><center>RECOMMENDATION<br></center><br>After a thorough review of the evidence on record, it has been preponderantly established that Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-A is the common lot described in VSD's TCT No. 285312 and Baello's TCT No. (35788)12754. The evidence shows that the titles of VSD and Baello can both be traced back to OCT No. 994 dated May 3, 1917. However, VSD's title was derived from Felisa D. Bonifacio's tampered TCT No. 265777/T-1325, which was already adjudged as spurious in Phil-ville (2011) and Syjuco (2015) Supreme Court cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br></blockquote><div align="center"><b>The ruling of the Court</b><br></div><br>The Court adopts the Investigation Report of the Court of Appeals (Special Division).<br><br>The ultimate purpose of the inquiry undertaken by the Court of Appeals (Special Division) was to determine who is the legitimate owner of the subject property traceable to the authentic OCT No. 994 registered on May 3, 1917, and, in accordance with the nature of the case (a complaint for annulment of title and recovery of possession), whether petitioner VSD is entitled to recover possession of the subject property from respondent Baello.<br><br>The Court affirms the finding of the Court of Appeals that the technical description in the respective titles of VSD and Baello refer to the same lot, subject of the dispute.<br><br>The Court finds that VSD's claim of title over the subject property cannot be sustained.<br><br>Based on the Investigation Report of the Court of Appeals and the evidence on record, VSD's title was derived from Felisa Bonifacio's TCT No. 265777/T-1325, which was tampered with to reflect that it was derived from the legitimate and authentic OCT No. 994 registered on May 3, 1917.

Hence, Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio, as heir of Maria de la Concepcion Vidal, could not acquire title over Lot 23-A by substitution and, therefore, she could not convey the disputed lot by Deed of Assignment to Felisa Bonifacio, and, likewise, Felisa Bonifacio had no legal right to validly sell the disputed lot to VSD. It also held that it was impossible for Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio to be an heir of Maria de la Concepcion Vidal because the Death Certificate of Eleuteria Rivera Bonifacio showed that she was two years older than her alleged grandmother Maria de la Concepcion Vidal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Further, the Court takes judicial notice that in <b><i>Syjuco, et al. v.

In <b><i>Syjuco</i></b>, Lot 23-A-4-B-2-A-3-B was later sold by Felisa Bonifacio to VSD.
