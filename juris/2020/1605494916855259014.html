Respondents also submitted a Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated March 1, 2010 from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Iloilo City, on its approval of Psu-06-001615 on February 13, 2008, regarding the subject land which adjoins the lots registered in the names of respondents.</p><p>Neither an answer nor an opposition to respondents' application was filed by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), notwithstanding its entry of appearance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Furthermore, no interested party who might interpose a claim on the subject land manifested their opposition after publication, mailing, and posting of the Notice of Initial Hearing; thus, a general default was deemed declared and respondents were then required to present evidence in support of their application.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p>On March 14, 2011, the RTC of Himamaylan City, Branch 56, Negros Occidental, rendered judgment approving the application.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> However, Ernesto Q. Tongson, Sr.'s name erroneously appeared as Ernesto Q. Limsiaco, Sr., due to a typographical error mistakenly applying the surname of Norma.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The RTC amended the decision on March 22, 2011, to correct the error.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> As disposed:</p><blockquote><p><strong>WHEREFORE, premises considered</strong>, the verified application for registration as amended is hereby <strong>GRANTED</strong>. It is hereby ordered that the subject lot, Psu-06-001615 with an area of 10,142 square meters more or less, situated at Barangay Talaban, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental, be registered in the names of applicants, NORMA LIMSIACO, married to Emesto Q.

In particular, it ruled that the CENRO of the DENR had already confirmed that the subject land was alluvium due to the accretion caused by the Aguisan River.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Citing Article 457<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of the Civil Code, the CA-Cebu City held that the addition to the land formed by alluvion belongs automatically to the riparian owner as a natural incident to ownership. Consequently, the dispositive portion of the September 30, 2016 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> under present review reads:</p><blockquote><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the appeal is <strong>DENIED</strong>. The Amended Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 56, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental, which approved the Application for Registration in Land Registration Case No. 3, is <strong>AFFIRMED</strong>.</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Considering that the OSG's ensuing Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> was denied<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> by the CA-Cebu City for lack of merit, petitioner is before us contending that the CA-Cebu City erred in holding that the CENRO certification is sufficient proof that the subject land resulted from accretion of alluvium.</p><p>In support of its position, the OSG cites the following grounds:</p><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE CENRO CERTIFICATION IS NOT A <em><strong>PRIMA</strong> FACIE</em> PROOF THAT THE SUBJECT LAND RESULTED FROM ACCRETION[; AND]</li><br><li>THE SIZE OF THE SUBJECT LOT MAKES IT HIGHLY IMPROBABLE THAT IT WAS THE RESULT OF AN ACCRETION WHICH WAS GRADUAL AND IMPERCEPTIBLE.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><p>On January 30, 2018, respondents filed their Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> on the petition, arguing that petitioner raises matters that were already considered by both the RTC and CA-Cebu City when both courts upheld respondents' right as riparian owners and concurred that respondents satisfactorily substantiated their application for registration, particularly that the subject land is alluvium due to accretion.</p><p>Also on record is the OSG's January 14, 2020 Reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> to respondents' Comment, amplifying its position that the CA-Cebu City erroneously gave weight to the CENRO's Certification that the subject land is an accretion to the titled properties.</p><p>We are inclined to set aside the CA-Cebu City's disposition sustaining the trial court's ruling.</p><p>As can readily be gleaned, exercising our discretionary review over the case involves examining anew whether the respondents adduced sufficient evidence that the land sought to be registered under their names came about by accretion to their registered lots. Normally:</p><blockquote><p>In petitions for review on <em>certiorari</em> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, this Court is limited to reviewing only errors of law, not of fact, unless the factual findings complained of are devoid of support by the evidence on record, or the assailed judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p></blockquote><p>In this case, we find that respondents failed to provide adequate evidence in support of the lower courts' factual findings and legal conclusion that the land subject of their application is an accretion to their registered parcels of land. No doubt:</p><blockquote><p>[A]ccretion benefits a riparian owner when the following requisites are present: 1) That the deposit be gradual and imperceptible; 2) That it resulted from the effects of the current of the water; and 3) That the land where accretion takes place is adjacent to the bank of the river. x x x In the absence of evidence that the change in the course of the river was sudden or that it occurred through avulsion, the presumption is that the change was gradual and was caused by alluvium and erosion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p></blockquote><p>There is no question that the foregoing requisites must be sufficiently established by the riparian owners applying for land registration over the additional portion. In the event that the land situated along the riverbank is indeed shown to have increased gradually over time from soil deposits brought by the river's current, there arises a disputable presumption that the change was gradual and caused by alluvium. Should the applicant successfully establish the fact of accretion, certainly:</p><blockquote><p>Accretions which the banks of rivers may gradually receive from the effect of the current become the property of the owners of the banks. Such accretions are natural incidents to land bordering on running streams and the provisions of the Civil Code in that respect are not affected by the Land Registration Act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (Citation omitted).</p></blockquote><p>It is likewise settled that "an accretion does not automatically become registered land just because the lot that receives such accretion is covered by a Torrens Title. Ownership of a piece of land is one thing; registration under the Torrens system of that ownership is another."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> For this reason, it is incumbent upon respondents seeking judicial confirmation under land registration laws on a claim that the subject land is a product of accretion to establish the presence of the three cited requisites.</p><p>Petitioner mainly contends that the lower courts relied on the CENRO Certifications presented by the applicants during trial, which it argues are insufficient in themselves. Thus, resolution of the petition boils down to the probative weight accorded by the lower courts on the CENRO Certification over the existence of the alluvial deposits in an application for land registration, which in this case is unopposed by the Land Registration Authority, the DENR, or any interested party. "Indeed, by reason of their special knowledge and expertise over matters falling under their jurisdiction, administrative agencies, like the DENR, are in a better position to pass judgment on the same, and their findings of fact are generally accorded great respect, if not finality, by the courts."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p><p>The CENRO and DENR's Certifications are not empty requirements; however, Ernesto, Sr., was not competent to testify on the factual and legal conclusions expressed in the said certifications. The records disclose that apart from the CENRO and DENR Certifications, Ernesto, Sr. testified that the registered lots were inherited by his wife Norma and their children from Norma's predecessors, going all the way back to Norma's grandmother.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> By his own admission, he only came to know that the subject land already measured 10,142 square meters, more or less, because of the CENRO's land survey.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> He could not say whether it was already around 10,000 square meters when he married Norma in 1961.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Ernesto, Sr., could only competently testify that he and his family had been cultivating the said land as early as 1990; that it was partly a fishpond; and that he had been paying taxes on the property since 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p><p>For the findings of the CENRO and the DENR to be conclusive on the courts to establish the fact of accretion, the certifying officer, the land surveyor, or any similarly competent officer of the said agency should have been presented in court to provide the factual bases of their findings. Given that the application suggests that the subject land incrementally materialized through three or four generations, only a competent officer could testify as to the historical metes and bounds or the soil composition of the subject land within its jurisdiction. Ernesto, Sr.'s testimony alone does not establish whether the registered lots, which were paraphernal properties from Norma's side of the family, originally bordered the east riverbank of the Aguisan River. Ernesto, Sr., could also not be expected to be familiar, in the span of time under consideration, how the river's current changed the property line causing the accretion.</p><p>Proceeding from the foregoing, our statement in <em>Republic of the Philippines v. Lydia Capco de Tensuan</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> that government certifications such as those issued by the CENRO "are <em>prima facie</em> evidence of their due execution and date of issuance but they do not constitute prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein," applies in this case. The appropriate officer must testify on the facts stated, or other competent evidence must be adduced by the party relying on the certification, even if the application is unopposed by other possible claimants during trial. Then, "[s]uch findings must be respected as long as they are supported by substantial evidence, even if such evidence is not overwhelming or even preponderant."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p><p>The OSG speculates further that the subject land could not have been the result of gradual and imperceptible accretion, given that it measures more or less 10,142 square meters. Notably, however, the two adjoining properties of respondents, the riparian owners in this case, respectively measure 32,840 square meters and 28,907 square meters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> On its own, 10,142 square meters seem such a sizable figure; but taken together with the aggregate expanse of respondents' two adjoining properties and the span of time involved, we are not prepared to conclude that gradual accretion is improbable based solely on the size of the accretion. It remains a case to case question. Again, only land survey and mapping experts of the CENRO and the DENR can competently establish or dispute such fact.</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is <strong>GRANTED</strong>. Accordingly, the September 30, 2016 Decision and July 20, 2017 Resolution of the Court of Appeals – Cebu City in CA-G.R. CV No. 04457 are <strong>SET ASIDE</strong>. Respondents' application for land registration is <strong>DENIED</strong> for failure to adequately substantiate their claim of accretion.</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p><em>Peralta, C.J.
