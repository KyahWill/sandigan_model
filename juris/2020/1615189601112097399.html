There, he ordered AAA to bend over and inserted his penis into AAA's vagina for the second time. Accused-appellant tried to stab AAA but the latter was able to parry the stab and was wounded on her right thumb.

In <i>People v. Seguis</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></sup> the crime of Robbery with Rape covers multiple rapes accompanying the robbery and all the rapes shall be merged in a single crime of robbery with rape.<br><br>Accused-appellant argues that the testimony of AAA is incredible and grossly inconsistent with human experience to be believable. The prosecution failed to prove the robbery beyond reasonable doubt. AAA's testimony is marred with inconsistencies. In AAA's affidavit, she claimed that her phone, money and jewelry were taken before the alleged rape happened.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></sup> During AAA's testimony, she claimed that only her cellphone was taken. Then, in her re-direct testimony, she claimed that her jewelry was also taken. The prosecution was not able to prove the stolen articles, it failed to present any receipt, photographic evidence or corroborating testimony of the existence of the cellphone and jewelry. Further, the prosecution failed to prove the incidents of rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></sup> AAA in her affidavit stated that the first rape happened beside the car, the second is down the canal and third was beside the car again. Also, during the third incident of rape, accused-appellant attempted to stab AAA but the latter was able to deflect the attack and was only wounded in her right thumb.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></sup> However, during AAA's testimony, she relayed that the first incident happened at the canal, then the second was beside the car, and the third incident was at the canal. Likewise, AAA testified that the attempt to stab her happened during the second incident of rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></sup><br><br>Accused-appellant also questions AAA's lack of resistance or instinct to escape even though there were moments that she could escape without danger to herself. Also, despite the fact that the place of incident was well-lit, AAA failed to identify the male companion of accused-appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></sup> Further, accused-appellant argues that it is possible that AAA mistook the identity of the accused-appellant as her assailant. It could not be dismissed that the assailant has the same features and clothes as accused-appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></sup><br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>The issues to be resolved in this petition is whether accused-appellant is guilty of the crime of Robbery with Rape.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>The conviction is affirmed with modification as to penalty.<br><br>Central in accused-appellant's arguments in reversing his conviction is the credibility of the victim AAA in relating the crime. Accused-appellant argues that AAA's affidavit stating that her phone, money and jewelry were taken before the alleged rape happened. During AAA's testimony, she claimed that only her cellphone was taken. Then, in her re-direct testimony, she claimed that her jewelry was also taken. Also, AAA in her affidavit stated that the first rape happened beside the car, the second is down the canal and third was beside the car again. Also, during the third incident of rape, accused-appellant attempted to stab AAA but the latter was able to deflect the attack and was only wounded in her right thumb. However, during AAA's testimony, she relayed that the first incident happened at the canal, then the second was beside the car, and the third incident was at the canal. Likewise, AAA testified that the attempt to stab her happened during the incident of rape.<br><br>Time and again, this Court has reiterated that the credibility of witnesses is a question best addressed by the trial court because of its opportunity to observe their demeanor while testifying on the stand, an opportunity denied to the appellate courts. In this case, accused-appellant was not able to show Us any good reason from deviating with the findings of the RTC and the CA that the testimony of AAA is credible, natural, convincing, consistent and supported by the evidence on the record.<br><br>Under Article 294, paragraph 1 of the RPC, as amended by Republic Act No. (R.A.) 7659, prescribes the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death when by reason of, or on the occasion of the robbery, the same was accompanied by rape. Thus, to be convicted of the special complex crime of Robbery with Rape, the original intent of the accused was to take, with intent to gain, the personal property of the victim, and rape was just committed on the occasion thereof. In this case, the prosecution was able to prove that accused-appellant's original intent was to rob AAA as evidenced by the fact that when accused-appellant approached AAA, he suddenly poked a knife at AAA's neck, declared a hold-up and took her cellphone. The fact that the prosecution was not able to show any receipt of the cellphone does not negate the fact that AAA was robbed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]<br></sup></sup><br>The prosecution was also able to prove that on the occasion of the robbery, AAA was raped by accused-appellant. The testimony of AAA that she was raped was supported by the Medico-Legal Report. The arguments of the accused-appellant that AAA's testimony was marred with inconsistencies especially as to where the three incidents of rape happened cannot be considered to reverse accused-appellant's conviction. It is well-settled that minor inconsistencies in the testimony of the victim does not automatically discredit the credibility of the witness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></sup> It should be borne in mind that minor inconsistencies are to be expected when a victim recalls her harrowing and traumatic experience which are commonly too painful and agonizing to recount, especially in a courtroom setting. Further, inconsistencies on inconsequential matters that has nothing to do on the elements of the crime cannot result to the acquittal of the accused-appellant. Whether the first rape happened down the canal or beside the car, or where the succeeding rapes happened, the same fact still rings through, that accused-appellant indeed committed the atrocious act on AAA. The place where the rape was committed is not an essential element of the crime. AAA was consistent that accused-appellant raped her three times on the morning of August 12, 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></sup><br><br>Likewise, the lack of resistance of AAA cannot be taken as evidence that rape was not committed. Physical resistance to a rape need not be established where it is shown that the rape victim was threatened or intimidated into submission by the assailant. Here, AAA was consistent in her testimony that accused-appellant was armed with a knife when he committed the atrocious act. We cannot ascribe to AAA a uniform reaction to a rape incident. Some may offer strong resistance while others may be too intimidated to offer any resistance at all. After all, resistance is not an element of rape and its absence does not negate AAA's claim that the accused-appellant consummated his bestial act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></sup><br><br>Accused-appellant's argument that he was mistaken as the assailant because AAA might have confused his appearance with that of the real assailant is incredulous. Be it noted that AAA testified that accused-appellant's face was familiar to her but she does not know his name. Also, AAA testified that when accused-appellant was raping her, she was looking at his face. The natural reaction of victims of a crime is to strive to know the identity of their assailants by looking at their appearance, features, and movements and observing the manner the crime was perpetrated to create a lasting impression that could not be erased easily in their memory. In this case, aside from the fact that AAA pointed at accused-appellant among the four persons presented in the barangay hall, she was consistent during trial in pointing the accused-appellant as the person who robbed and raped her.<br><br>Since the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellant committed the crime, the latter's denial and alibi cannot be considered by this Court, especially in light of the positive identification of AAA. Accused-appellant claimed that he was at the wake of a certain Lydia Flores from 7:00 p.m. of August 11, 2011 until 5:00 a.m. of August 12, 2011. After they left the wake they went in Sitio Broadway to eat lugaw. However, based on the testimony of accused-appellant and his friend, Jomar, the place of the incident, the place of the wake and the place where they ate <i>lugaw</i> are all in the same barangay. Accused-appellant was not able to show that it is physically impossible for him to be at the place of the incident on the time of the incident. Thus, his alibi cannot be considered by this Court. Be it noted that denial and alibi are inherently weak defenses which can easily be concocted and fabricated.<br><br>Nevertheless, the penalty prescribed by the CA and the damages awarded need to be modified in keeping with the recent jurisprudence and the rules.<br><br>Under Article 294, paragraph 1 of the RPC, states that the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death is to be imposed when on the occasion of the robbery, a rape was committed. Article 63 of the RPC provides that when the penalty is composed of two indivisible penalties and there is neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstance is present, the lesser penalty is to be imposed. In this case, since no mitigating or aggravating circumstance is present, the penalty of reclusion perpetua should be imposed.<br><br>While it is true that the CA, correctly imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, the inclusion of the phrase "without the eligibility for parole" is erroneous. As such, said phrase should be deleted. Under A.M. No. 15-08-02-SC, the phrase "without the eligibility for parole" is used to emphasize that the accused-appellant should have been sentenced to suffer the penalty of death had it not been for R.A. 9346. In this case, however, accused-appellant is only sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua since there is no aggravating circumstance that is alleged in the Information and proven during the trial in order to impose the supreme penalty of death.<br><br>Corollarily, the award of P100,000.00 as moral damages, P100,000.00 as civil indemnity and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages should be reduced to P75,000.00. As provided for in <i>People v. Jugueta</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></sup> in special complex crimes such as Robbery with Rape and the penalty is only reclusion perpetua the civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages is P75,000.00.<br><br>As to the other two counts of rape that was committed by the accused-appellant, the CA acquitted accused-appellant of the said crimes not because of reasonable doubt or lack of evidence but because accused-appellant cannot be convicted separately of the two counts of rape committed by reason of or on the occasion of the robbery. The two counts of rape committed on the occasion of the robbery are absorbed by one composite crime of Robbery with Rape.<br><br>While the two counts of rape cannot be treated as an aggravating circumstance for increasing the penalty, they can however be considered for the entitlement of the victim for additional damages. As held in the case of <i>Jugueta</i>, it is provided that:<br><blockquote>IV. For Special Complex Crimes like Robbery with Homicide, Robbery with Rape, Robbery with Intentional Mutilation, Robbery with Arson, Rape with Homicide, Kidnapping with Murder, Carnapping with Homicide or Carnapping with Rape, Highway Robbery with Homicide, Qualified Piracy, Arson with Homicide, Hazing with Death, Rape, Sodomy or Mutilation and other crimes with death, injuries, and sexual abuse as the composite crimes, where the penalty consists of indivisible penalties:<br><br>1.

The Informations sufficiently alleged an aggravating circumstance to justify the imposition of <b><i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility, for parole</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> To recall, the Informations specifically stated that AAA was raped not only "while in a sitting position" but was also "ordered to bend over against her will and consent."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Alfanta</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the Court held that the sexual position employed during rape may be considered as an aggravating circumstance. In an act of rape where the perpetrator enters the victim from behind, the means employed was ruled to add ignominy to the natural effects of the act, <i>viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>With respect to ignominy, the victim testified that after appellant had inserted his penis into her vagina, appellant ordered her to lie face down and while in that position had his penis into her anus. Thereafter, he ordered her to lie down again and this time he inserted his finger inside her. The Solicitor General correctly invoked the case of <i>People vs. Saylan</i>, where this Court said: The trial court held that there was ignominy because the appellant used not only the missionary position, i.e. male superior, female inferior, but also 'the same position as dogs do' i.e., entry from behind. The appellant claims there was no ignominy because The studies of many experts in the matter have shown that this 'position' is not novel and has repeatedly and often been resorted to by couples in the act of copulation. This may well be if the sexual act is performed by consenting partners but not otherwise.<br><br>Article 14, paragraph 17, of the Revised Penal Code considers to be an aggravating circumstance any means employed or circumstance brought about which add ignominy to the natural effects of the act. The circumstance, it is said, pertains to the moral order arid adds disgrace and obloquy to the material injury caused by the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>The Informations herein specifically described with particularity accused-appellant's act of raping AAA from behind. The conscious use of this position in committing the crime of rape unnecessarily added ignominy, humiliation, and disgrace to AAA's' suffering, Thus, this aggravating circumstance may be properly appreciated in the imposition of penalty.<br><br>Further, the manner and means employed by accused-appellant in the rape incidents were fully established during trial. The CA considered AAA's straightforward account as to how she was raped by the accused multiple times on occasion of the robbery:<br><blockquote>Q. And after that, you said that he pulled you towards the parked vehicle[.] [W]hat did Jonathan do next?<br>A. When he said "<i>babae kapala</i>", he lay me down on the canal.<br><br>Q. Did you follow his order?<br>A. Yes, ma'am[,] because his knife was pointed on the left side of my neck.<br><br>Q. When you lay down[,] what did he do?<br>&nbsp;A. In [sic] inserted his penis to my vagina. <br>&nbsp;<br>Q. When he ordered you to lie down and before he inserted his penis into your vagina, what[,] if any[,] did he order you?<br>A. He told me "<i>babae kapala, sige na humiga ka na</i>".<br><br>Q. And you said he inserted his penis into your vagina, what did you feel?<br>A. It was painful.<br><br>Q. And while he was doing that, what was he saying to you[,] if any? <br>A. He said, "<i>di ba taga-Sitio Broadway ka? May girlfriend ka? Dalhin mo dito, titirahin ko din</i>."<br><br>x x x<br><br>Q. When you were on top of the canal, what did he do next? <br><b>A. Pinatuwad po niya ako at ipinasok niya ulit yung titi niya.</b><br><br>Q. When he asked you to bend down and inserted his penis into your vagina, what was he saying[,] if any?<br>A. Sabi po niya, lalagyan po niya ko ng marka, tapos po, sinalag ko po yung saksak niya.<br><br>Q. Where did he stab you?<br>A. Hindi po natuloy[.] [D]apat po sasaksakin niya ko, sinalag ko, kaya nga po may sugat ako dito ([T]he witness is pointing to her right thumb). x x x<br><br>x x x<br><br>Q. So, the accused told you to go down to the canal, did you follow him?<br>A. Yes, ma'am[,] because the knife was still pointing to my neck ([W]itness is pointing to her left neck).<br><br>Q. When you were already down on the canal, what did he do to you?<br>A. He said "<i>last na to</i>" and he told me not to report to the police because he will kill me. Sinabi rin po niya na pag nabuntis ako, hanapin ko lang daw siya.<br><br>Q. What did he actually do to you when you were already down on the canal?<br>A. Ganun din po. Ipinasok niya ang titi niya sa ari ko.<br><br>Q. What was your position then when he inserted his penis into your vagina?<br>A. Nakaganito po, kasi, eto po yung canal eh...([T]he witness is raising both of her legs).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>AAA's sister, BBB, testified that when AAA came home, the latter was wet and dirty as a result of suffering through multiple rapes in a canal. Moreover, accused-appellant made cruel and hurtful remarks before and during the rapes against AAA, which added insult to injury, such as: "<i>babae ka pala, sige na humiga ka na</i>" and "<i>May girlfriend ka? Dalhin mo dito, titirahin ko din</i>." These statements are considered gender-based slurs, the use of which are punishable under Republic Act No. 11313.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Taken as a whole, accused-appellant's acts increased AAA's anguish and suffering from the ordeal.<br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="20%"><div align="justify"><em>Ignominy may be appreciated if alleged, in the Informations of the absorbed component crimes</em></div></td><td width="80%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>Indeed, there is as yet no jurisprudence where an aggravating circumstance alleged in the Information of the absorbed component crime has been treated as aggravating in the resulting complex crime. Conversely, We can view this dearth of jurisprudence to mean that there is yet no prohibition precluding courts from appreciating an aggravating circumstance from an absorbed crime. <br><br>To determine whether the alleged aggravating circumstance may be considered by the court, it is helpful to first examine the <i>ratio</i> behind the requirement that an Information must specify the qualifying and aggravating circumstance mandated by Section 8, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Solar</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Court stressed the Constitutional imperative that no person should be deprived of life or liberty without due process of law. An. essential component of the right to due process in criminal proceedings is <b>the right of the accused to be sufficiently informed</b>, in writing, of the cause of the accusation against him. These requirements are imposed to ensure that the accused is sufficiently apprised of the acts and circumstances with which he is being charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Simply put, the underlying purpose is to inform the accused of the acts and circumstances comprising the criminal charge.<br><br>The issue that now confronts this Court is this: if an aggravating circumstance was alleged under the Information of an absorbed component crime, can courts consider the accused as having been informed of this aggravating circumstance? I answer in the affirmative.<br><br>In robbery with multiple rapes, <b>all the rapes are merged in the composite, integrated whole</b> comprising the single crime of robbery with rape, so long as the rapes accompanied the robbery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Thus, it cannot be denied that the accused had already been informed, <i>in writing</i>, of the acts and circumstances alleged in the other Informations before the component rapes were absorbed. Necessarily, the allegations in the Informations for the component rapes should likewise be considered as integrated into the Information for robbery with rape because the purpose of Section 8, Rule 110 had been, satisfied. Ultimately, <b>the accused remains sufficiently informed of the acts and circumstances with which he is being charged</b>.<br><br>The Court's decision in <i>People v. tuppal</i> is instructive.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In that case, the accused was charged under four (4) separate Informations for murder, frustrated murder, attempted murder, and robbery. All charges were subsequently merged into one (1) special indivisible or composite crime of robbery with homicide. For the purpose of reckoning the appropriate penalty, the Court considered the injuries inflicted as an aggravating circumstance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In the present case, all charges under the three (3) Informations should also be considered as merged into one (1) special indivisible crime of robbery with rape, which necessarily includes the allegations of aggravating circumstances.<br><br>Incidentally, the CA herein acquitted the accused for the other two (2) incidents of rape. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, all premises considered, the instant appeal is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>.<br><br>Accordingly, the Decision dated 17 November 2016 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 100, Antipolo City, is hereby <b>MODIFIED</b> as follows: <br><br>(1) Insofar as Criminal Cases Nos. 11-43070 and 11-43071 are concerned, appellant is <b>ACQUITTED</b> of the charge of two (2) counts of simple rape under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>(2) With respect to Criminal Case No. 11-43069 convicting appellant of robbery with rape under Article 294, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, the same is <b>AFFIRMED</b>. However, the penalty imposed is reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole.<br><br>(3) Appellant is <b>ORDERED</b> to pay exemplary damages in the amount of P100,000.00, in addition to the awards of moral damages and civil indemnity which are increased to P100,000.00.<br><br>(4) Finally, pursuant to the pronouncement in Nacar v. Gallery Frames and Felipe Bordey, Jr., 34 appellant is further <b>ORDERED</b> to pay legal interest on all awarded damages at 6% per annum from the filing of the Information on 18 October 2011 until the finality of this Decision, and another 6% per annum from such finality until full payment.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br></blockquote>As shown in the <i>fallo</i>, the CA did not indicate whether the prosecution's evidence absolutely failed to prove the guilt of the accused or merely failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The CA erred in rendering an acquittal without specifying one of the reasons under Section 2, Rule 120 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The merging of composite crimes is not among the valid reasons to acquit an accused.<br><br>Since an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire base for review, it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction, over the case and renders such court competent to examine the records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Herein, considering the two (2) additional rapes were merely absorbed in the robbery with rape charge, thus, the proper manner in disposing the separate charges, instead of an acquittal, should have been to indicate that all other charges have been merged into the special complex crime. This manner of disposal was also employed in <i>Tuppal</i>, wherein the trial court did not acquit the. accused under any of the Informations. Instead, the trial court found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the single offense of robbery with homicide, <b>as all other charges have been merged in said offense</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Hence, the dispositive portion should be modified to indicate that all charges have been, merged into a single charge of robbery with rape.<br><br>With all three (3) charges merged, I see no impediment in applying the aggravating circumstance of ignominy sufficiently alleged in the second Information for rape. At any rate, accused-appellant has already been fully informed, <i>in writing</i>, of the acts and circumstances with which he was being charged.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the appeal. However, accused-appellant Jonathan Juarizo Evardone should be sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole. <br>&nbsp;<br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Guidelines for the Proper Use of the Phrase "Without Eligibility for Parole" in Indivisible Penalties</i>, A.M.
