The CSC-CAR did not consider Dampilag's defense that it was pure inadvertence when he gave the picture of his former board mate instead of his own during the examination. The CSC-CAR was convinced that room examiners will not let any person take the examination if he did not look like the person in the picture submitted. Further, a comparison of the signature of Dampilag in the PDS against the signature of the purported examinee Hilario J. Dampilag in the PSP revealed immense disparities. The CSC-CAR concluded that another person took the CSPE for and in behalf of Dampilag. Since the prescribed forms for government examinations, such as the&nbsp; PSP and&nbsp; the&nbsp; PDS,&nbsp; once duly&nbsp; accomplished&nbsp; are considered&nbsp; official documents, by intentionally making false narration of material facts in these documents,&nbsp; Dampilag&nbsp; committed&nbsp; Serious Dishonesty,&nbsp; Falsitication of Official Document, and Grave Misconduct.<br><br>Dampilag's motion tor reconsideration was denied by the CSC-CAR in its Resolution No. 15-00023 dated October 28, 2015.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Dampilag&nbsp; filed&nbsp; his appeal&nbsp; memorandum to the CSC, reiterating that his submission of a different photograph was due to pure inadvertence and may be considered as excusable negligence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> He insisted that the alleged discrepancies between the signatures in the PSP and the PDS were not substantial and any slight variation was an accepted norm because handwriting and signatures of a person vary over time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On February 29, 2016, the CSC affirmed the findings of the CSC-CAR but found Dampilag guilty instead of two counts of serious dishonesty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The CSC found the dissimilarities and disparities in the photographs and signatures in the PSP and the PDS sufficient to conclude that another person took the examination for and in behalf of&nbsp; Dampilag.&nbsp; Further, Dampilag committed falsification of official document when he intentionally and consciously misrepresented in his PDS that he was a CSPE passer, and allowed another person to take the examination and sign in the PSP as him.<br><br>However, the CSC modified the decision of the CSC-CAR and found Dampilag liable instead for two counts of Serious Dishonesty pursuant to Section 3<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> of CSC Resolution No. 06-0538<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated April 4, 2006.

A comparison of the PDS and&nbsp; PSP showed&nbsp; glaring disparities as to Dampilag's signature that even a layman, using his naked eye, can readily see.<br><br>In compliance&nbsp; with this Court's Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated July 9, 2018, Dampilag filed his comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> on November 7, 2018.<br><br>Dampilag counters that there are no substantial discrepancies between his handwriting and signature in the PDS and in the PSP. He posits that he has the tendency of constantly changing the style of his signature as year passes by. This was&nbsp; supported by various documents that&nbsp; he submitted before the CA. Further, the CSC's conclusion that another person&nbsp; took the CSPE for and in his be half is not supported by substantial evidence, but mere conjectures and speculations considering that no handwriting expert was presented to render his opinion on the matter. As to the photograph in the PSP,&nbsp; Dampilag already explained that&nbsp; he inadvertently submitted the picture of his former board mate which was mixed with his in an improvised envelope that&nbsp; he had&nbsp; in his possession on&nbsp; the day of examination. The circumstances do not indicate malice to commit fraud on his part and can be considered as excusable negligence.<br><br>In its&nbsp; Reply,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the OSG&nbsp; avers&nbsp; that the submission of a different photograph in an examination cannot be considered as excusable negligence. As a matter&nbsp; of procedure, room examiners closely examine the pictures submitted and attached on the PSP, and compare the appearance of each of the examinees with the person in the picture submitted&nbsp; and affixed on the PSP. Further, the CSC examiners enjoy a presumption of regularity in the administration of civil service examinations.&nbsp; The OSG&nbsp; insists&nbsp; the stark differences between the handwriting and signatures of Dampilag in the PSP and in the PDS.<br><b><center><br>Ruling<br></center></b><br>Prefatorily, findings of facts of administrative agencies, such as the CSC, if based on substantial evidence, are controlling on the reviewing court. The CSC are better-equipped in handling cases involving the employment status of employees in the Civil Service since it is within the field of their expertise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Moreover, it is not the function of the Supreme Court in a Rule 45 petition to analyze and weigh all over again the evidence presented before the lower court, tribunal or office. One of the recognized exceptions to this rule is when the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the lower court, tribunal or office, as in this case.<br><br>The CA exonerated Dampilag on the basis of absence of evidence on the records that will support the CSC's conclusion that there exists significant differences between the signatures of Dampilag in the PSP and in the PDS. According to the CA, since a copy of the PSP and the PDS were not made part of the records, "the alleged differences remain a mystery to th[e] [c]ourt."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the CA decided on Dampilag's guilt based on the evidence presented before it – the several affidavits and certifications which&nbsp; bore Dampilag's signature and executed over different dates. After careful&nbsp; examination, the CA concluded that Dampilag's signatures indeed vary over time.<br><br>In this petition, the CSC implores this Court to reverse the CA because the charges against Dampilag are well substantiated by evidence.<br><br>We rule in favor of the CSC.<br><br>The evidence on record is overwhelming to support the finding of the CSC that Dampilag employed another person to take the December 1, 1996 CSPE held in Baguio City for and in his behalf and claimed the result as his own in his PDS accomplished on March 3, 1999. We are one with the CSC that the differences in the facial features of the person appearing on the PSP vis-a-vis the PDS are evident in the shapes of the face, nose, lips and eyes of Dampilag. To be sure, Dampilag admitted that the person in the picture pasted in the PSP is not him. We find it, however, improbable that it was clue to mere inadvertence that Dampilag gave the picture of his former board mate instead of his own picture during the day of examination. The CSC officials who supervise civil service examinations enjoy the presumption of regularity in the performance of their official duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> If only to stress, we quote the findings of the CSC:<br><blockquote>The&nbsp; lame&nbsp; justification of Dampilag cannot&nbsp; prevail over the over whelming documentary evidence or the prosecution as regards the discrepancies in the facial features of the pictures attached to the subject PSP and his PDS dated March [3], 1999. It should be stressed that as a matter or procedure, the room examiners assigned to supervise the conduct or a civil service examination closely examine the pictures submitted and affixed on the PSP. The legal presumption that exists under the Civil Service Law and Rules is that the person whose picture appears in the PSP is the person who took the examination. The CSC officials who conducted the examination and ensured that it is the actual examinee's picture which is attached in the PSP are presumed to be regularly performing their duties and strong evidence is necessary to rebut this presumption.<br><br>In cases where the examinee does not look like the person in the picture submitted and attached to the PSP, the examiner will not allow said examinee to take the examination. Surely. Dampilag's impersonator&nbsp; was allowed by the Room and Supervising Examiners to take the examination because he pasted his own picture in the PSP. On the contrary, had the impersonator pasted in the PSP the true picture of Dampilag, he would have been disallowed by the examiners to take the examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote>Dampilag failed to controvert the presumption of regularity in the performance of duties of the room examiners. Thus, the CSC examiners are conclusively deemed to have regularly performed their duties in relation to the administration of the CSPE held in Baguio City on December 1, 1996.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>As to the absence of a handwriting expert, Section 49<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; Rule 130 of the Rules of Court uses the word "may," which signifies that the use of opinion of expert witness is permissive and not mandatory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>Heirs of Severa P. Gregorio v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> we held that due to the technicality of the procedure involved in the examination of the forged documents, the expertise of questioned document examiners is usually helpful; however, resort to questioned document examiners is not mandatory and while probably useful, they&nbsp; are&nbsp; not&nbsp; indispensable&nbsp; in examining or comparing&nbsp; handwriting.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Besides, when the dissimilarity between the genuine and false specimens of writing is visible to the naked eye, resort to technical rules is no longer necessary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> We quote the instructive rule of comparison in the examination of forged documents, thus:<br><blockquote>As a rule, forgery cannot be presumed and must be proved by clear, positive and convincing evidence and the burden of proof lies on the party alleging forgery. The best evidence of a forged signature in an instrument is the instrument itself reflecting the alleged forged signature. The fact of forgery can only be established by a comparison between the alleged forged signature and the authentic and genuine signature of the person whose signature is theorized upon to have been forged. Without the original document containing&nbsp; the alleged forged signature, one cannot make a definitive comparison which would establish forgery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote>Here, the evidence presented includes certified true copy of the PSP and the PDS. After a careful comparison, we noted stark differences in the structure, strokes, form and general appearance of Dampilag's signatures and handwriting in the PDS and in the PSP. The letters "M," "J," and "N" were written differently and the strokes of the signatures were not similar. It cannot also escape our attention&nbsp; that the purported examinee wrote his name as "HILARIO <b><u>D</u></b>. DAMPILAG" in the PSP and not "HILARIO <b><u>J</u></b>. DAMPILAG ." In the circumstances and based on the evidence on record, there is no doubt that the person who took the December 1, 1996 CSPE is not Dampilag. Someone&nbsp; impersonated Dampilag and took the examination in behalf of him.<br><br>In fine, we hold that the evidence presented before the CSC sufficiently proved that Dampilag is guilty of the offenses charged against him. To be sure, in administrative proceedings, the quantum of evidence required is only substantial, or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other minds equally reasonable might conceivably opine otherwise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; Here, the records bear more than substantial evidence to support a finding of guilt against Dampilag.<br><br><b><i>Offense and penalty</i></b><br><br>The CSC modified the decision of the CSC-CAR and found Dampilag guilty instead for two counts of serious dishonesty based on the following grounds: (1) he committed an examination irregularity of impersonation when he connived and colluded with somebody to take the December 1, 1996 CSPE for and in his behalf and (2) he employed fraud and falsification of official documents in the commission of the dishonest act when he misrepresented in his PDS dated March&nbsp; 3, 1999 that he passed&nbsp; the December 1, 1996 CSPE when he did not.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The CSC concluded that these acts separately constitute the offense of serious dishonesty under&nbsp; Sections 3(e)&nbsp; and&nbsp; (g)&nbsp; of&nbsp; CSC Resolution No. 06-0538, otherwise known as the Rules on the Administrative Offense of Dishonesty, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Section 3.

In addition, he connived and colluded with someone to impersonate him and take the December 1, 1996 CSPE for and on his behalf. More importantly, Dampilag has been benefiting from the passing result in the said examination. Clearly,&nbsp; Dampilag&nbsp; committed two&nbsp; counts of serious dishonesty&nbsp; under Sections 3(e) and (g) of CSC Resolution No. 06-0538, respectively.<br><br>Damilag is also liable for falsification of official document. It is a settled rule in this jurisdiction that the duly accomplished form of the Civil Service is an official document of the Commission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Dampilag falsified his PDS accomplished on March 3, 1999 when he indicated therein that be took and passed the CSPE on December 1, 1996 in Baguio City, with a rating of 81.89%, when in truth and in fact, somebody took the examination for him.<br><br>Moreover, under CSC Memorandum Circular No. 15, Series of 1991, any "act which includes the procurement and/or use of fake/spurious civil service eligibility, the giving of assistance to ensure the commission or procurement of the same, cheating, collusion, impersonation, or any other anomalous act&nbsp; which&nbsp; amounts to any&nbsp; violation of the Civil&nbsp; Service examination has been categorized as a grave offense of Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct or Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service." Verily, by colluding and conniving with someone to impersonate him in taking the December 1, 1996 CSPE, and making untruthful statement in his PDS of his civil service eligibility, Dampilag is liable for grave mi sconduct.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Section 50 of CSC Resolution No. 1101502, or the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, provides that if the respondent is found guilty of two or more charges or counts, the penalty to be imposed should be that corresponding to the most serious charge and the rest shall be considered as aggravating circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; Under Section 46, the offenses of serious dishonesty, falsification of official document, and grave misconduct are all punishable by the penalty of dismissal from the service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>In view of Dampilag's misrepresentation in the PDS that he took and passed the CSPE on December 1, 1996, and collu sion with someone to take the December 1, 1996 CSPE for and in his behalf, this Court finds Dampilag administratively liable for two counts of serious dishonesty, falsification of official document, and grave misconduct.
