No. 170867, as well as the Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of petitioners in G.R. No. 185941. The parties ask this Court to reconsider its December 4, 2018 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> in which it declared, among others, that the Province of Palawan was not entitled to an equitable share in the proceeds of the CamagoÂ­-Malampaya Natural Gas Project (Natural Gas Project). <p> To recall, the Republic, through the Department of Energy, entered into Service Contract No. 38 dated December 11, 1990 with Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Occidental Philippines. The 20-year contract was made for the drilling of the natural gas reservoirs in the Camago-Malampaya area, about 80 kilometers from mainland Palawan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p> Service Contract No. 38 provided a 60-40 production sharing scheme for the sale of petroleum, where the national government would receive 60% of the net proceeds, while Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Occidental Philippines, as service contractors, would receive 40%. Later, the service contractors were replaced by a consortium of Shell B.V., Shell Philippines LLC, Chevron Malampaya LLC, and PNOC Exploration Corporation (Shell Consortium).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> On February 17, 1998, then President Fidel V. Ramos (President Ramos) issued Administrative Order No. 381,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> which provided that per the Local Government Code, part of the national government's 60% share would be given to the concerned local government units.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> It further provided that the Province of Palawan was "expected to receive about US$2.1 billion from the total government share of US$8.1 billion"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> throughout the contract's 20-year period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> On June 10, 1998, then Energy Secretary Francisco L. Viray (Energy Secretary Viray) wrote to then Palawan Governor Salvador P. Socrates (Governor Socrates), requesting that the payment of half of Palawan's expected share be "spread over the initial seven years of operations"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> in order to pay for the National Power Corporation's obligations in its Gas Sales and Purchase Agreements with the Shell Consortium.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> Later, in a July 30, 2001 letter, then Finance Secretary Jose Isidro N. Camacho sought the legal opinion of then Justice Secretary Hernando B. Perez on whether the Province of Pa1awan had a share in the national wealth from the proceeds of the Natural Gas Project. The Department of Finance had taken the position that the province did not, as a local government unit's territorial jurisdiction was only within its land area and excludes marine waters more than 15 kilometers from its coastline.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p> The Natural Gas Project in the Camago-Malampaya area was inaugurated on October 16, 2001.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> Negotiations were held between the Departments of Energy, Finance, and Budget and Management, and the Province of Palawan to determine the province's expected share in the net proceeds of the Natural Gas Project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> However, since the national government would not grant the province's expected US$2.1 billion share, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Palawan on February 11, 2003 called off further negotiations and instead authorized the Palawan Governor to file the appropriate judicial action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p> On May 7, 2003, the Province of Palawan filed before the Regional Trial Court a Petition for Declaratory Relief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> docketed as Special Civil Action No. 3779, seeking a judicial determination of its rights under Administrative Order No. 381, Republic Act No. 7611, Section 290 of the Local Government Code, and Palawan Provincial Ordinance No. 474, series of 2000. In particular, the Province of Palawan sought a judicial declaration that it has territorial jurisdiction over the Camago-Malampaya natural gas reservoirs, entitling it to an equitable share in the proceeds from the Natural Gas Project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p><p> On February 9, 2005, while the declaratory relief case was still pending, then Energy Secretary Vincent S. Perez, Jr., then Budget and Management Secretary Mario L. Relampagos, and then Finance Secretary Juanita D. Amatong executed an Interim Agreement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> with then Palawan Governor Joel T. Reyes. </p><p> Under the agreement, half of the 40% revenue share being claimed by the Province of Palawan, to be called the "Palawan Share," would be used in its development and infrastructure projects, environment protection and conservation, electrification of 431 barangays, and establishment of facilities to enhance the exclusive economic zone's security.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> The Interim Agreement likewise stated that the release of funds would be without prejudice to the outcome of Special Civil Action No. 3779. Once the case is decided with finality in favor of either party, the shares already received would be treated as financial assistance. The parties further agreed that the P600 million already released to the Province of Palawan would be deducted from the initial release of the province's 50% share of 40% of the remitted funds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> On December 16, 2005, the Regional Trial Court rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> in the Province of Palawan's favor. It found that, under Article X, Section 7 of the Constitution and the Local Government Code, the province was entitled to a 40% share of the revenues generated from the Natural Gas Project since October 16, 2001.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> On February 16, 2006, the Republic filed before this Court a Petition for Review,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> docketed as G.R. No. 170867, assailing the trial court's December 16, 2005 Decision and its January 16, 2006 Amended Order. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p> On July 25, 2007, while the Petition was pending, the national government executed a Provisional Implementation Agreement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> with the Province of Palawan, in conformity with the representatives of its legislative districts. Per the agreement, half of the disputed 40% share was allowed to be used for development projects in Palawan. </p><p> On December 1, 2007, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (President Macapagal-Arroyo) issued Executive Order No. 683, which authorized the release of funds pursuant to the Provisional Implementation Agreement. Notably, it provided that the funds' release would be without prejudice to this Court's final resolution in G.R. No. 170867.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><p> Subsequently, Bishop Pedro Dulay Arigo, Cesar N. Sarino, Jose Antonio N. Socrates, and H. Harry L. Roque, Jr. (Arigo, et al.), as taxpayers, filed a Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> before the Court of Appeals against the Executive Secretary, the Department Secretaries of Energy, Finance, and Budget and Management, the Palawan Governor, the First District Representative of Palawan, and PNOC Exploration Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer. In their Petition, Arigo, et al. assailed Executive Order No. 683 and the Provisional Implementation Agreement for violating the Constitution and the Local Government Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> They also sought the release of the Province of Palawan's full 40% share in the proceeds of the Natural Gas Project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p> In a May 29, 2008 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Court of Appeals dismissed outright Arigo, et al.'s Petition for their failure to submit the documents necessary to substantiate their allegations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It likewise noted that the Petition was prematurely filed since the implementation of the Provisional Implementation Agreement was contingent on the final adjudication of G.R. No. 170867, the case pending before this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p> Arigo, et al. filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> which was denied by the Court of Appeals in a December 16, 2008 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> Subsequently, Arigo, et al. filed before this Court a Petition for Review on Certiorari,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> docketed as G.R. No. 185941. They essentially reiterated their argument before the Court of Appeals that Executive Order No. 683 and the Provisional Implementation Agreement were invalid for being unconstitutional and for violating the Local Government Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> On June 23, 2009, this Court consolidated G.R. No. 170867 and G.R. No. 185941.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Oral arguments were held on September 1, 2009<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and November 24, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> In a December 4, 2018 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> this Court granted the Petition in G.R. No. 170867 but denied the Petition in G.R. No. 185941. It held that since no law grants the Province of Palawan territorial jurisdiction over the area where the Natural Gas Project was located, the province was not entitled to an equitable share in the project's proceeds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> It likewise held that a local government unit's territorial jurisdiction requires contiguity and is limited only to land area or land mass.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Since the Camago-Malampaya gas reservoirs were located in the continental shelf, this territory would be beyond the Province of Palawan's territorial jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> This Court pointed out that the Constitution did not apportion the territories of the Philippines among the local government units.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> It also ruled that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea conferred no continental shelves on local government units.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> This Court further ruled that the State could not be estopped by the acts of its officials, as in this case, when the executive branch issued pronouncements recognizing the Province of Palawan's equitable share.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It also found that the Province of Palawan's share could not be granted based on equity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p> The dispositive portion of the Decision read: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition in G.R. No. 170867 is <b>GRANTED.</b> </p> <p> The Decision dated December 16, 2005 of the Regional Trial Court of the Province of Palawan, Branch 95 in Civil Case No. 3779 is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. The Court declares that under existing law, the Province of Palawan is not entitled to share in the proceeds of the Camago-Malampaya natural gas project. The Petition in GR.

This is because, it argues, the area is located within the continental shelf of the Municipality of Kalayaan, over which the province exercises territorial jurisdiction under Presidential Decree No. 1596.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The Province of Palawan also maintains that the State can be estopped when it promulgated issuances recognizing Camago-Malampaya as part of the Province of Palawan and granting it its 40% share in the proceeds of the Natural Gas Project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p> In its Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the Province of Palawan adds that since the Municipality of Kalayaan has territorial jurisdiction over its continental shelf, which goes up to 200 nautical miles, its territorial jurisdiction necessarily extends to the Camago-Malampaya area, which is barely 51 nautical miles from the municipality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> The Province of Palawan likewise adds that it is entitled to its 40% share on the basis of equity, since it is the nearest local government unit that "is capable of rendering the necessary and immediate assistance and services regarding any issue or concern within the area[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> </p><p> For their part, Arigo, et al. argue in their Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> that the doctrine on the continental shelf has been "constitutionalized," and its "constitutionalization" means "recognizing that the natural prolongation of the landmass of the Province of Palawan leading to a Continental Shelf, as defined under the [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea], is an area that is appurtenant to it and fall[s] within its jurisdiction but is nevertheless part and parcel of the unitary state that is the Republic of the Philippines."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> </p><p> Since the oil and gas wells in Camago-Malampaya are "within the natural prolongation" of the Province of Palawan's land mass, Arigo, et al. argue that the province is entitled to the Natural Gas Project's proceeds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> They also point out that both Republic Act No. 7611 and Administrative Order No. 381 recognize Malampaya as part of Palawan 's continental shelf.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, Arigo, et al. argue that since the Republic has used the island of Palawan as the reference point to mark its maritime entitlements in the South China Sea dispute, it has already recognized the province's unique geological features as comprised of islands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> They contend that this Court made "a fundamental and irreconcilable contradiction"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> in declaring that international law was inapplicable while still referring to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to conclude that the Province of Palawan had no territorial jurisdiction over Camago-Malampaya.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p><p> Arigo, et al. further point out that by declaring that the Province of Palawan cannot generate its own continental shelf, this Court "stands to erase all that remains of the legal gains the Philippines achieved"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> in the arbitral case on the South China Sea dispute. If not reversed, its ruling "may become binding as a sovereign admission . . . under the principle of estoppel under international law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> </p><p> The Republic, represented by the Office of the Solicitor General, counters in its Consolidated Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> that while the Municipality of Kalayaan is indeed within the Province of Palawan's territory, there is nonetheless no law granting the province territorial jurisdiction over the continental shelf between these areas, where Camago-Malampaya is located. As such, it argues, the Province of Palawan is not entitled to an equitable share in the proceeds of the Natural Gas Project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p> The Republic also maintains that Camago-Malampaya is beyond the boundaries designated by Presidential Decree No. 1596 and Act No. 422, as shown in the maps plotted by the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> It insists that any continental margin or shelf outside the metes and bounds described in Presidential Decree No. 1596 does not form part of the Municipality of Kalayaan and, thus, is beyond the Province of Palawan's territorial jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p><p> As for the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Republic asserts that the treaty's provisions apply to the sovereign state, not a local government unit. Thus, the rights over the state's continental shelf pertain to the sovereign state, not to any of its local government units.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> </p><p> The Republic also maintains that Article X, Section 1 of the Constitution does "not require that every portion of the Philippine territory be made part of the territory of a local government unit."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> It asserts that a local government unit's territory only pertains to its land area and not to its waters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> It maintains that it cannot be estopped since the Province of Palawan was neither misled nor injured by the State's prior declarations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, the Republic maintains that the principle of equity does not apply here. This is because any possible damage that the Natural Gas Project may cause the environment has already been addressed by the Environmental Compliance Certificate issued to the Shell Consortium, which was required to provide an Environmental Guarantee Fund for any possible damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><p> The principal issue raised by all the parties in their pleadings before this Court is whether or not the Province of Palawan is entitled, under Article X, Section 1 of the Constitution and Section 290 of the Local Government Code, to a 40% equitable share in the proceeds from the Camago-Malampaya Natural Gas Project. </p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> Article X, Section 7 of the Constitution mandates that local government units shall be entitled to an equitable share in the utilization and development of the natural wealth within their area. It states: </p><blockquote> <p> </p><center> ARTICLE X <br> Local Government<br> General Provisions </center> <p> . . . .</p> <p> SECTION 7. Local governments shall be entitled to an equitable share in the proceeds of the utilization and development of the national wealth within their respective areas, in the manner provided by law, including sharing the same with the inhabitants by way of direct benefits. </p> </blockquote> <p> While "territorial jurisdiction" does not appear in the Constitution, it is inscribed in the Local Government Code, the law meant to implement the constitutional mandate under Article X, Section 7. The Local Government Code provides that local government units shall be entitled to a 40% share in the gross collection the State derives from the utilization and development of these natural resources "within their territorial jurisdiction." </p><p> Section 290 of the Local Government Code provides: </p><p> </p><blockquote> SECTION 290. <i>Amount of Share of Local Government Units</i>. - Local government units shall, in addition to the internal revenue allotment, have a share of forty percent (40%) of the gross collection derived by the national government from the preceding fiscal year from mining taxes, royalties, forestry and fishery charges, and such other taxes, fees, or charges, including related surcharges, interests, or fines, and from its share in any co-production, joint venture or production sharing agreement in the utilization and development of the national wealth within their territorial jurisdiction. </blockquote> <p> Until this Court's December 4, 2018 Decision, "territorial jurisdiction" has not been defined. Thus, drawing from the provisions of the Local Government Code and jurisprudence, this Court concluded that territorial jurisdiction referred to "the [local government unit's] territorial boundaries,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> or that jurisdiction "pertaining to a physical location or area as identified by its boundaries":<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> </p><p> </p><blockquote> The Local Government Code does not define the term "territorial jurisdiction." Provisions therein, however, indicate that territorial jurisdiction refers to the LGU's territorial boundaries. <p> Under the Local Government Code, a "province" is composed of a cluster of municipalities, or municipalities and component cities. A âmunicipality," in turn, is described as a group of barangays, while a "city" is referred to as consisting of more urbanized and developed barangays. </p><p> In the creation of municipalities, cities and barangays, the Local Government Code uniformly requires that the territorial jurisdiction of these government units be "properly identified by metes and bounds," thus: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 386. <i>Requisites for Creation</i>.- </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> (b) The territorial jurisdiction of the new barangay shall be properly identified by metes and bounds or by more or less permanent natural boundaries. The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands. </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> Section 442. <i>Requisites for Creation</i>.- </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> (b) The territorial jurisdiction or a newly-created municipality shall be properly identified by metes and bounds. The requirement on land area shall not apply where the municipality proposed to be created is composed of one (1) or more islands. The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands. </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> Section 450. <i>Requisites for Creation</i>. </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> (b) The territorial jurisdiction of a newly-created city shall be properly identified by metes and bounds. The requirement on land area shall not apply where the city proposed to be created is composed of one (1) or more islands. The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands. </p> <p> x x x x </p> </blockquote> <p>The intention, therefore, is to consider an LGU's territorial jurisdiction as pertaining to a physical location or area as identified by its boundaries. This is also clear from other provisions of the Local Government Code, particularly Sections 292 and 294, on the allocation of LGUs' shares from the utilization of national wealth, which speak of the location of the natural resources:</p> <blockquote> <p> Section 292. <i>Allocation of Shares</i>. - The share in the preceding Section shall be distributed in the following manner: </p> <p> (a) Where the natural resources are located in the province: </p> <p> (1) Province - Twenty percent (20%);<br> (2) Component City/Municipality - Forty-five percent (45%); and<br> (3) Barangay - Thirty-five percent (35%) </p> <p> Provided, however, That where the natural resources are located in two (2) or more provinces, or in two (2) or more component cities or municipalities or in two (2) or more barangays, their respective shares shall be computed on the basis of: </p> <blockquote> <p> (1) Population- Seventy percent (70%); and <br> (2) Land area - Thirty percent (30%) </p> </blockquote> <p> (b) Where the natural resources are located in a highly urbanized or independent component city:</p> <blockquote> <p> (1) City - Sixty-five percent (65%): and<br> (2) Barangay - Thirty-five percent (35%) </p> </blockquote> <p> Provided, however. That where the natural resources are located in such two (2) or more cities, the allocation of shares shall be based on the formula on population and land area as specified in paragraph (a) of this Section. </p> <p> Section 294. <i>Development and Livelihood Projects.</i> - The proceeds from the share of local government units pursuant to this chapter shall be appropriated by their respective sanggunian to finance local government and livelihood projects: Provided , however, That at least eighty percent (80%) of the proceeds derived from the development and utilization of hydrothermal, geothermal, and other sources of energy shall be applied solely to lower the cost of electricity in the local government unit where such a source of energy is located. . . . </p> </blockquote> <p> That "territorial jurisdiction" refers to the LGU's territorial boundaries is a construction ret1ective of the discussion of the framers of the 1987 Constitution who referred to the local government as the "locality" that is "hosting" the national resources and a "place where God chose to locate His bounty." It is also consistent with the language ultimately used by the Constitutional Commission when they referred to the national wealth as those found within (the LGU's) respective areas. By definition, "'area" refers to a particular extent of space or surface or a geographic region. </p> <p> Such construction is in conformity with the pronouncement in <i>Sen. Alvarez v. Hon. Guingona, Jr</i>. where the Court, in explaining the need for adequate resources for LGUs to undertake the responsibilities ensuing from decentralization, made the following disquisition in which "territorial jurisdiction" was equated with territorial boundaries: </p> <blockquote> <p> The practical side to development through a decentralized local government system certainly concerns the matter of financial resources. With its broadened powers and increased responsibilities, a local government unit must now operate on a much wider scale. More extensive operations, in turn, entail more expenses. Understandably, the vesting of duty, responsibility and accountability in every local government unit is accompanied with a provision for reasonably adequate resources to discharge its powers and effectively carry out its functions. Availment of such resources is effectuated through the vesting in every local government unit of (1) the right to create and broaden its own source of revenue: (2) the right to be allocated a just share in national taxes. such share being in the form of internal revenue allotments (IRAs): and (3) the right to be given its equitable share in the proceeds of the utilization and development of the national wealth, if any, within its territorial boundaries. . . . </p> </blockquote> <p> An LGU has been defined as a political subdivision of the State which is constituted by law and possessed of substantial control over its own affairs. LGUs, therefore, are creations of law. In this regard, Sections 6 and 7 of the Local Government Code provide: </p> <blockquote> <p> Section 6. <i>Authority to Create Local Government Units</i>. - A local government unit may be created, divided, merged, abolished, or its boundaries substantially altered either by law enacted by Congress in the case of a province, city, municipality, or any other political subdivision, or by ordinance passed by the sangguniang panlalawigan or sangguniang panlungsod concerned in the case of a barangay located within its territorial jurisdiction, subject to such limitations and requirements prescribed in this Code. </p> <p> Section 7. <i>Creation and Conversion</i>. - As a general rule, the creation of a local govenm1ent unit or its conversion from one level to another level shall be based on verifiable indicators of viability and projected capacity to provide services, to wit: </p> <p> (a) Income. - It must be sufficient, based on acceptable standards, to provide for all essential government facilities and services and special functions commensurate with the size of its population, as expected of the local government unit concerned; </p> <p> (b) Population. - It shall be determined as the total number of inhabitants within the territorial jurisdiction of the local government unit concerned; and </p> <p> (c) Land Area. - It must be contiguous, unless it comprises two or more islands or is separated by a local government unit independent of the others; properly identified by metes and bounds with technical descriptions; and sufficient to provide for such basic services and facilities to meet the requirements of its populace. </p> <p> Compliance with the foregoing indicators shall be attested to by the Department of Finance (DOF), the National Statistics Office (NSO), and the Lands Management Bureau (LMB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). . . . </p> </blockquote> <p> In enacting charters of LGUs, Congress is called upon to properly identity their territorial jurisdiction by metes and bounds. <i>Mariano, Jr. v. COMELEC</i> stressed the need to demarcate the territorial boundaries of LGUs with certitude because they define the limits of the local governments' territorial jurisdiction. Reiterating this dictum, the Court, in M<i>unicipality of Pateros v. Court of Appeals, et al</i>., held: </p> <blockquote> <p> [W]e reiterate what we already said about the importance and sanctity of the territorial jurisdiction of an LGU: </p> <blockquote> <p> The importance of drawing with precise strokes the territorial boundaries of a local unit of government cannot be overemphasized. The boundaries must be clear for they define the limits of the territorial jurisdiction of a local government unit. It can legitimately exercise powers of government only within the limits of its territorial jurisdiction. Beyond these limits, its acts are <i>ultra vires</i>. Needless to state, any uncertainty in the boundaries of local government units will sow costly conflicts in the exercise of governmental powers which ultimately will prejudice the people's welfare. This is the evil sought to be avoided by the Local Government Unit in requiring that the land area of a local government unit must be spelled out in metes and bounds, with technical descriptions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> In view of this definition, this Court then went on to state that a local government unit's territorial jurisdiction refers only to its land area. Thus, its 40% share only pertains to the proceeds from the use and development of natural resources found only in its land area: </p><blockquote> <p> To recapitulate, an LGU's territorial jurisdiction refers to its territorial boundaries or to its territory. The territory of LGUs, in turn, refers to their land area, unless expanded by law to include the maritime area. Accordingly, only the utilization of natural resources found within the land area as delimited by law is subject to the LGU's equitable share under Sections 290 and 291 of the Local Government Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> At this juncture, this Court takes the opportunity to clarify its prior interpretation of the scope of a local government unit's territorial jurisdiction. </p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> The Constitution does not define a local government unit's territorial jurisdiction in relation to its entitlement to an equitable share in the utilization and development of the natural wealth. It does, however, mandate that the shares shall be <i>within their respective areas</i> and <i>in the manner provided by law</i>: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 7. Local governments shall be entitled to an equitable share in the proceeds of the utilization and development of the national wealth within their respective areas, in the manner provided by law, including sharing the same with the inhabitants by way of direct benefits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Moreover, the Constitution assigns the natural boundaries of local government units as either "territorial and political subdivisions" or "autonomous regions": </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 1.

However, the phrase "must be contiguous" is followed by an important proviso: "<i>unless it comprises two or more islands</i>[.]" </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 386. <i>Requisites for Creation</i>. â </p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> (b) The territorial jurisdiction of the new Barangay shall be properly identified by metes and bounds or by more or less permanent natural boundaries.

The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands. </p> </blockquote> <p> The Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Local Government Code is even more explicit. Article 9(2) provides: </p><blockquote> <p> ARTICLE 9.<i> Provinces</i>. â (a) Requisites for creation â A province shall not be created unless the following requisites on income and either population or land area are present: </p> <p> . . . . </p> <p> (2) Population or land area â Population which shall not be less than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) inhabitants, as certified by NSO; or land area which must be contiguous with an area of at least two thousand (2,000) square kilometers, as certified by LMB. The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises two (2) or more islands or is separated by a chartered city or cities which do not contribute to the income or the province.<i> The land area requirement shall not apply where the proposed province is composed of one (1) or more islands.</i> The territorial jurisdiction of a province sought to be created shall be properly identified by metes and bounds. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Incidentally, Article 9(2)âand notably its exemption to land area requirementâhad been put into question before, with this Court eventually upholding its constitutionality. </p><p> In<i> Navarro v. Ermita</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> this Court was confronted with the issue of whether Dinagat Islands could be considered a province since its total land mass was only 802.12 square kilometers, which was below the 2,000 square kilometers required by Article 9(2). Petitioners in that case, who were the former Vice Governor and members of the Provincial Board of Surigao del Norte, questioned the provision's constitutionality, arguing that the exemption to land area requirement was not explicitly provided in the Local Government Code. </p><p> The majority initially declared Article 9(2) unconstitutional for being "an extraneous provision not intended by the Local Government Code[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> On reconsideration, however, the majority reversed its decision and upheld the constitutionality of the assailed provision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> It found: </p><blockquote> <p> [W]hen the local government unit to be created consists of one (1) or more islands, it is exempt from the land area requirement as expressly provided in Section 442 and Section 450 of the LGC if the local government unit to be created is a municipality or a component city, respectively. This exemption is absent in the enumeration of the requisites for the creation of a province under Section 461 of the LGC, although it is expressly stated under Article 9 (2) of the LGC-IRR. </p> <p> There appears neither rhyme nor reason why this exemption should apply to cities and municipalities, but not to provinces. In fact, considering the physical configuration of the Philippine archipelago, there is a greater likelihood that islands or group of islands would form part of the land area of a newly-created province than in most cities or municipalities. It is, therefore, logical to infer that the genuine legislative policy decision was expressed in Section 442 (for municipalities) and Section 450 (for component cities) of the LGC, but was inadvertently omitted in Section 461 (for provinces). Thus, when the exemption was expressly provided in Article 9 (2) of the LGC-IRR, the inclusion was intended to correct the congressional oversight in Section 461 of the LGC â and to reflect the true legislative intent. It would, then, be in order for the Court to uphold the validity of Article 9 (2) of the LGC-IRR. </p> <p> This interpretation finds merit when we consider the basic policy considerations underpinning the principle of local autonomy. </p> <p> . . . . </p> <p> Consistent with the declared policy to provide local government units genuine and meaningful local autonomy, contiguity and minimum land area requirements for prospective local government units should be liberally construed in order to achieve the desired results. The strict units genuine and meaningful local autonomy, contiguity and minimum land area requirements for prospective local government units should be liberally construed in order to achieve the desired results. The strict interpretation adopted by the February 10, 2010 Decision could prove to be counter-productive, if not outright absurd, awkward, and impractical. Picture an intended province that consists of several municipalities and component cities which, in themselves, also consist of islands. The component cities and municipalities which consist of islands are exempt from the minimum land area requirement, pursuant to Sections 450 and 442, respectively, of the LGC. Yet, the province would be made to comply with the minimum land area criterion of 2,000 square kilometers, even if it consists of several islands. This would mean that Congress has opted to assign a distinctive preference to create a province with contiguous land area over one composed of islands â and negate the greater imperative of development of self-reliant communities, rural progress, and the delivery of basic services to the constituency. This preferential option would prove more difficult and burdensome if the 2,000-square-kilometer territory of a province is scattered because the islands are separated by bodies of water, as compared to one with a contiguous land mass. </p> <p> Moreover, such a very restrictive construction could trench on the equal protection clause, as it actually defeats the purpose of local autonomy and decentralization as enshrined in the Constitution. Hence, the land area requirement should be read together with territorial contiguity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, it is clear from the laws and regulations defining a local government unit's "respective area" that the requirement of contiguity <i>shall not apply if the local government unit is comprised of islands</i>. All that is required is that it is properly identified by its metes and bounds. </p><p> This clarification is necessary considering the geographical peculiarities unique to the Province of Palawan. </p><p align="center"> <b>III</b> </p><p> The Province of Palawan, previously known as the Province of Paragua, was created under Act No. 422.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Section 2 of the Act, as amended,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> provides the Province of Paragua's specific metes and bounds: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 2.

However, it was also clear that the Province of Palawan was not required to diminish its future resources in order to reimburse the national government for the funds received should there be a final ruling in this Resolution. </p><p> For this Court, it is a reasonable presumption that the national government wanted to immediately augment the Province of Palawan's funds for its constituents. Certainly, at that point when the funds were made available, both the national government and the Province of Palawan intended to provide for the general welfare. To require the return of funds now after this Court finally decides not only undermines public welfare and the presumption of regularity of the actions of public officials, but it will likewise weaken the very local autonomy envisioned by the Constitution. </p><p> Therefore, the Province of Palawan need not return the P600 million it received under Executive Order No. 683. Moving forward, any share that Congress will allot for the province will purely be an act of political discretion.
