"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Thus, even after the submission of comments from parties that may be affected by this Court's resolution, the issues before us remain the same: <i> first, </i> whether or not the Court of Appeals can be compelled by writ of mandamus to pass upon the constitutionality of a statute, and <i>second,</i> whether or not the issue of constitutionality has been rendered moot.<br>&nbsp;<br>While not raised as an issue by the parties before this Court, we find that for a complete resolution of all controversies in this case, we must likewise first pass upon the issue of whether or not the trial court erred in dismissing the Complaint on the ground that the Office of the Solicitor General was not impleaded as a party. &nbsp; <br><b><center><br>I</center></b><br>&nbsp;The trial court erred in dismissing the Complaint on the ground that the Republic, represented by the Office of the Solicitor General, was not impleaded in this case.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Complaint, while denominated as a <i> Declaration of Nullity of Notice of Sale, Certificate of Sale&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; TCTs and Declaration as Unconstitutional Sec. 47, RA No. 8791,</i> was, in reality, an action for declaratory relief. Petitioner, in seeking the nullification of the foreclosure sale, questioned the validity of Republic Act No. 8791, Section 47 insofar as the law limits the redemption period for juridical persons to only three (3) months. Petitioner was a juridical person affected by the shorter redemption period. Under Rule 63, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, any person whose rights are affected by a statute may bring an action before the trial court to determine its validity: <br><blockquote><br>SECTION 1. <i>Who May File Petition. </i> - Any person interested under a deed, will , contract or other written instrument, or whose rights are affected by a statute, executive order or regulation, ordinance, or any other governmental regulation may, before breach or violation thereof[,] bring an action in the appropriate Regional Trial Court to determine any question of construction or validity arising , and for a declaration of his rights or duties, thereunder.<br></blockquote>In dismissing the action, the trial court cited Rule 63, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, in that the Solicitor General was required to be impleaded in all actions where the validity of a statute was in question:&nbsp; <blockquote><br>SECTION 3. <i> Notice on Solicitor General.&nbsp; -</i> In any action which involves the validity of a statute, executive order or regulation, or any other governmental regulation, the Solicitor General shall be notified by the party assailing the same and shall be entitled to be heard upon such question. <br></blockquote>The Rules, however, only require that notice be given to the Solicitor General. They do not state that if the Solicitor General fails to participate in the action, the action would be dismissed. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Administrative Code provides that the Solicitor General shall appear in any action involving the validity of a statute "when in his [or her] judgment his intervention is necessary <i> or when requested by the Court."</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> <br>&nbsp;<br>In this instance, the trial court sent a copy of the Complaint to the Office of the Solicitor General.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The Office of the Solicitor General, however, did not participate in the case. The failure of the Office of the Solicitor General to participate, however, should not prejudice a litigant's cause. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The trial court dismissed the action on the ground that the Solicitor General may be deprived of due process. Due process, however, has already been accorded to the Solicitor General when he/she was furnished with a copy of the Complaint. The Solicitor General's failure to comment on the Complaint should have the effect of waiving his or her right to participate in the case. To hold otherwise would be to give the Solicitor General more power than what the law grants. The Solicitor General does not have and should not have unbridled control over cases that were originally filed between private parties. &nbsp; <br><center><br>II</center>&nbsp;<br>The grant of declaratory relief is discretionary on the courts. Courts may refuse to declare rights or to construe instruments if it will not terminate the controversy or if it is unnecessary and improper under the circumstances. A discretionary act cannot be the subject of a petition for mandamus. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While Petitioner's Complaint before the trial court was captioned as one for <i>Declaration of Nullity of Notice of Sale, Certificate of Sale&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; TCTs and Declaration as Unconstitutional Sec. 47, RA No. 8791, </i> it was, as the Court of Appeals correctly found, a petition for declaratory relief. Petitioner sought the declaration of Republic Act No. 8791 unconstitutional so that, in effect, the foreclosure proceedings of the properties now held by private respondent would be declared void. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Courts, however, have the discretion of whether to entertain an action for declaratory relief. In <i>Chan v. Galang :</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><blockquote>Declaratory relief is discretionary upon the court to entertain. It may refuse to exercise the power to declare rights and to construe instruments in any case where the declaration or construction is not necessary and proper at the time under all the circumstances[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>The same paragraph now appears in Rule 63, Section 5 of the Rules of Court: <br><blockquote><br>SECTION 5. <i>Court Action&nbsp; Discretionary. </i> - Except in actions falling under the second paragraph of section 1 of this Rule, the court, <i>motu proprio </i>or upon motion, may refuse to exercise the power to declare rights and to construe instruments in any case where a decision would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy which gave rise to the action, or in any case where the declaration or construction is not necessary and proper under the circumstances.<br></blockquote>Although the Regional Trial Courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over actions for declaratory relief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court of Appeals exercises appellate jurisdiction over final judgments of the trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Thus, the Court of Appeals may, in appeals of actions for declaratory relief, apply Rule 63 of the Rules of Court in resolving the appeal.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Court of Appeals, in deferring the question of the validity of Republic Act No. 8791, Section 47 to the Court of Appeals, cited Rule 63, Section 5of the Rules of Court, and held that to resolve the Petition "would be an empty discourse and will not terminate the controversy. "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> This was an exercise of the Court of Appeals' discretion.<br><br>Any person may file a verified petition for mandamus against any tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person who "unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Petitioner submits that the Court of Appeals had the duty to pass upon the issue of the statute's constitutionality. By refusing to pass upon it, it argues that the Court of Appeals unlawfully neglected its duty and may properly be the subject of a petition for mandamus.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mandamus, however, may issue only to compel the performance of a ministerial duty.&nbsp; It cannot be issued to compel the performance of a discretionary act. In <i>Metro Manila Development Authority v. Concerned&nbsp; Residents of Manila Bay:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><blockquote>Generally, the writ of <i>mandamus</i> lies to require the execution of a ministerial duty. A ministerial duty is one that "requires neither the exercise of official discretion nor judgment." It connotes an act in which nothing is left to the discretion of the person executing it. It is a "simple, definite duty arising under conditions admitted or proved to exist and imposed by law." <i> Mandamus </i> is available to compel action, when refused, on matters involving discretion, but not to direct the exercise of judgment or discretion one way or the other.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Petitioner cannot file a petition for mandamus to compel what is essentially a discretionary act on the Court of Appeals. What Petitioner should have done was to file a petition for certiorari to question the exercise of the Court of Appeals' discretion. Unfortunately, Petitioner filed the wrong remedy. As such, the Petition must be denied. &nbsp;&nbsp; <b><center><br>&nbsp;III<br></center></b>&nbsp;<br>Even assuming that the Court of Appeals may be compelled to rule on the issue of the validity of Republic Act No. 8791, Section 47, the Petition has already become moot in view of the promulgation of <i> Goldenway Merchandising Corporation v. Equitable PCI Bank.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Goldenway Merchandising,</i> this Court squarely addressed the argument that Republic Act No. 8791, Section 47 violated the equal protection clause when it provided a shorter redemption period for juridical persons. This Court, in finding the argument unmeritorious, stated:&nbsp; <blockquote><br>Petitioner' s claim that Section 47 infringes the equal protection clause as it discriminates mortgagors/property owners who are juridical persons is equally bereft of merit. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The equal protection clause is directed principally against undue favor and individual or class privilege. It is not intended to prohibit legislation which is limited to the object to which it is directed or by the territory in which it is to operate. It does not require absolute equality, but merely that all persons be treated alike under like conditions both as to privileges conferred and liabilities imposed. Equal protection permits of reasonable classification. We have ruled that one class may be treated differently from another where the groupings are based on reasonable and real distinctions. If classification is germane to the purpose of the law, concerns all members of the class, and applies equally to present and future conditions, the classification does not violate the equal protection guarantee. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We agree with the CA that the legislature clearly intended to shorten the period of redemption for juridical persons whose properties were foreclosed and sold in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 3135. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The difference in the treatment of juridical persons and natural persons was based on the nature of the properties foreclosed â whether these are used as residence, for which the more liberal one-year redemption period is retained, or used for industrial or commercial purposes, in which case a shorter term is deemed necessary to reduce the period of uncertainty in the ownership of property and enable mortgageeÂ­ banks to dispose sooner of these acquired assets. It must be underscored that the General Banking Law of 2000, crafted in the aftermath of the 1997 Southeast Asian financial crisis, sought to reform the General Banking Act of 1949 by fashioning a legal framework for maintaining a safe and sound banking system. In this context, the amendment introduced by Section 47 embodied one of such safe and sound practices aimed at ensuring the solvency and liquidity of our banks. It cannot therefore be disputed that the said provision amending the redemption period in Act 3135 was based on a reasonable classification and germane to the purpose of the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>As pointed out by the Office of the Solicitor General, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and the Bankers Association of the Philippines, the constitutionality of Section 47 of Republic Act No. 8791 has likewise been passed upon in <i>White Marketing Development Corporation&nbsp; v.&nbsp; Grandwood&nbsp; Furniture and Woodwork:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><blockquote>Grandwood had three months from the foreclosure or before the certificate of foreclosure sale was registered to redeem the foreclosed prope1iy. This holds true even when Metrobank ceased to be the mortgagee in view of its assignment to ARC of its credit, because the latter acquired all the rights of the former under the mortgage contract â including the shorter redemption period. The shorter redemption period should also redound to the benefit of White Marketing as the highest bidder in the foreclosure sale as it stepped into the shoes of the assignee-mortgagee. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Measured by the foregoing parameters, the Court finds that Grandwood's redemption was made out of time as it was done after the certificate of sale was registered on September 30, 2013. Pursuant to Section 47 of R.A. No. 8791, it only had three (3) months from foreclosure or before the registration of the certificate of foreclosure sale, whichever came first, to redeem the property sole in the extrajudicial sale. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Such interpretation is in harmony with the avowed purpose of R.A. No. 8791 in providing for a shorter redemption period for juridical persons. In <i> Goldenway Merchandising Corporation v. Equitable PCI Bank, </i> the Court explained that the shortened period under Section 47 of R.A. No. 8791 served as additional security for banks to maintain their solvency and liquidity, to wit:<br><blockquote>The difference in the treatment of juridical persons and natural persons was based on the nature of the properties foreclosed â whether these are used as residence, for which the more liberal one-year redemption period is retained, or used for industrial or commercial purposes, in which case a shorter term is deemed necessary to reduce the period of uncertainty in the ownership of property and enable mortgagee-banks to dispose sooner of these acquired assets. It must be underscored that the General Banking Law of 2000, crafted in the aftermath of the 1997 Southeast Asian financial crisis, sought to reform the General Banking Act of 1949 by fashioning a legal framework for maintaining a safe and sound banking system. In this context, the amendment introduced by Section 47 embodied one of such safe and sound practices aimed at ensuring the solvency and liquidity of our banks. It cannot therefore be disputed that the said provision amending the redemption period in Act 3135 was based on a reasonable classification and germane to the purpose of the law.<br></blockquote>To adopt Grandwood's position that Section 47 of R.A. No. 8791 no longer applies would defeat its very purpose to provide additional security to mortgagee-banks. The shorter redemption period is an incentive which mortgagee-banks may use to encourage prospective assignees to accept the assignment of credit for a consideration. If the redemption period under R.A. No. 8791 would be extended upon the assignment by the bank of its rights under a mortgage contract, then it would be tedious for banks to find willing parties to be subrogated in its place. Thus, it would adversely limit the bank's opportunities to quickly dispose of its hard assets, and maintain its solvency and liquidity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The same case has also been cited in <i>Spouses Limso v. Philippine&nbsp; National Bank,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> where this Court upheld the rationale for the shorter redemption period for juridical persons:&nbsp; <blockquote><br>We rule that the period of redemption for this case should be not more than three (3) months in accordance with Section 47 of Republic Act No. 8791. The mortgaged properties are all owned by Davao Sunrise. Section 47 of Republic Act No. 8791 states: "the mortgagor or debtor whose real property has been sold" and "juridical persons whose property is being sold[.]" Clearly, the law itself provides that the right to redeem belongs to the owner of the property mortgaged. As the mortgaged properties all belong to Davao Sunrise, the shorter period of three (3) months is the applicable redemption period. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The policy behind the shorter redemption period was explained in <i> Goldenway Merchandising Corporation v. Equitable PCI Bank:</i> <br>&nbsp;<br>To grant a longer period of redemption on the ground that a co-debtor is a natural person defeats the purpose of Republic Act No. 8791. In addition, the real properties mortgaged by Davao Sunrise appear to be used for commercial purposes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Citations omitted) <br></blockquote>Despite being given numerous opportunities to do so, Petitioner has neither mentioned <i>Goldenway Merchandising</i> in any of its pleadings nor argued against its applicability in this case. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While this Court looks with favor on the redemption of properties by its owners, the process of redemption is still a statutory privilege. Parties must still comply with the laws and the procedural rules on the matter. In <i>City of Davao v. Intestate Estate of Amado D. Dalisay:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><blockquote>While it is a given that redemption by property owners is looked upon with favor, it is equally true that the right to redeem properties remains to be a statutory privilege. Redemption is by force of law, and the purchaser at public auction is bound to accept it. Further, the right to redeem property sold as security for the satisfaction of an unpaid obligation does not exist preternaturally. Neither is it predicated on proprietary right, which, after the sale of the property on execution, leaves the judgment debtor and vests in the purchaser. Instead, it is a bare statutory privilege to be exercised only by the persons named in the statute. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In other words, a valid redemption of property must appropriately be based on the law which is the very source of this substantive right.&nbsp; It is, therefore, necessary that compliance with the rules set forth by law and jurisprudence should be shown in order to render validity to the exercise of this right. Hence, when the Court is beckoned to rule on this validity, a hasty resort to elementary rules on construction proves inadequate. Especially so, when there are deeper underpinnings involved, not only as to the right of the owner to take back his property, but equally important, as to the right of the purchaser to acquire the property after deficient compliance with statutory requirements, including the exercise of the right within the period prescribed by law. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Court cannot close its eyes and automatically rule in favor of the redemptioner at all times. The right acquired by the purchaser at an execution sale is inchoate and does not become absolute until after the expiration of the redemption period without the right of redemption having been exercised. " But inchoate though it be, it is, like any other right, entitled to protection and must be respected until extinguished by redemption." Suffice it to say, the liberal application of redemption laws in favor of the property owner is not an austere solution to a controversy, where there are remarkable factors that lead to a more sound and reasonable interpretation of the law[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote>&nbsp;<br><b><center><br>IV</center></b><br>&nbsp;The Constitution guarantees that no person shall be denied equal protection of the laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The right to equal protection of the laws guards "against undue favor and individual or class privilege, as well as hostile discrimination or the oppression of inequality. "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Equal protection, however, was not intended to prohibit the legislature from enacting statutes that either tend to create specific classes of persons or objects, or tend to affect only these specific classes of persons or objects. Equal protection "does not demand absolute equality among residents; it merely requires that all persons shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions both as to privileges conferred and liabilities enforced."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> As aptly discussed in <i>Victoriano v. Elizalde Rope Workers Union:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><blockquote>The guaranty of equal protection of the laws is not a guaranty of equality in the application of the laws upon all citizens of the state. It is not, therefore, a requirement, in order to avoid the constitutional prohibition against inequality, that every man, woman and child should be affected alike by a statute. Equality of operation of statutes does not mean indiscriminate operation on persons merely as such, but on persons according to the circumstances surrounding them. It guarantees equality, not identity of rights. The Constitution does not require that things which are different in fact be treated in law as though they were the same. The equal protection clause does not forbid discrimination as to things that are different. It does not prohibit legislation which is limited either in the object to which it is directed or by the territory within which it is to operate. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The equal protection of the laws clause of the Constitution allows classification. Classification in law, as in the other departments of knowledge or practice, is the grouping of things in speculation or practice because they agree with one another in certain particulars. A law is not invalid because of simple inequality. The very idea of classification is that of inequality, so that it goes without saying that the mere fact of inequality in no manner determines the matter of constitutionality. All that is required of a valid classification is that it be reasonable, which means that the classification should be based on substantial distinctions which make for real differences; that it must be germane to the purpose of the law; that it must not be limited to existing conditions only; and that it must apply equally to each member of the class. This Court has held that the standard is satisfied if the classification or distinction is based on a reasonable foundation or rational basis and is not palpably arbitrary. <br>&nbsp;<br>In the exercise of its power to make classifications for the purpose of enacting laws over matters within its jurisdiction, the state is recognized as enjoying a wide range of discretion. It is not necessary that the classification be based on scientific or marked differences of things or in their relation. Neither is it necessary that the classification be made with mathematical nicety. Hence legislative classification may in many cases properly rest on narrow distinctions, for the equal protection guaranty does not preclude the legislature from recognizing degrees of evil or harm, and legislation is addressed to evils as they may appear.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></blockquote>Thus, a statute that treats one class differently from another class will not violate the equal protection clause as long as the classification is valid. In <i>Samahan ng Progresibong Kabataan v. Quezon City,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> this Court summarized the three (3) tests to determine the reasonableness of a classification:<br><blockquote>The strict scrutiny test applies when a classification either (i) interferes with the exercise of fundamental rights, including the basic liberties guaranteed under the Constitution, or (ii) burdens suspect classes. The intermediate scrutiny test applies when a classification does not involve suspect classes or fundamental rights, but requires heightened scrutiny, such as in classifications based on gender and legitimacy. Lastly, the rational basis test applies to all other subjects not covered by the first two tests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote>A "suspect class" is defined as "a class saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process. "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Juridical entities enjoy certain advantages that natural persons do not, such as limited liability. A corporation has a separate and distinct personality from its corporate officers or stockholders. It may incur its own liabilities and is responsible for the payment of its debts. Thus, a corporate officer or a stockholder, as a general rule, is not personally held liable for corporate debts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br>&nbsp;<br>The properties of juridical entities are also often used for commercial purposes. Corporations will give more attention to assets that are incomeÂ­ generating, and will also be equipped with greater resources for the protection of these assets. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In contrast, the properties of natural persons are more often used for residential purposes. They are also directly responsible for the liabilities they incur and, often, are not equipped with the same resources that juridical entities may have. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Juridical entities, thus, cannot be considered a "suspect class." The rational basis test may be applied to determine the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 8971, Section 47. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"The rational basis test requires only that there be a legitimate government interest and that there is a reasonable connection between it and the means employed to achieve it."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> A longer period of redemption is given to natural persons whose mortgaged properties are more often used for residential purposes. A shorter period of redemption is given to juridical persons whose properties are more often used for commercial purposes. <i> Goldenway Merchandising </i> explains that the shorter period is aimed to ensure the solvency and liquidity of banks. This helps minimize the period of uncertainty in the ownership of commercial properties and enable mortgagee-banks to dispose of these acquired assets quickly. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There is, thus, a legitimate government interest in the protection of the banking industry and a legitimate government interest in the protection of foreclosed residential properties owned by natural persons. The shortened period of redemption for juridical entities may be considered to be the reasonable means for the protection of both these interests. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b> WHEREFORE, </b> the Petition is <b> DENIED. <br><br>SO ORDERED.</b><br>&nbsp;<br><i>Peralta, C.J., Caguioa, Gesmundo, Reyes, J.,&nbsp; JR., Hernando, Carandang,Lazaro-Javier, Inting</i>, and <i>Zalameda, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Perlas-Bernabe, J</i>. on official leave.<br><i>Reyes, A., JR., J</i>., on official business<br><i>Lopez, J</i>. on wellness leave.<br><div><br></div><div><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="center"><br><br><div align="center">&nbsp;<b>NOTICE OF JUDGMENT &nbsp;</b><br></div>&nbsp;<br>Sirs/Mesdames: &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Please
