overpayment in the amount of P13,160,534.06 resulting from the use of the 4% tax rate, which was in turn due to the addition of the 50,000 treasury shares to the 562,367,000 outstanding shares of

</p> <p> On November 13, 2009, petitioner filed a Petition for Review before the CTA after the respondent failed to act on the claim for refund and in order to toll the running of the prescriptive period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Petitioner argued that the treasury shares should be excluded from the divisor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Further, petitioner stated that the tax under Section 127(B) should be based on the<em> total</em> shares sold in primary and secondary offerings in proportion to the total outstanding shares of stock of the corporation

CTA Second Division agreed with petitioner that the 50,000,000 treasury shares should have been excluded from the divisor, which ruling settled the issue on the exclusion of the treasury shares.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Nevertheless, the CTA Second Division still denied the Petition for Review for petitioner's failure to prove its status of being a closely held corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p> Notably, the CTA Second Division affirmed petitioner's position that the dividend should be the <i>total</i> number of shares sold during the initial public offering, <b><u>regardless of whether they are offered in primary or secondary offering</u></b>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Petitioner alleges that in determining the tax rate to be used, Section 127 of the NIRC does not distinguish whether the shares of stocks sold or otherwise disposed of is covered by primary or secondary offering. The law is clear that the tax rate shall depend on the proportion of shares of stock sold, bartered or exchanged to the total outstanding shares of stock after listing, or based on the following formula: shares of stock sold, bartered or otherwise disposed divided by the total outstanding shares of stock after the listing in the local stock exchange. While the law provides a distinction on who shall pay the IPO tax (i.e., issuing corporation in 'primary offering' and selling shareholder in 'secondary offering'), it does not provide for separate computations for the taxes to be paid and the tax rates to be used for each type of taxpayer or 'offering' during the same IPO. <u>Thus, a joint computation, using the total number of shares sold during the IPO, should determine the IPO tax rate to be used</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis retained) </p> </blockquote> <p> The dispositive portion of the May 23, 2011

ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>On June 10, 2011, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration, essentially arguing that Section 127(B) does not require petitioner to prove that it is a closely held corporation before it can be entitled to the refund of tax in question.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p> In its August 18, 2011 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the CTA Second Division reconsidered and reversed its earlier ruling that petitioner needed to prove that it was a closely held corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <b><u>Nevertheless, it still denied the claim for refund on the basis of Section 6 (C) of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 06, series of 2008<sup

style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The CTA Second Division deemed it proper to apply RR 06-2008 retroactively pursuant to the principle that an administrative rule interpretative of a statute

whether the tax on sale of shares of stock sold or exchanged through initial public offering under Section 127 (B) is <em>separately </em>computed for shares in primary and secondary offerings. </p><p align="center"> <b>Our Ruling</b> </p><p> We rule in the affirmative. </p><table width="30%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><b>Every sale of shares under Section 127 (B) taxed. </b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>A plain reading of Section 127(B) shows that tax is imposed on "<em>every sale</em>, barter, exchange or other disposition through initial public offering of shares of stock in closely held corporations": </p><blockquote> <p> <b>SEC. 127. <i>Tax on Sale, Barter or Exchange of Shares of Stock Listed and Traded through the Local Stock Exchange or through Initial Public Offering</i>.</b> –</p> <p align="justify"> x x x x</p> <p> <b>(B) Tax on Shares of Stock Sold or Exchanged Through Initial Public Offering. </b>- There shall be levied, assessed and collected on <b><u>every sale, barter, exchange or other disposition through initial public offering of shares of stock in closely held corporations</u></b>, as defined herein, a tax at the rates provided hereunder based on the gross selling price or gross value in money of the shares of stock sold, bartered, exchanged or otherwise disposed in accordance with the proportion of shares of stock sold, bartered, exchanged or otherwise disposed to the total outstanding shares of stock after the listing in the local stock exchange: </p> <blockquote> <table width="63%" border="0">

align="justify">Over thirty-three and one third percent (33 1/3%)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">1%</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> The word "every" precedes the word "sale." The use of such word is clear and leaves no room for interpretation. <i>Each sale</i> of shares of stock in closely held corporations through initial public offering is taxed under Section 127(B). </p><p> The tax on every sale under Section 127 (B) is in turn based on the "gross selling price or gross value in money of shares of stock sold, bartered, exchanged or otherwise disposed in accordance with the proportion of shares of stock sold, bartered, exchanged or otherwise disposed to the total outstanding shares of stock after the listing." </p><p> Since tax is imposed on every sale of shares of stock, there is a need to determine which sales are covered in the sale of shares through initial public offering. On this score, the second paragraph of Section 127(B) precisely provides for the types of sales involved: sale by the issuing corporation in primary offering, and sale by each of the corporation's shareholders in secondary offering: </p><blockquote> <p> The tax herein imposed shall be paid by the issuing corporation in primary offering or by the seller in secondary offering. </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, every sale in Section 127(B) is referenced to the seller,<em> i.e.</em>, the issuing corporation in case of primary offering, and each of the selling shareholders of the corporation in case of secondary offering. The sale contemplated is not a 1one, lump sum sale, as suggested by the petitioner, since more than one sale may transpire under Section 127(B). </p><p> In arguing that Section 127(B) provides for a joint computation of tax on sale of shares in primary and secondary offerings, I-Remit focuses only on the phrase "shares of stock sold, bartered, exchanged or otherwise disposed in accordance with the proportion of shares of stock sold, bartered, exchanged or otherwise disposed to the total outstanding shares of stock after the listing." It chooses to disregard the rest of the provision, contrary to the principle that "[a] statute must be so construed as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions whenever possible."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p> Yet even this oft-quoted phrase of petitioner indicates the intent to differentiate the computation of tax on sale of shares in primary and secondary offerings. The word "total" is used to describe the outstanding shares after the listing (or the divisor in the computation), while the same word is noticeably not used in describing the "shares" offered during the initial public offering (or the dividend in the computation). Obviously, the "shares" contemplated is not lump sum in that it includes all the shares sold during the initial public offering, otherwise the word "total" would have also been used to describe it. </p><p> Further, the distinction is readily apparent from a reading of Section 127 (C) of the NIRC, which expressly provides for a separate time and manner of payment of tax in primary and secondary offerings as well as the party liable to pay the corresponding tax: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>(C) Return on Capital Gains Realized from Sale of Shares of Stocks. -</b></p> <p> <b>(1) Return on Capital Gains Realized from Sale of Shares of Stock Listed and Traded in the Local Stock Exchange. - <u>It shall be the duty of every stock broker who effected the sale subject to the tax imposed herein to collect the tax and remit the same to the Bureau of Internal Revenue within five (5) banking days from the date of collection thereof</u></b> and to submit on Mondays of each week to the secretary of the stock exchange, of which he is a member, a true and complete return which shall contain a declaration of all the transactions effected through him during the preceding week and of taxes collected by him and turned over to the Bureau of Internal Revenue. </p> <p> <b>(2) Return on Public Offerings of Shares of Stock. - <u>In case of primary offering, the corporate issuer shall file the return and pay the corresponding tax within thirty (30) days from the date of listing of the shares of stock in the local stock exchange. In the case of secondary offering, the provision of Subsection (C) (1) of this Section shall apply as to the time and manner of the payment of the tax</u></b>. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> While the tax on sale of shares in primary offering should be filed and paid by the <em>issuing corporation</em> within <em>thirty (30) days from the date of listing</em> of the shares of stock in the local stock exchange,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the tax on sale of shares in secondary offering should be collected and remitted by the <em>stock broker</em> within<em> five (5) banking days from the date of collection</em> thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> It cannot be any clearer from the foregoing that the sale of shares in primary offering is treated separately from the sale in secondary offering. Necessarily, the corresponding tax for every sale is likewise computed separately. </p><table width="30%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b>Section 6 (C) of RR 06-2008 is consistent with Section 127(B).</b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>To implement Section 127(B), RR 06-2008 was issued by the CIR on April 22, 2008, months<em> after </em>petitioner's initial public offering on October 17, 2007.

As discussed above, Section 127(B) is clear in requiring a separate computation of tax on shares offered in primary and secondary offerings. Thus, Section 6(C), in illustrating how the tax should be computed separately, is consistent with Section 127(B). </p><p> We also find as misplaced petitioner's argument that RR 06-2008 may not be applied retroactively when it will affect vested rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> While the CTA Second Division indeed applied RR 06-2008 retroactively in its August 18, 2011 Resolution, a reading of the CTA <em>En Banc</em>'s assailed Decision shows that the CTA <em>En Banc</em> did not apply RR 06-2008 in deciding petitioner's case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Its ruling was anchored on the clarity of Section 127(B) in that the tax on sale of shares in primary and secondary offerings shall be separately computed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Since it is the CTA <em>En Banc</em>'s assailed Decision which is the subject of the instant Petition, petitioner's argument on retroactive application fails. </p><table width="30%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><b>RR No. 03, series of 1995<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (RR 03-1995) considers as separate transactions the sale of shares in primary and secondary offerings. </b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>We now look at RR 03-1995, the implementing rule of Section 124-A of the old Tax Code from which Section 127 of the NIRC was lifted. RR 03-1995 was the prevailing rule during petitioner's initial public offering on October 17, 2007. It is apparent from a plain reading of RR 03-1995 that the sale of shares in primary and secondary offerings are separately treated. Section 7, in relation to Section 5 (b),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> provides: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>SECTION 7. Transactions Covered. </b></p> <p> (a) Sale, barter or exchange or other disposition of shares of stock listed and traded through the local stock exchange; </p> <p> (b) Sale, barter or exchange or other disposition of shares of stock in closely-held corporations through <b><u>initial/primary public offering</u></b> (IPO); and</p> <p> (c) Sale, barter or exchange or other disposition of shares of stock in closely-held corporations through <b><u>secondary offering</u></b>. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> By expressly differentiating between the sale of shares in primary and secondary offerings, RR 03-1995 made it clear that the corresponding tax shall also be separately computed. Thus, even during the effectivity of the old Tax Code and RR 03-1995, the tax on sale of shares in primary and secondary offerings have always been separately computed. </p><table width="30%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><b>The Percentage Tax Return corresponding to Section 127(B) requires a separate computation.</b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>There should be no confusion as to the separate computation. Aside from the clarity of Section 127(B), it is also clear from the Percentage Tax Return for transactions under Section 127(B) that a separate computation of the tax due is required. Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Form No. 2552 (July 1999 version)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> provides separate fields for computation of tax on sale of shares in primary and secondary offerings: </p><p align="center">(see image, p. 12) </p><p> Interestingly, when petitioner used the same form to report the tax on its sale of shares during the October 17, 2007 initial public offering, petitioner used the fields in primary offering to compute for the tax on sale of shares in both primary and secondary offerings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> It deliberately ignored the fields for secondary offering, as can be seen below: </p><p align="center">(see image, p. 13) </p>Given the specificity of BIR Form No. 2552, petitioner should not have jointly computed the tax on sale of shares in primary and secondary offerings. <p></p><table width="30%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><b>A vested right may not spring from a wrong construction of law. </b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Finally, I-Remit argues that it has the right to rely on the favorable pronouncement of the CTA Second Division in its May 23, 2011 Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> To recall, the Second Division of the Tax Court stated that "a joint computation, using the total number of shares sold during the IPO, should determine the IPO tax rate to be used."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> </p><p> However, the pronouncement was an erroneous interpretation of Section 127(B) from which no vested right may arise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, it cannot be the source of any vested right in favor of petitioner – more so in this case where the said pronouncement was reversed and reconsidered by the same court in its August 18,2011 Resolution. </p><p> In fine, we rule that the tax on sale of shares of stock in closely held corporations sold or exchanged through initial public offering under Sec. 127 (B) is <i>separately</i> computed as to shares offered in primary and secondary offerings. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review is <b>DENIED</b>.
