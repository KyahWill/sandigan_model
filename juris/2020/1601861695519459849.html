Because of this tragic incident, the vessel changed course and set sail to Galle, Sri Lanka instead, where Manuel's remains were unloaded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p> On October 18, 2013, Senior Counsel Murshid Maharoof (Maharoof) and Junior Counsel Shamir Zavahir (Zavahir) conducted an investigation on the death of Manual. In the Investigation Report on the Death of Manuel Augastine Borreta, Jr.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Investigation Report) they prepared, the investigators stated that the statements of the master, chief officer, crew members, logged in the vessel log book as well as the details on the medical assistance record showed that Manuel had not been acting like his usual self. On October 7, 2013, he failed to report for work and locked himself in the vessel's gymnasium and then later shut himself inside the hospital. When they tried to communicate with him, Manuel sounded distraught, talked non-sense and fearful that someone was going to kill him. They could only talk to him through the ship's phone. Manuel was offered food the following day but he refused to partake of the same. When Manuel stopped communicating with them, the crew decided to force open the door to the hospital room but found it unlocked and empty. The crew eventually found Manuel inside the vessel's hospital lavatory, with a nylon cord tied around his neck and hanging on a hook, dead. These facts notwithstanding, the investigators failed to identify the cause of Manuel's death. As such, the Death Certificate that was issued indicated the cause of death as "Under investigations."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p> On October 23, 2013, the remains of Manuel was repatriated to the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Upon the request of the sister of the deceased, Dr. Roberto Rey C. San Diego, M.D., Medico-Legal Officer of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), autopsied the remains of Manuel on October 24, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In Autopsy Report No. N-13-1056 that was subsequently issued, the NBI stated that the cause of death was "CONSISTENT WITH ASPHYXIA BY LIGATURE."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p> On December 7, 2013, Dr. Rohan Ruwanpura (Dr. Ruwanpura), Consultant Judicial Medical Officer at Galle, Sri Lanka issued a post-mortem report on the post-mortem examination he conducted on Manuel on October 19, 2013,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> with the following observations: </p><blockquote> <p> A ligature prepared from white twisted nylon rope was present around the upper neck. It was tied around the neck with a sliding knot [running noose] positioned over the left mastoid region of back of the head.</p> <p> Removal of the ligature revealed a parchment like abraded mark, mostly regular in shape and about 0.5 cm in width. The mark was deeper and mostly horizontal on right side of the neck, then taking upwards course on front and back aspect of upper part of the neck to form united inverted "V" mark over left mastoid region, in relation to position of the knot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> From the foregoing, Dr. Ruwanpura remarked that "the circumstantial data and [his] autopsy findings are in keeping with self suspension." Thus, pronounced the cause of death to be asphyxia due to hanging.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p> Subsequently, petitioner filed her claim for benefits arising from the death of Manuel, but the respondents refused to grant her any. Respondents averred that Manuel's death was not compensable because he took his own life.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> This prompted petitioner to file a Notice to Arbitrate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> on August 7, 2014, before the NCMB of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) demanding for payment of the following: </p><ol><li> Compensation for Loss of Life pursuant to the applicable CBA in the amount of US$89,100.00:<br><br></li><li>Death Benefit in the amount of US$50,000.00 and Burial Expenses in the amount of US$1,000.00 pursuant to the Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers On-Board Ocean-Going Vessels:<br><br></li><li>Mandatory Insurance Benefit of at least US$10,000.00 pursuant to R.A. 10022: <br><br></li><li>Moral damages in the amount of [PhP] 2,500,000.00; <br><br></li><li> Exemplary damages in the amount of [PhP] 2,500,000.00; <br><br></li><li>Attorney's fees equivalent to ten (10) per cent of the total monetary award.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </li></ol> <p> In asking for compensation for loss of life, petitioner averred that under Article 25 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) which covers Manuel's employment contract, respondents unconditionally bound themselves to pay the same in the event of death of a seafarer through any cause while employed by them. The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration's (POEA's) Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Employment of Filipino Seafarers On-Board Ocean-Going Vessels, furthermore entitled her to death and burial benefits. Her claim for insurance benefits was likewise supported by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10022.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The wanton and oppressive manner by which respondents refused to accord to her the benefits due her made respondents liable for moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> Respondents, for their part, insisted that they were not liable to pay compensation with respect to the death of Manuel since the POEA's Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC), as well as the CBA specifically exclude from the payment of benefits for death that are directly attributable to the seafarer. As proof that Manuel committed suicide, respondents presented the following pieces of evidence: (a) Investigation Report on the death of Manuel conducted by Maharoof and Zavahir on October 18, 2013, on board <i>M/V Sea Lord</i> which included the individual statements of Manuel's co-workers regarding his death;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (b) photocopy of pictures taken of the room where Manuel hanged himself and the retrieval of his body from where he was suspended;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (c) Cause of Death Form stating the cause of Manuel's death was under investigation;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and (d) Post-Mortem Report issued by Dr. Ruwanpura stating Manuel's cause of death as asphyxia due to hanging.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Inasmuch as Manuel committed suicide, petitioner, clearly, is not entitled to any benefits arising therefrom. Even if death by suicide was ruled out, respondents argued that no benefits can still be granted to the petitioner because she failed to present proof that Manuel's death during his employment was due to any work-related cause as required under the POEA-SEC or the CBA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p> Moreover, respondents posited that the petitioner cannot claim insurance benefits under R.A. No. 10022 because only death through natural and accidental causes are covered by the said law. Since suicide is neither natural nor accidental, the same is not compensable under R.A. No. 10022.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Since respondents are justified in denying petitioner's claims, there is also no cogent reason to award moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney's fees in her favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p> On February 2, 2015, the Panel rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> in favor of the petitioner. The individual accounts of Manuel's co-workers of his bizarre attitude failed to convince the Panel that Manuel took his own life. It also found unworthy of belief the reports of the various investigators given that the same were prepared 10 days after Manuel's death. The Panel likewise made much of the NBI Autopsy Report which made no mention of the word "hanging" or "suicide," but only concluded the cause of death as "consistent with asphyxia by ligature." Thus, the Panel ruled that petitioner's narration of her warm and happy telephone conversations with Manuel where the latter shared his dreams for her and his siblings contradicted respondents' claim of suicide.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Since there is no substantial evidence to warrant a finding of suicide, the Panel held that petitioner was entitled to death benefits under the CBA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Even assuming that it had been duly proved that Manuel took his own life, petitioner would still be entitled to death benefits considering that Manuel died while in respondents' employ and because the CBA makes them liable therefor, regardless of the cause of death. In addition to death benefits, Section 25.1 of the CBA makes respondents' liable to the petitioner for transportation and burial expenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> As for the insurance benefits, the Panel held that petitioner must be granted the same since suicide had not been established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The Panel also awarded to the petitioner uncollected salaries due to Manuel given that the respondents' did not deny the same. It also found that substantial evidence had been presented showing Manuel's entitlement to guaranteed overtime pay, unpaid leave pay, unpaid daily allowance and owner's bonus. Hence, awarded the same to the petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The Panel disposed in this wise: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, all the foregoing premises being duly considered, in the light of the facts as borne by the evidence on record, as well as based on the law and jurisprudence, [judgment] is hereby rendered as follows:</p> <p> First, Death Benefits are hereby granted in the Philippine currency equivalent to US $89,100.00 in accordance with the CBA covering the late [Manuel] A.

This is precisely what makes voluntary arbitration different from compulsory arbitration. Let then the parties herein remain faithful to that intent. </p> <p> Let the parties be true to their commitment. And let the difference of this mode of dispute settlement be upheld as distinguished from the other modes, in the higher interest of substantive justice, as enshrined in the Philippine Constitution. </p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Respondents moved for reconsideration but the Panel denied it in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated January 23, 2015.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Aside from denying the motion for lack of merit, the Panel also ruled that the same was filed out of time. Considering that respondents received the February 2, 2015 Decision on February 5, 2015, the motion should have been filed on February 15, 2015, the last day for the filing of the same even if the 10<sup>th</sup> day fell on a Sunday. Since respondents filed their motion for reconsideration the following day, the filing thereof was already a day late, rendering the Panel's assailed Decision final and executory. </p><p> On April 23, 2015, petitioner moved for the resolution of her motion for execution of the Decision of the Panel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p><p> On March 3, 2015, respondents filed a Manifestation with Opposition to Complainant's Motion for Execution (Manifestation with Opposition).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Records disclosed that the Panel had not acted on the same. </p><p> Aggrieved, respondents filed on March 12, 2015 a Petition for Review (with Urgent Prayer for the Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction) before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p>Subsequently, or sometime in May 2015, respondents filed with the Panel a pleading entitled Reiterative Motion to Set Case for Clarificatory Conference (Reiterative Motion).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p> On appeal, the CA recognized the suppletory application of the Rules of Court and prevailing jurisprudence in the computation of periods in the filing of pleadings in court. Since the last day of the 10-day period to appeal fell on a Sunday, the CA held that the respondents timely filed their motion for reconsideration the next working day, or on February 16, 2015. It also held that respondents did not engage in forum shopping when they filed their Manifestation with Opposition as the same was just a response to petitioner's motion for execution, and not a second motion for reconsideration. In the same vein, respondents' Reiterative Motion only addressed petitioner's motion to resolve her motion for execution. </p><p> Contrary to the ruling of the Panel, the CA found that respondents have successfully proved by substantial evidence that Manuel killed himself on October 8, 2013. Such notwithstanding, respondents remain liable under the parties' CBA tor death benefits, particularly Section 25.1 thereof. Since the same provision provides that the employer will shoulder the costs for the transportation and burial of Manuel's body in the Philippines, the CA ordered the respondents to, reimburse petitioner the transportation and burial expenses she incurred. </p><p> As for the other awards, the CA held that petitioner was not entitled to the same. It held that life insurance may only be awarded in case of accidental death. Since death by suicide cannot in any way be ruled as accidental, petitioner was not entitled to claim the life insurance benefit under R.A. No. 10022. The CA deleted the awards for unpaid salary, guaranteed overtime pay, leave pay, daily allowance/subsistence allowance and owner's bonus in light of the evidence presented by the respondents that the same had already been paid to, and received by the petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> The CA also ruled that petitioner was not entitled to moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees, and thus deleted the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The CA disposed in this wise: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the APPEAL is PARTLY GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated 2 February 2015 is hereby MODIFIED,</b> to the extent that the awards for insurance proceeds, amounting to US$15,000[,] uncollected salary amounting to US$670.03, overtime pay amounting to US$3730.00, unpaid leave credits/pay in the amount of US$696.00, unpaid daily subsistence allowance in the amount for US$504.00, [owners' bonus in the amount of] US$400.00 are <strong>all</strong> <b>DELETED</b>. </p> <p> The awards for moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees, for lack of factual and legal basis, are likewise <b>DELETED</b>. </p> <p> [Respondents] <b>REMAIN LIABLE</b> to pay US$89,100.00 for death benefits and [PhP] 162,080.00 for transportation and burial expenses as provided by their CBA with their seafarers.

She points out that since respondents have only 10 days from receipt on February 26, 2015 of the Panel's January 23, 2015 Resolution, they should have filed their appeal on March 8, 2015. The 15-day period to appeal under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court is not applicable to voluntary arbitration cases under the Labor Code. Since respondents' appeal was filed only on March 12, 2015, the same was filed four days late, rendering the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Panel final and executory; hence, not appealable. Perforce, the CA should have dismissed the appeal outright.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, the appeal should have been dismissed at once for respondents' failure to move for the reconsideration of the Panel's Decision. Petitioner explains that respondents motion for reconsideration before the Panel had not been duly filed inasmuch as their motion was not filed within 10 days from their receipt of the Panel's Decision, and the same was not filed directly with the Panel. It is of no moment that the 10<sup>th</sup> day within which respondents have to file their motion falls on a Sunday. The rule which states that when the last day to file a pleading falls on a Saturday, Sunday or Holiday, the same may be filed on the next business day finds no application in this case considering that the Voluntary Arbitrators that comprised the Panel were private individuals, and there is no law or rule that prohibits them from holding office on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday. Since respondents' motion for reconsideration was not filed in accordance with the mandatory law and rules governing voluntary arbitration proceedings, the CA should have dismissed their appeal straightway.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner disagrees with the CA that respondents did not engage in forum shopping. Contrary to the view of the CA, the Manifestation with Opposition was not filed to oppose the motion for execution she filed, but was in reality a second motion for reconsideration as it sought the reversal and setting aside of the Panel's Decision despite the denial of respondents' earlier motion for reconsideration. Without waiting for the resolution of the said Manifestation with Opposition, respondents filed with the CA their appeal, which also sought for the reversal and setting aside of the very same February 2, 2015 Decision of the Panel. Their contumacious acts, however, did not end there. After filing their appeal with the CA and failing to obtain the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) or injunctive writ they prayed for, they filed their Reiterative Motion before the Panel, which in substance was just another second motion for reconsideration. Respondents did not inform the CA about it and even lied in their Compliance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> when they stated that, " <i>to the best of their knowledge, NO other cases and/or proceedings involving the same parties and issues are pending before the Honorable Court or other courts."</i> All the actions actively and simultaneously pursued by the respondents before the Panel and the CA involved the same and related issues and are all aimed at obtaining the same relief — the reversal of the Decision of the Panel in two fora. Such is clearly a case of forum shopping warranting the outright dismissal of respondents' appeal before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p> On the merits, petitioner asseverates that the factual findings of the Panel should have been respected by the CA because the same were in accord with the law and evidence on record. She staunchly maintains that there was nothing on record which showed that Manuel committed suicide. Like the Panel, petitioner avers that the statements of the crew members about the actuations of Manuel do not lead to a logical conclusion that he took his own life for being hazy, equivocal, and non-committal. The reports (Investigation Report;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Master's Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>) relative to the said incident were also not worthy of belief because they lack spontaneity as they were prepared 10 days after the incident. Even the Cause of Death Form issued by the Sri Lankan authorities failed to conclude Manuel's death as suicide, as in fact it only stated the cause thereof to be under investigation. The subsequent December 7, 2013 Post-Mortem Report released by Dr. Ruwanpura finding the cause of death as "asphyxia due to hanging" was also suspected for being issued some two months after the incident. It could not even be verified whether the said Post-Mortem Report had been properly translated. The statements of the crew members, Investigative Report, Master's Report and the December 7, 2013 Post-Mortem Report actually lacked probative value for being mere photocopies. No police investigation report conducted by the harbor authorities of Galle, Sri Lanka was presented. The NBI Autopsy Report made no mention of the words "hanging" or "suicide," but merely labelled the cause of Manuel's death as "consistent with asphyxia by ligature." The findings that Manuel did not sustain any injuries are not supported by the evidence on record as the NBI Autopsy Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> showed otherwise. In fact, said findings appear to be more consistent with strangulation, a clear indication of foul play. <i>Viz.</i>: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>EXTERNAL INJURIES:</b> </p> <p><b>Head and Neck:</b> Ligature mark, antero-lateral aspect, contused and abraded, 48.0 cm. long.

No. 10022. Anent her claims for other monetary benefits, petitioner maintains that respondents must be made to pay the CBA mandated guaranteed overtime pay, leave pay, daily allowance/subsistence allowance and owner's bonus for their failure to present competent and credible evidence showing payment of the same to Manuel. She claims that the US$670.03 paid to Manuel only covers the period from October 1, 2013 to October 8, 2013, leaving the mandated benefits of Manuel from June 2013, the start of his employment, up to the whole month of September 2013, unpaid. While the respondents presented documents showing payment of Manuel's wages for the months prior to October 2013, the same did not reflect that the same were in fact payments for Manuel's guaranteed overtime pay, leave pay, daily allowance/subsistence allowance and owner's bonus for June 2013, until the end of September 2013. </p><p> Petitioner insists that respondents' bad faith had been duly established by the following circumstances - (a) concealment and refusal to furnish the petitioner with a copy of the CBA in order to mislead Manuel and his widow, petitioner herein, into thinking that no CBA applied to the former; (b) suppression of Police Investigation Report which could have shown that Manuel had been killed; (c) failure to procure the mandatory life insurance policy for Manuel and refusal to pay the life insurance benefit thereunder; (d) refusal to provide any form of assistance to Manuel's next of kin when his remains were repatriated; (e) withholding of Manuel's last earned salary unless a quitclaim is signed by the petitioner freeing respondents from liability arising out of her husband's death; (f) eventual release of the said last earned salary only after five long months from the death of Manuel; (g) berating petitioner for seeking the Government's help in the repatriation of Manuel; and (h) the sudden decision to bring Manuel's remains to Galle, Sri Lanka despite the fact that the ship's destination is Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - all justify the award in her favor of moral and exemplary damages. Furthermore, their unjustified refusal to grant her legitimate claims compelled her to litigate, therefore, entitles her to attorney's fees. </p><p> Respondents, for their part, averred that the petitioner should stop her insatiable quest for financial gain as the CA only removed the highly questionable benefits she had been awarded by the Panel but retained the US$89,100.00 death benefits and P162,080.00 transportation and burial expenses awarded in her favor, and which amounts they no longer contest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></p><p> Contrary to petitioner's supposition on forum shopping, respondents contend that their recourse had been valid and legally justifiable. There is nothing in their Manifestation with Opposition that would even suggest that the same was a second motion for reconsideration. Respondents explain that their "Manifestation" merely expressed their displeasure with the violation of their right to due process, while their "Opposition" conveyed their disapproval to petitioner's motion for the execution of the assailed Decision rendered by the Panel. It is inconsequential that respondents also pray for the reversal of the decision of the Panel in the said pleading. It must be taken into account that the petitioner moved for the execution of the Panel's Decision on the very same day the Panel denied respondents' Motion for Reconsideration with Urgent Motion for Clarificatory Conference.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> It is precisely for that reason why they filed a "Manifestation" with an "Opposition." Respondents add that it is very unlikely that conflicting decisions will arise given that what was pending before the NCMB is petitioner's motion for execution and not any of respondents' motion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> Respondents assert that they timely moved for the reconsideration of the Panel's Decision. Contrary to the contention of the petitioner, the Panel is bound by the provisions of the Civil Code and the Rules of Court pertaining to the computation of the period within which an act must be performed. Following Section 1, Rule 22 of the Rules of Court, their motion was timely filed the next working day, since the last day of the filing of the same falls on a Sunday. There is also no rhyme or reason for petitioner's insistence that the motion must be filed directly with any Panel member inasmuch as all proceedings were conducted through the facilities of the NCMB. They likewise maintain that <i>Philippine Electric Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> which provides for a 10-day period to appeal before the CA from receipt of the Decision of the Panel that was cited by the petitioner does not apply in this case in light of the pronouncement of the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> in a number of cases declaring the appeal period to be 15 days.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p><p> While respondents claim that petitioner is not entitled to death benefits, transportation and burial expenses, they asseverate that the benefits awarded by the CA to the petitioner should no longer be disturbed as the same represent the most judicious and fair interpretation of the law and contracts under the circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>The Ruling of the Court</b> </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Respondents' appeal before the CA had been duly filed pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Court</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Petitioner avers that since respondents filed their appeal with the CA 14 days from their receipt of a copy of the Decision of the Panel, the same was filed out of time considering that pursuant to Article 276 of the Labor Code, the appeal must be brought within 10 days.

Court of Appeals.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> In this case, the Court ruled that the 10-day period stated in Article 276 of the Labor Code should be understood as the period within which the party adversely affected by the ruling of the Voluntary Arbitrator or the Panel may file a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> This is in line with the pronouncement in <i>Teng v. Pahagac</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> where the Court had clarified that the 10-day period set in Article 276 of the Labor Code gave the aggrieved parties the opportunity to file their motion for reconsideration, in keeping with the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies. <i>Viz</i>.: </p><blockquote> <p> In the exercise of its power to promulgate implementing rules and regulations, an implementing agency, such as the Department of Labor, is restricted from going beyond the terms of the law it seeks to implement; it should neither modify nor improve the law. The agency formulating the rules and guidelines cannot exceed the statutory authority granted to it by the legislature. </p> <p> By allowing a 10-day period, the obvious intent of Congress in amending Article 263 to Article 262-A is to provide an opportunity for the party adversely affected by the VA's decision to seek recourse via a motion for reconsideration or a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court filed with the CA. Indeed, a motion for reconsideration is the more appropriate remedy in line with the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. For this reason, an appeal from administrative agencies to the CA <i>via</i> Rule 43 of the Rules of Court requires exhaustion of available remedies as a condition precedent to a petition under that Rule. </p> <p> The requirement that administrative remedies be exhausted is based on the doctrine that in providing for a remedy before an administrative agency, every opportunity must be given to the agency to resolve the matter and to exhaust all opportunities for a resolution under the given remedy before bringing an action in, or resorting to, the courts of justice. Where Congress has not clearly required exhaustion, sound judicial discretion governs, guided by Congressional intent. </p> <p> By disallowing reconsideration of the VA's decision, Section 7, Rule XIX of DO 40-03 and Section 7 of the 2005 Procedural Guidelines went directly against the legislative intent behind Article 262-A of the Labor Code. These rules deny the VA the chance to correct himself and compel the courts of justice to prematurely intervene with the action of an administrative agency entrusted with the adjudication of controversies coming under its special knowledge, training and specific field of expertise. In this era of clogged court dockets, the need for specialized administrative agencies with the special knowledge, experience and capability to hear and determine promptly disputes on technical matters or intricate questions of facts, subject to judicial review, is indispensable. In <i>Industrial Enterprises, Inc. v Court of Appeals</i>, we ruled that relief must first be obtained in an administrative proceeding before a remedy will be supplied by the courts even though the matter is within the proper jurisdiction of a court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Citation omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> The Court further clarified in <i>Guagua</i> that once the motion for reconsideration interposed had been resolved, the aggrieved party may now opt to appeal to the CA by way of a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. Pursuant to Section 4 of the said Rule, the aggrieved party has 15 days to file the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> </p><p> There is no dispute that respondents received on February 26, 2015, a copy of the January 23, 2015 Resolution of the Panel which denied their motion for reconsideration, and filed their appeal to the CA on March 12, 2015. Given that their appeal had been filed 14 days from their receipt of the assailed Resolution of the Panel, respondents' appeal had clearly been filed within the reglementary period provided in Rule 43. </p><p> But petitioner contends that there is no motion for reconsideration which could have been considered as <i>duly filed</i> in this case that may be appealed to the CA as provided in Section 4,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Rule 43 of the Rules of Court since respondents' motion for reconsideration had not been filed directly with the Panel in violation of Section 2, Rule III of the Revised Procedural Guidelines in the Conduct of Voluntary Arbitration Proceedings (VA Procedural Guidelines) which provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 2. <i>Where to file Pleadings.</i> - All pleadings relative to the voluntary arbitration case shall be filed directly with the chosen voluntary arbitrator at his designated business or professional office copy furnished the Regional Branch of the board having jurisdiction over the workplace of the complainant. </p> </blockquote> <p> For the petitioner, in order for the filing of the motion for reconsideration to be proper, it must be filed at the Voluntary Arbitrators' private addresses or offices.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> It is also for this reason why the petitioner posits that Section 1<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> of Rule 22 of the Rules of Court does not apply here because "<i>there is no rule or requirement that the offices of Voluntary Arbitrators should be closed on Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays</i>.

The motion was received by the Panel, as in fact it immediately convened upon receipt thereof and acted on the same. While respondents' motion for reconsideration was denied, the denial was not premised on the failure to <i>directly</i> file the motion with the Panel as the term is understood by the petitioner, but because the Panel found the motion to be lacking in merit and filed a day late.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup></p><p> However, as ruled correctly by the CA, respondents motion for reconsideration of the Panel's Decision had been timely filed. Section 3 of the VA Procedural Guidelines which provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 3. <i>Directory and Suppletory Application of the Guidelines and Rules of the Court.</i> - The rules governing the proceedings before a voluntary arbitrator shall be the subject of agreement among the parties to a labor dispute and their chosen arbitrator.

As such, Section 1, Rule 22 of the Rules of Court had been properly appreciated in determining the timeliness of the filing of respondents' motion for reconsideration. The said section provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 1. <i>How to compute time.</i> - In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these Rules, or by order of the court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run is to be excluded and the date of performance included. If the last day of the period, as thus computed, falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday in the place where the court sits, the time shall not run until the next working day. </p> </blockquote> <p> In this case, respondents have 10 days from February 5, 2015, the day they received a copy of the Panel's Decision, within which to file their motion for reconsideration. However, given that February 15, 2015, falls on a Sunday, respondents have until the next business day, pursuant to Section 1, Rule 22 of the Rules of Court, to file their motion for reconsideration. Hence, when respondents filed their motion on February 16, 2015, the same had been filed within the reglementary period. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Respondents are not guilty of forum shopping</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Petitioner insists that respondents resorted to forum shopping when they filed before the Panel a <i>Manifestation with Opposition</i> after their motion for reconsideration was denied, and another motion entitled <i>Reiterative Motion</i> after they had already filed their petition for review with the CA and before the Panel can rule on its Manifestation with Opposition, as they actively sought the review and reversal of the ruling of the Panel with the latter and the CA simultaneously and successively. </p><p> Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court embodies the rule against forum shopping.

Quinan, Jr</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> has exhaustively discussed the concept of forum shopping in this wise: </p><blockquote> <p> In<i> City of Taguig v. City of Makati</i>, this Court was able to thoroughly discuss the concept of forum shopping through the past decisions of this Court, thus: </p> <blockquote> <p> <i>Top Rate Construction &amp; General Services, Inc. v. Paxton Development Corporation</i> explained that: </p> <blockquote> <p> Forum shopping is committed by a party who institutes two or more suits in different courts, either simultaneously or successively, in order to ask the courts to rule on the same or related causes or to grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition or increase a party's chances of obtaining a favorable decision or action. </p> </blockquote> <p> <i>First Philippine International Bank v. Court of Appeals</i> recounted that forum shopping originated as a concept in private international law:</p> <blockquote> <p> To begin with, forum shopping originated as a concept in private international law, where non-resident litigants are given the option to choose the forum or place wherein to bring their suit for various reason s or excuses, including to secure procedural advantages, to annoy and harass the defendant, to avoid overcrowded dockets, or to select a more friendly venue. To combat these less than honorable excuses, the principle of <i>forum non conveniens</i> was developed whereby a court, in conflicts of law cases, may refuse impositions on its jurisdiction where it is not the most "convenient" or available forum and the parties are not precluded from seeking remedies elsewhere. </p> <p> In this light, <i>Black’s Law Dictionary </i>says that forum shopping "occurs when a party attempts to have his action tried in a particular court or jurisdiction where he feels he will receive the most favorable judgment or verdict." Hence, according to <i>Words and Phrases</i>, "a litigant is open to the charge of 'forum shopping' whenever he chooses a forum with slight connection to factual circumstances surrounding his suit, and litigants should be encouraged to attempt to settle their differences without imposing undue expense and vexatious situations on the courts." </p> </blockquote> <p> Further,<i> Prubankers Association v. Prudential Bank and Trust Co</i>. recounted that: </p> <blockquote> <p> The rule on forum shopping was first included in Section 17 of the Interim Rules and Guidelines issued by this Court on January 11, 1983, which imposed a sanction in this wise: "A violation of the rule shall constitute contempt of court and shall be a cause for the summary dismissal of both petitions, without prejudice to the taking of appropriate action against the counsel or party concerned." Thereafter, the Court restated the rule in Revised Circular No. 28-91 and Administrative Circular No. 04-94. Ultimately, the rule was embodied in the 1997 amendments to the Rules of Court. </p> <p> Presently, Rule 7, Section 5 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a Certification against Forum Shopping be appended to every complaint or initiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief. x x x</p> <p> x x x x</p> </blockquote> <p> Though contained in the same provision of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the rule requiring the inclusion of a Certification against Forum Shopping is distinct from the rule against forum shopping. In <i>Korea Exchange Bank v. Gonzales</i>: </p> <blockquote> <p> The general rule is that compliance with the certificate of forum shopping is separate from and independent of the avoidance of the act of forum shopping itself. Forum shopping is a ground for summary dismissal of both initiatory pleadings without prejudice to the taking of appropriate action against the counsel or party concerned. </p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Top Rate Construction</i> discussed the rationale for the rule against forum shopping as follows: </p> <blockquote> <p> It is an act of malpractice for it trifles with the courts, abuses their processes, degrades the administration of justice and adds to the already congested court dockets. What is critical is the vexation brought upon the courts and the litigants by a party who asks different courts to rule on the same or related causes and grant the same or substantially the same reliefs and in the process creates the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different <em>fora</em> upon the same issues, regardless of whether the court in which one of the suits was brought has no jurisdiction over the action. </p> </blockquote> <p> Jurisprudence has recognized that forum shopping can be committed in several ways: </p> <blockquote> <p> (1) filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action and with the same prayer, the previous case not having been resolved yet (where the ground for dismissal is <i>litis pendentia</i>); (2) filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action and the same prayer, the previous case having been finally resolved (where the ground for dismissal is <i>res judicata</i>); and (3) filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action but with different prayers (splitting of causes of action, where the ground for dismissal is also either <i>litis pendentia or res judicata</i>). (Emphasis in the original) </p> </blockquote> <p> Similarly, it has been recognized that forum shopping exists "where a party attempts to obtain a preliminary injunction in another court after failing to obtain the same from the original court." </p> <p> The test for determining forum shopping is settled. In <i>Yap v. Chua, et al.</i>: </p> <blockquote> <p> To determine whether a party violated the rule against forum shopping, the most important factor to ask is whether the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> are present, or whether a final judgment in one case will amount to<i> res judicata</i> in another; otherwise stated, the test for determining forum shopping is whether in the two (or more) cases pending, there is identity of parties, rights or causes of action, and reliefs sought. </p> </blockquote> <p> For its part,<i> litis pendentia</i> "refers to that situation wherein another action is pending between the same parties for the same cause of action, such that the second action becomes unnecessary and vexatious."

For these reasons, there can clearly be no forum shopping in this case. </p><p> <i>Suicide had been duly established</i></p><p> A careful review of the records would show that suicide had been indubitably established. As aptly ruled by the CA: </p><blockquote> <p> The signed statements of Manuel's co-workers who were with him on the vessel on that fateful day allow Us to reconstruct with clarity the events leading to his death. Rather than being hazy, unequivocal, and non-committal, they were detailed, categorical, and certain, having been based on their actual experiences on the day Manuel died and with their personal interactions with the deceased. More importantly, We have found no fatal inconsistency that would warrant a different conclusion, that there was a cover-up of another cause of death, or that there was motive for <i>all of Manuel’s co-workers</i> to lie about the death of their fellow seaman. A number of them even found him to be a nice and quiet person who prefers spending time alone. </p> <p> Relevantly, judging from the noticeable variations in handwriting, writing styles, and the content of the narratives of Manuel's co-employees, We can only find their statements to have been executed voluntarily and willfully. Particularly even more credible are the detailed reports of the ship's Chief Officer and the Chief Engineer executed on 9 October 2013. The Chief Officer's Report was even signed and witnessed by crew members. </p> <p> There is thus every reason to seriously consider and believe all their signed statements. </p> <p> To elaborate, Manuel's co-workers commonly agreed that Manuel did not report to work on 7 October 2013; that he had shut himself inside the gymnasium; that having been informed [of] Manuel's behavior, the master of the ship called for a meeting to inform everyone of the developments; that while everyone was gathering, Manuel moved from the gymnasium into the hospital. </p> <p> His co-workers then narrated that while Manuel was locked in the hospital room, some of them talked to him through the telephone, which included the Chief Engineer, Leo Odio, seafarers Richard Lamug, Deneb Jake Alcantara and Dennis Tinaja. These persons attested that Manuel did not sound calm or stable at all, but that he was fearful that somebody was going to kill him. </p> <p> The seamen continued that Manuel's room remained locked, so that none of them could enter the same. On 8 October 2013, Manuel was offered food which he declined, after which he refused to talk to anyone. His companions knocked but received no reply; later in the day, following Manuel's continuous silence, the crew forced their way in the hospital room but found it unlocked. </p> <p> As to Manuel's demise, We can infer from the statements of Rolando Leonardo, the Chief Officer, and the Chief Engineer the grim circumstances thereof. These officers corroborate each other’s statements that having discovered that Manuel was no longer in the room, they found the hospital restroom locked; with their co-workers, they then peered into a ventilation whereupon Engineer Ohio beheld Manuel "standing motionless with a small nylon rope tied on his neck and hanging to the Hat's hooks." Leonardo's words paint a starker picture, as he was able to describe that "Manuel's tongue is already outside of his mouth about 1 cm and his hands almost violet." The crew members then forced the door open and took Manuel's body down. </p> <p> These employees’ statements are corroborated by the meticulous Investigative Report immediately conducted by two lawyers when the ship managed to dock on October 18, 2013, by the Log Book Entries and email correspondence with the Medical Office, and the photographs of the crew taking down Manuel’s body. </p> <p> Lingering doubts are then dispelled by the final Post Mortem Report dated 7 December 2013, executed by one Dr. Rohan Ruwanpura, a Judicial Medical Officer in Sri Lanka, x x x. </p> <p> The Report concluded that Manuel died from asphyxia due to hanging and informed that there were no injuries present upon Manuel's body. </p> <p> <i>Significantly, all these - that Manuel had isolated himself, that no one else entered the rooms wherein he had concealed his person, that he had no other injuries, and that he was later found hanging – make foul play or any other conclusion implausible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup></i></p> </blockquote> <p> However, according to the petitioner, the documentary submissions of the respondents cannot be believed for they lacked probative value since they are mere photocopies. She also alludes to a certain police investigation report of the harbor authorities in Galle, Sri Lanka that proves the circumstances of the death of Manuel but which she claims respondents suppressed. Thus, for the petitioner, the CA erred when it sets aside the ruling of the Panel which found that no adequate evidence exists to prove that Manuel committed suicide.</p><p> The Court does not agree. In ruling that suicide had not been duly proved, the Panel relied on the "<i>consistent, coherent and spontaneous narration by [the petitioner] of her pleasant, joyful and very happy telephone conversation with the deceased</i> x x x. "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> From her statement, the Panel was able to conclude that Manuel could not have possibly taken his own life since he and the petitioner did not have a dysfunctional family as in fact, they <i>had a very close, warm and loving relationship</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> and Manuel <i>was a very caring husband, filled with beautiful dreams and plans for his wife and siblings</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Apart from these general statements, no proof whatsoever could be found on the records that would sufficiently establish the veracity of the same. As correctly observed by the CA, the petitioner "<i>could have supported her allegations with text messages and emails[,] or could have narrated her conversations with her husband and the frequency thereof to at least lend her version some credibility and weight. Absent these, [the court is] bound to uphold the well-settled rule that bare allegations are unworthy of belief</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup></p><p> It must be emphasized that technical rules of procedure are not binding in labor cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> and that the quantum of proof required here is only substantial evidence, defined as "that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Thus, while it may be true that the documentary evidence adduced by respondents were photocopies, the Court cannot discount the fact that the statements of the crew members of the vessel as well as the autopsy report issued by the Sri Lankan authority coincide with the NBI autopsy report which concluded that the cause of death to be <i>"consistent with asphyxia by ligature</i>." As such, the NBI autopsy report lends credence to and bolsters the account of the respondents that Manuel took his own life. In other words, the NBI autopsy report, autopsy report prepared by Dr. Ruwanpura and Investigation Report, taken together, substantially prove that Manuel's death was due to his deliberate act of killing himself by committing suicide. It is of no moment that the NBI Autopsy Report did not categorically state that suicide or hanging was the cause of death. The fact remains that the same report found no evidence of foul play in the death of Manuel. Perforce, the Court must agree that death by suicide had been sufficiently proved. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Petitioner is entitled to death benefits and reimbursement for transportation and burial expenses</i></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Crucial to the determination of petitioner's entitlement to death benefits as well as her right to get reimbursement for transportation and burial expenses she incurred are Sections 18.1 b, 21, 22, and 25 of the CBA. However, as observed by the CA, the copy of the CBA attached to the petition filed before it did not completely cite Section 21, while Section 25 was missing. As such, the CA adopted the parties' citation of Section 25 and lifted from the copy of the CBA submitted to it the available portions of Section 21.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> <i>Viz.</i>: </p><blockquote> <p> [SEC. 25.1] - If a seafarer dies through any cause whilst in the employment of the Company including death from natural causes and death occurring whilst traveling to and from the vessel, or as a result of marine or other similar peril, the Company shall pay the sums specified in the attached Annex 4 (four) to a nominated beneficiary and to each dependent child up to a maximum of 4 (four) under the age of 18.

If the seafarer shall leave no nominated beneficiary, the aforementioned sum shall be paid to the person empowered by law or otherwise to administer the estate of the Seafarer. For the purpose of this clause, a seafarer shall be regarded as "in employment of the company" for as long as the provision[s] of Article[s] 21 and 22 apply and provided the death is directly attributable to sickness or injury that caused the seafarer's employment to be terminated in accordance with Article 18.1b</p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> [SEC.] 21.2 A seafarer who is hospitalized abroad owing to sickness or injury shall be entitled to medical attention (including hospitalization) at the company's expense for as long as such attention is required or until the seafarer is repatriated to the port of engagement, whichever is the earlier. </p> <p> [Section] 21.3 A seafarer repatriated to their port of engagement, unfit as a result of sickness or injury, shall be entitled to medical attention (including hospitalization) at the company's expenses: </p> <ol start="" type="a"><li> in case of sickness, for up to 130 days after repatriation, subject to the submission of satisfactory medical reports;<br> </li><li> in the case of injury, for so long as medical attention is required or until a medical determination is made in accordance with clause 24.2 concerning permanent disability. </li></ol> <p> [Section] 21.4 Proof of continued entitlement to medical attention shall be submission of satisfactory medical reports, endorsed, where necessary, by a company appointed doctor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup></p> <p> On the other hand, [Section] 22 provides: </p> <blockquote> <p> When a seafarer is landed at any port because of sickness or injury a pro rata payment of their basic wages plus guaranteed or, in the case of officers, fixed overtime, shall continue until [they] have been repatriated at the company's expense as specified in Article 19. </p> <p> 22.1 Thereafter the seafarer shall be entitled to sick pay at the rate equivalent to their basic wage while they remain sick up to a maximum rate of 130 days after repatriation. </p> <p> 22.2 However, in the event if incapacity due to an accident the basic wages shall be paid until the injured seafarer has been cured or until a medical determination is made in accordance with clause 24.2 concerning permanent disability. </p> <p> 22.3 Proof of continued entitlement to sick pay shall be by submission of satisfactory medical reports, endorsed, where necessary, by a company appointed doctor.

It is clear from the express provision of Section 25.1 of the CBA that respondents hold themselves liable for death benefits for the death of the seafarer under their employ for <i>any cause</i>. Under Annex 4 of the CBA, the same shall be in the amount of US$89,100.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> Aside from death benefits, respondents also obligated themselves to pay the transportation expenses for the repatriation of the body of the deceased, as well as the burial expenses. In this case, the petitioner was able to show that the expenses she incurred for the repatriation of Manuel as well as his burial amounted to P162,080.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> Sections 21 and 22 of the CBA did not limit the liability of the respondents to deaths that are directly attributable to sickness or injury, but rather widens its coverage to also include seafarers who died or signed off due to sickness of injury. Thus, the Court agrees with the following pronouncement of the CA: </p><blockquote> <p> Now brought to light and in consideration of Articles 21 and 22, the CBA, in defining "in employment of the company" actually expanded the coverage of Section 25.1. <b>Without this qualification</b>, "in the employment of the company" simply means those who are actively working in the employ of Athenian Ship Management, Inc. However, the "for the purpose" clause "in employment of the company" <b>widens its coverage to also include</b> (a) employees who died as a result of sickness or injury during their employment as provided under Articles 21 and 22 of the CBA; and (b) employees who had to sign off due to sickness or injury under Articles 21 and 22 of the agreement. </p> <p> Otherwise stated, rather than limiting the scope of coverage of Section 25.1, the last sentence of its first paragraph widens it. It never affected or narrowed the phrase "any cause" in Section 25.1. To further make it simpler, the part of Section 25.1 pertaining to ''any cause" responds to the question, "what causes of deaths are covered?", while "in the employment" answers to the query, "given that all causes of death are covered, <i>who else</i> are considered employed?"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Respondents cannot also validly argue that the POEA-SEC takes precedence over the terms of the CBA, in that, death must be work-related in order to be compensable. The Court has already settled that, in the event that the clauses in the CBA provide for greater benefits to the seafarer, the same must prevail over the standard terms and benefits formulated by the POEA in its Standard Employment Contract inasmuch as a contract of labor is so impressed with public interest that the more beneficial conditions must be endeavored in favor of the laborer. This is in keeping with the avowed policy of the State to give maximum aid and full protection to labor as enshrined in Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> Thus, the CA ruled correctly when it held that petitioner is entitled to death benefits, transportation expenses and burial expenses. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Petitioner is not entitled to insurance benefits under R.A.

No. 10022, such failure does not merit the automatic award of the aforementioned sum to the petitioner as the same pertains to the minimum of the life insurance policy coverage to be paid by the insurance company only to qualified beneficiaries and for such causes as specified therein, and is not a penalty or fine to be paid by the manning agency. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Petitioner is entitled to overtime pay, owner's bonus, and unpaid leave pay plus daily allowance pay</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Articles 6<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> and 11<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> of the CBA provide for the guidelines to a seafarer's entitlement to overtime pay as well as to leave benefits.

Their defense is that they are no longer liable for these benefits since they had already been paid.

If these allotments were for the guaranteed overtime pay, leave pay plus daily allowance and owner's bonus, respondents could have easily presented a similar Wages Account like the one they presented for the October 1 to 8, 2013 payment for the subject benefits considering that the Wages Account form appears to be a standard form issued by the respondents to its employees whenever they release payments to them.</p><p> For these reasons, the CA erred in deleting the awards for overtime pay, leave pay, daily allowance/subsistence allowance and owner's bonus. However, considering that Manuel commenced working for the respondents on June 25, 2013, and the petitioner had already received the said benefits for the period covering October 1 to October 8, 2013, respondents shall be liable for overtime pay, leave pay, daily allowance/subsistence allowance and owner's bonus for 3 months and 5 days only, instead of four months. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>Petitioner is not entitled to uncollected: salary, moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney's fee.</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>As discussed above, since respondents were able to duly prove, and the petitioner had already received the amount of US$670.03 representing Manuel's uncollected salary, the CA correctly deleted the same. </p><p>Petitioner is also not entitled to moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney's fees as these forms of indemnity may only be imposed on a concrete showing of bad faith or malice on the part of the respondents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> In this case, the refusal of the respondents to pay the benefits being claimed by the petitioner, and the delay in the eventual release of the last salary of Manuel, did not arise out of bad faith, but brought about by their firm belief of petitioner's lack of entitlement thereto and the merits of their cause. The mere failure of the respondents to furnish the petitioner with a copy of the CBA does not establish bad faith. It must be taken into account that the terms of the employment contract of Manuel had been faithful to the benefits spelled out in the said CBA, thereby negating petitioner's claim that respondents intended to conceal and mislead her into thinking that no CBA applied to Manuel's employment. Petitioner also failed to substantiate her claim that there indeed had been a police investigation report proving that Manuel had been killed which respondents suppressed. As with the said police investigation report, there is also no showing that respondents did not procure the mandatory life insurance policy for Manuel. No proof was also shown to support petitioner's claim that respondents did not extend any form of assistance in the repatriation of Manuel or that they berated her when she sought the assistance of the government for the said repatriation. Petitioner's contention that respondents' decision to bring the remains of her husband to Sri Lanka, instead of Dammam, Saudi Arabia had been sudden and tainted with bad faith is belied by her very own written consent where she agreed that the autopsy of the remains of the deceased shall be performed by the authorities in Sri Lanka.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> For these reasons, the CA had been correct in deleting the said awards. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><i>The monetary benefits awarded to the petitioner shall earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the finality of the Decision until fully paid</i> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The case of<i> Lara's Gifts &amp; Decor, Inc. v.
