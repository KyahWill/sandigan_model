(Caltex), and Petron Corporation (Petron), collectively referred to as the "Big 3." In its Petition, private respondent SJS raised as an issue the oil companies' business practice of increasing the prices of their petroleum products whenever the price of crude oil increases in the world market despite that fact that they had purchased their inventories at a much lower price long before the increase. SJS argued that such practice constitutes monopoly and combination in restraint of trade, prohibited under Article 186<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). SJS likewise contended that the acts of these oil companies of increasing the prices of its oil products whenever their competitors increase their prices fall under the term "combination or concerted action" used in Section 11 (a)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> of Republic Act (RA) No. 8479, otherwise known as the Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act of 1998 (Approved on February 10, 1998).

Finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of public respondent RTC, the CA reversed and set aside the April 27, June 23, and July 7, 2009 Orders, and ordered the dismissal of the case for declaratory relief for lack of cause of action. The appellate court, in essence, opined that the issues raised by private respondents cannot be made subject of an action for declaratory relief. As to the propriety of the intervention of <i>Pasang Masda</i>, it ruled that <i>Pasang Masda</i> had no legal interest in the matter.<br><br>Aggrieved, private respondents sought to have the August 6, 2010 Decision reconsidered.

No. 188760</i></u><br><br>The OSG assails the April 27 and May 5, 2009 Orders of the RTC on the ground that it would be legally impossible for the COA, the BIR, and the BOC to comply with the said Orders because it is beyond the mandates of these government agencies to examine the books of accounts of the Big 3.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Also, the OSG asserts that the orders are not sanctioned by the Rules of Court, specifically Rule 27 on the Production or Inspection of Documents or Things, and RA 8479.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In fact, under RA 8479, it is the DOE-DOJ Joint Task Force which has the power and authority to monitor or investigate oil companies, and initiate the filing of a complaint, if necessary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In this case, considering that public respondent RTC already referred the case to the DOE-DOJ Joint Task Force for investigation, there was no need for public respondent RTC to issue said orders as it is bound by the task force's finding that no violation was committed by the Big 3 under the doctrine of conclusive finality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><u><i>Shell</i></u><br><br>Shell, impleaded as a necessary party, likewise argues that public respondent RTC committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the opening of the books of accounts of the Big 3 as this is beyond the scope of a petition for declaratory relief, which is only limited to the declaration of legal rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Shell claims that it is beyond the mandates and statutory powers of the COA, the BIR, and the BOC to examine the books of accounts of the Big 3,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and that such order is a violation of the Big 3's right to due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br><u><i>G.R. No. 189060</i></u><br><br>Chevron ascribes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC in issuing the April 27 and July 7, 2009 Orders. Chevron argues that the Amended Petition for Declaratory Relief filed by private respondents failed to raise a justiciable controversy and to establish a cause of action for a declaratory relief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Chevron points out that there is no factual allegation in the Petition that private respondents' rights are being threatened or that there is an imminent violation thereof that should be prevented by the declaratory relief sought.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Instead, from the allegations, it appears that private respondents want public respondent RTC to investigate and render an opinion on whether the Big 3 violated Article 186 of the RPC or Section 11 of RA 8479.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> This, however, is not the function of the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Rather, it is the DOE-DOJ Joint Task Force that has primary jurisdiction to investigate whether there was a violation of Section 11 of RA 8479.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Thus, the RTC exceeded its power or authority when it created its own procedure, ordering the government agencies to investigate the Big 3 and allowing private respondent Cabigao to become part of the panel of examiners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> To justify its orders, the RTC cites the doctrine of <i>parens patriae</i>.

It appears therefore that the filing of the Amended Petition was done on the assumption that there was already a breach or violation on the part of the Big 3, which cannot be the subject of a declaratory relief. It must be stressed that an action for declaratory relief presupposes that there has been no actual breach as such action is filed only for the purpose of securing an authoritative statement of the rights and obligations of the parties under a contract, deed or statute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> It cannot be availed of if the statute, deed or contract has been breached or violated because, in such a case, the remedy is for the aggrieved party to file the appropriate ordinary civil action in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Thus, the Court has consistently ruled that "[i]f adequate relief is available through another form or action or proceeding, the other action must be preferred over an action for declaratory relief."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Worth mentioning at this point is the ruling in <i>Sarmiento v.

If the case at bar were allowed for a declaratory relief, the judgment therein notwithstanding, another action would still lie against the importer respondent for violation of the barter law. So, instead of one case only before the courts in which all issues would be decided, two cases will be allowed, one being the present action for declaratory relief and a subsequent one for the confiscation of the importations as a consequence of the breach of the barter law.<br><br>The impropriety of allowing an action for declaratory relief, after a breach of the law, can be seen in the very decision of the court itself, which is now subject of the appeal. Whereas the case at bar was purported to bring about a simple declaration of the rights of the parties to the action, the judgment goes further than said declaration and decrees that the importation by the respondent corporation violates the law, and further directs that the legal importation be confiscated under the provisions of the law (Section 1 (e), R.A. No. 1194). This confiscation directed by the court lies clearly beyond the scope and nature of an action for declaratory relief, as the judgment of confiscation goes beyond the issues expressly raised, and to that extent it is null and void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br></blockquote>Similarly, in this case, an action for declaratory relief may no longer be allowed considering that private respondents are not merely asking for a declaration of their rights but are actually asking public respondent RTC to determine whether there was a violation of Section 11 of RA 8479, for which the Big 3 may be prosecuted and found criminally liable. And since there is already an alleged breach, it cannot be the subject of a declaratory relief. Public respondent RTC therefore committed grave abuse of discretion in not dismissing the Amended Petition.<br><br><b><i>The DOE-DOJ Joint Task Force is duly authorized by law to investigate and to order the prosecution of cartelization.</i></b><br><br>Moreover, the determination of such issue lies with the DOE-DOJ Joint Task Force.

Garcia v. Hon. Corona</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> the Court made it clear that it is the DOE-DOJ Task Force which has the power to investigate and cause the prosecution of violators. It ruled that:<br><blockquote>Article 186 of the [RPC], as amended, punishes as a felony the creation of monopolies and combinations in restraint of trade. The Solicitor General, on the other hand, cites provisions of RA 8479 intended to prevent competition from being corrupted or manipulated. Section 11, "Anti-Trust Safeguards," defines and prohibits cartelization and predatory pricing. It penalizes the persons and officers involved with imprisonment of three (3) to seven (7) years and fines ranging from One Million to Two million pesos. For this purpose, a Joint Task Force from the [DOE] and [DOJ] is created under Section 14 to investigate and order the prosecution of violations.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 13 of the Act provides for "Remedies," under which the filing of actions by government prosecutors and the investigation of private complainants by the Task Force is provided.

Upon the other hand, the disciplined, determined, consistent and faithful execution of the law is the function of the President. As stated by public respondents, the remedy against unreasonable price increases is not the nullification of Section 19 of R.A. 8479 but the setting into motion of its various other provisions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br></blockquote>Again, in <i>Congressman Garcia v.

No. 8479, x x x does not condone these acts; indeed, Section 11 (a) of the law expressly prohibits and punishes cartelization, which is defined in the same section as "<i>any agreement, combination or concerted action by refiners, importers and/or dealers</i>, or their representatives, <i>to fix prices</i>, restrict outputs or divide markets, either by products or by areas, or allocate markets, either by products or by areas, in restraint of trade or free competition, including any contractual stipulation which prescribes pricing levels and profit margins." This definition is broad enough to include the alleged acts of overpricing or price-fixing by the Big 3. R.A. No. 8479 has provided, aside from prosecution for cartelization, several other anti-trust mechanisms, including the enlarged scope of the [DOE's] monitoring power and the creation of a Joint Task Force to immediately act on complaints against unreasonable rise in the price of petroleum products. Petitioner Garcia's failure is that he failed to show that he resorted to these measures before filing the instant petition. His belief that these oversight mechanisms are unrealistic and insufficient does not permit disregard of these remedies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br></blockquote>Here, the RTC initially resolved to refer the instant case to the DOE-DOJ Joint Task Force for investigation and determination of whether the Big 3 were in violation of Section 11 of RA 8479. However, upon receipt of the report of the DOE-DOJ Joint Task Force that there was no violation committed by the Big 3, the RTC, instead of dismissing the case, ordered the COA, the BIR, and the BOC to open and examine the books of accounts of the Big 3 and even allowed private respondent Cabigao to be part of the panel of examiners. In doing so, the trial court divested the DOE-DOJ Joint Task Force of its power and authority and vested the same to the COA, the BIR, the BOC and private respondent Cabigao.<br><br>To justify its orders, the public respondent trial court invokes the doctrine of <i>parens patriae</i>.<br><br>Under the doctrine of <i>parens patriae</i> (father of his country), the judiciary, as an agency of the State, has the supreme power and authority to intervene and to provide protection to persons <i>non sui juris</i> - those who because of their age or incapacity are unable to care and fend for themselves.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> In <i>Maynilad Water Services, Inc. v.

Public respondent RTC, therefore, cannot create a new panel of examiners to replace the DOE-DOJ Joint Task Force as this goes against RA 8479.<br><br><b><i>It is beyond the mandates of the COA, the BIR, and the BOC to open and examine the books of accounts of the Big 3 in the instant case.</i></b><br><br>Besides, it is beyond the mandates of the COA, the BIR, and the BOC to open and examine the books of accounts of the Big 3.<br><br>In <i>Fernando v.

However, where the internal control system of the audited agencies is inadequate, the Commission may adopt such measures, including temporary or special pre-audit, as are necessary and appropriate to correct the deficiencies. It shall keep the general accounts of the Government and, for such period as may be provided by law, preserve the vouchers and other supporting papers pertaining thereto.<br></blockquote>The COA was envisioned by our Constitutional framers to be a dynamic, effective, efficient and independent watchdog of the Government. It granted the COA the authority to determine whether government entities comply with laws and regulations in disbursing government funds, and to disallow illegal or irregular disbursements of government funds.<br><br>In the case of <i>Funa v. Manila Economic and Cultural Office, et al.</i>, this Court enumerated and clarified the COA's jurisdiction over various governmental entities. In that case, this Court stated that the COA's audit jurisdiction extends to the following entities:<br><br>1. The government, or any of its subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities;<br><br>2. GOCCs with original charters;<br><br>3. GOCCs without original charters;<br><br>4. Constitutional bodies, commissions and offices that have been granted fiscal autonomy under the Constitution; and<br><br>5. Non-governmental entities receiving subsidy or equity, directly or indirectly, from or through the government, which are required by law or the granting institution to submit to the COA for audit as a condition of subsidy or equity.<br><br>COA's authority to examine and audit the accounts of government and, to a certain extent, non-governmental entities, is consistent with Section (Sec.) 29 (1) of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1445 otherwise known as the Auditing Code of the Philippines, which grants the COA visitorial authority over the following non-governmental entities:<br><br>1. Non-governmental entities "subsidized by the government;"<br><br>2. Non-governmental entities "required to pay levy or government share;"<br><br>3. Non-governmental entities that have "received counterpart funds from the government;" and<br><br>4. Non-governmental entities "partly funded by donations through the government."<br><br>COA's audit jurisdiction is also laid down in Section 11, Chapter 4, Subtitle B, Title I, Book V of the Administrative Code of 1987:<br><blockquote>SECTION 11. <i>General Jurisdiction</i>. (1) The Commission on Audit shall have the power, authority, and duty to examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenue and receipts of, and expenditures or uses of funds and property, owned or held in trust by, or pertaining to, the Government, or any of its subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters, and on a post-audit basis: (a) constitutional bodies, commissions and offices that have been granted fiscal autonomy under this Constitution; (b) autonomous state colleges and universities; (c) other government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries; and (d) such non-governmental entities receiving subsidy or equity, directly or indirectly, from or through the Government, which are required by law or the granting institution to submit to such audit as a condition of subsidy or equity. However, where the internal control system of the audited agencies is inadequate, the Commission may adopt such measures, including temporary or special pre-audit, as are necessary and appropriate to correct the deficiencies.

However, its authority to audit extends even to non-governmental entities insofar as the latter receives financial aid from the government. Thus, it is clear that the determination of COA's jurisdiction over a specific entity does not merely require an examination of the nature of the entity. Should the entity be found to be non-governmental, further determination must be had as to the source of its funds or the nature of the account sought to be audited by the COA.<br><br>In the analysis of an entity's nature, this Court, in prior cases, examined the statutory origin, the charter, purpose and the relations that a particular entity has with the State.<br><br>In <i>Phil. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. [COA]</i>, this Court clarified that totality of an entity's relations with the State must be considered. If the corporation is created by the State as the latter's own agency or instrumentality to help it in carrying out its governmental functions, then that corporation is considered public; otherwise, it is private. This Court examined the charter of therein petitioner, Philippine Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, its employees' membership to social insurance system, and the presence of x x x government officials in its board, among others. In that case, this Court ruled that the mere public purpose of an entity's existence does not, <i>per se</i>, make it a public corporation:<br><blockquote><i>Fourth</i>. The respondents contend that the petitioner is a "body politic" because its primary purpose is to secure the protection and welfare of animals which, in turn, redounds to the public good.<br><br>This argument, is, at best, specious. The fact that a certain juridical entity is impressed with public interest does not, by that circumstance alone, make the entity a public corporation, inasmuch as a corporation may be private although its charter contains provisions of a public character, incorporated solely for the public good. This class of corporations may be considered quasi-public corporations, which are private corporations that render public service, supply public wants or pursue other eleemosynary objectives. While purposely organized for the gain or benefit of its members, they are required by law to discharge functions for the public benefit. Examples of these corporations are utility, railroad, warehouse, telegraph, telephone, water supply corporations and transportation companies. It must be stressed that a quasi-public corporation is a species of private corporations, but the qualifying factor is the type of service the former renders to the public: if it performs a public service, then it becomes a quasi-public corporation.<br><br>Authorities are of the view that the purpose alone of the corporation cannot be taken as a safe guide, for the fact is that almost all corporations are nowadays created to promote the interest, good, or convenience of the public. A bank, for example, is a private corporation; yet, it is created for a public benefit. Private schools and universities are likewise private corporations; and yet, they are rendering public service. Private hospitals and wards are charged with heavy social responsibilities. More so with all common carriers. On the other hand, there may exist a public corporation even if it is endowed with gifts or donations from private individuals.<br></blockquote>Meanwhile, in <i>Engr. Feliciano v. [COA]</i>, this Court ruled that regardless of the nature of the corporation, the determining factor of COA's audit jurisdiction is government ownership or control of the corporation. In this case, the Court found that local water districts (LWDs), are owned and controlled by the government, as evidenced from the fact that "there [was] no private party involved in their creation, ownership of the national or local government of their assets, the manner of appointment of their board of directors and their employees' being subject to civil service laws." The Court also noted as an indication of the government's control, the latter's power to appoint LWD directors, to provide for their compensation, as well as the Local Water Utilities Administration's power to require LWDs to merge or consolidate their facilities or operations.<br><br>In <i>Boy Scouts of the Philippines v. [COA]</i>, the Court, in arriving at the conclusion that BSP is subject to the COA's audit jurisdiction, examined its charter, Commonwealth Act No. 111, and the provisions of the same concerning BSP's governing body, its classification and relationship with the National Government, specifically as an attached agency of then Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS), as well as its sources of funds.<br></blockquote>Without a doubt, the case of the Big 3 would not fall under the audit jurisdiction of COA. They are not public entities nor are they non­ governmental entities receiving financial aid from the government.<br><br>As to <i>Pasang Masda's</i> reliance on the case of <i>Meralco v.

That case involves a situation different from the present case as what was in issue therein was the authority of the COA under Section 22 of the Administrative Code of 1987 to examine the books, records and accounts of public utilities in connection with the fixing of rates for the purpose of determining franchise taxes. Thus, it cannot be used as precedent to justify the orders of public respondent RTC.<br><br>With respect to the BIR, its Commissioner is authorized to examine books, paper, record, or other data of taxpayers but only to ascertain the correctness of any return, or in making a return when none was made, or in determining the liability of any person for any internal revenue tax, or in collecting such liability, or evaluating the person's tax compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> The BOC, on the other hand, is authorized to audit or examine all books, records, and documents of importers necessary or relevant for the purpose of collecting the proper duties and taxes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Since there are no taxes or duties involved in this case, the BIR and the BOC likewise have no power and authority to open and examine the books of accounts of the Big 3.<br><br>As previously discussed, it is the DOE-DOJ Joint Task Force that has the sole power and authority to monitor, investigate, and endorse the filing of complaints, if necessary, against oil companies.
