				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The right to speedy disposition of cases is a relative and flexible concept. It is also waivable and must be seasonably raised.

He alleged that upon consultation with the barangay captain and other officials of Poblacion Diplahan in Zamboanga Sibugay, letters were oftentimes not delivered personally to the addressee especially in remote barangays. Instead, names of addressees were posted in the barangay bulletin board and, if the letters were not claimed after a few days, they were returned to senders. It could very well be that the addressees were unaware that they had letters awaiting them in the barangay hall. However, it does not mean that these beneficiaries do not exist. Therefore, the finding of the Commission on Audit that the beneficiaries who had availed themselves of financial assistance through him were fictitious was presumptuous.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>''<br><br>In a 136-page Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated July 10, 2006, the Office of the Ombudsman found probable cause to indict Board Member Baya, together with 31 other co-respondents, including the Provincial Governor, Vice- Governor, Board Members of the Province of Zamboanga Sibugay, and their respective staff who participated in the scheme,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> for the commission of malversation of public funds <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33] </sup>through falsification of public documents and violation of Section 3(e)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<br><br>The Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao found that Board Member Baya indeed caused the reimbursement of a total of P60,000.00 under three (3) disbursement vouchers for amounts he allegedly advanced to poor beneficiaries of the "Aid to the Poor" program. However, of the 18 beneficiaries that had allegedly availed of financial assistance, 14 could not be located. While Board Member Baya submitted affidavits from the alleged beneficiaries of the "Aid to the Poor" program, the Office of the Ombudsman said that these do not "sufficiently explain the inconsistency attending the grant of financial aid to the other beneficiaries whose existence remains doubtful."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>It thus concluded that "the documents, such as the [Brief Social Case Study Reports], Application Forms[,] and the Reimbursement Expense Receipts, submitted by [Baya and his co-respondents] to support the claims under the different disbursement vouchers were false and merely fabricated to make it appear that the money was spent and given to the poor."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Aside from the Provincial Governor, Vice-Governor, and the Provincial Board Members, the members of their respective staff who had prepared and signed the Brief Social Case Study Reports, Application Forms, and Reimbursement Expense Receipts were likewise indicted as principals because, according to the Ombudsman, "[t]he appropriation of the subject public funds would not have been carried out were it not for [their] indispensable and active participation[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Even granting that the funds were under the custody of the Provincial Social Welfare and Development Office, the Office of the Ombudsman held, nonetheless, that Board Member Baya and his co-respondents may still be held accountable and responsible since they participated in the misuse and misapplication of the funds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Lastly, the undue haste and evident bad faith of the respondents were shown by the grant of financial assistance even before the enactment in 2002 of the ordinance providing for guidelines regulating the "Aid to the Poor" program.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the July 10, 2006 Resolution of the Office of the Ombudsman partly read:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, FOREGOING PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, this Office after due consideration of the evidence on hand finds the existence of probable cause for the commission of the crimes of Malversation thru Falsification of Public Documents and violation of Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019 against the following respondents:<br><br>. . . .<br><br><b>IGNACIO BAYA, NELITA R.

Rodriguez, Alice B. Libre, and Rex P. Tago, the latter three (3) being members of his staff who had prepared or otherwise signed the Brief Social Case Study Reports, copies of Department of Social Welfare and Development Form 200, and the Reimbursement Expense Receipts used to reimburse amounts allegedly given to the inexistent beneficiaries. Considering that the crime charged against Board Member Baya was a complex crime and the amount involved was more than "P22,000.00 or higher[,]" no bail was recommended pursuant to the 2000 Bail Bond Guide issued by the Department of Justice, National Prosecution Service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>On October 6, 2010,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Board Member Baya filed a Motion for Judicial Determination of Probable Cause<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> with prayer for dismissal of the cases against him.

Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> where this Court held that a delay in the preliminary investigation that is close to three (3) years is violative of the right to speedy disposition of cases, leading to the dismissal of the criminal complaints against then Secretary of the Department of Public Information Francisco Tatad.<br><br>In its March 31, 2011 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the Sandiganbayan held that during preliminary investigation, failure to furnish a copy of the resolution recommending the filing of information against the respondent does not invalidate the information already filed in court. The proper remedy of the respondent is to file, with leave of court, a motion for reconsideration with the prosecutor, which Board Member Baya failed to do.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>As to Board Member Baya's claim that his right to speedy disposition of cases was violated, the Sandiganbayan said that it is a "flexible concept"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and that "[d]ue regard must be given to the facts and circumstances surrounding each case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> According to the Sandiganbayan, the long period that took the Ombudsman to resolve the case, in itself, is not the measure of whether the right was violated, further explaining that:<br><blockquote>[The right to speedy disposition of cases] is deemed violated only when the proceedings are attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays, or when unjustified postponements of the trial are asked for and secured, or when without cause or justifiable motive, a long period of time is allowed to elapse without the party having his case tried. In the determination of whether or not this right has been violated the Supreme Court has laid down the following guidelines: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for such delay; (3) the assertion or failure to assert such right by the accused; and (4) the prejudice caused by the delay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></blockquote>The Sandiganbayan noted that Board Member Baya raised his objection to his perceived delay in the resolution of the case during the preliminary investigation stage only until the information was filed in court. This, the Sandiganbayan said, was a belated assertion of the right. Further, the case involved numerous respondents and voluminous records, which justified the long period to resolve the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Ultimately, the Sandiganbayan denied the Motion for Judicial Determination of Probable Cause but ordered the Office of the Ombudsman to reinvestigate the cases against Board Member Baya, nevertheless.

In any case, the Office of the Ombudsman still considered the former submissions of Board Member Baya in resolving the case. The Office of the Ombudsman recommended as follows:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, it is respectfully recommended by the undersigned prosecutors that the Resolution of the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao dated July 10, 2006 finding probable cause against the accused-movants be MAINTAINED.<br><br>RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>In the meantime, on June 7, 2011,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Board Member Baya, who is also a member of the Bar, filed on his own behalf and that of his co-respondents Rodriguez, Libre, and Tago a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> <i>before the Sandiganbayan</i> of its March 31, 2011 Order, maintaining that there was no probable cause for the filing of the Informations against him in court.

Upon the directive of this Court, the Office of the Special Prosecutor, representing the Sandiganbayan and the People of the Philippines, filed a Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> to which petitioner replied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>The issues raised in the Petition are the following:<br><br>First, whether or not the Sandiganbayan gravely abused its discretion in not dismissing the cases for malversation of public funds and the cases for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act for lack of probable cause; and<br><br>Second, whether or not the Sandiganbayan erred in not dismissing the cases filed against petitioner for violation of his constitutional rights to due process and speedy disposition of cases.<br><br>Petitioner argues that he should not have been charged with malversation of public funds through falsification of public documents. He first enumerates the elements of Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code, which defines the felony of malversation of public funds or property. He then points out that three (3) of the four (4) elements are allegedly missing in this case. Specifically, apart from the element of the accused being a public officer, all the other elements are purportedly absent. He insists that: (1) he had no custody or control of funds or property by reason of the duties of his office; (2) he was not accountable for any public funds or property; and (3) he did not appropriate, take, misappropriate or consent or, through abandonment or negligence, permit another person to take public funds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Petitioner alleges that the funds for the "Aid to the Poor" program was under the custody of the Provincial Social Welfare and Development Office. He maintains that he never misappropriated any of the funds for the "Aid to the Poor" program, especially since the money he had given to the poor beneficiaries came from his own pocket. All that petitioner sought was a reimbursement of the amounts he had given out from his personal funds, and whether his request for reimbursement will be granted was still subject to the discretion of the Provincial Social Welfare and Development Office. Therefore, there is no malversation of public funds on his part.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Petitioner adds that he should not have been charged with violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 because no undue injury was caused to any party or to the government.

According to petitioner, it was error for the Commission on Audit and the Office of the Ombudsman to consider the confirmation letters that were returned to senders as proof of the nonexistence of beneficiaries. While it may be true that the addressees may no longer be found at the addresses they gave at the time they availed themselves of the "Aid to the Poor" program, it could very well be that they had already moved out of their old homes. In addition, the Office of the Ombudsman should have considered the affidavits he submitted in evidence, allegedly issued by the some of the beneficiaries of the "Aid to the Poor" program, proving that they indeed received aid from petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Apart from the lack of probable cause, petitioner argues that the Sandiganbayan gravely abused its discretion for not dismissing the cases on the ground of violation of his rights to due process and speedy disposition of cases. Petitioner highlights how, from the time the crimes were allegedly committed in 2001 to the filing of the cases before the Sandiganbayan in 2010, the Office of the Ombudsman took a period of almost seven (7) years just to resolve the complaints.<br><br>Furthermore, petitioner argues that neither the number of the respondents nor the voluminous records of the case justify the delay in resolving the cases at the Ombudsman level.

The rule is that the determination of probable cause for purposes of filing an information in court is a duty exclusively lodged to the prosecutory arm of government, which in this case is the Office of the Ombudsman. Once the case is filed before the Sandiganbayan, the latter acquires exclusive jurisdiction to determine the case before it. Here, after the Sandiganbayan granted reinvestigation and petitioner failed to avail himself of the remedies before the Office of the Ombudsman, the Sandiganbayan became duty-bound to proceed with determining probable cause for purposes of issuing a warrant of arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>Respondent vehemently denies petitioner's claim that he was not given due process during reinvestigation. As shown by the registry return card of the April 14, 2011 Order directing petitioner to file a motion for reconsideration or reinvestigation, his counsel, Atty.

The Disbursement Vouchers he signed, as well as the Brief Social Case Study Reports, Department of Social Welfare and Development Form 200, and Reimbursement Expense Receipts annexed to the vouchers, all show that petitioner participated in the release of public funds allegedly for beneficiaries of the "Aid to the Poor" program, beneficiaries who turned out be nonexistent. Having participated in the release of the funds, petitioner is accountable for the funds he had reimbursed pursuant to Section 340<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> of the Local Government Code.

The exception to the rule is "when the reckless or gross negligence of the counsel deprives the client of due process of law.<br><br>The agency created between a counsel and a client is a highly fiduciary relationship. A counsel becomes the eyes and ears in the prosecution or defense of his or her client's case. This is inevitable because a competent counsel is expected to understand the law that frames the strategies he or she employs in a chosen legal remedy. Counsel carefully lays down the procedure that will effectively and efficiently achieve his or her client's interests. Counsel should also have a grasp of the facts, and among the plethora of details, he or she chooses which are relevant for the legal cause of action or defense being pursued.<br><br>It is these indispensable skills, among others, that a client engages. Of course, there are counsels who have both wisdom and experience that give their clients great advantage. There are still, however, counsels who wander in their mediocrity whether consciously or unconsciously.<br><br>The [S]tate does not guarantee to the client that they will receive the kind of service that they expect. Through this [C]ourt, we set the standard on competence and integrity through the application requirements and our disciplinary powers. Whether counsel discharges his or her role to the satisfaction of the client is a matter that will ideally be necessarily monitored but, at present, is too impractical.<br><br>Besides, finding good counsel is also the responsibility of the client especially when he or she can afford to do so. Upholding client autonomy in these choices is infinitely a better policy choice than assuming that the [S]tate is omniscient. Some degree of error must, therefore, be borne by the client who does have the capacity to make choices.<br><br>This is one of the bases of the doctrine that the error of counsel visits the client. This [C]ourt will cease to perform its social functions if it provides succor to all who are not satisfied with the services of their counsel.<br><br>But, there is an exception to this doctrine of binding agency between counsel and client. This is when the negligence of counsel is so gross, almost bordering on recklessness and utter incompetence, that we can safely conclude that the due process rights of the client were violated. Even so, there must be a clear and convincing showing that the client was so maliciously deprived of information that he or she could not have acted to protect his or her interests. The error of counsel must have been both palpable yet maliciously exercised that it should viably be the basis for disciplinary action.<br><br>Thus, in <i>Bejarasco, Jr. v. People</i>, this [C]ourt reiterated:<br><blockquote>For the exception to apply ... the gross negligence should not be accompanied by the client's own negligence or malice, considering that the client has the duty to be vigilant in respect of his interests by keeping himself up-to-date on the status of the case. Failing in this duty, the client should suffer whatever adverse judgment is rendered against him.</blockquote>In <i>Bejarasco, Jr.,</i> Peter Bejarasco, Jr., failed to file a Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals within the extended period prayed<br><br>for. The Court of Appeals then dismissed the Appeal and issued an Entry of Judgment. His conviction for grave threats and grave oral defamation became final, and a warrant for his arrest was issued.<br><br>In his Petition for Review on Certiorari before this [CJourt, Peter Bejarasco, Jr. argued that his counsel's negligence in failing to file the Appeal deprived him of due process.<br><br>This [C]ourt rejected Peter Bejarasco, Jr.'s argument, ruling that "[i]t is the client's duty to be in contact with his lawyer from time to time in order to be informed of the progress and developments of his case[.]" "[T]o merely rely on the bare reassurances of his lawyer that everything is being taken care of is not enough."<br><br>This [C]ourt noted the 16 months from the issuance of the Entry of Judgment and the 22 months from the issuance of the trial court's Decision before Peter Bejarasco, Jr. appealed his conviction. According to this [C]ourt, "[h]e ought to have been sooner alerted about his dire situation by the fact that an unreasonably long time had lapsed since the [trial court] handed down the dismissal of his appeal without [his counsel] having updated him on the developments[.]"<br><br>In the present case, petitioner took almost seven (7) years, or almost 84 months, from the Court of Appeals' issuance of the Resolution denying his Motion for Reconsideration to file a Petition before this court. As this [C]ourt ruled in Bejarasco, Jr., petitioner ought to have been sooner alerted of the "unreasonably long time" the Court of Appeals was taking in resolving his appeal. Worse, he was arrested in Pasay City, not in Cebu where he resides. His failure to know or to find out the real status of his appeal "rendered [petitioner] undeserving of any sympathy from the Court <i>vis-a-vis</i> the negligence of his former counsel."<br><br>We fail to see how petitioner could not have known of the issuance of the Resolution.

The criminal cases against Coscolluela and his co-respondents were dismissed, first, because it took the Ombudsman eight (8) years to resolve the criminal complaints against them and, second, they were unaware that the investigation against them was still on going. Here, there is no indication that petitioner was unaware that the investigation against him and his co­respondents was still on going.<br><br>Further, <i>Coscolluela</i> directly cited Barker, an American case and, therefore, is not binding precedent.' While Barker served as basis for this Court's adoption of the balancing test, it must be highlighted that <i>Barker</i> involved the right to speedy trial which, though akin to the right to speedy disposition of cases, is an entirely different right nonetheless.<br><br><i>Barker</i>, though providing that "[a] defendant has no duty to bring himself to trial[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> followed with "[t]his does not mean, however, that the defendant has no responsibility to assert his right [to speedy trial]."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> Precisely, assertion of the defendant's right was made one of the factors to consider in determining whether an accused's right to speedy trial was violated. For the United States Supreme Court, the acceptable test was "a balancing test, in which conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant are weighed."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> <i>Barker</i> explains:<br><blockquote>The nature of the speedy trial right does make it impossible to pinpoint a precise time in the process when the right must be asserted or waived, but that fact does not argue for placing the burden of protecting the right solely on defendants. A defendant has no duty to bring himself to trial; the State has that duty as well as the duty of insuring that the trial is consistent with due process. Moreover, for the reasons earlier expressed, society has a particular interest in bringing swift prosecutions, and society's representatives are the ones who should protect that interest.<br><br>It is also noteworthy that such a rigid view of the demand-waiver rule places defense counsel in an awkward position. Unless he demands a trial early and often, he is in danger of frustrating his client's right. If counsel is willing to tolerate some delay because he finds it reasonable and helpful in preparing his own case, he may be unable to obtain a speedy trial for his client at the end of that time. Since under the demand-waiver rule no time runs until the demand is made, the government will have whatever time is otherwise reasonable to bring the defendant to trial after a demand has been made. Thus, if the first demand is made three months after arrest in a jurisdiction which prescribes a six-month rule, the prosecution will have a total of nine months—-which may be wholly unreasonable under the circumstances. The result in practice is likely to be either an automatic, <i>pro forma</i> demand made immediately after appointment of counsel or delays which, but for the demand-waiver rule, would not be tolerated. Such a result is not consistent with the interests of defendants, society, or the Constitution.<br><br>We reject, therefore, the rule that a defendant who fails to demand a speedy trial forever waives his right. <u>This does not mean, however, that the defendant has no responsibility to assert his right. We think the better rule is that the defendant's assertion of or failure to assert his right to a speedy trial is one of the factors to be considered in an inquiry into the deprivation of the right</u>. Such a formulation avoids the rigidities of the demand-waiver rule and the resulting possible unfairness in its application. <u>It allows the trial court to exercise a judicial discretion based on the circumstances, including due consideration of any applicable formal procedural rule.</u> It would permit, for example, a court to attach a different weight to a situation in which <u>the defendant knowingly fails to object from a situation in which his attorney acquiesces in long delay without adequately informing his client, or from a situation in which no counsel is appointed</u>. It would also allow a court to weigh the frequency and force of the objections as opposed to attaching significant weight to a purely <i>pro forma</i> objection.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> (Citations omitted; underscoring provided)</blockquote>In any case, the 2018 <i>en banc</i> case of <i>Cagang v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup> already settled the rule that, in this jurisdiction, the right to speedy disposition of cases must be seasonably invoked; otherwise, it is deemed waived.<br><br>The fourth and last factor of the balancing test is prejudice to the respondent, either in the form of oppressive pre-trial incarceration, anxiety and worry, or impairment of respondent's defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> It is said that the most serious of these is the last, because:<br><blockquote>[T]he inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system. There is also prejudice if the defense witnesses are unable to recall accurately the events of the distant past. Even if the accused is not imprisoned prior to trial, he is still disadvantaged by restraints on his liberty and by living under a cloud of anxiety, suspicion and often, hostility. His financial resources may be drained, his association is curtailed, and he is subjected to public obloquy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>There are instances when a respondent does not want a speedy disposition of his or her case as a way to, albeit counterproductively, ease his or her anxiety. Thus, a respondent may resort to "delaying tactics like failing to appear despite summons, filing needless motions against interlocutory actions, or requesting unnecessary postponements that will prevent courts or tribunals to properly adjudicate the case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> He or she may also deliberately fail to object to continuances obtained by the prosecution during preliminary investigation. Then, only when a case is filed in court, will the respondent invoke the right to speedy disposition of cases.<br><br>Courts, therefore, perform a delicate balancing act in determining whether or not a person's right to speedy disposition of cases is violated. The four (4) factors—(1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the respondent's assertion of ¦ the right, and (4) prejudice to the respondent—are to be considered together, not in isolation. The interplay of these factors determine whether the delay was inordinate. Thus, it said that the right to speedy disposition of cases is a relative and flexible concept.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> This fluidity, however, gives rise to possible subjectivity and inconsistency in determining whether a case was disposed within an acceptable period of time.<br><br>Addressing this, this Court in Cagang directed the Office of the Ombudsman to promulgate specific time periods for resolving complaints for preliminary investigation. The party with the burden of justifying the delay would then depend on when the delay occurred, that is, before or after the lapse of the time periods set. If the perceived delay occurred within the time periods, the defense has the burden of proving that the delay was inordinate,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup> If the delay occurred after the time periods set, the prosecution has the burden of justifying the delay. Courts are now mandated to apply <i>Cagang</i> on the mode of analysis for resolving claims of violation of the right to speedy disposition of cases:<br><blockquote>This Court now clarifies the mode of analysis in situations where the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial is invoked.<br><br><i>First</i>, the right to speedy disposition of cases is different from the right to speedy trial. While the rationale for both rights is the same, the right to speedy trial may only be invoked in criminal prosecutions against courts of law. The right to speedy disposition of cases, however, may be invoked before any tribunal, whether judicial or quasi-judicial. What is important is that the accused may already be prejudiced by the proceeding for the right to speedy disposition of cases to be invoked.<br><br><i>Second</i>, a case is deemed initiated upon the filing of a formal complaint prior to a conduct of a preliminary investigation. This Court acknowledges, however, that the Ombudsman should set reasonable periods for preliminary investigation, with due regard to the complexities and nuances of each case. Delays beyond this period will be taken against the prosecution. The period taken for fact-finding investigations prior to the filing of the formal complaint shall not be included in the determination of whether there has been inordinate delay.<br><br><i>Third</i>, courts must first determine which party carries the burden of proof. If the right is invoked within the given time periods contained in current Supreme Court resolutions and circulars, and the time periods that will be promulgated by the Office of the Ombudsman, the defense has the burden of proving that the right was justifiably invoked. If the delay occurs beyond the given time period and the right is invoked, the prosecution has the burden of justifying the delay.<br><br>If the defense has the burden of proof, it must prove <i>first</i>, whether the case is motivated by malice or clearly only politically motivated and is attended by utter lack of evidence, and <i>second</i>, that the defense did not contribute to the delay.<br><br>Once the burden of proof shifts to the prosecution, the prosecution must prove <i>first</i>, that it followed the prescribed procedure in the conduct of preliminary investigation and in the prosecution of the case; <i>second</i>, that the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence made the delay inevitable; and <i>third</i>, that no prejudice was suffered by the accused as a result of the delay.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, determination of the length of delay is never mechanical. Courts must consider the entire context of the case, from the amount of evidence to be weighed to the simplicity or complexity of the issues raised.<br><br>An exception to this rule is if there is an allegation that the prosecution of the case was solely motivated by malice, such as when the case is politically motivated or when there is continued prosecution despite utter lack of evidence. Malicious intent may be gauged from the behavior of the prosecution throughout the proceedings. If malicious prosecution is properly alleged and substantially proven, the case would automatically be dismissed without need of further analysis of the delay.<br><br>Another exception would be the waiver of the accused to the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial. If it can be proven that the accused acquiesced to the delay, the constitutional right can no longer be invoked.<br><br>In all cases of dismissals due to inordinate delay, the causes of the delays must be properly laid out and discussed by the relevant court.<br><br><i>Fifth</i>, the right to speedy disposition of cases or the right to speedy trial must be timely raised. The respondent or the accused must file the appropriate motion upon the lapse of the statutory or procedural periods. Otherwise, they are deemed to have waived their right to speedy disposition of cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup> (Citations omitted; emphasis in the original)</blockquote>The subsequent case of <i>Salcedo v.

The preliminary investigation lasted six (6) years,' six (6) months, and three (3) days, beginning on February 19, 2004, when the Ombudsman docketed the Commission on Audit's audit report as a formal charge, up to September 22, 2010, when the informations were filed before the Sandiganbayan. The time the Commission on Audit took to conduct its audit investigation from March 2003 to February 19, 2004, which was about 11 months, is not considered part of the proceedings for preliminary investigation but only for fact-­finding purposes.

As explained by respondent Office of the Special Prosecutor, petitioner was indicted together with 31 other co-respondents for malversation of public funds and for allegedly violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. The alleged criminal act consisted of disbursing funds from the coffers of Zamboanga Sibugay through a sham financial aid program.<br><br>To establish a <i>prima facie</i> case, the Ombudsman, with the help of the Commission on Audit, investigated the public officers, including petitioner, who had requested for reimbursements from the provincial government for amounts allegedly advanced to give financial aid. The identities of the supposed beneficiaries were verified, but it was found that the numerous beneficiaries indicated in the reimbursement requests were nonexistent.<br><br>These findings were detailed in the 7225-page audit report of the Commission on Audit, which was reviewed by the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao before docketing the case and directing the 32 respondents to file their respective counter-affidavits. After the submission of the complaints and counter-affidavits, the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao found probable cause against the respondents through a 136-page Resolution. The Resolution was further reviewed before finally approved by the Ombudsman.<br><br>These reasons—(1) number of persons charged; (2) the degree of review needed to unravel the scheme; (3) the numerous pleadings filed; (4) the voluminous documents and testimonies for review; and (5) the participation of petitioner—justify the time it took the Ombudsman to finally file the information in court.<br><br>Notably, during the preliminary investigation, petitioner never filed any kind of motion or manifestation to speedily resolve the complaints against him. Only when the six (6) informations were filed in the Sandiganbayan did petitioner file his Motion for Judicial Determination of Probable Cause, raising as one of the grounds the alleged violation of his right to speedy disposition of cases. To our mind, the right was invoked belatedly, and that petitioner acquiesced to the delay in the conduct of preliminary investigation.<br><br>Considering that petitioner never asserted his right to speedy disposition of cases at the prosecutor level, We conclude that he was not prejudiced by the six (6) years of preliminary investigation. No allegations of threats to liberty, loss of employment or compensation, or any other kind of prejudice were made, leading this Court to believe that petitioner actually welcomed the delay.<br><br>While the preliminary investigation in this case took more time than the three (3) years of preliminary investigation in <i>Tatad v.

In <i>Tatad</i>, a formal report for alleged violations of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act was filed against then Minister of Public Information Francisco S. Tatad as early as 1974. It was only in 1979, when Minister Tatad resigned from his position after he had a falling out with President Marcos, that the Presidential Security Command resurrected the 1974 report and filed it as a formal complaint before the Tanodbayan. Circuitously, the Tanodbayan referred the complaint back to the Presidential Security Command for fact­-finding investigation. By 1982, all the complaint-affidavits and counter-affidavits were with the Tanodbayan for final disposition, with the resolution approved and the case filed in court in 1985.<br><br>The peculiar circumstances in <i>Tatad</i> show that, though not in its technical sense, a "case" has been built against Minister Tatad as early as 1974 and its disposition was inordinately delayed to deliberately prejudice Minister Tatad.<br><br>The government, then controlled by a dictator, deviated from established procedure for preliminary investigation. Instead of directly filing a case before the Tanodbayan, a formal report was made to sleep in the Presidential Security Command. After the falling out in 1979, only then was the formal report revived and converted into a formal complaint. The Tanodbayan referred the complaint back to the Presidential Security Command, the very office that had received the initial report, for fact-­finding investigation.<br><br>Three (3) years after, the Tanodbayan had the complaint and all the counter-affidavits. It then took another three (3) years to file cases before the Sandiganbayan. These circumstances were patently impelled by political motivations, and this Court rightly concluded that Minister Tatad's right to speedy disposition of cases was violated.<br><br>Petitioner's prosecution was not similarly colored by political motivations. Nothing in the facts show that petitioner's prosecution was done in retaliation for offending a powerful person in government. As opposed to <i>Tatad</i>, the proceedings done here were in accord with established procedure for preliminary investigation, including the referral of the complaint to the Commission on Audit. It is the accepted practice in the Ombudsman to refer to the Commission on Audit complaints involving the alleged illegal disbursement of public funds in view of the Commission's authority to examine and audit expenditures and uses of government funds and property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> This is to ensure that no more State funds are wasted by filing unmeritorious cases in court.<br><br><i>Lopez, Jr. v.

In Lopez, a former official of the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports (now Department of Education) was charged with violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act for his involvement in an overpricing scheme and lack of public bidding for the procurement of laboratory apparatus and school equipment. After a four (4)-year conduct of the preliminary investigation, cases were filed before the Sandiganbayan. This Court considered the four (4) years too long a delay, finding that the cases filed against respondent Lopez were "not sufficiently complex to justify the length of time for their resolution."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> There was also "no statement that voluminous documentary and testimonial evidence were involved."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup><br><br>In contrast with the overpricing scheme in <i>Lopez</i>, the nature of the "Aid to the Poor" program, coupled with the sheer number of respondents, justifies the six (6) years it took the Office of the Ombudsman to file cases in court. Numerous persons were named as beneficiaries of financial aid, so numerous that the Commission on Audit issued a 7225-page report. To establish a <i>prima facie</i> case, the identities of these various persons had to be verified.

That out of the alleged eighteen (18) beneficiaries of said financial assistance, fourteen (14), however, could not be located.<br><br>Reiterating the same averments of his co-respondents, respondent Baya maintained his participation as being limited to referrals, also stressing the possible misrepresentation employed by beneficiaries. On the contrary, the members of his staff, namely, Nenita Rodriguez, Alice Libre and Rex Tago, who claimed to have personally seen the beneficiaries, are firm on their belief that the beneficiaries would not lie as to their names and addresses. Respondent Baya's allegations as to procedure claimed to have been undertaken in the release of the funds appears inconsistent, hence dubious. In his reply-affidavit, respondent Baya was quick to point responsibility to the [Provincial Social Work and Development Office], therein claiming that it was the [Provincial Social Work and Development Office] who prepared the [Brief Social Case Study Reports] and that payments to the beneficiaries were only made after the approval by the [Provincial Social Work and Development Office], In his counter-affidavit, however, respondent Baya alleged that it was his personnel, namely, Nelita Rodriguez, Alice Libre and Rex Tago who conducted the interview, gathered data and filled-up the [Brief Social Case Study Reports]. In his supplemental counter-affidavit, respondent Baya claimed that he conducted preliminary interview of the client before giving the monetary assistance, after which he left everything to his staff including the gathering and completion of requirements.<br><br>In an effort to prove the existence of the beneficiaries, respondent submitted affidavits of people who attested to the whereabouts of the beneficiaries, especially those of Oliver Alvarico, Romeo dela Cerna, Erlinda Yecla, Rogelyn Mejorada and Ramon Chavez. The statements of the affiants may show their association with the earlier named beneficiaries, however, the same do not in any way show that said alleged beneficiaries received the amounts claimed to have been extended to them by respondent Baya. While the affidavits of Emeliana Sueno and Cecille Ceballos may show that financial aid were extended to them by [Board Member] Baya, these confirmations do not sufficiently explain the inconsistency attending the grant of financial to aid to the other beneficiaries whose existence remains doubtful. A peculiar case is that of Erlinda Yecla who is listed as one of the beneficiaries for the amount of P4,000.00. In the confirmation letter dated 10 June 2003, <b>Erlinda Yecla</b> denied having received any cash aid from [the Provincial Social Work and Development Office] nor of having known [Board Member] Baya, further claiming that while she formerly resided at Malangas, she has since. . . transferred to Ipil [in 1977], While respondents impress on this Office the existence of another beneficiary likewise named <b>Erlinda Yecla</b>, such assertion, however, does not in any way establish the existence of said Erlinda Yecla as alleged recipient of the cash aid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[192]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>The Resolution dated June 1, 2011, issued after the reinvestigation, provides:<br><blockquote><center><b>THE RULING</b></center><br>The undersigned prosecutors examined all pertinent documents in these cases which consist of the three [Disbursement Vouchers] and all its annexes, the Audit-Investigation Report, the sworn statements of accused-movants, and the Affidavits of alleged beneficiaries of the Aid to the Poor Program, among others.<br><br>A careful scrutiny of the Disbursement Vouchers and the annexes thereto, consisting of the Brief Social Case Study Reports (BSCSR), DSWD Form 200, and Reimbursement Expense Receipts (RERs) revealed that all of the accused-movants participated in the release of public funds through reimbursement of expenses allegedly incurred for the "Aid to the Poor" program.

She also signed all the DSWD Form [2000] and all the [Brief Social Case Study Reports][sic], thereby attesting that financial assistance were given to the clients mentioned therein.<br><br>Based on their sworn statements, accused-movants do not dispute their participation in the release of public funds through the three above- stated reimbursement Disbursement Vouchers. They insist, however, that they actually paid the clients mentioned in the [Reimbursement Receipts], [Provincial Social Work and Development Office] Form 200 [sic] and [Brief Social Case Study Reports]. In support of this claim, they submitted the Affidavits of Barangay Captain Edison Ybanez, Emeliana Sueno, Barangay Captain Jonathan Acalendo, Cecile Gomez Cebailos, Lowell Lalican, Alan B. Tolorio, Roger Mejorada, Albani Maut and Dr. Carlos L. Gemarino, Jr.<br><br>Likewise, the Certification of Dr. Carlos L.

This is to certify further that she was different Erlinda Yecla from the Erlinda Yecla whom I know as an employee of the DSWD, Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay. X x x x."</blockquote>The above-stated Certification does not state that the Erlinda Yecla who was confined at the Gemarino Hospital for medical check-up received financial assistance from accused-movant Baya.<br><br>On the other hand, Allan Tolorio's Affidavit that Erlinda Yecla received financial assistance from accused-movant Baya is hearsay, not being executed by Erlinda Yecla herself. More importantly, this is belied by the Confirmation letter dated June 10, 2003 of Erlinda Yecla which expressly states that she did not receive financial aid from accused- movants.<br><br>The affirmation of Emelyn Sueno, Cecile Gomez Ceballos and Roger Mejorada that accused-movant Baya gave them financial assistance, including their defense of good faith are also matters of evidence which are best threshed out in the trial of these cases. Besides, the [Brief Social Case Study Reports] and [Provincial Social Work and Development Office] Form 200 [sic] show that accused-movants allegedly gave financial assistance to nineteen (19) clients and they have not submitted any proof as regards the other sixteen (16) alleged clients.<br><br>Significantly, accused-movant Libre did not sign any document attached to [Disbursement Voucher] Nos. 101-0201-90 and 101-0109-363 while accused-movant Tago did not sign any document attached to [Disbursement Voucher] Nos. 101-0201-91 and 101-0109-363. However, there is prima facie evidence that all the accused-movants conspired in all of these cases. They expressly admitted in their respective Sworn Statements that they personally witnessed Board Member Baya actually paying the clients listed in the AOL and that they personally met the individual clients, despite the finding in the audit investigation report of the "Aid to the Poor Program" were found to be fictitious or non-existing.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, it is respectfully recommended by the undersigned prosecutors that the Resolution of the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao dated July 10, 2006 finding probable cause against the accused-movants be MAINTAINED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[193]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>We reject petitioner's argument that he cannot be charged with malversation because he was not an accountable officer who had custody of the funds appropriated by him. Section 340 of the Local Government Code on persons accountable for local government funds provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 340. <b><i>Persons Accountable for Local Government Funds</i></b>. — Any officer of the local government unit whose duty permits or requires the possession or custody of local government funds shall be accountable and responsible for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with the provisions of this Title. Other local officers who, though not accountable by the nature of their duties, may likewise be similarly held accountable and responsible for local government funds through their participation in the use or application thereof.</blockquote>It is clear that not only those with actual possession or custody of the local government funds are considered accountable persons. Local government officials become accountable public officers either: (1) because of the nature of their functions; or (2) on account of their participation in the use or application of public funds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[194]</sup><br><br>Despite not having actual custody of the municipality's funds, petitioner participated in their use or application by directing how the funds should actually be applied.

Were it not for his certification in the Disbursement Vouchers and Reimbursement Expense Receipts, the Provincial Social Work and Development Office would not have approved the application for reimbursement.<br><br>This Court will not pass upon petitioner's contention that the manner by which the Commission on Audit confirmed the existence of the beneficiaries was "very much insufficient to establish probable cause."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[195]</sup> Again, this goes into the exclusive domain of the prosecution, and this Court sees nothing capricious, whimsical, arbitrary, or despotic in sending out confirmation letters to the addresses indicated by the beneficiaries in their respective application forms.
