She resisted, prompting HHH to use a cigarette to burn her left cheek. When AAA refused to hold HHH's penis, he spanked her with a thick wood. HHH made her lie on her stomach.

The Decision dated December 29, 2017 of the Regional Trial Court of Angeles City, Branch 59, convicting him of three (3) counts of Statutory Rape and three (3) counts of Rape through Sexual Assault is <b>AFFIRMED with MODICIATION</b> as to the award of damages in Criminal Case Nos. 14-11715, 14-12400 and 14-12401 which shall now be, as follows: civil .&nbsp; indemnity in the amount of Php 100,000; moral damages in the amount of Php 100,000.00 and Php 100,000.00 as exemplary damages.

The CA recognized that rape victims cannot be expected to give an accurate account of the traumatic and horrifying experience they had undergone. For the CA, what is important is that all the complainants were unfaltering in their declaration that they were raped and molested by their own father.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The CA also explained that the lack of immediate response from the daughters of HHH or the fact that they continued to live in the same house where he lived did not diminish the veracity or reliability of their testimony. They cannot be expected to immediately flee after the first incident of rape because they were too young, had no money, and had no means to live elsewhere. They submitted to their father's lewdness out of fear.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The CA also held that the claim of BBB was corroborated by the medical findings of Dr. Caranto. The physician established through his physical examination of BBB that he found healed laceration on the 9 o'clock and 8 o'clock areas of BBB's vagina. These could have been caused by a blunt object inserted therein more than seven days ago.

Thus, the fact that the two separate Informations alleged "on or about the year 2012" should not be taken against BBB.<br><br>On the other hand, the lower courts committed error in convicting HHH of Rape by Sexual Assault under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). Noticeably, CCC testified on an alleged incident of abuse that occurred in March 2012. In CCC's Complaint Judicial Affidavit,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> she alleged that the incident of abuse occurred in March 2012, as revealed in the following exchange:<br><blockquote>T-3.

However, a modification of the nomenclature of the offenses committed in Criminal Case Nos. 14-11713 and 14-11714 is in order.<br><br>There is a need to clarify the proper nomenclature of the offenses HHH is charged with in Criminal Case No. 14-11713 and 14-11714 for purposes of uniformity. In Criminal Case Nos. 14-11713 and 14-11714, instead of Rape by Sexual Assault, HHH should be held liable for Sexual Assault under Article 266-A (2) of RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. (R.A.) 7610.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> In <i>People v.

No. 7610"</b> and no longer "Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610," because sexual assault as a form of acts of lasciviousness is no longer covered by Article 336 but by Article 266-A (2) of the RPC, as amended by R.A. No. 8353. Nevertheless, the imposable penalty is still reclusion temporal in its medium period, and not prision mayor <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>The reliance of the RTC and the CA in the testimony of AAA was proper as it was clear and categorical. Her claim was also supported by the Medico-Legal Report74 prepared by Dr. Nae Ann V. Mandal (Dr. Mandal) who conducted a physical examination on AAA, the pertinent portion of which states:<br><blockquote>Circular abrasion, 1 x lcm cheek left.<br>Tanner stage 1 breast.<br>Tanner stage 1 external genitalia hair distribution.<br>GENIALIA: Labia minora erythematous.<br>Cervical&nbsp; laceration,&nbsp;&nbsp; incomplete&nbsp; healed&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 o'clock,<br>6 o'clock, 3 o'clock, and 9 o'clock position.

Dr. Mandal also confirmed that the cervical laceration she noted could have been caused by a foreign object such as a finger, a penis or any hard object.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>From the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, the elements of the crime of statutory rape under Article 266-A of the RPC. Statutory rape is committed when: (1) the offended party is under 12 years of age; and (2) the accused had carnal knowledge of her, regardless of whether there was force, threat or intimidation, whether the victim was deprived of reason or consciousness, or whether it was done through fraud or grave abuse of authority. It is termed Statutory Rape as it departs from the usual modes of committing rape. The law presumes that the victim does not and cannot have a will of her own on account of her tender years. What the law punishes in Statutory Rape is carnal knowledge of a woman below 12 years old. Thus, force, intimidation, and physical evidence of injury are not relevant considerations; the only pertinent concern is the age of the woman and whether carnal knowledge indeed took place.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, the following are the elements of Rape by Sexual Assault under Article 266-A(2) of the RPC:<br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the offender commits an act of sexual assault;<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; That the act of sexual assault is committed by any of the following means:<br><blockquote>(a)&nbsp; By inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice; or<br><br><b>(b)&nbsp; By inserting any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person;</b><br></blockquote>(3) That the act of sexual assault is accomplished under any of the following circumstances:<br><blockquote>(a) By using force and intimidation;<br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or<br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; or<br>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>When the woman is under 12 years of age</b> or demented.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote>All the foregoing elements for the offenses charged against HHH were proven beyond reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding her youth and innocence, AAA was able to narrate in detail her traumatic experience in the hands of HHH who ravished and sexually molested her. She convincingly recounted her harrowing experience on May 13, 2014. At 7:00 a.m., HHH he made her lie on a mat, instructed her to hold his penis and threatened to burn her face with a cigarette if she did not follow. When she refused to obey him, HHH used a cigarette to burn her left cheek. When AAA refused again to hold HHH's penis, he spanked her with a thick wood. HHH made her lie on her stomach. Thereafter, he inserted his penis in the anal orifice of AAA and licked her vagina. At around 12:00 p.m. on May 13, 2014, HHH again instructed AAA to hold his penis. AAA did as instructed for fear that HHH would hurt her again. She held his penis tightly as instructed. He then held AAA's hands while holding his penis to masturbate. After semen came out of his penis, he inserted his penis into AAA's vagina. Before HHH left the house at around 7:00 p.m., he again instructed AAA to clean the room. While inside the room, HHH told AAA to lie down and inserted his fingers inside her vagina.<br><br><i><b>The prosecution established HHH's <br>guilt beyond reasonable doubt in <br>Criminal Case Nos. 14-12400, and <br>14-12401 for two counts of Statutory <br>Rape. [BBB complaint/</b></i><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 14-12400 and 14-12401, the prosecution was able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that HHH had carnal knowledge of BBB on two incidents in 2009, when BBB was just 10 years old. BBB convincingly relayed how HHH molested her. BBB's testimony is further bolstered by the findings of Dr. Caranto, which confirmed the injuries she sustained. Dr. Caranto's report stated:<br><blockquote>SKIN:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (-) Bite marks.<br>HEENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A traumatic.<br>CHEST/ LUNHGS: SCE, CBS<br>HEART:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (-) murmur<br>ABDOMEN:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flat non-tender<br>GENITALIA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal: (+) Abrasion all over vaginal canal<br>(-) Hymen<br>EXTERNAL:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanner tage 1<br>EXTREMITIES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No bipedal edema <br>BREADT (sic):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanner stage 1.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup></blockquote><u><i><b>The testimonies of the private <br>complainants are not doubtful <br>despite the fact that they continued to <br>live with HHH after the first incident <br>of abuse.</b></i></u><br><br>The fact that HHH's daughters continued to live with him after the alleged incidents of abuse should not be taken against them. It must be remembered that no child has equal power to say 'no' to a parental figure and understand the consequences of sexual involvement with an adult. The threat of loss of family security may be more frightening to a child than the threat of violence.<br><br>More importantly, it is settled that testimonies of child victims are given full weight and credit, because when a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.81 It is incredible to believe that HHH's daughters would concoct a story that would send their father to jail, allow an examination of their private parts, and permit themselves to be subjected to a public trial, unless they are motivated solely by the desire to have their own father punished for his transgressions.<br><br>To Our mind, the positive and categorical testimonies of AAA and BBB are consistent with the other pieces of evidence presented by the prosecution to prove the abuse they suffered in the hands of their father. When a rape victim's testimony is straightforward and candid, unshaken by rigid cross-examination and unflawed by inconsistencies or contradictions in its material points, the same must be given full faith and credit.<br><br>Although it is admitted that HHH and his family shared a house with other families, this fact did not make it impossible for the crimes to be committed. The Court has recognized that many incidents of rape were not always committed in secluded places. As aptly stated by the Court, "lust is no respecter of time or place, and rape defies constraints of time and space."82<br><br><u><b><i>Imposable Penalties &amp; Damages</i></b></u><br><br>It must be clarified that, while HHH admitted and it was proven during trial that he is the father of AAA, BBB, and CCC, the qualifying circumstance of relationship cannot be appreciated by the Court. Section 8, Rule 110 of the Rules expressly require that:<br><blockquote>Section 8. <i>Designation of the offense.</i> - The complaint or information shall state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and <u>specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances. </u>If there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it. (Emphasis and italics in the original; underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Accordingly, even if established during trial, the qualifying circumstance of relationship cannot affect the penalty to be imposed on HHH. He cannot be convicted of the graver offense of qualified rape, although proven, because relationship was neither alleged nor necessarily included in the six Informations filed against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>The lower courts committed error in applying <i>prision mayor,</i> as stated in Article 266-B of the RPC, in ascertaining the indeterminate penalty to be imposed on HHH for the two counts of Sexual Assault under Article 266-A(2) of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610 in Criminal Case Nos. 14-11713, 14-11714 and 14-12402. In Franco y <i>Eslaban v. People</i><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[84]</sup></font>, the Court explained:<br><blockquote>In the case of <i>People of the Philippines v.

Thus, it is settled that the imposable penalty for Sexual Assault under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610 is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period. HHH, who is found guilty of sexual assault committed against a child below 12 years of age in Criminal Case Nos. 14-11713, 14-11714 and 14-12402, shall suffer the higher penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period, as provided for in Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. 7610.<br><br>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum term shall be taken from the medium period of reclusion temporal in its medium period, which is 15 years, 6 months and 20 days to 16 years, 5 months and 9 days; while the minimum term is within the range of the penalty next lower than that prescribed by law, which is 12 years and 1 day to 14 years and 8 months of reclusion temporal in its minimum period. Accordingly, in Criminal Case Nos. 14-11713 and 14-11714, HHH is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty ranging from 14 years and 8 months of <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its minimum period, as minimum, to 16 years, 5 months and 9 days of reclusion temporal in its medium period, as maximum.<br><br>In Criminal Case Nos. 14-11715, 14-12400, and 14-12401 for Rape under Article 266-A(l) in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC, We affirm that HHH should suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua in accordance with paragraph 1 (d), Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended by R.A. 8353.<br><br>In accordance with the Court's ruling in <i>People v.
