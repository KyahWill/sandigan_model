He was the registered owner of a property located at Pacita Complex II, Phase I, Blk 17, Lot 12, San Pedro, Laguna covered by TCT No. T-264547. He acquired it through a GSIS real estate loan and paid it through salary deductions for fifteen (15) years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On June 24, 1993, Danilo went to their house in Tacloban City and forced him and Dominga to sign a Deed of Absolute Sale. They initially refused because the property was intended for Danilo's siblings for their eventual study in Manila. Because of his refusal, Danilo angrily shouted and threw a briefcase at him but missed. Out of fear, he and Dominga signed the Deed even without receiving any payment as consideration. When he was able to secure a copy of the Deed in 2002, he noted that the acknowledgment portion falsely stated that he personally appeared before a notary in Makati City on July 14, 1993. This was physically impossible since he reported for work at the GSIS-Tacloban City that day.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In 2002, he learned that Danilo and his wife respondent Alice Viovicente were able to transfer the property to their names and were issued TCT-356656 through a fictitious Deed of Absolute Sale dated December 14, 1995. He denied ever signing it. As with the Deed of Sale dated June 24, 1993, he too denied personally appearing before a notary public in Makati where the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995 was supposedly executed. The GSIS-Tacloban City certified that he reported for work that day.<br><br>Hence, he and Dominga filed the Complaint dated January 20, 2003<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> for reconveyance of property, nullity of the supposed sale of real property, and cancellation of TCT No. T-356656 issued in the names of Danilo and his wife.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><b>Dominga Viovicente</b> corroborated Teodorico's testimony. Danilo forced them to sign the Deed of Sale dated June 24, 1993 in Tacloban, City, shouting <i>"pirma, pirma, unsa dili mo pirma"</i> before throwing a briefcase at Teodorico. They were not able to read the contents of the document they signed because Danilo did not allow them. She confirmed that they did not receive any consideration for the sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><i><b><i>Respondents' Version</i></b></i><br><br><b>Danilo Viovicente</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> denied using force and intimidation to obtain his parents' signature on the Deed of Sale dated June 24, 1993. He testified that sometime in 1983, Teodorico commented that it would be convenient to have a house in Manila where his siblings could stay. He initially dismissed the idea for lack of funds. Teodorico then suggested that he (Teodorico) could apply for a loan to cover the downpayment while he (Danilo) would be in charge of paying the amortizations; and upon full payment thereof, Teodorico would convey the property to him. He agreed to this arrangement.<br><br>Though reluctant at first, Teodorico signed the Deed of Sale dated June 24, 1993 after he (Danilo) assured him that the property could still be used by his siblings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> To facilitate the transfer of the property to his name, he gave the Deed of Sale dated June 24, 1993 to his brother Phio who executed an identical Deed to avoid paying surcharges and penalties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Before petitioners filed the complaint, their family had a meeting where Teodorico told him to reconvey the property, claiming he was coerced into signing the Deed on June 23, 1993.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>GSIS Chief of the Accounts Administrative Division <b>Gavino B. Gagarin</b> testified that Teodorico's timecards from 1993 to 1995 and daily time records for the period covering January to August 1992 were all unsigned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>NBI Senior Document Examiner <b>Noel Cruz</b> testified that Teodorico's signatures on the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995 and in the other documents<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> submitted for examination were written by one and the same person. He noted however the <i>"snopaked"</i> entries in the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995, with the figure <b>'5'</b> superimposed on <b>'3'</b> and concluded that the Deed was actually executed in 1993.<br><br><b><i>The Trial Court's Ruling</i></b><br><br>By Amended Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated July 16, 2010, the trial court ruled in petitioners' favor, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of plaintiffs and against defendants hereby directing defendants to reconvey to plaintiffs the property originally covered by Transfer Certificate of Title T-356656; declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale dated June 24, 1993 as null and void; and directing the Register of Deeds of Calamba, Laguna to cancel Transfer Certificate of Title T-356656 issued in the name of defendant Danilo L.

Viovicente.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br><br>According to the trial court, the Deed of Sale dated June 24, 1993 was devoid of any consideration because petitioners were merely forced to sign it. There was simply no evidence to establish Danilo's supposed arrangement with Teodorico.<br><br>As for the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995, petitioners categorically denied having executed the same. Worse, the NBI even noted the <i>"snopake"</i> deletions and concluded that there was actually no Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995; it was actually the same Deed of Sale dated June 24, 1993 with altered entries.<br><br><center><b>The Proceedings before the Court of Appeals</b></center><br><br>On appeal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> respondents faulted the trial court for holding that the sale was void for want of consideration and that petitioners were merely coerced to sign the Deed of Sale dated June 24, 1993. Respondents pointed out that the trial court's findings were based exclusively on petitioners' allegations and evidence, totally disregarding in the process their own evidence.<br><br>Too, the trial court erred when it held that the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995 was executed sans any consideration, the same being in clear violation of the Parole Evidence Rule.<br><br>The Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995 bore the unequivocal acknowledgment that Teodorico appeared before Notary Public Atty. Fallar. At any rate, even granting for the sake of argument that Teodorico did not appear before the notary public, such defect did not affect the validity of the instrument.<br><br>Petitioners,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> on the other hand, countered that the trial court could not have considered respondents' evidence because their counsel failed to make a formal offer thereof. They emphasized that there was only one (1) Deed of Sale, not two (2). The only existing Deed of Sale bore the date <b>June 24, 1993</b> which they were forced to sign without receiving any consideration from respondents. This was confirmed by respondents' own witness, NBI Document Examiner Cruz who opined that there was actually no Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995; it was the same Deed of Sale dated June 24, 1993 with altered entries. They presented a GSIS Certification stating that Teodorico reported for work on December 14, 1995, the date when the deed was supposedly executed and notarized.<br><br><center><b>The Court of Appeals' Ruling</b></center><br><br>By Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated May 20, 2014, the Court of Appeals reversed. It found that the cancellation of TCT No. 264547 was not based on the Deed of Sale dated June 24, 1993 but on the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995. Petitioners failed to overthrow the presumption that this Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995 was actually executed and the consequent Torrens title, issued with regularity. Petitioners' assertion that the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995 was forged was unsubstantiated. Lastly, the action for reconveyance had already prescribed because TCT No. 356656 was issued on January 16, 1996 while the action was only filed in 2003.<br><br>Petitioners moved for reconsideration which the Court of Appeals denied by Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated June 18, 2015.<br><br><center><b>The Present Petition</b></center><br><br>Petitioners now seek<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> affirmative relief from the Court and pray that the assailed dispositions of the Court of Appeals be reversed and a new one rendered upholding the trial court's Amended Decision dated July 6, 2010.<br><br>Petitioners essentially argue:<br><br><b>First,</b> there was actually only one (1) document signed in 1993 for which they did not receive any consideration.<br><br><b>Second,</b> the Court of Appeals erred when it ruled that the notarized Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995 enjoyed the presumption of due execution since that instrument was not even formally offered in evidence by respondents. At any rate, the aforesaid presumption was sufficiently overturned in view of the apparent alterations on the face of the instrument itself.<br><br><b>Third,</b> the presumption of validity of Torrens Title does not apply to the simulated Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995 intended as it was to evade payment of taxes. Respondents' own witness testified that the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995 and the Deed of Sale dated June 24, 1993 were one and the same, except that the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995 now carried a superimposed number 5 (1995) over number 3 (1993). The allegation of forgery, therefore, was clearly established.<br><br><b>Lastly,</b> the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the action for reconveyance here already prescribed four (4) years after petitioners discovered the fraud attendant to the execution of the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995.<br><br>In their Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> respondents riposte that the element of fraud was never proven because TCT No. 256656 was issued by virtue of the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995 and petitioners' signatures thereon were genuine. Too, it had a valid consideration of Php111,180.00. It enjoys the presumption of due execution of a public document just as their Torrens title enjoys the presumption of regularity in its issuance. Lastly, the Court of Appeals correctly held that petitioners' action for reconveyance had already prescribed.<br><br><center><b>Threshold Issues</b></center><br><br><blockquote><b>First.</b> Are petitioners' causes of action barred by prescription? <br><b>Second.</b> Was there a valid conveyance of subject property in favor of respondents?<br></blockquote></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, jurisdiction is generally limited to the review of errors of law committed by the appellate court. The Supreme Court is not obliged to review all over again the evidence which the parties adduced in the court <i>a quo</i>. The general rule though admits of exceptions, one of which is when the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and the trial court are conflicting or contradictory,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> as in this case.<br><br><i><b>Petitioners' action for nullity of a<br>spurious deed sale is imprescriptible</b></i><br><br>The elementary rule is that the allegations in the complaint determine the cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Here, the complaint below clearly alleged an action for reconveyance of property based on null deed of sale, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>12. <b><i>There was no consideration for the alleged sale of the PROPERTY from plaintiffs to DANILO. There was never any agreement for the price of an alleged sale.</i></b> In the Deed of Absolute Sale that <b>DANILO</b> coerced plaintiffs to sign, it says there that plaintiffs sold the <b>PROPERTY</b> to <b>DANILO</b> for P111,180.00 which plaintiffs allegedly received to their entire satisfaction. <b><i>This is absolutely untrue. This is an insult to plaintiffs whom DANILO, by this absolutely simulated contract, are treating plaintiffs like useless people with very little intelligence. What hurts plaintiffs more is that DANILO has floated the idea that plaintiffs were constant beggars to hint in the past.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx</center><br>16. Thus, judgment should be rendered declaring the alleged sale of the <b>PROPERTY</b> to <b>DANILO</b> void for absence of consideration, ordering the defendant <b>REGISTER OF CALAMBA, LAGUNA,</b> to cancel Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-356656 issued in the name of defendant <b>DANILO </b>and to issue a new transfer certificate of title on the <b>PROPERTY</b> in the name of plaintiff <b>TEODORICO M. VIOVICENTE</b> married to <b>DOMING[A] L. VIOVICENTE</b>.<br><br><center><b>PRAYER</b><br></center><br>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that judgment be rendered declaring the alleged sale of the <b>PROPERTY</b> to <b>DANILO</b> void for absence of consideration, ordering the defendant <b>REGISTER OF CALAMBA, LAGUNA</b>, to cancel Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-356656 issued in the name of defendant <b>DANILO</b> and to issue a new transfer certificate of title on the <b>PROPERTY</b> in the name in the name of plaintiff <b>TEODORICO M. VIOVICENTE</b> married to <b>DOMING [A] L. VIOVICENTE</b>.<br><br>Other reliefs just and equitable under the premises are likewise prayed for.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Verily, petitioners invariably alleged that they did not receive any consideration from respondents relative to the sale of the property, rendering it void.<br><br>Further, during the trial, petitioners consistently denied signing the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995, let alone, appearing before the notary public to acknowledge it as their voluntary act. Hence, the purported deed is spurious and consequently, void. The trial court delved on this issue without so much as an objection from respondents. Pursuant to Rule 10, Section 5 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, therefore, the matter may be treated as though it had been raised in the pleadings. The rule pertinently states:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 5.</b> <i>Amendment to conform to or authorize presentation of evidence.</i> — <b>When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried with the express or implied consent of the parties they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.</b> Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; <b>but failure to amend does not effect the result of the trial of these issues.</b> If evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so with liberality if the presentation of the merits of the action and the ends of substantial justice will be subserved thereby. The court may grant a continuance to enable the amendment to be made. (emphases added)</blockquote><br><br>But whether petitioners hinge their complaint on the alleged lack or absence of consideration or the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995 being spurious, the result would still be the same – petitioners' cause or causes of action had not prescribed. Article 1410 of the Civil Code ordains:<br><br><blockquote><b>Article 1410.</b> The action or defense for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract does not prescribe.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br>In <b><i>Santos v. Heirs of Lustre</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the complaint alleged that the deed of sale was simulated. There, the Court ruled that the action for reconveyance on the ground that the certificate of title was obtained by means of a fictitious deed of sale is virtually an action for the declaration of its nullity, which does not prescribe.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, therefore, erred in ruling that petitioners' cause of action had already prescribed, using <b><i>D.B.T. Mar-Bay Construction, Inc. v. Panes</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> where the Court decreed:<br><br><blockquote>When an action for reconveyance is based on fraud, it must be filed within four (4) years from discovery of the fraud, and such discovery is deemed to have taken place from the issuance of the original certificate of title.</blockquote><br><br><b><i>A forged or spurious Deed<br>cannot be the source of ownership.</i></b><br><br>As it was, petitioners sought the cancellation of respondents' TCT No. T-356656. It was issued based on the Deed of Absolute Sale dated December 14, 1995 supposedly executed by petitioners in favor of respondents. But as records clearly show, the Deed of Absolute Sale dated December 14, 1995 was a forged or spurious document. Consider:<br><br><b>First</b>.

However, since Phio was not able to process the transfer within the reglementary period, and processing it thereafter would mean paying surcharges and penalties on the taxes, Phio printed an identical deed, except the date, caused this second deed to be signed by Plaintiffs, had it notarized, and eventually processed the transfer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Since the Deed of Sale dated December 14, 1995 was Phio's own making, there was, therefore, no actual sale of subject property made on said date by the real owners herein petitioners Spouses Teodorico and Dominga Viovicente.<br><br><b>Third.</b> Teodorico categorically denied having signed the said deed and was able to prove that it was physically impossible for him to personally appear before the Notary Public in Makati City for its notarization on December 14, 1995:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">CONTINUATION OF DIRECT<br> EXAMINATION BY<br> ATTY.
