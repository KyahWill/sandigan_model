				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Courts must strictly scrutinize violations of Republic Act No. 9165 when only minuscule amounts of dangerous drugs were seized from the accused. Additionally, in assessing the prosecution's evidence, courts should include the scale of operations and the government unit involved in an anti-narcotics operation. If the amount of drugs seized is disproportionate to the scale of operations, courts should not readily rely on the presumption of regularity accorded to the arresting and seizing officers.<br><br>This Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assailing the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Regional Trial Court Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> finding Juandom Palencia y De Asis (Palencia) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of possessing dangerous drugs, punished under Section 11 of Republic Act No. 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.<br><br>On April 22, 2008, Palencia was charged with possession of dangerous drugs. The accusatory portion of the Information against him reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 21<sup>st</sup> day of April, 2008, in the City of Dumaguete, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, not being then authorized by law, did, then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously possess one (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing 0.01 gram of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride, otherwise known as "SHABU", a dangerous drug.<br><br>Contrary to Sec. 11, Art. II of R.A. 9165.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Upon arraignment, Palencia pleaded not guilty to the charge against him. After pre-trial had been terminated, trial soon ensued.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The prosecution evidence showed that on the morning of April 21, 2008, officers of the National Bureau of Investigation received information about the rampant sale of illegal drugs near Chicos in Zone 4, Barangay Looc, Dumaguete City. That same day, a team of law enforcers was formed to conduct an anti-narcotics operation in the tipped site.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The team included Special Investigator Nicanor Tagle (SI Tagle) and two Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency agents, Senior Police Officer 1 Allen June Germodo (SPO1 Germodo) and PO2 Glenn Corsame (PO2 Corsame).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>At around 10:50 a.m., the team proceeded to Zone 4 with the volunteer assets.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The team began walking along two parallel alleys that led to the beach while PO2 Corsame paused to park his motorcycle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On their way, SI Tagle, SPO1 Germodo, and the assets saw a man walking toward their direction, his head bowed down as he looked at the plastic sachets he was holding in his left hand. They would later identify the man as Palencia.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>When Palencia looked up and saw the officers, he tried to run away, but SI Tagle and SPO1 Germodo caught him and tried to restrain him. Palencia struggled to escape from the officers' grasp and when he was able to free his left hand, he popped the sachets in his hand to his mouth and managed to swallow them. As the struggle continued, however, one of the sachets fell from his mouth and dropped to the ground.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>With the rest of the team's help, the officers were able to fully restrain Palencia. SI Tagle then picked up the sachet Palencia dropped. He also informed Palencia of his constitutional rights in both English and Visayan and the reason for his arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> As SPO1 Germodo handcuffed Palencia, SI Tagle marked the sachet by putting a piece of masking tape<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> on it and writing "JP"-P 4-21-08 on the tape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The arresting officers moved about eight meters away from the arrest site and positioned themselves near the highway. After about 10 minutes,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the seized sachet was inventoried<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> in the presence of Neil Rio (Rio),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> a news reporter, Ramonito Astillero (Astillero),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> a representative from the Department of Justice, and Merlindo Tamayo (Tamayo),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> a barangay kagawad. SPO1 Germodo took pictures.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Rio confirmed that he saw the marked sachet and signed the inventory sheet; however, he admitted that he did not witness the arrest and was only present during the inventory after being called by SPO1 Germodo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Tamayo likewise testified that he did not see the actual arrest but that he only went to the inventory after being informed of the arrest. Nonetheless, he declared that he saw a marked sachet, which was why he signed the inventory sheet.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Astillero, meanwhile, testified that he saw a marked sachet during the inventory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>After the inventory, the officers brought Palencia to the National Bureau of Investigation office where PO2 Corsame recorded the arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> SI Tagle then prepared a transmittal letter and letter request for an examination of the recovered sachet and a drug test on Palencia. Afterward, he brought the documents and the marked sachet to the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory and handed them to Police Chief Inspector Josephine S. Llena (Chief Inspector Llena).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Upon examination, Chief Inspector Llena reported that the specimen tested positive for shabu. She then resealed the sachet and, on the seal, wrote A D-072-08.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Chemistry Report No. D-072-08<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> reads in part:<br><br><blockquote>SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:<br><ol type="A"><li>One (1) heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet with markings "JP-P" 4-21-08 containing 0.01 gram of white crystalline substance.<br></li></ol><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx</center><br>PURPOSE OF LABORATORY EXAMINATION:<br><br>To determine the presence of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165.<br><br>FINDINGS:<br><br>Qualitative examination conducted on specimen A gave <b>POSITIVE </b>result to the tests for <b>Methamphetamine Hydrochloride</b>, a dangerous drug under RA 9165.<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx</center><br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br>Specimen A contains <b>Methamphetamine Hydrochloride</b>, a dangerous drug under RA 9165.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br><br>The defense presented Palencia and his sisters, Jessica Guerrero (Guerrero) and Jingle Lugo (Lugo), as its witnesses.<br><br>Palencia testified that on the day he was arrested, he and Guerrero were on their way to Zone 3 to sell <i>"bihag,"</i> or "the meat of a dead fighting cock." On their way, somebody flagged them down and bought the two pieces of <i>bihag</i> they carried for P100.00 each.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>After the sale, Palencia and Guerrero walked toward the main road on their way home. At that moment, they saw several persons being chased by another group of men who wielded guns. Unable to chase them, one of the armed men, whom Palencia would later discover to be SI Tagle, stopped running and turned on the siblings instead. The officer grabbed Palencia's arm and pointed the gun to his head.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Together with his companions, SI Tagle patted down Palencia and emptied his pockets, where they found his cellphone and the proceeds from the <i>bihag</i> sale. Two men held down Palencia while SI Tagle repeatedly punched him in his chest and stomach. After the officer had finished and walked away, his companions handcuffed Palencia.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>When SI Tagle returned minutes later, he bent down in front of Palencia as if to pick something up. When he stood, he had a plastic sachet in his hand, which prompted Palencia to shout, "Planting! Planting!"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Palencia denied that he was informed of his constitutional rights during his arrest, or that PO2 Corsame and SPO1 Germodo were with SI Tagle when he was arrested. He likewise denied that an inventory was conducted at the place of his arrest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Guerrero corroborated her brother's testimony.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> She added that while her brother was being mauled and handcuffed, she was "crying and trembling," terrified of what was happening.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Guerrero also testified that after her brother had been handcuffed,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the men brought him to the side of the road, made him sit on a stool, and investigated him without a lawyer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Afterward, they made him board a car and brought him to the National Bureau of Investigation office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Lugo testified that Guerrero texted her of Palencia's arrest immediately after it happened. Thus, she went to the National Bureau of Investigation office to check on his brother. When she talked to him, he denied possessing shabu and claimed that the officers had mauled him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Lugo also testified that her brother was later transferred to the police station jail. When she visited him about three days after his arrest, she saw that he had large bruises on his chest. She gave him pain reliever and advised him not to undergo medical examination because this might only encourage the officers to gang up on him once more.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>On October 24, 2011, the Regional Trial Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> found Palencia guilty beyond reasonable doubt of illegally possessing a dangerous drug.<br><br>The Regional Trial Court found that the prosecution was able to establish that Palencia was caught possessing a sachet of shabu. It emphasized that the police officers were justified in making a warrantless seizure under the plain view doctrine because Palencia was caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i> with what appeared to be a sachet of dangerous drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The Regional Trial Court then brushed aside Palencia's "inherently weak defense" of denial or frame-up, made even weaker with the prosecution witnesses' positive identification of Palencia. It also pointed out that Palencia failed to show that the arresting officers had ill motive to testify against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The Regional Trial Court likewise punctuated that the arresting officers enjoyed the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duty.

It states:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<br><br>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government.</blockquote><br><br>Judicial review of the constitutionality of a statute is not limited to an action "for declaratory relief" and may be sought through any of the cognizable actions by courts of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>However, for the court to exercise its power of judicial review, the constitutional issue "(a) must be properly raised and presented in the case, and (b) its resolution is necessary to a determination of the case, i.e., the issue of constitutionality must be the very <i>lis mota</i> presented."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Thus, a court will only pass upon the constitutionality of a statute "to the extent that, it is directly and necessarily involved in a justiciable controversy and is essential to the protection of the rights of the parties concerned."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> This is called the constitutional policy of avoidance.<br><br>Additionally, the issue of a statute's constitutionality can only be assailed through a direct attack, with the purported unconstitutionality pleaded directly before the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> <i>San Miguel Brewery, Inc. v.

In resolving the pending incidents of the motion to transfer and motion to quash, the trial court should not have allowed petitioners to collaterally attack the validity of A.O. Nos. 113-95 and 104-96. We have ruled time and again that the constitutionality or validity of laws, orders, or such other rules with the force of law cannot be attacked collaterally. There is a legal presumption of validity of these laws and rules. Unless a law or rule is annulled in a direct proceeding, the legal presumption of its validity stands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br><br>This was reiterated in <i>Vivas v. The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> where this Court stated:<br><br><blockquote>Preliminarily, Vivas' attempt to assail the constitutionality of Section 30 of R.A. No. 7653 constitutes collateral attack on the said provision of law. Nothing is more settled than the rule that the constitutionality of a statute cannot be collaterally attacked as constitutionality issues must be pleaded directly and not collaterally. A collateral attack on a presumably valid law is not permissible. Unless a law or rule is annulled in a direct proceeding, the legal presumption of its validity stands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>It is likewise well established that a challenge to a statute's constitutionality "must be raised at the earliest opportunity.”<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Nonetheless, <i>San Miguel Brewery</i> noted that in a criminal case, the constitutionality of a statute "may be raised at any stage of the proceedings," even on appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Finally, a legal presumption exists that an enacted law is valid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Thus, if the controversy on the constitutionality of a statute can be settled on other grounds, this Court stays its hand from ruling on the constitutional issue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> The policy of constitutional avoidance finds its genesis in a concurring opinion on the United States case of <i>Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> In his concurrence, Justice Louis Brandeis set forth the seven pillars of limitations of judicial review:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of legislation n a friendly, non-adversary proceeding, declining because to decide such questions "is legitimate only in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest and vital controversy between individuals. It never was the thought that, by means of a friendly suit, a party beaten in the legislature could transfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the legislative act."<br><br></li><li>The Court will not "anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it." "It is not the habit of the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case."<br><br></li><li>The Court will not "formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied."<br><br></li><li>The Court will not pass upon a constitutional question, although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of. This rule has found most varied application. Thus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law, the Court will decide only the latter. Appeals from the highest court of a state challenging its decision of a question under the Federal Constitution are frequently dismissed because the judgment can be sustained on an independent state ground.<br><br></li><li>The Court will not pass upon the validity of a statute upon complaint of one who fails to show that he is injured by its operation. Among the many applications of this rule, none is more striking than the denial of the right of challenge to one who lacks a personal or property right. Thus, the challenge by a public official interested only in the performance of his official duty will not be entertained. In <i>Fairchild v. Hughes</i>, the Court affirmed the dismissal of a suit brought by a citizen who sought to have the Nineteenth Amendment declared unconstitutional. In <i>Massachusetts v. Mellon</i>, the challenge of the federal Maternity Act was not entertained, although made by the Commonwealth on behalf of all its citizens.<br><br></li><li>The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits.<br><br></li><li>"When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (Citations omitted)</li></ol></blockquote><br><br>These rules of avoidance were then summarized in <i>Francisco, Jr. v. House of Representatives</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> as follows:<br><br><blockquote>The foregoing "pillars" of limitation of judicial review, summarized in <i>Ashwander v. TVA</i> from different decisions of the United States Supreme Court, can be encapsulated into the following categories:<br><br><ol><li>that there be absolute necessity of deciding a case<br></li><li>that rules of constitutional law shall be formulated only as required by the facts of the case<br></li><li>that judgment may not be sustained on some other ground<br></li><li>that there be actual injury sustained by the party by reason of the operation of the statute<br></li><li>that the parties are not in <i>estoppel</i><br></li><li>that the Court upholds the presumption of constitutionality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</li></ol></blockquote><br><br>Here, it is of no moment that petitioner only raised the issue of constitutionality for the first time on appeal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> as it was still properly and timely raised in a direct action. However, delving into the constitutionality of the assailed provisions of the law and implementing rules is not essential to the disposition of the case. It can still be resolved in favor of petitioner on other grounds without resorting to a review of the law.<br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br><br>The inviolability of a person's right against unreasonable searches and seizures finds its mooring in Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. It provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 2. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and for any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant arid the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote><br><br>The general rule is that a judicial warrant is needed before a search and seizure may be carried out. Without it, the search and seizure would violate the Constitution and any evidence gathered from it "shall be inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the constitutional prohibition only encompasses <i>unreasonable</i> searches and seizures. In fact, this Court has recognized several instances of reasonable warrantless searches and seizures:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li><i>Warrantless search incidental to a lawful arrest</i> recognized under Section 12, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court and by prevailing jurisprudence;<br></li><li>Seizure of evidence in "plain view," the elements of which are:<br><blockquote>(a) a prior valid intrusion based on the valid warrantless arrest in which the police are legally present in the pursuit of their official duties;<br>(b) the evidence was inadvertently discovered by the police who had the right to be where they are;<br>(c) the evidence must be immediately apparent, and<br>(d) "plain view" justified mere seizure of evidence without further search;</blockquote><br></li><li>Search of a moving vehicle.

That is, law enforcers should be given the legal arsenal to prevent the commission of offenses. However, this should be balanced with the need to protect the privacy of citizens in accordance with Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution.<br><br>The balance lies in the concept of "suspiciousness" present in the situation where the police officer finds himself or herself in. This may be undoubtedly based on the experience of the police officer. Experienced police officers have personal experience dealing with criminals and criminal behavior. Hence, they should have the ability to discern — based on facts that they themselves observe — whether an individual is acting in a suspicious manner.

While they are certainly a bane to our society, small retailers are but low-lying fruits in an exceedingly vast network of drug cartels. Both law enforcers and prosecutors should realize that the more effective and efficient strategy is to focus resources more on the source and true leadership of these nefarious organizations. Otherwise, all these executive and judicial resources expended to attempt to convict an accused for 0.05 gram of shabu under doubtful custodial arrangements will hardly make a dent in the overall picture.

The inequality in our prisons is underscored by the numerous arrests on the retail side. We cannot continue hoping to reduce the drug menace by merely focusing most of our resources on small fry. By combining the full force of the law with our vast government resources, we should be able to successfully target the source of illegal drugs and dismantle its widespread network to finally rid our society of its pernicious effects.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Court of Appeals' November 25, 2014 Decision and June 23, 2015 Resolution in CA-G.R.
