Per the <i>rollo</i>, it appears that all criminal charges against him has been dismissed <i>except</i> for the most recent one filed in 2019. The timing of the filing of this case, however, is highly suspect as it came just as the other criminal charges against respondent were dismissed on June 28, 2018,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> January 4, 2019,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and October 15, 2019.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Thus, it can no longer be denied that the manifest intention of complainant in successively filing these criminal cases against respondent is to prevent him from taking the Lawyer's Oath and signing the Roll of Attorneys—the last two steps needed to be undertaken by respondent to become a full-fledged lawyer. </p> <p> The dismissal of all the other criminal charges against respondent, coupled with the various certifications of good moral character in his favor, is sufficient for the Court to conclude that respondent possesses the moral qualifications required of lawyers. Though it is true that the practice of law is not a right but a privilege, the Court will not unjustifiably withhold this privilege from respondent, who has clearly shown that he is both intellectually and morally qualified to join the legal profession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> And so, after almost six years of waiting, the Court finally grants respondent's prayer for admission to the Philippine Bar. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court resolves to: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify"><b>NOTE</b> the Letter dated January 19, 2020 and the Report dated January 21, 2020 of the Office of the Bar Confidant; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b) </div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>ALLOW</b> Anthony de Zuzuarregui to take the Lawyer's Oath and sign the Roll of Attorneys on a date set by the Court and upon payment of the appropriate legal fees, if any. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Complainant Enrique Javier de Zuzuarregui and his counsel, Atty.
