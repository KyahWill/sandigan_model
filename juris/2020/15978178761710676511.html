He asked the men who they were looking tor. The men, whom he later identified as "Genova" and PO1 Julaton, asked who he was. He replied and identified himself as Boy Sebilleno. PO1 Julaton allegedly pointed a gun at him and forced him to say that he was "Boy Trolly." Sebilleno refused, and was subsequently hit in the stomach with PO1 Julaton's gun.

It avers that the testimonies of PO1 Julaton and PO1 Ocampo duly established the chain of custody, hence, the seized drug from the accused was the same drug presented in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> It claims that failure to present the concerned forensic chemist is immaterial since the Chemistry Report yielded positive results for <u>shabu</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The Solicitor General justifies the Police officers' conduct of the inventory in the Police station rather than at the place of arrest, since "the apprehending team would be putting their lives in peril considering that the area where the buy-bust operation was conducted is a notorious Muslim community."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>For this Court's resolution is the lone issue of whether or not accused-­appellant Gilbert Sebilleno y Casabar is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Article 11, Section 5 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act.<br><br>This Court grants the appeal and acquits accused-appellant.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>The elements to sustain convictions for violation of Section 5 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, or the illegal sale of dangerous drugs are "(1) proof that the transaction or sale took place and (2) the presentation in court of the <i>corpus delicti</i> or the illicit drug as evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The prosecution must prove with moral certainty the <i>corpus delicti</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><blockquote>It is of paramount importance that the existence of the drug, the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime, be established beyond doubt. Its identity and integrity must he proven to have been safeguarded. Aside from proving the elements of the charges, the fact that the substance illegally possessed and sold was the same substance offered in court as exhibit must likewise be established with the same degree of certitude as that needed to sustain a guilty verdict. The chain of custody carries out this purpose as it ensures that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence are removed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Contrary to the Solicitor General's position, the Police officers' testimonies are not enough to prove that the confiscated item from the accused was the same drug presented in court. <i>Mallilin v.

The Court cannot reluctantly close its eyes to the likelihood, or at least the possibility. that at any of the links in the chain of custody over the same there could have been tampering, alteration or substitution of substances from other cases - by accident or otherwise - in which similar evidence was seized or in which similar evidence was submitted for laboratory testing. Hence, in authenticating the same, <b><i>a standard more stringent than that applied to cases involving objects which are readily identifiable must be applied, a more exacting standard that entails a chain of custody of the item with sufficient completeness if only to render it improbable that the original item has either been exchanged with another or been contaminated or tampered with</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The nature of narcotic substances necessarily entails heightened scrutiny.

As to where, it depends on whether the seizure was supported by a search warrant.

Jurisprudence requires that the Police officer who received the articles in the laboratory testify in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Neither does the Chemistry Report suffice.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>The Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals' reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of the law enforcers' official duty is misplaced. We clarified in <i>People v. Kamad</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> that:<br><blockquote>Given the flagrant procedural lapse the Police committed in handling the seized <i>shabu</i> and the obvious evidentiary gaps in the chain of its custody, a presumption of regularity in the performance of duties cannot be made in this case. A presumption or regularity in the performance of official duty is made in the context of an existing rule of law or statute authorizing the performance of an act or duty or prescribing a procedure in the performance thereof. <b><i>The presumption applies when nothing in the record suggests that the law enforcers deviated from the standard conduct of official duty required by law; where the official act is irregular on its face, the presumption cannot arise.</i></b> In light of the flagrant lapses we noted, the lower courts were obviously wrong when they relied on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty.<br><br>We rule, too, that the discrepancy in the prosecution evidence on the identity of the seized and examined <i>shabu</i> and that formally offered in court cannot but lead to serious doubts regarding the origins of the shabu presented in court. This discrepancy and the gap in the chain of custody immediately affect proof of the <i>corpus delicti</i> without which the accused must be acquitted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>There were persistent doubts in the origins of the drugs supposedly seized from accused-appellant. The absence of the required witnesses during seizure, marking, inventory, and taking of photographs, along with the Police officers' failure to conduct these at the place of arrest, and their nonpresentation of material witnesses who handled the items; and, lastly, their utter failure to justify these blatant lapses, reveal a seriously compromised chain of custody. Taken together, these instances raise doubt on the integrity of the confiscated items and, ultimately, on the commission of the crime.<br><br>This Court is, thus, constrained to acquit accused-appellant. However, we we echo this Court's declarations in <i>People v. Holgado</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><blockquote>It is lamentable that while our dockets are clogged with prosecutions under Republic Act No. 9165 involving small-time drug users and retailers, we are seriously short of prosecutions involving the proverbial "big fish." We are swamped with cases involving small fry who have been arrested for miniscule amounts. While they are certainly a bane to our society, small retailers are but low-lying fruits in an exceedingly vast network of drug cartels. Both law enforcers and prosecutors should realize that the more effective and efficient strategy is to focus resources more on the source and true leadership of these nefarious organizations. Otherwise, all these executive and judicial resources expended to attempt to convict an accused for 0.05 gram of shabu under doubtful custodial arrangements will hardly make a dent in the overall picture. It might in fact be distracting our law enforcers from their more challenging task: to uproot the causes of this drug menace. We stand ready to assess cases involving greater amounts of drugs and the leadership of these cartels.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br></blockquote></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court of Appeals' January 26, 2015 Decision in CA-G.R.
