He also disagreed with the security guard's report that he was absent from April 28 to May 7, 2010, because he was on duty at that time and even signed ahead of his officemates. He explained that his 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. class schedule was for enrolment purposes only and was not followed., The classes were divided into three batches: 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., and 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. During his third and fourth year in school, he attended the last batch of class or none at all.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>He denied not returning to court on May 18, 2010 when he attended Atty.

Atty. Cuenco contested the accuracy of the security guard's logbook, specifically the entries on April 28 and May 28, 2010. The logbook entry on April 28, 2010 showed that the security guard relied on the janitor's information on her arrival time. The logbook entry on May 28, 2010 indicated that she left the court with De Guzman on board a tricycle. She alleged that she arrived at 8:00 a.m. in court, then went to the Supreme Court, and returned to the RTC at 4:30 p.m. to log out. She averred that the security guard was not always in his post whenever she arrived in the morning. She asserted that since the logbook was placed at the security guard's table and due to heavy workload, she was unable to update her DTR daily.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>She denied authorizing anybody to bring the logbook to Cabanilla at Polo, Valenzuela Hospital so he could log in. She confirmed that he studied BS Nursing while employed as court interpreter. She admitted that: (1) on March 31, 2010, she wrote on the logbook on Cabanilla's behalf, and (2) on April 23, 2010, she wrote "half-day" in Cabanilla's name in the logbook to prevent insertion. She did so because he left in a hurry, and as clerk of court, she believed she was authorized to do so.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>She disowns most of the pleadings found in her computer, except for the motion for reconsideration of a police officer. She explained that the motion had to be transferred to her computer because the flash drive where it was contained was attached to the police officer's car key. She insisted that all court employees have access to her computer, including De Guzman, who admitted preparing the pleadings at home and printing them in the office. De Guzman saved the pleadings in her computer for printing and emailing purposes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>She maintained that she played no other role in the stenographers' agreement to assume Abcede's workload since she lacks stenographic skills.

Cabanilla alleged that he wrote the entries in. the DTRs for March, April, July, and August 2009. He apologized for believing that the DTR may be written by anyone as long as these were copied from the court attendance logbook.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>He averred that the signature appearing in the logbook on April 23, 2010 was his, but the time "12:00 out" was not. It was written by Atty. Cuenco without his consent. He did not log out on that day because he could not locate the logbook and had to leave immediately. He denied filling out a leave form on March 29, 2010 and was surprised that he had one when in fact he was present at work. He also disowned the signature appearing in the logbook on March 31, 2010 and maintained that he did not authorize anyone to sign on his behalf. However, he admitted that his July 1-13, 2010 DTR did not contain a single entry when the investigating team arrived. It was a common practice that court employees sign the logbook upon arrival and departure and the entries were to be transferred on the DTR on the 15lh and last day of the month.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>He assailed the entries in the security guard's logbook for being inconsistent and unreliable. There is only one guard on duty for the whole RTC compound, making it impossible for him to monitor and record the precise arrival and departure time of all court employees. He clarified, that: (1) in those entries appearing that he arrived at 1:00 p.m., the guard could have thought that he just arrived when in fact he merely bought lunch across the court; (2) he was present on April 29, 2010 as evidenced by his notes on the court calendar and his signature on the certificate of arraignment; (3) he signed the logbook on April 28 to 30, 2010 ahead of half of the court staff; (4) he was present from April 28 to June 29, 2010 as he was the interpreter on duty during the hearings every Monday, Thursday and Friday; (5) on May 11, 14, and 18, 2010, he signed in ahead of Yabut, who arrived at midday, but the guard recorded that he arrived later than Yabut; (6) he was present on June 7, 2010 as he signed in ahead of Buzon and as evidenced by the minutes of the court proceedings; and (7) he was also present on June 17, 2010 as he signed in ahead of Atty.

As for her attendance on June 15, 2010, she explained that she went to the Supreme Court and returned in the afternoon, but the guard may not have noticed her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>4.

On July 13, 2010, she admitted that she accomplished her DTR in the morning as she had to take care of her sick child.

Cuenco impugned the accuracy of the guard's monitoring. The OCA opined that the monitoring was not expected to be flawless, as a margin of error was considered. An employee was considered absent if there was no entry of his/her arrival. Here, there were several dates of no records of Atty. Cuenco's arrival and departure, but the court's logbook indicated that she was present. Atty. Cuenco offered no explanation for the disparity between the logbooks of the guard and of the court. The OCA sustained the integrity of the guard's logbook in the absence of showing that the alleged inconsistency was patently gross.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Cabanilla presented the court calendar and certificate of arraignment to dispute the security guard's report on his absence from April 28 to May 7, 2010. The OCA did not give credence to his evidence, because they are not conclusive proof of his presence on that day. A court calendar is usually prepared before the scheduled hearing and a certificate of arraignment is made after the hearing. Further, he failed to impute any malicious motive on the guard in declaring his absences. Thus, the guard enjoys the presumption of regularity in the performance of his duty. The guard is an impartial person who has no interest in the outcome of the investigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Cabanilla argued that it was impossible for the guard to monitor precisely the arrival and departure time of all employees. The OCA contended that the guard was specifically instructed to monitor only the four respondents, Atty. Cuenco, Cabanilla, Abcede, and Yabut. Further, he made no effort to dispute the disparity between the guard's logbook and the court's logbook on several dates, including an occasion wherein he stayed only for four minutes. The OCA also did not believe him when he alleged that at times'he signed ahead of Yabut, because it is possible that a blank space was intentionally left for him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> It was also unbelievable for him to aver that he could not find the logbook, which should be in a conspicuous place and accessible to all employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>The OCA also did not give merit to Yabut's assertion that she was neither late nor absent from April 28 to May 5, 2010. The guard's report revealed that she arrived late in the morning and in the afternoon on those dates. It was also reported that in May and June 2010, she incurred several absences and discrepancies in her arrival and departure time. Her own admission that she failed to log in and out because she attended to her children contradict her assertion that her attendance was in order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>As for Abcede, the OCA found out that she logged out at 12:24 p.m. on June 15, 2010 with no indication that she returned afterwards. However, her logbook entry indicated that she logged in and out on time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Despite the respondents' denial, the OCA determined that there were proofs of falsification of DTRs, which constitutes dishonesty.

Cabanilla's Conflicting School and Work Schedules<br><br>The OCA found Cabanilla's averments untenable, because the registration cards are the best evidence and cannot overcome his self-serving claim. The school registration cards showed that from the second semester of 2006 to the second semester of 2009, his class schedules coincided with his work schedules. Further, he did not present documents, such as certification or actual class schedule from the school or professor, to prove his claim. More so, his long record of absences, tardiness, and half-days contradict his claim that his class schedule was from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. It was also observed that if indeed there was no conflict in schedules, there would be no reason to ask for the leniency of the former presiding judge. While the OCA acknowledged that court employees may pursue personal development and improvement, it should be done without sacrificing public service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>4. Abcede's Lack of Knowledge in Stenography<br><br>The OCA resolved that Abcede's admission in her Comment as to her lack of effort to refresh her stenography skills and Yabut's corroboration rendered her inept to perform her duties as stenographer. From her appointment in 1993, she has been defrauding the Court by receiving her salary without performing her expected functions. Her actuations amount to incompetence and dishonesty, and her employment should be discontinued.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>5. Pleadings of Litigants in the Court Computer<br><br>The OCA explained that the act of reviewing a litigant's pleading, as Atty. Cuenco claimed, is not within her job description as clerk of court. Doing so compromised the integrity and impartiality expected from a court personnel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>As for De Guzman, the OCA held that, even if she used her own printer, she prepared and printed the pleadings using the court computer and during office hours.

It cannot and should not be delegated to anyone else.</blockquote>Here, Judge Laurea and the OCA both determined that Atty. Cuenco made handwritten entries on Cabanilla's DTR and the latter consented to it by affixing his signature. The Court agrees with the OCA that the acts amount to serious dishonesty, falsification of official documents, and grave misconduct. The Court also observed that Atty. Cuenco and Cabanilla committed other acts of dishonesty and misconduct.<br><br>Atty. Cuenco made it appear in the court logbook that she was present on June 1, 2, and 28, 2010, but there was no record of her arrival and departure in the guard's logbook. She also did not dispute the discrepancies between the court's logbook and the guard's logbook on April 30, 2010; May 4-6, 11-14, 17-21, 24-26, and 31, 2010; June 7, 11, 17, 21-22, 24-25, and 29, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> She also admitted reviewing the pleading of a litigant, which compromised the integrity and impartiality expected from a court personnel.<br><br>She also violated Section 5, Canon III of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (CCCP) which provides:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><blockquote>SEC. 5. The full-time position in the Judiciary of every court personnel shall be the personnel's primary employment. For purposes of this Code, "primary employment" means the position that consumes the entire normal working hours of the court personnel and requires the personnel's exclusive attention in performing official duties.</blockquote>As for Cabanilla, he failed to conclusively prove that he was present on April 28 to May 7, 2010, and he did not dispute the guard's report that he was absent on May 4, 24-26, and 31, 2010; and June 2, 7, 10-11, 17, 21, 23 and 29, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> More seriously, he attended school during office hours; thus, depriving the government and the public of the expected service. Just like Atty. Cuenco, Cabanilla clearly disregarded the tenet embodied in Section 5, Canon III, above-quoted.<br><br>The OCA's investigation showed that there were other court employees who committed dishonesty and misconduct. <i>First</i>, the guard reported that (1) Yabut arrived late in the morning and in the afternoon from April 28 to May 5, 2010; (2) she was absent on May 21, 24-25, and 31, 2010 and June 2, 7, 11, 17, and 21, 2010; and (3) there were discrepancies in her arrival and departure times on May 6-7, 11-14, 17-20, 26-27', 2010 and June 1, 15, 18, 22, 24-25, and 28, 2010.

Calpo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> tells us the following:<br><blockquote>Misconduct is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by the public officer. It is intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of a rule of law or standard of behavior and to constitute an administrative offense, the misconduct should relate to or be connected with the performance of the official functions and duties of a public officer. In order to differentiate gross misconduct from simple misconduct, the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, and not a mere error of judgment, or flagrant disregard of established rule, must be manifest in the former.<br><br>On the other hand, dishonesty means "a disposition to lie, cheat, deceive or defraud; untrustworthiness; lack of integrity, lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; lack of fairness and straightforwardness; disposition to defraud, deceive or betray."</blockquote>Here, the investigations conducted by Judge Laurea and the OCA revealed that respondents Atty. Cuenco, Cabanilla, Abcede, and Yabut blatantly violated the established office circular and the Code of Conduct, and had been doing so for a long period of time. They violated Section 3, Canon IV of the CCCP, which states that <i>court personnel shall not alter, falsify, destroy or mutilate any record within their control.</i> This includes the DTR.<br><br>As Clerk of Court, Atty. Cuenco is expected to lead in the observance of office rules. Yet she and Cabanilla conspired to falsify the entries in the DTRs. As the immediate supervisor of the rest of the court employees, she cannot claim ignorance on the irregularities in their attendance and their whereabouts during office hours. She abused her authority by being lenient to selected court employees. For these, she should be held liable for serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and falsification of official documents.<br><br>In <i>Arabani, Jr. v. Arabani</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> the Court held that office hours should be devoted to the performance of official functions. Section 1, Canon IV of the CCCP provides that <i>court personnel shall at all times perform official duties properly and with diligence. They shall commit themselves exclusively to the business and responsibilities of their office during working hours</i>. However, respondents Cabanilla, Abcede, and Yabut violated the canon.<br><br>Section 1, Canon IV of the CCCP mandates that court personnel shall commit themselves <i>exclusively</i> to the business and responsibilities of their office during working hours. Court personnel should strictly observe the prescribed office hours and the efficient use of every moment thereof to inspire public respect for the justice system. Thus, court officials and employees are at all times behooved to <i>strictly</i> observe official time because the image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat, from the judge to the last and lowest of its employees.<br><br>Here, Cabanilla admitted that he was enrolled in a nursing course while employed as court interpreter, and there were occasions that he left the court to attend classes. He also claimed that the former judge was lenient with him as he pursued his education. There were documentary and testimonial evidence to prove that he was absent at work and yet his DTRs showed otherwise. The pieces of evidence and his admissions point to the conclusion that he finished BS Nursing at the expense of the government and the public. His actions amount to serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and falsification of official documents.<br><br>As for Abcede, not only did she commit dishonesty in her attendance, she was also remiss in the non-performance of her duties as stenographer for years. She admitted that she already forgot stenography because the former judge assigned her to do other clerical work. However, after the retirement of the former judge, she did nothing to regain the skills required of a stenographer. She ignored Atty. Cuenco's directive to resume her duties as stenographer. Her conduct constitutes incompetence and serious dishonesty.<br><br>As for Yabut, records show that she was absent and tardy on several occasions, but her DTR shows otherwise. For these, she is guilty of serious dishonesty and falsification of official documents, which carries the penalty of dismissal from the service. However, the records also disclosed that she admitted her infraction and expressed deep remorse for it. She explained that she could not afford to hire a house helper and she was constrained to take care of her school-aged children. At lunchtime, she had to go home and bring lunch for those coming home from school and bring food to those who will attend school in the afternoon. Her family situation constrained her to time-in late after lunch, to leave early before dismissal, and time-out the following day.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> It appearing that this is her first offense and there is no connivance with the other respondents, the Court finds that the penalty of n suspension for six months is sufficient. <br><br>In <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Cabrera-Faller</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> the Court extended leniency and showed compassion to the erring court employees.<br><blockquote>[W]e have always taken advantage of every opportunity to show compassion and leniency in the imposition of administrative penalties on erring court employees. This is because work is as much a source of one's dignity as it is of one's income. While this Court will never tolerate any act of wrongdoing in the performance of duties, it would not be remiss in its mandate, should it extend just one more chance for court employees to improve their ways.</blockquote>Sadly, the Court cannot grant the same leniency to the other respondents who are found guilty of grave offenses with deliberate intent to violate civil service rules. Specifically, it appears that there is collusion between Atty. Cuenco and Cabanilla as to the latter's attendance in order to accommodate his class schedule. There is also connivance between Atty. Cuenco and Abcede in intentionally assigning the other, stenographers to sit on duty to conceal the latter's lack of stenography skills. The offenses of these respondents have robbed the court and the public of much needed service, warranting the penalty of dismissal.<br><br>As for De Guzman, the Court sustains the OCA's findings that she violated reasonable office rules and regulations for using the court computer and printer to prepare and print pleadings for the litigants. The records disclose that in a Memorandum dated June 8, 2010, Atty. Caridad A. Pabello, OCA Chief of Office, Office of Administrative Services, confirmed that the Court did not approve De Guzman's detail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> In a Resolution dated July 21, 2010, the Court ordered De Guzman to return to her mother unit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> In her Comment dated August 19, 2010, De Guzman stated that she was no longer connected with the Malabon RTC, Branch 72 and any other government institution as she purportedly resigned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>While De Guzman was never an employee of the Court, still she committed violations of the court's reasonable office rules and regulations when she used the court computer and printer to prepare and print pleadings for the litigants.

While the Court cannot exercise administrative supervision over her since, based on the records, her detail to the said RTC was not even approved, therefore, she is not a court employee, still she must be held accountable for her acts of disrespect towards the Judiciary. Also, since according to De Guzman she is no longer connected with any government institution, a recommendation of referral to the local government unit would not serve any practical purpose. For this reason, the Court deems it proper to refer De Guzman's case to tlie Presiding Judge of Malabon RTC, Branch 72 and direct said Judge to commence contempt proceedings against De Guzman. The findings in this administrative case may be taken cognizance of by said court in the contempt proceedings.<br><br>As for Asis, the Court observed that in the OCA's Report dated January 26, 2005, her name was not mentioned or the allegations against her discussed.

It must be pointed out that the CCCP explicitly <u>incorporates civil service rules</u>, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><center>INCORPORATION OF OTHER RULES</center><br>Section 1. All provisions of law, <b>Civil Service rules</b>, and issuances of the Supreme Court governing or regulating the conduct of public officers and employees applicable to the Judiciary <b>are deemed incorporated</b> into this Code.</blockquote>Hence, offenses under civil service laws and rules committed by court personnel constitute violations of the CCCP, for which the offender will be held administratively liable. However, considering that the CCCP does not specify the sanctions for those violations, the Court has, <b><u>in the exercise of its discretion</u></b>, adopted the penalty provisions under existing civil service rules, such as the RRACCS, including Section 50 thereof.<br><br>Accordingly, in cases where a respondent court personnel had committed multiple infractions, the Court has applied Section 50 of the RRACCS. To illustrate, in the recent case of <i>Paduga v.

Since there were multiple violations, the Court applied Section 50 of the RRACCS in imposing the penalty of suspension for one (1) year. Similarly, in <i>Anonymous Complaint against Camay, Jr.</i>, a utility worker of the Judiciary was found guilty of various serious offenses, and applying Section 50 of the RRACCS, the Court dismissed him from service.<br><br>Consistent with these cases, the Court resolves that in administrative cases wherein the <b>respondent court personnel commits multiple administrative infractions, the Court, adopting Section 50 of the RRACCS, shall impose the penalty corresponding to the most serious charge, and consider the rest as aggravating circumstances.</b> (Emphases in the original; citation omitted)</blockquote>Section 50, Rule 10 of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service classifies serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and falsification of official document as grave offenses, which are penalized by dismissal from the service. Incompetence is likewise a grave offense, but is penalized with suspension for six months and one day to one year for first offense, and dismissal from the service for the second offense.<br><br>Following the ruling in <i>Boston</i> case, the Court imposes the penalty of dismissal from the service for the most serious offenses, serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and falsification of official document.

Even without a duly approved assignment, De Guzman seemingly acted as a court personnel, which, in my mind, was a means to lure litigants into paying for a consideration in exchange for unwarranted favors and benefits such as "favorable or speedy actions and early settings"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> of their cases. Apart from this, it was discovered that De Guzman also took part in causing the arrest of accused in archived cases "who would later be released after payment of consideration."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Although further surveillance was recommended to adduce evidence for the above findings,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> it is my view that De Guzman's transgressions should, as a matter of course, be dealt with accordingly. Considering that the image of a court is reflected in the official and personal conduct of its employees,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> she should be made liable for her misrepresentation that not only degrades the administration of justice, but also erodes the people's confidence to the courts.<br><br>Finally, I express my extreme discomfort with the practice that local government units routinely fill in the practical needs of our lower courts. Their support is pragmatic but has very grave consequences regarding the judiciary's independence and the lower court judges' impartiality when it comes to cases involving the local governments and their officials within their territorial jurisdiction. Were it not for the fact that the alleged local government detailed personnel in this case was not validly appointed, this Court would have been, again, confronted with the awkward questions as to whether we can exercise full disciplinary action against personnel from another constitutional branch of the government.<br><br>For these reasons, this Court must urgently examine how it can transition from this current state of affairs to a more ideal one: where <i>all</i> personnel of every lower court are from the judiciary. We should continually be vigilant with respect to our financial autonomy, and continually assert that the judiciary be given all the resources necessary to ensure its independence and impartiality in all cases.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> I concur.<br><br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><i>Ponencia</i>, p. 2.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>Id. at 4.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>Id. at 5.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>Id. at 7-8.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>Id. at 9.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>Id. at 13-14.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>Id. at 19.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>Id. at 18-19.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>Dated March 11,2008.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>Supreme Court Adm.
