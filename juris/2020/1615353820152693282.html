Ramos</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Gerry Toyoto, Eddie Gonzales and Dominador Gabiana were arrested and charged for conducting a rally along Navotas on October 23, 1983 in violation of the Anti-Subversion Act. They moved to dismiss the case, which the trial court granted, for lack of evidence. Despite the order of dismissal, they were not released from detention on the ground that a Preventive Detention Action had been issued against them. Thus, they filed an application for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. When the writ was returned, respondents alleged that the petition was already moot since petitioners had been released from detention. This Court, however, in granting the petition, held that the action can only be moot if petitioners can no longer be re-arrested: <br><blockquote>Ordinarily, a petition for habeas corpus becomes moot and academic when the restraint on the liberty of the petitioners is lifted either temporarily or permanently. We have so held in a number of cases. But the instant case presents a different situation. The question to be resolved is whether the State can reserve the power to re-arrest a person for an offense after a court of competent jurisdiction has absolved him of the offense. An affirmative answer is the one suggested by the respondents because the release of the petitioners being merely "temporary" it follows that they can be re-arrested at any time despite their acquittal by a court of competent jurisdiction. We hold that such a reservation is repugnant to the government of laws and not of men principle.

Enrile</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Efren C. Moncupa was arrested and detained on April 22, 1982 on the allegation that he was a member of the National Democratic Front. After two separate investigations, it was found that he was not a member of any subversive group. The investigating fiscal, however, recommended that Moncupa be charged with illegal possession of firearms and illegal possession of subversive documents. While information for these charges were filed, he had not been arraigned and no further proceedings ensued. His motions for bail were likewise denied. Thus, he filed a petition for application of a writ of habeas corpus. Respondents in that case, however, countered that his petition had already become moot as he had already been temporarily released from detention upon order of the Minister of National Defense with the approval of the President. This Court, in granting the Petition, reiterated the ratio in <i>Toyoto</i> and explained that the action, while moot, was one capable of repetition:<br><blockquote>A release that renders a petition for a writ of habeas corpus moot and academic must be one which is free from involuntary restraints. Where a person continues to be unlawfully denied one or more of his constitutional freedoms, where there is present a denial of due process, where the restraints are not merely involuntary but appear to be unnecessary, and where a deprivation of freedom originally valid has, in the light of subsequent developments, become arbitrary, the person concerned or those applying in his behalf may still avail themselves of the privilege of the writ.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, this Court may still pass upon actions for habeas corpus even when the alleged illegal detention has ceased if the action is one that is capable of repetition yet evading review.<br><br>Here, the national inmates had been returned to their actual detention facilities. There is, however, a lingering question of whether the Department of Justice is authorized to transfer them to another facility without a court order, which could happen at any time. Its capability of being repeated had already been demonstrated when on June 10, 2019, President Duterte, through Secretary of Justice Menardo Guevarra, ordered the transfer of 10 "high profile" inmates from the New Bilibid Prisons in Muntinlupa City to the Marines Barracks Rudiardo Brown in Taguig City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> While this transfer has not been questioned before this Court, there is still no definitive ruling on whether the Department of Justice has the authority to transfer national inmates.

Rule 102, Section 4 provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 4. <i>When writ not allowed or discharge authorized</i>. — If it appears that the person alleged to be restrained of his liberty is in the custody of an officer under process issued by a court or judge or by virtue of a judgment or order of a court of record, and that the court or judge had jurisdiction to issue the process, render the judgment, or make the order, the writ shall not be allowed; or if the jurisdiction appears after the writ is allowed, the person shall not be discharged by reason of any informality or defect in the process, judgment, or order.

Very broadly, the writ applies "to all cases of illegal confinement or detention by which a person has been deprived of his liberty, or by which the rightful custody of any person has been withheld from the person entitled thereto". Issuance of the writ necessitates that a person be illegally deprived of his liberty, hi the celebrated case of <i>Villavicencio v. Lukban</i>, we stated that "[a]ny restraint which will preclude freedom of action is sufficient."<br><br>The most basic criterion for the issuance of the writ, therefore, is that the individual seeking such relief be illegally deprived of his freedom of movement or placed under some form of illegal restraint. If an individual's liberty is restrained via some legal process, the writ of habeas corpus is unavailing. Concomitant to this principle, the writ of habeas corpus cannot be used to directly assail a judgment rendered by a competent court or tribunal which, having duly acquired jurisdiction, was not deprived or ousted of this jurisdiction through some anomaly in the conduct of the proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote>This general rule, however, has certain exceptions. Considering that the remedy is available for any form of illegal restraint, the nature of the restraint need not be related to any offense.

Those in violation of the order would be imprisoned for not more than 60 days. Petitioners, who were Mangyans, applied for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that they were being held against their will in the Tigbao reservation. This Court held that the writ may be applied for, since the act complained of involved a restriction on the freedom of movement.<br><br>In <i>Villavicencio v. Lukban</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> the Mayor of Manila, with the assistance of the Chief of Police, "hustled" some 170 "women of ill repute" from their homes on the midnight of October 25, 1918, and placed them on steamers bound for Davao, to be employed as laborers. The relatives and friends of these women filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that these women were illegally deprived of their liberty. In granting the writ, this Court held that the remedy of the writ of habeas corpus may be available where there has been a violation of the right to liberty of abode or the freedom of locomotion:<br><blockquote>A prime specification of an application for a writ of habeas corpus is restraint of liberty. The essential object and purpose of the writ of habeas corpus is to inquire into all manner of involuntary restraint as distinguished from voluntary, and to relieve a person therefrom if such restraint is illegal. Any restraint which will preclude freedom of action is sufficient. The forcible taking of these women from Manila by officials of that city, who handed them over to other parties, who deposited them in a distant region, deprived these women of freedom of locomotion just as effectively as if they had been imprisoned. Placed in Davao without either money or personal belongings, they were prevented from exercising the liberty of going when and where they pleased. The restraint of liberty which began in Manila continued until the aggrieved parties were returned to Manila and released or until they freely and truly waived his right.<br><br>Consider for a moment what an agreement with such a defense would mean. The chief executive of any municipality in the Philippines could forcibly and illegally take a private citizen and place him beyond the boundaries of the municipality, and then, when called upon to defend his official action, could calmly fold his hands and claim that the person was under no restraint and that he, the official, had no jurisdiction over this other municipality. We believe the true principle should be that, if the respondent is within the jurisdiction of the court and has it in his power to obey the order of the court and thus to undo the wrong that he has inflicted, he should be compelled to do so. Even if the party to whom the writ is addressed has illegally parted with the custody of a person before the application for the writ is no reason why the writ should not issue. If the mayor and the chief of police, acting under no authority of law, could deport these women from the city of Manila to Davao, the same officials must necessarily have the same means to return them from Davao to Manila. The respondents, within the reach of process, may not be permitted to restrain a fellow citizen of her liberty by forcing her to change her domicile and to avow the act with impunity in the courts, while the person who has lost her birthright of liberty has no effective recourse.

Any movement outside the penal institution, such as court appearances, must have prior court authorization. Since the Department of Justice exercises administrative supervision over the Bureau of Corrections, with the power to "review, reverse, revise or modify the decisions of the [Bureau of Corrections],"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> it stands to reason that the Secretary of Justice has the same authority to determine the movement of national inmates <i>within</i> the penal institutions.<br><br>According to respondents, the national inmates in this case were transferred from the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City to the New Bilibid Prison Extension Facility in the National Bureau of Investigation Compound in Manila City. Neither the law nor its Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations define what an "extension facility" is or how one is established. However, as an extension facility, the control and supervision of these national inmates remained with the Bureau of Corrections, through the Secretary of Justice. Thus, the movement of the national inmates from New Bilibid Prison to its extension facility was within the authority of the Secretary of Justice.<br><br>As the competent authority with supervisory administration over the Bureau of Corrections, the Secretary of Justice was authorized to order the inspection of the living quarters of the national inmates. As stated in the Department of Justice Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> dated December 16, 2014, several illegal and contraband items were recovered from the <i>kubol</i> of these national inmates. The inspection and subsequent movement of the inmates from one penal facility to another also did not appear to have violated the national inmates' basic rights under the Nelson Mandela Rules. On December 27, 2014, the Chair of the Commission on Human Rights was able to visit the national inmates and she reported that "they had no complaints about food, shelter and treatment of authorities."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> There was likewise no merit to the allegation that the national inmates were being held incommunicado.<br><br>Detained persons, whether deprived of liberty or convicted by final order, are still deserving of humane and ethical treatment under detention. However, this must be balanced with the public interest to not unduly hamper effective and efficient penal management. In <i>Hudson v. Palmer</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> as quoted in <i>Alejano v. Cabuay</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><blockquote>However, while persons imprisoned for crime enjoy many protections of the Constitution, it is also clear that imprisonment carries with it the circumscription or loss of many significant rights. These constraints on inmates, and in some cases the complete withdrawal of certain rights, are "justified by the considerations underlying our penal system." The curtailment of certain rights is necessary, as a practical matter, to accommodate a myriad of "institutional needs and objectives" of prison facilities, chief among which is internal security. Of course, these restrictions or retractions also serve, incidentally, as reminders that, under our system of justice, deterrence and retribution are factors in addition to correction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup><br></blockquote>Here, there was an urgent need to remove the national inmates from their place of confinement and to transfer them to another detention facility. Considering that the Secretary of Justice has the authority to determine the movement of national inmates between penal facilities, there is no compelling reason for this Court to grant these Petitions.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petitions are <b>DENIED</b>. <br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Peralta, C.
