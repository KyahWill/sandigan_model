Accordingly, respondents are hereby ordered jointly and severally liable:</p><p>1) To pay complainant the amount of USD60,000.00, or its equivalent in Philippine Currency prevailing at the exchange rate at the time of payment, representing his payment and total disability benefits;</p><p>2) To pay complainant an amount equivalent to ten (10%) percent of the total judgment award, as and for attorney's fees.</p><p>Other claims are dismissed for lack of merit.</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p></blockquote><p>In so ruling, the LA disregarded the medical assessment and grading given by the company-designated physician.

Private respondent is ordered to return to petitioners the amount of Two Million Nine Hundred Forty Three Thousand Six Hundred Pesos (Php2,943,600.00) less the equivalent of $7,465.00 in Philippine currency as of 16 October 2014, the date of receipt of payment by private respondent, as compensation for Grade 11 disability.</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The CA found grave abuse of discretion on the part of NLRC in issuing the assailed NLRC Decision and Resolution, and held that the conclusions of the NLRC are unsupported by substantial evidence and contrary to the provisions of the POEA-SEC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p><p>The CA found that Pastrana failed to observe the procedure outlined in Section 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC, which requires the referral to and appointment of a third doctor whose medical assessment shall be binding on both parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Thus, the complaint is dismissible for being premature, and the opinion of the company-designated physician becomes controlling.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The CA further noted that the company-designated physician timely issued a final disability grading on April 11, 2013, or 120 days from the date of the commencement of Pastrana's treatment. Based on the foregoing, the CA held that Pastrana 's disability is only partial, and that he is only entitled to disability benefits corresponding to Grade 11 disability rating in the amount of $7,465.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></p><p>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p><p>Pastrana invites the Court to revisit a piece of evidence — the April 11, 2013 medical assessment issued by the company-designated physician — which he claims was neither presented nor furnished to him at the time of the discontinuation of his treatment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> He contends that he was only verbally advised by the company-designated physician on April 2, 2013 that he is fit to return to his sea duties, and was later on offered disability benefits amounting to $7,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> At any rate, Pastrana argues that the medical assessment dated April 11, 2013 is not valid and binding for it lacked any categorical statement as to his fitness to return to work, and it failed to comply with guidelines on the assessment of seafarers issued by the Department of Health and the International Labor Organization.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Thus, in effect, there is failure to issue a final medical assessment within the periods provided by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> It also follows that he is under no obligation to comply with the conflict-resolution procedure under Section 20(B)(3) of the POEA-SEC which mandates the referral of the matter to a third doctor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p><p>In their Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> respondents maintain that the company-designated physician timely issued a final medical assessment on April 11, 2013, and that it was misleading for Pastrana to claim otherwise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Respondents also fault Pastrana for his failure to move for the referral of the conflicting medical assessments to a third doctor, which militates against Pastrana's claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Thus, the medical assessment issued by the company-designated physician shall prevail, and accordingly, Pastrana is only entitled to partial disability benefit amounting to $7,465.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></p><p>Petitioner reiterates his position in his Reply.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></p><p align="center"><strong>Issues</strong></p><p>The issue for resolution of the Court is whether the CA erred in reversing the NLRC, and in holding that Pastrana is only entitled to partial disability benefit.</p><p align="center"><strong>The Court's Ruling</strong></p><p>It is settled that a petition for review on <em>certiorari</em> under Rule 45 is a mode of appeal where the issue is limited to questions of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> As such, the Court will not review the factual findings of the lower tribunals, or re-examine the evidence already passed upon in the proceedings below. This is especially true when the findings of facts of the labor tribunals were affirmed by the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p><p>In this case, the labor tribunals and the CA consistently found that the company-designated physician issued a disability assessment on April 11, 2013, and this became the basis of the partial disability assessment that was offered by respondents to Pastrana. Thus, Pastrana cannot, for the first time and at this stage of the proceedings, assert that the April 11, 2013 disability assessment was not presented nor furnished to him prior to his filing of the complaint. The factual findings of the labor tribunals and the CA with respect to the issuance of said disability assessment shall remain undisturbed.</p><p>Nonetheless, the Court still finds merit in the Petition.</p><p>The seafarer's entitlement to disability benefits for work-related illness or injury is governed by the Labor Code, its implementing rules and regulation (IRR), the POEA-SEC, and prevailing jurisprudence.</p><p>In <em>Vergara v. Hammonia Maritime Services, Inc. and Atlantic Marine Ltd.</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (<em>Vergara</em>), the Court explained how the pertinent provisions in the Labor Code, its IRR, and the POEA-SEC operate, <em>viz.:</em></p><blockquote><p>In this respect and in the context of the present case, Article 192 (c)(1) of the Labor Code provides that:</p><blockquote><p>x x x The following disabilities shall be deemed <u><strong>total and permanent:</strong></u></p><p>(1) Temporary total disability lasting continuously for more than one hundred twenty days, <strong>except as otherwise provided in the Rules</strong>;</p><p>[x x x x]</p></blockquote><p>The rule referred to — Rule X, Section 2 of the Rules and Regulations implementing Book IV of the Labor Code — states:</p><blockquote><p>Period of entitlement. — (a) The income benefit shall be paid beginning on the first day of such disability. If caused by an injury or sickness it shall not be paid longer than 120 consecutive days <u>except where such injury or sickness still requires medical attendance beyond 120 days but not to exceed 240 days from onset of disability in which case <strong>benefit for temporary total disability</strong> shall be paid. However, the System may declare the total and permanent status at anytime after 120 days of continuous temporary total disability as may be warranted by the degree of actual loss or impairment of physical or mental functions as determined by the System.</u></p></blockquote><p>These provisions are to be read hand in hand with the POEA Standard Employment Contract whose Section 20 (3) states:</p><blockquote><p>Upon sign-off from the vessel for medical treatment, the seafarer is entitled to sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage until he is declared fit to work or the degree of permanent disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician but in no case shall this period exceed one hundred twenty (120) days.</p></blockquote><p>As these provisions operate, the seafarer, upon sign-off from his vessel, must report to the company-designated physician within three (3) days from arrival for diagnosis and treatment. For the duration of the treatment but in no case to exceed 120 days, the seaman is on <em>temporary total disability</em> as he is totally unable to work. He receives his basic wage during this period until he is declared fit to work or his temporary disability is acknowledged by the company to be permanent, either partially or totally, as his condition is defined under the POEA Standard Employment Contract and by applicable Philippine laws. If the 120 days initial period is exceeded and no such declaration is made because the seafarer requires further medical attention, then the temporary total disability period may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists. The seaman may of course also be declared fit to work at any time such declaration is justified by his medical condition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></p></blockquote><p>In <em>Elburg Shipmanagement, Inc. v. Quiogue, Jr.</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (<em>Elburg</em>), the Court supplanted <em>Vergara</em> and outlined the rules with respect to the period within which the company-designated physician must issue a final and definitive disability assessment, <em>viz</em>.:</p><blockquote><p>In summary, if there is a claim for total and permanent disability benefits by a seafarer, the following rules <em>(rules)</em> shall govern:</p><ol><li>The company-designated physician must issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer's disability grading within a period of 120 days from the time the seafarer reported to him;</li><br><li>If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable reason, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total;</li><br><li>If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days with a sufficient justification (<em>e.g.</em> seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be extended to 240 days. The employer has the burden to prove that the company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the period; and</li><br><li>If the company-designated physician still fails to give his assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total, regardless of any justification.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><p>While <em>Elburg</em> states that the 120 or 240-day periods shall be reckoned "from the time the seafarer reported to [the company-designated physician]," subsequent cases consistently counted said periods from the date of the seafarer's repatriation for medical treatment. This is true even in cases where the date of repatriation of the seafarer does not coincide with the date of his first consultation with the company-designated physician. This will be observed, for instance, in <em>Jebsens Maritime, Inc. v. Pasamba</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and <em>Teekay Shipping Philippines, Inc. v. Ramoga, Jr.</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> This is consistent with Section 20(A)(3) which provides for the repatriation of the seafarer in case of work-related illness or injury, and the obligation of the employer to give the seafarer sickness allowance from the time he signed off until he is declared fit to work or the degree of his or her disability has been assessed, but not exceeding 120 days, <em>viz</em>.:</p><blockquote><p><strong>SECTION 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS</strong></p><p><strong>A. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS</strong></p><blockquote><p>The liabilities of the employer when the seafarer suffers work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract are as follows:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x x x x</p><ol start="2"><li>If the injury or illness requires medical and/or dental treatment in a foreign port, the employer shall be liable for the full cost of such medical, serious dental, surgical and hospital treatment as well as board and lodging until the seafarer is declared fit to work or to be repatriated. However, if after repatriation, the seafarer still requires medical attention arising from said injury or illness, he shall be so provided at cost to the employer until such time he is declared fit or the degree of his disability has been established by the company-designated physician.</li><br><li>In addition to the above obligation of the employer to provide medical attention, the seafarer shall also receive sickness allowance from his employer in an amount equivalent to his basic wage computed from the time he signed off until he is declared fit to work or the degree of disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician. The period within which the seafarer shall be entitled to his sickness allowance shall not exceed 120 days. Payment of the sickness allowance shall be made on a regular basis, but not less than once a month.</li></ol></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><p>Thus, <em>Elburg</em> should be read as requiring the company-designated physician to issue a final and definitive disability assessment within 120 or 240 days <u><strong>from the date of the seafarer's repatriation</strong></u>.</p><p>As held by the Court in <em>Vergara</em> and <em>Elburg</em>, the initial 120 days within which the company-designated physician must issue a final and definitive disability assessment may be extended for another 120 days. The extended period, however, may only be availed of by the company-designated physician under justifiable circumstances.</p><p>In <em>Marlow Navigation Philippines, Inc. v. Osias</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> the Court held that the seafarer's uncooperativeness with his medical treatment justified the extension of the period of the medical treatment and assessment to 240 days.</p><p>In <em>Magsaysay Mitsui Osk Marine, Inc. v. Buenaventura</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> the Court found that the extension of the initial 120-day period was justified by the seafarer's need for further treatment, as in fact, the seafarer underwent therapy and rehabilitation beyond the 120-day period. The need for further medical treatment also justified the application of the 240-day period in <em>Rickmers Marine Agency Phils., Inc. v. San Jose</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and <em>Magsaysay Maritime Corp. v. Simbajon</em>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></p><p>The Court stressed, however, that to avail of the extended 240-day period, the company-designated physician must perform some complete and definite medical assessment to show that the illness still requires medical attendance beyond 120 days, but not to exceed 240 days.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> The employer bears the burden of proving that the company-designated physician had a reasonable justification to invoke the 240-day period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Thus, in <em>Hanseatic Shipping Philippines, Inc. v. Ballon</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> the Court did not give credence to the employer's belated and unsubstantiated invocation of the 240-day period.</p><p>The duty of the company-designated physician to issue a final and definitive assessment of the seafarer's disability within the prescribed periods is imperative. His failure to do so will render his findings nugatory and transform the disability suffered by the seafarer to one that is permanent and total. As explained by the Court in <em>Pelagio v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc.</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>:</p><blockquote><p>Otherwise stated, the company-designated physician is required to issue a <u><em><strong>final and definite assessment</strong></em></u> of the seafarer's disability rating within the aforesaid 120/240-day period; otherwise, the opinions of the company-designated and the independent physicians are <u><em><strong>rendered irrelevant</strong></em></u> because the seafarer is already conclusively presumed to be suffering from a permanent and total disability, and thus, is entitled to the benefits corresponding thereto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Similarly, in <em>Olidana v. Jebsens Maritime, Inc.</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> the Court declared as follows:</p><blockquote><p>x x x The Court in <em>Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc. v. Munar</em>, held that the declaration by the company-designated physician is an obligation, the abdication of which transforms the temporary total disability to permanent total disability, regardless of the disability grade, <em>viz.:</em></p><blockquote><p>Indeed, under Section 32 of the POEA-SEC, only those injuries or disabilities that are classified as Grade 1 may be considered as total and permanent. However, if those injuries or disabilities with a disability grading from 2 to 14, hence, partial and permanent, would incapacitate a seafarer from performing his usual sea duties for a period of more than 120 or 240 days, depending on the need for further medical treatment, then he is, under legal contemplation, totally and permanently disabled. In other words, an impediment should be characterized as partial and permanent not only under the Schedule of Disabilities found in Section 32 of the POEA-SEC but should be so under the relevant provisions of the Labor Code and the Amended Rules on Employee Compensation (AREC) implementing Title II, Book IV of the Labor Code. That while the seafarer is partially injured or disabled, he is not precluded from earning doing the same work he had before his injury or disability or that he is accustomed or trained to do. Otherwise, if his illness or injury prevents him from engaging in gainful employment for more than 120 or 240 days, as the case may be, he shall be deemed totally and permanently disabled.</p><p>Moreover, the company-designated physician is expected to arrive at a definite assessment of the seafarer's fitness to work or permanent disability within the period of 120 or 240 days. That should he fail to do so and the seafarer's medical condition remains unresolved, the seafarer shall be deemed totally and permanently disabled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Applying the foregoing rules in the present case, the Court finds that Dr. Lim was unable to timely issue a final assessment of Pastrana's disability.</p><p>Pastrana was repatriated on December 10, 2012. He reported to Dr. Lim two days thereafter, or on December 12, 2012. After a series of treatment and consultations, Dr. Lim issued his final assessment of Pastrana's disability on April 11, 2013. At the time of its issuance, 122 days had already lapsed since Pastrana's repatriation. Clearly, the assessment dated April 11, 2013 was issued beyond the mandated 120-day period.</p><p>While this initial 120-day period may be extended to 240 days, the Court finds no sufficient justification to apply the extended period in this case. The records of the case are bereft of any indication that such extension was needed, or even intended, to provide Pastrana further medical treatment. On the contrary, it was found below that his treatment was discontinued and he was given a partial disability grading.</p><p>Dr. Lim was bound to issue a final disability assessment within 120 days from Pastrana's repatriation — but, he failed to do so. Such failure rendered his opinion on Pastrana's disability irrelevant. The law had already stepped in, and considered Pastrana permanently and totally disabled. He is, therefore, entitled to disability benefits corresponding to Grade 1 disability rating.</p><p>Pastrana is also entitled to attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total monetary awards following Article 2208 of the New Civil Code, which allows its recovery in actions for recovery of wages of laborers and actions for indemnity under the employer's liability laws.</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, in view of the foregoing, the petition is hereby <strong>GRANTED</strong>.
