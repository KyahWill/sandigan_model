Rebato seeking the reversal of the Court of Appeals (CA) Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated August 30, 2018, which affirmed with modifications the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 1, Borongan City, Eastern Samar, dated June 18, 2015, finding Rebato guilty of the crime of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).<br><br>The accusatory portion of the Information, docketed as Criminal Case No. 12002, states:<br><blockquote>That on September 6, 2008, at about 11:30 o'clock (<i>sic</i>) in the evening, at Brgy[.] 05, Llorente, Eastern Samar, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused conspiring together and with treachery and evident premeditation, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously stabbed to death [Fredelindo Gura Remo].<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>Upon arraignment, Rebato pleaded not guilty.<br><br><center><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br></center><br>In view of Rebato's affirmative allegation of self-defense,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the RTC conducted a reverse trial wherein the defense first presented its evidence and chronicled alleged factual antecedents.<br><br>On September 6, 2008, at around 11:00 p.m. in Brgy. 5, Llorente, Eastern Samar, Rebato was sitting outside Joyan's Bakeshop and listening to music from his MP4. He was with Edgar Carpio and Melchor Villaflor. The victim, Fredelindo G. Remo, together with siblings Jimmy Cabanatan and Jomar Cabanatan, who came from a drinking session about 15 to 20 meters away, approached and attacked Carpio and Villaflor. Afterwards, Remo attacked Rebato with the same water pump pipe, hitting the latter's right elbow, left hand and back. While Remo's group was attacking Rebato, someone from Remo's group said, "Let us kill him." Thereafter, Rebato ran inside the bakeshop, and Gerwin Gunda gave Rebato a small <i>bolo</i> locally called "<i>dipang</i>." Rebato used the <i>dipang</i> to stab Remo, who then ran away. Afterwards, Rebato went inside the bakeshop. Minutes later, Rebato heard people shouting that there was a dead body. When the policemen arrived, they asked the people inside the bakery to come out. When they asked who stabbed the dead person, Rebato admitted that it was him who stabbed Remo. Rebato was brought to the municipal building of Llorente, Eastern Samar, near the jail. He allegedly surrendered the bladed weapon he used to the policemen. After six days, Rebato was brought by policemen to the clinic of Dr. Myra Cecilia D. Grata and was physically examined.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b><br></center><br>On the other hand, the prosecution presented the incident in this manner:<br><br>On September 6, 2008, at about 11:30 p.m. in Brgy. 5, Llorente, Eastern Samar, while Remo was walking home and passing by Joyan's Bakeshop, Rebato approached Remo from behind and stabbed the latter, twice. First, Remo was stabbed at the right portion of the stomach and, then, in his left chest. Afterwards, Remo ran towards his house, but was not able to get too far, and fell down.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Jimmy, who was about 10 to 15 meters away, witnessed the incident. Jimmy was with his three friends, who were about to start their drinking session, about 50 meters away from the bakery. Jomar, who was about 8 to ten 10 meters away from Rebato and Remo, also witnessed the incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Remo sustained two stab wounds: a 2-centimeter in diameter wound below the right nipple of the midclavicular line, penetrating the chest cavity; and a 1.5-centimeter in diameter wound located at the left quadrant of the abdomen, penetrating the abdominal cavity. These wounds caused the immediate death of the victim due to excessive loss of blood, which was considered by the doctor as hypovolemic shock secondary to stab wound.<br><br><center><b><i>Ruling of the RTC</i></b><br></center><br>After trial on the merits, the RTC convicted Rebato of the crime of Murder. The dispositive portion of the Decision, dated June 18, 2015, reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, all the foregoing premises considered, this Court <b>finds</b> accused <b>Elmer T. Rebato GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER</b>, and thereby imposing upon him the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, with the corresponding accessory penalties provided under Article 41 of the Revised Penal Code, and ordering accused Elmer T. Rebato to pay the heirs of victim [Fredelindo Remo] the following:<br><ol type="a"><li>Civil indemnity for the death of [Fredelindo Remo] in the amount of P75,000.00;<br></li><li>Moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00;<br></li><li>Exemplary damages in the amount of P30,000.00; and <br></li><li>Temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00.<br></li></ol>It appearing on record that accused has been detained on October 10, 2008, his period of detention shall be credited in the service of his sentence consisting of deprivation of liberty with the full time during which he has undergone preventive imprisonment pursuant to Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC ruled that the justifying circumstance of self-defense cannot be properly interposed because of the absence of the indispensable element of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim. The RTC held that Rebato fabricated his defense of self-defense when he testified that he only sustained injuries on his right elbow, left hand and back, despite being beaten alternately for several times using water pump pipes, by Remo and his two friends.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The RTC also took into consideration the testimony of the doctor who examined Rebato's injuries, and who categorically declared that the injury could have probably been sustained from some other incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Based on the testimonies of Rebato and Dr. Grata, the element of unlawful aggression has not been clearly and convincingly established by the defense.<br><br>The RTC also gave weight and credence to the evidence of the prosecution, which was clearly supported by testimonial and documentary evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It was established through testimonial evidence that Remo was walking home when Rebato, after having been handed over the <i>dipang</i>, swiftly and deliberately stabbed Remo, and fatally wounded him, which eventually caused the latter's death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Through these acts, the qualifying circumstance of treachery was attendant in the killing of Remo when the attack was swift, deliberate and unexpected, and affords the hapless victim no chance to resist or escape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>As regards the aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation, this was not attendant in this case. The prosecution failed to establish that there was a previous decision on the part of the accused to commit the crime, and that there was evidence to show that sufficient time had elapsed for Rebato and his co-accused Gunda to decide to commit the crime and reflect on its consequences.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, Rebato appealed to the CA.<br><br><center><b><i>Ruling of the CA</i></b><br></center><br>On appeal, in its Decision dated August 30, 2018, the CA affirmed the conviction by the RTC with modifications:<br><blockquote><b>IN LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court hereby AFFIRMS with MODIFICATlONS</b> the assailed Decision dated June 18, 2015, of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 1, Borongan City, Eastern Samar, in Criminal Case No. 12002.

[2] Imminent unlawful aggression [is] an attack that is impending or at the point of happening; it must not consist in a mere threatening attitude, nor must it be merely imaginary, but must be offensive and positively strong (like aiming a revolver at another with intent to shoot or opening a knife and making a motion as if to attack). Imminent unlawful aggression must not be a mere threatening attitude of the victim, such as pressing his right hand to his hip where a revolver was holstered, accompanied by an angry countenance, or like aiming to throw a pot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>Rebato's testimony provides that after he was struck with water pump pipes outside the bakery, he ran inside the bakery where Gunda handed him the <i>dipang</i>.

Instead of remaining inside the baker to keep himself safe from Remo, Jimmy and Jomar, Rebato used the <i>dipang</i> handed to him to harm Remo. In this case, Rebato caused harm to Remo not as an act of self-defense, but as an act of vengeance.

The stealth, swiftness and methodical manner by which the attack was carried out did not give Remo a chance to evade when Rebato stabbed Remo, below the latter's right nipple of the midclavicular line, and the left quadrant of his abdomen. There is no doubt that Rebato's sudden and unexpected attack upon the victim evidences treachery. The fact that Rebato was facing Remo when the latter was stabbed is of no consequence.

On the other hand, evident premeditation cannot be considered as an aggravating circumstance.
