After the pre-trial, a reverse trial ensued.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The prosecution established the following version of facts:<br><br>Armando and Ruben Archivido (Ruben) are brothers. Their parents owned an eight-hectare parcel of land in San Pascual, Basud, Camarines Norte. Sometime in 1979, the lot was subdivided and each brother was given 2.68 hectares each. However, in 1989, Armando demanded a bigger share. Ruben and their mother Lydia Archivido (Lydia) refused to accede to his demand. Armando was infuriated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The dispute between the brothers dragged for a number of years. On July 2, 2009, the fight escalated and Armando threatened to kill Ruben and his wife Lilia Archivido (Lilia). The incident was recorded in the barangay blotter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>At around 10:00 a.m. of July 31, 2009, while Ruben and Lilia were on their way home after cultivating their land at San Pascual, they chanced upon Armando who was on his way to the mountains. Armando intentionally bumped Lilia, which resulted in an argument. Ruben intervened and urged Armando and Lilia to just move on. They agreed. However, immediately after Ruben and Lilia turned their backs, Armando suddenly hacked Lilia from behind. Upon hearing a thud, Ruben turned around and saw Armando hacking Lilia with his <i><i>bolo</i>.</i> Lilia retaliated but was no match for Armando. She was severely injured and fell on the ground.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Ruben rushed to his wife's aid. While he was removing his raincoat and unloading the cassava he was carrying, Armando suddenly started hacking him, inflicting injuries on his face, shoulders and arms. Then, Armando left to wash his <i><i>bolo</i>.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Ruben left Lilia's side to seek help from people in the barrio. On his way, he met Edgar Ponaya (Edgar), who went to the barangay and reported the matter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Thereafter, Edgar took Ruben to the Camarines Norte Provincial Hospital, where he was treated by Dr. Edmundo Dizon (Dr. Dizon). Dr. Dizon noted that Ruben had six hacking wounds, which caused severe bleeding and would have been fatal if not for immediate medical attention. Ruben was confined for 16 days.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Unfortunately, Lilia succumbed to her injuries. When the barangay officials arrived at the crime scene, they discovered Lilia's lifeless body.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Dr. Jose Magana, Municipal Health Officer of Daet, Camarines Norte conducted a Post-Mortem Examination on Lilia. He noted several hacking wounds on her right leg and left leg, and declared that the cause of death was hemorrhagic shock caused by the wounds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Armando interposed self-defense. He related that he met Lilia and Ruben while he was on his way to the mountain. Lilia threatened him to refrain from testifying in a case that was being filed against her by Glenda Sablawan. He retorted that Lilia should not tell him what to do. When he turned his back to leave, he was suddenly struck with a <i>bolo</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Then, Ruben and Lilia moved towards him with their arms raised and clutching their <i>bolo</i>s. While he was about to draw his <i>bolo</i>, Ruben hit him on his right arm. Ruben tried to hack him several times but he was able to parry the attacks and fight back. Then, Ruben pleaded for him to stop, so he left. He proceeded to the barangay hall of San Pascual to surrender. However, there was no barangay official present. He asked a certain Eduardo to accompany him to the Basud Police Station. On their way, they ran into barangay tanod Morada, who brought him to the police station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>While at the police station, he had the incident recorded in the police blotter. Thereafter, he was taken to the hospital for treatment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Dr. Antonio Dee (Dr. Dee) attended to his wounds. Dr. Dee noted that his injuries were superficial and may not lead to death. He returned to the police station after being discharged from the hospital.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the RTC</b></center><br>On October 10, 2012, the RTC rendered a Joint Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> finding Armando guilty beyond reasonable cloubt of murder and frustrated murder. The RTC held that the prosecution proved all the essential elements of the crimes charged. The RTC rejected Armando's plea of self-defense as well as his claim of voluntary surrender.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the RTC ruling reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, accused ARMANDO ARCHIVIDO y ABENGOZA is hereby found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER in Crimina' Case No. 1393?).

The spouses were blindsided and completely caught off-guard. Lilia was hacked after she had turned her back against Armando.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Armando deliberately and consciously adopted this manner of attack to eliminate any possible risk to himself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>However, the CA opined that the prosecution failed to prove the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation. There was no showing that Armando deliberately and carefully planned his attack against Ruben and Lilia, and that a considerable amount of time lapsed for him to reflect upon the consequences of his act. All that was proved was that he suddenly hacked Lilia and Ruben at the moment they turned their backs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the CA rejected Armando's claim of self-defense, both complete and incomplete. According to the CA, Armando failed to prove that the spouses mounted unlawful aggression against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Similarly, his claim that the spouses ganged up on him was belied by the physical evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Finally, the CA found that Armando was entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender. He immediately went to the barangay hall after the incident to surrender, and he even proceeded to the police station when there were no persons in the barangay hall.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA ruling reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> in view of the foregoing, the Appeal is <b>DISMISSED.</b> The Joint Decision dated October 10,2012 of the Regional Trial Court of Daet, Camarines Norte, Branch 39 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATIONS</b> insofar as the penalties and monetary awards are concerned, <i>viz</i>.:</blockquote><blockquote>In Criminal Case No. 13933, Accused Armando Archivido y Abengoza is hereby found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder.

He claims that Lilia and Ruben attacked him first by hacking the back of his head. Although the wound was later declared to be superficial, at the time of the attack, he honestly believed that his life was in danger, thereby prompting him to retaliate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The means he employed were reasonably necessary to parry the assault. Moreover, he did not cause any sufficient provocation. He merely refused to accede to Lilia's request for him not to testify against her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> He further claims that the threats he allegedly uttered againsi Lilia and Ruben occurred more than one month prior to the incident. No other threats were reported since then.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Alternatively, Armando argues that should he be found guilty, he may only be convicted of homicide and frustrated homicide.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The prosecution failed to establish the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation. He avers that the prosecution's narration of events is unbelievable. If he truly wanted to attack Ruben and Lilia without any danger to himself, then he would have attacked Ruben first, the latter being the stronger opponent, and attack a more delicate part of the body — the head, neck or abdomen.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Neither was the prosecution able to prove that the assault was deliberately and consciously adopted.<br><br>Finally, Armando claims that he is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> He went to the barangay hall immediately after the incident in order to surrender. However, since no one was present thereat, he proceeded to the Basud Police Station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the People, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), counters that Armando failed to prove his plea of complete and incomplete self-defense. His defense was based on his "lone and doubtful testimony" which pales in comparison to the statements of the prosecution witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Likewise, his claim that Ruben and Lilia ganged up on him is unbelievable, and is belied by the physical evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Similarly, the OSG maintains that the attack was attended with treachery and evident premeditation. Armando hacked the spouses as soon as they turned their backs against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> This proves that Armando employed means to ensure the success of his attack with the least harm to himself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Evident premeditation existed considering the Armando had an ongoing dispute with the spouses and even made a threat to kill them. Armando fulfilled his threat by killing Lilia and injuring Ruben.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b></center><br><b><i>Armando is Guilty Beyond<br>Reasonable Doubt of Murder and<br>Frustrated Homicide</i></b><br><br>Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) defines the crime of murder as the unlawful killing of a person, which is not parricide or infanticide, committed with any of the following qualifying circumstances, to wit:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> <b><u>with treachery,</u></b> taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity.<br><br></li><li> in consideration of a price, reward or promise.<br><br></li><li> By means of inundation, fire, poison, explosion, shipwreck, stranding of a vessel, derailment or assault upon a street car or locomotive, fall of an airship, by means of motor vehicles, or with the use of any other means involving great waste and ruin.<br><br></li><li> On occasion of any of the calamities enumerated in the preceding paragraph, or of an earthquake, eruption of a volcano, destructive cyclone, epidemic, or any other public calamity.<br><br></li><li> With evident premeditation.<br><br></li><li> With cruelty, by deliberately and inhumanly augmenting the suffering of the victim, or outraging or scoffing at his person or corpse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (F.mphasis and underscoring supplied)</li></ol></blockquote>Essentially, the elements of murder are: (i) that a person was killed; (ii) that the accused killed him or her; (iii) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the RPC; and (iv) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>It is an elementary rule in criminal law that each of the qualifying circumstances must, be alleged in the Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and must be proven as clearly as the crime itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In the absence of a qualifying circumstance, the crime committed is homicide, not murder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, Armando was indicted for murder qualified by treachery and evident premeditation. Parenthetically, there is treachery or <i>alevosia</i> when the offender commits any of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods or forms to ensure its execution, without risk to himself/herself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> "The essence of treachery is that the attack comes without a warning and in a swift, deliberate, and unexpected manner, affording the hapless, unarmed, and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape the sudden blow."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case No. 13933 for murder, Armando attacked Lilia in a sudden, unexpected and rapid motion. Although Armando and Lilia had a prior argument, Lilia believed that the matter was already settled. Hence, she and Ruben turned their backs against Armando and started walking home. However, in a swift move, and taking advantage of his position, Armando hacked Lilia from behind. The onslaught was so sudden and swift that Lilia had no chance to mount a defense. She had no inkling that an attack was forthcoming and was completely unaware of the imminent peril. The deliberate swiftness of the attack significantly diminished the risk to Armando that may be caused by Lilia's retaliation. Thus, there can be no denying that Armando's attack against Lilia reeks of treachery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Remarkably, in <i>People v. Kalipayan,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the Court held that an attack against a victim whose back was turned against the aggressor is treacherous. This manner of attack is a sign of the accused's conscious choice to employ the specific means and methods to kill the victim. It cannot be regarded as a sudden emotional response.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Similarly, in <i>People v. Saure,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> the Court affirmed the presence of treachery even though there was a prior altercation between the accused and the victim:<br><blockquote>Treachery is evidently present in the instant case as the accused-appellant, stealthily and without warning, rushed towards the victim from behind and stabbed him in the chest. The victim, who was then seated, was not aware of any impending danger. <b>Although there had been prior verbal altercation, the victim had reasons to believe that the matter has already been settled after Alinsub's intervention.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Likewise, in <i>People v. PO3 Feliciano,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> a prior verbal tussle between the accused and the victim did not eliminate treachery. The victim had no reason to believe that he was in danger, considering that the accused left after the squabble.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In the same vein, in <i>People v. Beltran</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> <i>People v. Jabian</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> <i>People v.

Montemayor,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> treachery was appreciated considering that the assault took place after the altercation had ceased. Said altercation was no longer regarded as a warning of the oncoming onslaught. In <i><i>People v. Vallespin,</i></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the Court clarified that a prior altercation negates treachery only insofar as it forewarned the victim about the impending danger.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Furthermore in <i>People v. Coscos,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the Court likewise considered the nature of the fight, noting that "it was not intense to provoke a shooting," and could not have served as a potent warning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Applied to the case at bar, the testimonies of both the defense and the prosecution reveal that the altercation was too shallow to have served as a sufficient warning of a life-threatening peril. Armando related that the altercation originated from his refusal to accede to Lilia's request for him not to testify against her. Meanwhile, Ruben claimed that the quarrel erupted because Armando bumped into Lilia when their paths crossed. In both instances, the reasons behind the squabble were too shallow and juvenile to have warned Lilia that her life was in serious danger.<br><br>Concededly, the Court is aware of its pronouncements in the cases of <i>People v. Antonio</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> <i>People v. Placer,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and <i>People v. Cayabyab,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> where it held that treachery cannot be appreciated in cases where a prior altercation preceded the attack. It bears stressing that in those cases, the fight between the accused and the victim was ongoing, such that the victim was aware of the imminent danger. In contrast, in the instant case, the squabble between Armando and Lilia had ended. Lilia believed that the matter was settled, and thus, proceeded to leave. Armando grabbed this opportunity and surreptitiously attacked Lilia.<br><br>Finally, the fact that the accused suffered no injuries, evidences treachery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Here, Lilia died due to severe blood loss caused by the severity of her wounds, whereas Armando was practically unscathed.<br><br><b>However, the same circumstances do not obtain in Criminal Case No. 13937 for frustrated murder against Ruben.</b><br><br>The facts show that after Lilia and Ruben turned their backs against Armando and proceeded on their way, Ruben suddenly heard a loud thud, which prompted him to turn around. Then, he saw Armando attacking Lilia. He immediately rushed to Lilia's aid and tried to stop Armando. Ruben's narration is enlightening:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">PROSECUTOR APUYA:</td></tr><tr><td width="5%" valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td width="95%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>And when you met Armando with your wife walking ahead of you, what happened next?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>Armando bumped my wife, they had an argument.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td> How far were you then from them while they were arguing?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>Around two (2) arms length, ma'am.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>And what did you do when you saw that they were arguing?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>I told my wife not to argue with him because she will get nothing.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td> And what was your wife's response, if any?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>I likewise told Armando to proceed to where he was going and the two (2) of us, me and my wife turn[ed] our back[s].</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>Were you walking side by side when you turned your back at Armando?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td><p>Yes, ma'am.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td> And what happened after that?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>While our back was turned against him, I heard a thud, and when I turned around I saw that my wife was hacked by Armando hitting her - (witness pointing to his left ankle)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>And upon seeing that Armando hacked your wife what did you do?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>When I was removing the cassava from my back he suddenly hack[ed] me hitting my two (2) hands.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>Why is it that you were hit on your arms what are you doing?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>After I was about to remove my things at the back he started to hack me so I was not able to do anything but parried [sic] his hack.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>How many times did he hack you, Mr. witness?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td> Six (6) ma'am.

He turned around, saw the onslaught, and was forewarned of the impending danger. He was aware that in saving Lilia, he would likewise be vulnerable to an attack by Armando.<br><br>Significantly, in <i>People v. Se</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> the Court stressed that once it appears that the victim was forewarned of the danger he was in, and instead of fleeing from it, met it and was killed as a result, then the qualifying circumstance of treachery cannot be appreciated. Treachery presupposes a sudden, unexpected, and unforeseen attack on the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Similarly, in <i>People v. Casas</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> the Court held that there can be no treachery if the victim knew of the impending danger to his life, and was fully aware of the peril he may be faced with:<br><blockquote>Under these circumstances, it is the Court's observation that Joel was fully aware of the danger posed in assisting Eligio. He knew that Casas was armed with a knife and had just used the same on Eligio. Joel elected to intervene, and even armed himself with a bamboo pole. Accordingly, it is rather obvious that Joel was aware of the danger to his life, x x x Thus, insofar as the incidents in Crim. Case No. 136842 go, the Court downgrades the conviction to the crime of Homicide, x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote>In <i>People v.

Evident premeditation cannot be presumed in the absence of evidence showing when and how the accused planned, and prepared for the crime, and that a sufficient amount of time had lapsed between his determination and execution.
