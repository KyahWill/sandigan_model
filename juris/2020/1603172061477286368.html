While in Japan, she remitted cash to her PS Bank savings account, and issued checks for the support of her children and the amortization of a house and lot she purchased. On July 27, 2006, Sakata went back to the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p>On August 7, 2006, Sakata went to PS Bank to close her checking account and surrender unused checks.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> When Sakata had her passbook updated, she noticed that the deposit and withdrawal entries from May 1, 2003 to September 16, 2005 were "lumped in one entry" instead of having a "per transaction entry."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> This prompted Sakata to request for a copy of the itemized transaction entries from October 1, 2004 to September 16, 2005 as she had trouble verifying the bank transactions. However, PS Bank denied her requests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p>Upon updating her savings account, Sakata was surprised to find out that instead of P1,000,000.00, she only had a remaining balance of P391.00. She also discovered that there was a deposit of P4,488,197.01 and a withdrawal of P4,751.112.42 both made on September 16, 2005. Sakata informed the teller that she could not have made those transactions as she was in Japan during that time, but she was only asked to return to the bank.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p>Sometime in January 2007, Sakata talked to the PS Bank branch manager who instructed her to write a letter requesting for "specimen signature cards for her savings and current accounts, statement of account for her current account, printout of her passbook, and the original checks which were encashed and paid by the bank."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> On April 30, 2007, PS Bank provided Sakata with copies of her current account statement and some checks, as well as two original checks.

She claimed that she never possessed a checkbook bearing the serial numbers of the 25 checks, and the entries and signatures on them were all forged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Upon demand, PS Bank refused to give Sakata the original copies of the 25 checks, which were: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="1"> <tbody><tr> <td width="37%"><div align="center">Date Debited/ Paid</div></td> <td width="35%"><div align="center">Check Number</div></td> <td width="28%"><div align="center">Amount</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">12-15-04</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159654 </div></td> <td><div align="right">P 150,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">01-12-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159655 </div></td> <td><div align="right">30,000 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">01-25-05 </div></td> <td><div align="center">159656 </div></td> <td><div align="right">30,000 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">02-10-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159658 </div></td> <td><div align="right">70,000</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">02-11-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159659</div></td> <td> <div align="right">10,000 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">02-21-05 </div></td> <td><div align="center">159660</div></td> <td> <div align="right">40,000</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">03-17-05 </div></td> <td><div align="center">159662 </div></td> <td><div align="right">40,000</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">03-23-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159663 </div></td> <td><div align="right">16,000 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">13-30-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159664 </div></td> <td><div align="right">20,000 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">04-07-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159665</div></td> <td> <div align="right">20,000</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">04-19-05 </div></td> <td><div align="center">159666</div></td> <td> <div align="right">40,000 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">05-12-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159672</div></td> <td> <div align="right">50,000 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">05-19-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159673</div></td> <td> <div align="right">30,000</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">06-06-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159675</div></td> <td> <div align="right">60,000</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">06-17-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159677</div></td> <td> <div align="right">40,000</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">07-07-05 </div></td> <td><div align="center">159681 </div></td> <td><div align="right">320,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">07-12-05 </div></td> <td><div align="center">159682</div></td> <td> <div align="right">10,000 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">07-18-05 </div></td> <td><div align="center">159683 </div></td> <td><div align="right">10,000</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">08-03-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159684</div></td> <td> <div align="right">20,000</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">08-17-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159685 </div></td> <td><div align="right">20,000</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">09-01-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159686 </div></td> <td><div align="right">25,000</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">09-16-05</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159688 </div></td> <td><div align="right">20,000</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">05-17-06</div></td> <td> <div align="center">159692 </div></td> <td><div align="right">10,000</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">06-30-06 </div></td> <td><div align="center">159694</div></td> <td> <div align="right">5,000.00 </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><div align="center">07-08-06 </div></td> <td><div align="center">159698 </div></td> <td><div align="right">1,500.00</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"><div align="center"><strong>Total Amount </strong></div></td> <td><div align="right"><strong>P 1,087,500.00</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>On March 14, 2008, Sakata, through her counsel, made a formal request asking PS Bank to hand over the 25 checks and the specimen signature cards.

They claimed the 25 checks were validly encashed as they were verified by their bank personnel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p> <p>In her Reply, Sakata denied that she authorized her mother to request and receive additional checkbooks and monthly bank statements from PS Bank.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p> <p> In its June 27, 2013 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Regional Trial Court of Imus, Cavite, Branch 20 ruled in favor of Sakata and ordered PS Bank to pay Sakata P1,087,500.00 plus attorney's fees.

She claims that she never authorized petitioner to accept the signature "C.

Meanwhile, questions of fact—or those which require a review of the evidence to determine "the truth or falsehood of alleged facts"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> or involve the correctness of the lower courts' appreciation of the evidence—are not proper in a Petition for Review on Certiorari. The function of the Court, not being a trier of facts, is limited to reviewing errors of law committed by the lower courts. Thus, it accords finality to the factual findings of the trial court, especially when such findings are affirmed by the appellate court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></p><p> While the general rule admits of exceptions,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> the party raising questions of fact must not only allege the exception but should also prove and substantiate that its case clearly falls under the exception .<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p><p> Forgery is the "counterfeiting of any writing, consisting in the signing of another's name with intent to defraud[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Since it is not presumed, forgery "must be proved with clear, positive and convincing evidence"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> by the party alleging it. Whether forgery exists on the checks is a question of fact, which requires reevaluation of evidence best left to the lower courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></p><p> In this case, we find no reason to depart from the findings of the trial court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, that respondent was able to establish the forgery of her signature on the questioned checks. These factual findings are binding and conclusive upon us:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> In the present case, we hold that Sakata established that there was forgery of the drawer's signature on the check. </p> <p> Sakata could not have issued in [sic] the checks in question inasmuch as she was in Osaka, Japan at the time they were allegedly issued. An examination of the Passport of Sakata shows that she left the Philippines on May 4, 2003 and returned to the country only July 27, 2006. There were no other records in her Passport that she has flown in and out of the country between May 4, 2003 to July 27, 2006. Hence, it was physically impossible for Sakata to have issued the questioned 25 checks dated December 15, 2004 and July 8, 2006. </p> <p> As the trial court correctly opined: </p> <blockquote> <p> "Based on the evidence adduced by the parties, the Court finds that plaintiff was able to present preponderance of evidence to prove her case. At the center of this controversy is the allegation of plaintiff that her signatures in the bank records and several checks were forged causing her to lose about a Million Peso in her savings account from which the funds were withdrawn. As between the narration of facts as stated by the plaintiff and the version of the defendant bank and its witnesses, the Court is more inclined to believe plaintiff's version.</p> <p>. . . .</p> <p> The witnesses of [defendant] bank testified that they compared the alleged signature of the plaintiff in the checks with the second copy of the updated specimen signature card. Defendant bank's witness alleged that the specimen signature card is updated every two (2) years from the time of opening the account. When plaintiff opened her accounts in 2004, the update of her specimen signature was due in 2004. However, as clearly established by plaintiff, she was out of the country at the time and she only returned in 2006. Verily, the updated specimen signature card allegedly issued by plaintiff upon which defendant bank's employees referred to is dubious. A closer look at the three (3) signature cards would show that: (1) two (2) original specimen signature cards were signed by plaintiff with her full name "Maria Cecilia E. Sakata"; (2) the allegedly updated signature cards was signed with "C. Sakata''. However, defendant bank failed to present any credible witness to testify as to when the said specimen signature card was updated. In addition, the contents of the updated signature card are highly questionable based on the following reasons: it lacks vital information such as the complete current account number of the plaintiff; the passport details of the plaintiff is incorrect with respect to its expiry date; no updated photograph of the plaintiff was submitted; and no date of execution of the said document was placed on the specimen [signature] card to confirm when was it executed. . .<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Petitioner insists that the finding of forgery was based on assumptions and conjectures which falls under the exceptions allowing questions of fact to be raised under a Petition for Review on Certiorari. However, petitioner failed to prove and substantiate how its case clearly falls under the exception. Aside from alleging that the lower courts' findings were grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures, petitioner offered nothing else to substantiate its claim. </p><p> On the contrary, it is actually petitioner who dwelled on speculations. In its Petition, it claimed that physical presence is not indispensable in the requisition and issuance of checks. It posits that "[r]espondent may [have] used the service of private and public couriers to deliver the checks to the named payee."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> It added that "[t]he [checks] may also be sent through somebody close to respondent who went back to the Philippines"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and that "[i]t is also possible for respondent to issue postdated checks before leaving for Japan."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> However, these allegations were not substantiated by evidence. </p><p> Petitioner's allegation that respondent authorized her mother, Gemma Bartolome, to receive the two checkbooks containing Check Nos. 159601 to 159650 and 159651 to 159700, and the monthly statements of account issued to her<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> is also mere speculation since it was not duly proven. Further, petitioner failed to present any credible testimony as to the circumstances of the execution of the Updated Specimen Signature Card on the basis of which the 25 questioned checks were encashed. It is settled that "the party alleging a fact has the burden of proving it and a mere allegation cannot take the place of evidence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p><p> That respondent never authorized anyone to issue or deliver the questioned checks is further bolstered by the stipulations in the Pre-Trial Order. There, petitioner, through its counsel, admitted that "the signatures of the drawer on the twenty five (25) questioned checks are not the authorized signatures of the [respondent] as shown and indicated in the specimen signature card of the [respondent] for her savings account and current account."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> </p><p>Considering that the forgery of respondent's signature in the questioned checks was established, Section 23 of the Negotiable Instruments Law is clearly applicable: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 23. <i>Forged Signature; Effect of</i>. — When a signature is forged or made without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to be, it is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the instrument, or to give a discharge therefor, or to enforce payment thereof against any party thereto, can be acquired through or under such signature, unless the party against whom it is sought to enforce such right is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority.</p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, "a forged signature is a real or absolute defense, and a person whose signature on a negotiable instrument is forged is deemed to have never become a party thereto and to have never consented to the contract that allegedly gave rise to it."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> As payment made under a forged signature is ineffectual, the drawee bank cannot charge it to the drawer's account because it is in a superior position to detect forgery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> "The forgery may be so near like the genuine as to defy detection by the depositor himself, and yet the bank is liable to the depositor if it pays the check."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> Banking institutions are imbued with public interest, and the trust and confidence of the public to them are of paramount importance. As such, they are expected to exercise the highest degree of diligence, and high standards of integrity and performance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> "By the nature of its functions, a bank is under obligation to treat the accounts of its depositors with meticulous care, always having in mind the fiduciary nature of their relationship."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Thus, the prime duty of a bank is to ascertain the genuineness of the signature of the drawer or the depositor on the check being encashed, with reasonable business prudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup></p><p> On the other hand, negligence is the "omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided by those considerations that ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing of something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> The issue of whether a party is negligent is a question of fact, which is to be determined after taking into account the particulars of each case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></p><p> To reiterate, factual findings of the trial court, particularly when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are binding upon this Court. They are entitled to utmost respect and even finality, if there is no palpable error that would warrant a reversal of the lower courts' assessment of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup></p><p> While petitioner contends that it made a signature verification procedure to confirm respondent's signature on the disputed checks, it still failed to detect the 25 instances of forgery and omitted the degree of diligence required of a bank. Petitioner was clearly negligent in encashing the forged checks when it based the examination of respondent's signature on the questionable Updated Specimen Signature Card. As found by the lower courts, the Updated Specimen Signature Card is dubious because it lacked vital information such as its date of execution, Sakata's complete account number, her correct passport details, and her updated photograph.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></p><p> "A bank is bound to know the signatures of its customers; and if it pays a forged check, it must be considered as making the payment out of its own funds, and cannot ordinarily charge the amount so paid to the account of the depositor whose name was forged."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Being negligent in failing to detect the forgery, petitioner bears the loss.</p><p> However, petitioner insists that respondent should contribute to the loss considering that she was also negligent in failing to detect the unauthorized transactions in her account despite the monthly statements issued by petitioner. It also claims that her mother was the one who presented and negotiated the questioned checks.</p><p> "Section 23 of the Negotiable Instruments Law bars a party from setting up the defense of forgery if it is guilty of negligence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> However, we find that respondent is not negligent in this case. Petitioner failed to prove its contentions that respondent received the monthly statements, and that her mother received, forged and presented the questioned checks. Thus, there is no need to discuss the applicability of Section 14 of the Negotiable Instruments Law.</p><p> The presumption remains that every person takes ordinary care of his or her concerns, and that the ordinary course of business has been followed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> "Negligence is not presumed, but must be proven by him [or her] who alleges it."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Here, petitioner was unable to dispute the presumption of ordinary care exercised by respondent.</p><p> Furthermore, in <i>Philippine National Bank v. Quimpo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> the respondent's act of leaving his checkbook in the car with his longtime classmate and friend while he went out for a short while cannot be considered negligence sufficient to excuse the bank from its own negligence, because respondent had no reason to suspect that his friend would breach his trust.</p><p> Similarly in this case, even assuming that her mother indeed presented the questioned checks while respondent was in Japan, she cannot be held negligent in entrusting the same to her mother.</p><p> Having established the forgery of respondent's signatures and petitioner's negligence in failing to detect the forgery on the checks, the checks are wholly inoperative. Thus, only petitioner is liable for making payments on the forged checks.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
