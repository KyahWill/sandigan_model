Nevertheless, where only a portion of a certain property is to be acquired, the owner is not restricted only to compensation for the part actually taken, but is <u><b>likewise entitled to recover consequential damages for the remainder of the property, which may suffer an impairment or decrease in value as an incidental result of the expropriation, provided such fact is proven by sufficient evidence</b></u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The award of consequential damages is recognized under Section 6, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court, which reads:<br><blockquote>Section 6. <i>Proceedings by Commissioners</i>. - Before entering upon the performance of their duties, the commissioners shall take and subscribe an oath that they will faithfully perform their duties as commissioners, which oath shall be filed in court with the other proceedings in the case. Evidence may be introduced by either party before the commissioners who are authorized to administer oaths on hearings before them, and the commissioners shall, unless the parties consent to the contrary, after due notice to the parties to attend, view and examine the property sought to be expropriated and its surroundings, and may measure the same, after which either party may, by himself or counsel, argue the case. <b>The commissioners shall assess the consequential damages to the property not taken and deduct from such consequential damages the consequential benefits to be derived by the owner from the public use or purpose of the property taken, the operation of its franchise by the corporation or the carrying on of the business of the corporation or person taking the property. But in no case shall the consequential benefits assessed exceed the consequential damages assessed, or the owner be deprived of the actual value of his property so taken.</b> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In this case, records<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> show that the value of the affected lots was impaired on account of their close proximity to the power posts, transmission lines, and other facilities installed on the subject lots, which constrained the use of the properties, and created a perceived fear of radiation, electrocution, and other health risks in the minds of prospective buyers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Notably, the RTC observed that "given their nature, high powered transmission lines would necessarily diminish - if not entirely damage - the value and use of the property as well as endanger lives and limbs[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and "the existence of [NAPOCOR'S] posts and high tension transmission lines which traversed [petitioners'] properties would impair their prices or value to some extent."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> This finds support in the Court Commission's Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> dated October 13, 2008, which was quoted and adopted by the RTC, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Based upon an analysis of the prevailing land usage in the neighborhood and the property itself, we are of the opinion that the following land use would represent the highest and best use of the property:<br><br><b>Before the taking</b> - the whole property could be developed to a pleasant residential subdivision with a view of the adjoining properties.<br><br><b>After the taking</b> - portions of the property have been occupied, segregated and affected by power transmission lines that <b>deprived the property owners from developing the whole property to a pleasant residential subdivision without any eye sore or danger of being affected by the radiation emitted by the power lines</b>. The damage caused to the adjoining area affected by the power lines is due to <b>the fear in the marketplace or the external obsolescence caused by the proximity to the power lines</b> and not due to corona ions that can risk causing childhood leukemia and other illnesses like cancer to both children and adults.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>x x x [S]everance damage is the decrease in market value of the remaining property of an owner caused by the taking of the part of his property. In this exercise, severance damage is noted on the remaining land area.<br><br>The severance damage on the remaining land area is based on the reduction of value in the highest and best use of that portion of the property that has been segregated from the main parcel of land thus making it less desirable to develop to a residential subdivision.<br><br><b>The external obsolescence on the adjoining property is based on the fear in the market place due to the proximity of the power transmission lines. This is depreciation on property values similar to the effect of the presence of a squatter colony, sidewalk vendors, railroad tracks, airport runway, noise or polluting factory or heavy traffic.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>In previous cases, the Court has recognized the payment of consequential damages to compensate property owners - as petitioners in this case - for <b>the adverse effect caused by power transmission lines to "the market value of the land x x x [considering that] potential buyers x x x would shy away from building their houses in the proximity of such high voltage transmission lines."</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Accordingly, the payment of consequential damages in favor of petitioners is in order.<br><br>This notwithstanding, the Court agrees with the CA in holding that the consequential damages in an amount equivalent to 10% of the fair market value of the affected lots are speculative and without basis. As the CA correctly held, there appears to be no reliable and actual data supporting the estimated valuation fixed by the RTC. Thus, the award of consequential damages in the amount of P26,538,415.68 must be set aside.<br><br>However, the Court finds it unnecessary to order the remand of the case to determine the proper amount of consequential damages since jurisprudence has already provided for a reasonable basis to compute the same in similar cases. In <i>NAPOCOR v. Marasigan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (<i>Marasigan</i>), the Court had fixed the amount of consequential damages at the rate of 50% of the BIR zonal valuation of the affected property. Notably, <i>Marasigan</i> similarly involved the expropriation of an easement of right of way brought about by the installation of transmission lines, as in this case. As observed by the Court, the said amount was derived from the recommendation of the appraisal committee which, after ocular inspection, had evaluated the effects of installing transmission lines to the value of the properties, <i>i.e.</i>, that they may no longer be used either for commercial or residential purposes, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Respondents in this case claim consequential damages for the areas in between the transmission lines which were rendered unfit for use. "Dangling" areas, as defined under National Power Board Resolution No. 94-313, refer to those remaining small portions of the land not traversed by the transmission line project but which are nevertheless rendered useless in view of the presence of the transmission lines. The appraisal committee determined the total dangling area to be 41,867 square meters and consequently recommended the payment of consequential damages equivalent to 50% of the BIR zonal value per square meter or for a total amount of P22,227,800.<br><br>In arriving at its recommendation to pay consequential damages, the appraisal committee conducted an ocular inspection of the properties and observed that the areas before and behind the transmission lines could no longer be used either for commercial or residential purposes. Despite this determination, NPC insists that the affected areas cannot be considered as "dangling" as these may still be used for agricultural purposes. In so arguing, NPC loses sight of the undisputed fact that the transmission lines conveying high-tension current posed danger to the lives and limbs of respondents and to potential farm workers, making the affected areas no longer suitable even for agricultural production. Thus, the Court finds no reason to depart from the assessment of the appraisal committee, as affirmed and adopted by the RTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>The foregoing formula was then adopted in the fairly recent case of <i>National Transmission Corporation v. Lacson-De Leon</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (<i>Lacson-De Leon</i>), wherein it was held that "the in ore reasonable computation is the one laid down in <i>NAPOCOR v. Marasigan</i>, which is 50% of the BIR zonal valuation of the affected property,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><b><i>The award of consequential damages is limited to 50% of the BIR zonal valuation of the property segregated by the electric transmission lines</i></b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x In <i>NAPOCOR v. Marasigan</i>, the Court awarded consequential damages equivalent to 50% of the BIR zonal valuation of the property segregated by the electric transmission lines, thus:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>Respondents in this case claim consequential damages for the areas in between the transmission lines which were rendered unfit for use.

The appraisal committee determined the total dangling area to be 41,867 square meters and consequently recommended the payment of consequential damages equivalent to <b>50% of the BIR zonal value per square meter</b> or for a total amount of P22,227,800.

In so arguing, NPC loses sight of the undisputed fact that the transmission lines conveying high-tension current posed danger to the lives and limbs of respondents and to potential farm workers, making the affected areas no longer suitable even for agricultural production. Thus, the Court finds no reason to depart from the assessment of the appraisal committee, as affirmed and adopted by the RTC.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><b>While the award of consequential damages is proper, the Court finds the amount of 10% of the fair market value of the segregated property without basis. Rather, the more reasonable computation is the one laid down in <i>NAPOCOR v. Marasigan</i>, which is <u>50% of the BIR zonal valuation of the affected property</u>.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></blockquote>To note, <i>Lacson-De Leon</i> involved the same 138 KV Bacolod-Cadiz Transmission Line for the Negros IV-Panay Project, as in this case. Also, similar to this case, the Court had set aside exactly the same valuation of 10% of the properties' fair market value for being without basis. Hence, finding no cogent reason to the contrary, the formula set by these cases is herein adopted.<br><br>Applying the foregoing, the award of consequential damages should therefore yield an amount of <b>P3,798,480.00</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> taking into consideration the undisputed BIR zonal valuation of P17.00/sq. m.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> for the affected lots<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> at the time the complaint was filed on September 7, 2001. In this regard, it bears pointing out that consequential damages, being a component of just compensation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> should be determined based on the value of the properties "as of the date of the taking x x x or the filing of the complaint for expropriation, <b>whichever came first</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Here, the filing of the expropriation complaint evidently preceded the actual taking of the properties on December 19, 2003. Therefore, the BIR zonal valuation prevailing at such earlier point in time should be the proper basis in determining the amount of consequential damages.<br><br>For another, petitioners contend that the CA erred in failing to impose legal interest on the award of just compensation. To recount, the CA held that since petitioners failed to appeal the RTC Decision which was silent on legal interest, the same was already final as to them. While it is a basic rule that "a decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable[,] and may no longer be modified in any respect even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact or law,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the Court has, in exceptional and compelling cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> relaxed its rigid application to serve substantial justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Among others, in the case of <i>Apo Fruits Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> <b>the Court relaxed the doctrine of immutability of judgment and ordered the imposition of legal interest on the just compensation award</b>. The Court reasoned that despite the immutability doctrine, the award of legal interest remains warranted <b>in deference to the constitutional right of owners to receive the fair and full amount of "just" compensation</b> for property taken by the State, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Apart from the requirement that compensation for expropriated land must be fair and reasonable, compensation, to be "just," <b>must also be made without delay. Without prompt payment, compensation cannot be considered "just" if the property is immediately taken as the property owner suffers the immediate deprivation of both his land and its fruits or income.</b><br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>We recognized in <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i> [433 Phil. 106 (2002)] the <b>need for prompt payment and the necessity of the payment of interest to compensate for any delay in the payment of compensation for property already taken</b>. We ruled in this case that:<br><blockquote>The constitutional limitation of "just compensation" is considered to be the sum equivalent to the market value of the property, broadly described to be the price fixed by the seller in open market in the usual and ordinary course of legal action and competition or the fair value of the property as between one who receives, and one who desires to sell, i[f] fixed at the time of the actual taking by the government. Thus, <b>if property is taken for public use before compensation is deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the case, the final compensation must include interest[s] on its just value to be computed from the time the property is taken to the time when compensation is actually paid or deposited with the court.</b> In fine, between the taking of the property and the actual payment, <b>legal interest[s] accrue in order to place the owner in a position as good as (but not better than) the position he was in before the taking occurred</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br></blockquote><div align="center">x x x x<br></div><br>As a rule, <b>a final judgment may no longer be altered, amended or modified</b>, even if the alteration, amendment or modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law and regardless of what court, be it the highest Court of the land, rendered it. In the past, however, we have <u><b>recognized exceptions to this rule by reversing judgments and recalling their entries in the interest of substantial justice and where special and compelling reasons called for such actions</b></u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br><u><b>That the issues posed by this case are of transcendental importance is not hard to discern from these discussions. A constitutional limitation, guaranteed under no less than the all-­important Bill of Rights, is at stake in this case: how can compensation in an eminent domain be "just" when the payment for the compensation for property already taken has been unreasonably delayed?</b></u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote>Further, in the same case, the Court discussed that a contrary ruling denying interest in the just compensation award would not only be an aberration of our settled jurisprudence on the matter but also run counter to the societal objective of agrarian reform:<br><blockquote>As duly noted in the above discussions, this issue is not one of first impression in our jurisdiction; the consequences of delay in the payment of just compensation have been settled by this Court in past rulings. Our settled jurisprudence on the issue alone accords this case primary importance as a contrary ruling would unsettle, on the flimsiest of grounds, all the rulings we have established in the past.<br><br>More than the stability of our jurisprudence, the matter before us is of transcendental importance to the nation because of the subject matter involved - agrarian reform, a societal objective that the government has unceasingly sought to achieve in the past half century. This reform program and its objectives would suffer a major setback if the government falters or is seen to be faltering, wittingly or unwittingly, through lack of good faith in implementing the needed reforms. Truly, agrarian reform is so important to the national agenda that the Solicitor General, no less, pointedly linked agricultural lands, its ownership and abuse, to the idea of revolution. This linkage, to our mind, remains valid even if the landowner, not the landless farmer, is at the receiving end of the distortion of the agrarian reform program.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x [R]ules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. Their strict and rigid application, which would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, must always be eschewed. Even the Rules of Court reflects this principle. The power to suspend or even disregard rules can be so pervasive and compelling as to alter even that which this Court itself had already declared to be final.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, in light of the foregoing, legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum (p.a.) <u>from the time of actual taking</u>, <i>i.e.</i>, December 19, 2003, up to June 30, 2013, and thereafter, at 6% p.a. until full payment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> should be imposed on the unpaid balance of the just compensation in the amount of <b>P13,473,408.53</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> as well as on the consequential damages in the amount of <b>P3,798,480.00</b>. To be sure, the delay in the payment of just compensation amounts to an effective forbearance of money on the part of the State<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> that "accrues as a matter of law and follows as a matter of course from the landowner's right to be placed in as good a position as money can accomplish, <b>as of the date of taking</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Hence, the award of legal interest is but proper in this case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>.
