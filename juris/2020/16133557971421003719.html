				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before
 Us is an administrative complaint<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font>&nbsp; for disbarment filed by Fatima S. 
Ingram (complainant) against Atty. Jose Q. Lorica IV (respondent).<br><br><div align="center"><b>Facts</b><br></div><br>The
 records show that on August 4, 2004, the spouses Victor Ferdinand B. 
Blanco and Rizza O. Blanco (spouses Blanco) executed a promissory note<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[2]</sup></font> 
in favor of the spouses John Ingram and complainant (collectively, 
spouses Ingram). The promissory note was notarized by respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>When the spouses Blanco defaulted in payment, the spouses Ingram instituted the following actions:<br><blockquote>a)
 Criminal Case No. 13757 for Estafa, which was dismissed for want of 
probable cause, the case being purely civil in nature and not criminal;<br><br>b) Criminal&nbsp; Case Nos.&nbsp; 21381&nbsp;&nbsp; and 21382 for violation&nbsp; of Batas Pambama Bilang 22; and,<br><br>c) Civil Case No.&nbsp; U-8268 for collection of sum of money with damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>The
 spouses Blanco then engaged the legal services of respondent to 
represent them in the foregoing cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[5]</sup></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);"></sup><br>The instant controversy arose when 
respondent, as counsel of the spouses Blanco, filed an Answer<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[6]</sup></font> to the 
civil complaint, wherein the validity of the promissory note was raised 
as an issue. Paragraph 3 thereof alleged that the execution of the 
subject promissory note was attended with coercion, threats, 
intimidation and the like, <i>viz.:</i><br><blockquote>3.
 That paragraphs 3 and 4 are DENIED, the truth of the matter being that 
there should be an accounting to be made by both parties to arrive at an
 actual obligation of herein defendants. The rest of the allegations are
 likewise DENIED for lack of knowledge and information sufficient to 
form a belief thereon. <b><u>The execution of the alleged promissory 
note was without due regard to the defendants' pleas at the time as they
 were subjected to coercion, threats, intimidation and the like, thus 
defendant Victor Ferdinand Blanco was forced to sign the 
same</u>[.]</b> xxx<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>Along the same line, the pre-trial brief<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[8]</sup></font> filed by respondent in behalf of the spouses Blanco stated, among others:<br><blockquote>5.
 Whether or not plaintiffs were made aware of the financial situation 
[of] herein defendants and requested the restructuring of their 
agreement so as for them to be able to settle their obligation unto the 
plaintiffs but the latter denied such request and instead, <u><b>sent
 coercive and threatening communications unto the defendants, who were 
forced to execute the subject promissory notef</b>.[.]</u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </blockquote>The
 spouses Ingram were thus prompted to move for the disqualification of 
the respondent to act as counsel for the spouses Blanco in Civil Case 
No. U-8268.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Thereafter,
 complainant filed the instant complaint for disbarment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> docketed as CBD Case 
No 06-1863. Complainant posits that respondent, as the person who 
notarized the promissory note, is estopped from assailing the validity 
thereof inasmuch as he certified that the maker thereof acknowledged 
before him that the instrument is the latter's own free will and 
voluntary act and deed. Complainant also filed an administrative case, 
docketed as Administrative Case No. U-22.1, for the revocation of 
respondent's notarial appointment before the office of the Executive 
Judge of the Regional Trial Court, Urdaneta City.<sup style="COLOR: 
RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Later, in her position 
paper<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> in this 
disbarment case, complainant likewise accused respondent of committing 
acts of dishonesty and deceit. According to the complainant, paragraph 
2(d) of the promissory note provides:<br><blockquote>d) Any and all payments 
should be made in Australian Currency as described in paragraphs 1 and 2
 and as such, the exchange rate will not affect the aforecited payment. 
Should it become necessary to bank any of the cheques for collection, we
 shall be held liable for any difference between the current rate at the
 time of banking and the current rate of P38.00 per Australian Dollar as
 used in the drawing of cheques.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>To assail the above stipulation, 
respondent cited Article 1250 of the Civil Code in his clients' Answer 
in Civil Case No. U-8268 in the following manner:<br><blockquote>14.
 That relative to the stipulation on the exchange rate on the subject 
promissory note, it is but imperative that the pertinent provisions of 
Article 1250 of the Civil Code of the Philippines be noted herein, to 
wit:<br><br>In case of an extraordinary inflation or deflation of the 
currency stipulated should supervene, the value of the currency at the 
time of the establishment of the obligation shall be the basis of [the] 
payment[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>Similarly, in the Pre-Trial Brief he prepared for the spouses Blanco, he stated:<br><blockquote>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STATEMENT OF ISSUES<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><blockquote>6.
 Whether or not it is but imperative that the pertinent provisions of 
Article 1250 of the Civil Code of the Philippines be noted relative to 
the stipulation on the exchange rate on the subject promissory note, 
that is, "In case of an extraordinary inflation or deflation of the 
currency stipulated should supervene, the value of the currency at the 
time of the establishment of the obligation shall be the basis of [the] 
payment[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>Meanwhile, Article 1250 of the Civil Code in its entirety reads:<br><blockquote>Article
 1250. In case an extraordinary inflation or deflation of the currency 
stipulated should supervene, the value of the currency at the time of 
the establishment of the obligation shall be the basis of the payment, 
unless there is an agreement to the contrary.</blockquote>According
 to the complainant, respondent intentionally and deliberately omitted 
the phrase <b>"unless there is an agreement to the 
contrary,'"'</b> in an attempt to put in issue the stipulated 
exchange rate in the promissory note and to mislead the complainant as 
to the complete thought provided in Article 1250 of the Civil Code.<br><br>On
 the other hand, in his Verified Answer<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0,
 0);">[17]</sup> to the disbarment complaint, the respondent 
claims that it was only at the time when he prepared the Answer in Civil
 Case No. U-8268 that he learned that the spouses Ingram employed 
coercion, threats and intimidation upon his clients before, during and 
after the execution of the promissory note. He attached copies of: the 
Police Blotter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 dated March 1, 2005, stating that the spouses Ingram "allegedly 
threatened [Mr. Blanco] to be killed, putting him into great fear and 
mental anguish;" the document denominated as "Chronological Events of
 Grave Threats issued by Sps. John and Fatima Ingram against Victor 
Blanco"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> 
listing the alleged incidents from November 21, 2004 to February 28, 
2005, when the spouses Ingram threatened the lives of the spouses 
Blanco; and, the Police Blotter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[20]</sup> dated August 13, 2005, stating that the 
complainant allegedly threatened to drive his business bankrupt and 
remarked in an angry voice <i>"umalis kayudtan ta awan ti kiiarta 
da ditan."</i> According to respondent, he committed no dishonesty
 in the preparation of the answer in the civil case and simply relied in
 good faith on the narration of facts of his clients. As a lawyer, he 
deemed it imperative to raise the foregoing defenses in order to protect
 his clients' interest. He likewise asserts that, in any case, he had 
already withdrawn his appearance from the civil case with the conformity
 of the spouses Blanco.<br><br><b>Findings and Recommendation</b><br><br>In
 a Report and Recommendation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[21]</sup> dated 3 August 2009, the Integrated Bar of the 
Philippines (IBP) Investigating Commissioner found that respondent did 
not commit a violation when he represented the spouses Blanco in Civil 
Case No. U-8268 and assailed the validity of the promissory note that he
 himself notarized. He opined that complainant cannot validly invoke the
 doctrine of estoppel against respondent, since the latter had no 
knowledge of the alleged threat, coercion and intimidation when he 
notarized the promissory note, and since complainant failed to show that
 she relied on the respondent's notarial acknowledgment before dealing 
with the spouses Blanco.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the Investigating 
Commissioner found that respondent violated Rule 10.02, Canon 10 of the 
Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) when he omitted the phrase 
"unless there is an agreement to the contrary''' in citing Article 1250 
of the Civil Code because the phrase would weaken his clients' 
case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, 
Commissioner recommended as follows:<br><blockquote>PREMISES 
CONSIDERED, in view of the foregoing facts and circumstances, there 
being substantial evidence to show that respondent Jose Q. Lorica IV 
knowingly misrepresented Article 1250 of the Civil Code, it is 
recommended that he be warned that the commission of the same act in the
 future [will] be dealt with more severely.<br><br>Respectfully submitted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>In
 Resolution No. XX-2011-300<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[25]</sup></font> dated December 10, 2011, the IBP Board of 
Governors found respondent guilty of glaring conflict of interest and 
thus, resolved to reverse the Report and Recommendation of the 
Investigating Commissioner, <i>viz.:</i><br><blockquote>RESOLVED to 
REVERSE as it is hereby unanimously REVERSED the Report and 
Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner in the above-entitled 
case, herein made part of this Resolution as Annex "A" and finding 
Respondent's [sic] guilty of glaring conflict of interest, Atty. Jose Q.
 Lorica IV is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of 
two (2) years and Revocation of his Notarial Commission if presently 
existing and SUSPENDED from being commissioned as a notary public for a 
period of five (5) years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>Feeling aggrieved, respondent filed a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On
 June 21, 2013, the IBP Board of Governors issued Resolution No. 
XX-2013-736,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[28]</sup></font> denying respondent's motion for reconsideration, but 
modifying the penalty imposed, <i>viz.:</i><br><blockquote>RESOLVED 
to unanimously DENY Respondent's Motion for Reconsideration, there being
 no cogent reason to reverse the findings of the Commission and it being
 a mere reiteration of the matters which had already been threshed out 
and taken into consideration. Thus, Resolution No. XX-2011-300 dated 
December 10, 2011 is hereby AFFIRMED, with modification, instead Atty. 
Jose Q. Lorica IV is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for one 
(1) year, and his "Notarial Commission REVOKED immediately. Further, he 
is DISQUALIFIED from re-appointment as Notary Public for two (2) years.<br></blockquote><div align="center"><b>Ruling</b><br></div><br>The Court deviates with the finding of the IBP Board of Governors. Rule 15.03 of the CPR reads:<br><blockquote>Canon
 15 - A lawyer shall observe candor, fairness and loyalty in all his 
dealings and transactions with his clients.<br><br>Rule 15.03 - A lawyer
 shall not represent conflicting interests except by written consent of 
all concerned given after a full disclosure of the 
facts.</blockquote>Jurisprudence has provided three tests 
in determining whether a violation of the above rule is present in a 
given case. One test is whether a lawyer is duty-bound to fight for an 
issue or claim in behalf of one client and, at the same time, to oppose 
that claim for the other client. Thus, if a lawyer's argument for one 
client has to be opposed by that same lawyer in arguing for the other 
client, there is a violation of the rule. Another test of inconsistency 
of interests is whether the acceptance of a new relation would prevent 
the full discharge of the lawyer's duty of undivided fidelity and 
loyalty to the client or invite suspicion of unfaithfulness or 
double-dealing in the performance of that duty. Still another test is 
whether the lawyer would be called upon in the new relation to use 
against a former client any confidential information acquired through 
their connection or previous employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 
0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>At first glance, it would indeed 
appear that respondent is guilty of glaring conflict of interest under 
the first test. By handling the defense of the spouses Blanco in Civil 
Case No. U-8268 and raising for them the defense that the execution of 
the promissory note that he himself notarized was attended by coercion, 
threats and intimidation, respondent clearly took up a position that was
 inconsistent with his own attestation in the notarial acknowledgment 
thereof that the instrument was Mr. Blanco's own free will and voluntary
 act and deed.<br><br>However, the rule on conflict of interests 
presupposes a lawyer-client relationship. This is because the purpose of
 the rule is precisely to protect the fiduciary nature of the ties 
between an attorney and his client.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[30]</sup> The relationship between a lawyer and his/her 
client should ideally be imbued with the highest level of trust and 
confidence. This is the standard of confidentiality that must prevail to
 promote a full disclosure of the client's most confidential information
 to his/her lawyer for an unhampered exchange of information between 
them. Needless to state, a client can only entrust confidential 
information to his/her lawyer based on an expectation from the lawyer of
 utmost secrecy and discretion; the lawyer, for his part, is duty-bound 
to observe candor, fairness and loyalty in all his dealings and 
transactions with the client. Part of the lawyer's duty in this regard 
is to avoid representing conflicting interests.<sup style="COLOR: 
RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Conversely, a lawyer may not
 be precluded from accepting and representing other clients on the 
ground of conflict of interests, if the lawyer-client relationship does 
not exist in favor of a party in the first place.<sup style="COLOR: 
RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Suffice it to state, the 
proscription against representing conflicting interests finds no 
application, unless it serves the foregoing purpose.<br><br>In this 
case, the record is devoid of any allegation, much less proof, that a 
lawyer-client relationship exists between respondent and the spouses 
Ingram. An attorney-client relationship is said to exist when a lawyer 
acquiesces or voluntarily permits the consultation of a person, who in 
respect to a business or trouble of any kind, consults a lawyer with a 
view of obtaining professional advice or assistance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Here, respondent's 
mere act of notarizing the subject promissory note and nothing more, 
hardly gave rise to an attorney-client relationship between the notary 
public and the payees of the said note, the spouses Ingram. There is, in
 fact, no showing that respondent and the spouses Ingram ever dealt with
 each other, as it was only the spouses Blanco, as the makers and 
signatories of the instrument, who appeared before him to acknowledge 
their execution thereof. For this reason, We hold that the respondent 
did not violate the rule on conflict of interests.<br><br>The foregoing 
notwithstanding, respondent is far from being scot-free. There is 
definitely something amiss with his actuation, such that while it may 
not come within the purview of "conflict of interest" as contemplated in
 this jurisdiction, a "conflict" in the general sense of the word, is 
extant. To reiterate, respondent clearly took up inconsistent positions 
when, on one hand, he attested in the notarial acknowledgment of the 
promissory note that the instrument was Mr. Blanco's own free will and 
voluntary act and deed, while on the other hand, he assailed the due 
execution thereof by putting up the defenses of coercion, threats and 
intimidation allegedly employed by the spouses Ingram that forced the 
spouses Blanco to execute the same.<br><br>It must be underscored that 
notarization by a notary public converts a private document into a 
public document, making that document admissible in evidence without 
further proof of its authenticity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[34]</sup> Thus, respondent's attempt to nullify the 
promissory note on the ground that it was not duly executed, defeated 
the very purpose of his own notarial act. By his conduct, he made a 
clear mockery of the integrity of a notary public and degraded the 
function of notarization.<br><br>Time and again, We have held that 
notarization of a document is not an empty act or routine. It is 
invested with substantive public interest for its function is to convert
 a private document into a public document, thus rendering a notarial 
document entitled to full faith and credit upon its face. Courts, 
administrative agencies and the public at large must be able to rely 
upon the acknowledgment executed by a notary public and appended to a 
private instrument.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 
0);">[35]</sup> Hence, a notary public cannot simply disavow 
the contents of his notarial acknowledgment, otherwise, the confidence 
of the public in the integrity of public instruments and the integrity 
of the notarial practice and the legal profession, in general, would be 
undermined.<br><br>In this light, respondent should be held liable for 
his indiscretion not only as a notary public but also as a lawyer. His 
disavowal of the contents of his notarial acknowledgment—which, in good 
taste, he is called upon to honor and uphold; and which the public 
should be able to rely upon—constitutes a violation of his obligation 
under Canon 7 of the CPR, which directs every lawyer to uphold at all 
times the integrity and dignity of the legal profession.<br><br>Considering,
 however, that respondent's infraction does not amount to representation
 of conflicting interests, which deserves a more severe penalty, and 
considering, furthermore, that respondent eventually withdrew as counsel
 of the spouses Blanco, We deem the penalty of suspension for a period 
of six months from the practice of law to be commensurate with the 
extent of respondent's violation. Nonetheless, We sustain the IBP Board 
of Governor's imposition of the penalties of immediate revocation of his
 Notarial Commission and disqualification from being commissioned as a 
notary public for a period of two years.<br><br>Finally, We adopt the 
finding of the Investigating Commissioner that respondent is guilty of 
misquoting Article 1250 of the Civil Code when he omitted the phrase 
<i>"unless there is an agreement to the contrary,"</i>'' in 
citing the said provision. Indeed, while the evidence on record fell 
short in establishing that the omission was an "act of lying or 
cheating" that would constitute a "dishonest act," it clearly 
contravened Rule 10.02 of the CPR, which provides:<br><blockquote>Rule
 10.02. A lawyer shall not knowingly misquote or misrepresent the 
contents of a paper, the language or the argument of opposing counsel, 
or the text of a decision or authority, or knowingly cite as law a 
provision already rendered inoperative by repeal or amendment, or assert
 as a fact that which has not been proved.<br><br>For this infraction, respondent deserves to be admonished.</blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b>
 premises considered, Atty. Jose Q. Lorica IV is hereby found GUILTY of 
violation of Canon 7 of the Code of Professional Responsibility for 
which he is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of 
six (6) months. He is likewise meted the penalties of immediate 
REVOCATION of his Notarial Commission if presently existing and 
<b>DISQUALIFICATION</b> from being commissioned as a Notary 
Public for a period of two (2) years. He is likewise hereby found
