It discussed: </p><blockquote> <p> Defendant Uy-Cua argues that the plaintiffs never exercised the option to renew the lease contract after its expiration, thus the condition thereof granting the latter the right of first refusal (Priority to Buy), was never renewed. Although there was an implied renewal of the contract of lease in (<em>sic</em>) a month-to-month basis, in accordance with Article 1670 of the New Civil Code, the plaintiffs' right of first refusal was never renewed for the reason that the said condition is not germane to possession.</p> <p> Furthermore, defendant Uy-Cua asserted that the filing of the case is premature. The case did not undergo the required Barangay Conciliation, pursuant to RA 7160, a condition precedent before resort to the courts is initiated.</p> <p> . . . .</p> <p> . . . Nothing in the questioned contract of lease provides for an extension of the life after the term thereof had expired. Verily, the continued occupation by the plaintiffs of th e leased premises after the term has expired, but with the consent of the defendants, constitutes an implied renewal. . . .</p> <p>. . . .</p> <p> It may be amiss to consider plaintiffs' reliance on the "whereases" narrated in the contract of lease, of which one of them stated that: <b>"<i><u>whereas, the lessee is also interested in buying the same real property during the existence of the lease or thereafter.</u></i>"</b> According to the plaintiffs, the word "THEREAFTER" bestowed upon them to exercise the Right of First Refusal even after the term of the contract has expired. This is absurd. To consider and to give effect to this contention is to create an infinite contractual relationship between the parties. More so, the "whereases" mentioned in the contract are only considered premises and/or introduction, and definitely does not form part of the terms and conditions of the subject contract of lease.</p> <p> Lastly, on the issue of barangay conciliation, clearly, Section 412 of RA 7160, is controlling. Unless, it is shown that the subject legal process is being availed of in order to pave way for a procedural shortcut.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> <p> The Mañas Spouses filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but this was denied in a March 16, 2009 Order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The trial court stated: </p><blockquote> <p> The issue that the subject Deed of Absolute Sale is a simulated contract and therefore void was raised by the plaintiffs in their Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss. Although this issue was not threshed out in the assailed Order, this Court believes that to attack the validity of [the] Deed of Absolute Sale for being simulated should be made in an action for Annulment of Contracts, not in an action for Rescission. </p> <p> This Court had already ruled that the expiration of the subject Contract of Lease carries with it the termination of the Plaintiffs' Right of First Refusal. Such being the case, to notify the Plaintiffs of the defendants' intention to sell the property in question is no longer necessary and has no legal effect; and a suit instituted in order to compel the latter to allow the former to exercise the said right, states no cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Hence, the Mañas Spouses filed a Notice of Appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p><p> In their Brief, they again alleged that Roselle was a minor at the time of sale; hence, the Deed of Absolute Sale was void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> They also faulted the trial court for ruling that their Complaint stated no cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> They asserted that the trial court incorrectly found that they had no right of first refusal because the contract was not expressly renewed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p> In its April 17, 2013 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the Court of Appeals affirmed the Regional Trial Court's rulings, and also made the following findings: </p><blockquote> <p> A closer scrutiny of the records reveals that even on the face of the Complaint alone, there is absent a cause of action.

Instead, after the original Lease Contract had expired, they continued to pay rentals to the lessor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> This constitutes an implied lease contract renewal, as the trial court and the Court of Appeals correctly found.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Article 1670 of the Civil Code states: </p><blockquote> <p> ARTICLE 1670. If at the end of the contract the lessee should continue enjoying the thing leased for fifteen days with the acquiescence of the lessor, and unless a notice to the contrary by either party has previously been given, it is understood that there is an implied new lease, not for the period of the original contract, but for the time established in Articles 1682 and 1687. The other terms of the original contract shall be revived.</p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Dizon v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>—a 1999 case that similarly delved into which terms in a lease contract would be revived in implied renewals—is enlightening. In that case, Overland Express Lines, Inc. (Overland) entered into a one-year Contract of Lease with Option to Buy with the Dizons, the property owners. Per the agreement, Overland would pay a monthly rental of P3,000.00, while the purchase price was pegged at P3,000.00 per square meter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> The lease contract was not expressly renewed after a year had lapsed, though Overland continued to occupy the premises. However, when the monthly rental rate eventually rose to P8,000.00, Overland was unable to pay. This prompted the Dizons to file an ejectment suit, which resulted in the trial court ordering Overland to vacate the property and pay reasonable compensation and attorney's fees. Overland went to the Court of Appeals and subsequently to this Court, questioning the trial court's jurisdiction, but its petitions were dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></p><p> Insisting on its option to buy, Overland filed a suit for specific performance seeking that a deed of sale be executed, and later, another suit seeking to annul the judgment in the ejectment case. These cases were consolidated and later dismissed. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's jurisdiction, but it also ruled that Overland had acquired the rights of a vendee upon a perfected contract of sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> </p><p> Meanwhile, as the Dizons were already moving to have the judgment in the ejectment case executed, Overland contested the enforceability of the judgment. Its effort yielded much success: the trial court granted a writ of preliminary injunction, and later, the Court of Appeals found that the Dizons' alleged right to eject Overland had no basis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p><p> Hence, both parties came to this Court. Ruling on the consolidated petitions, this Court discussed that the issue on whether the Dizons could eject Overland was based on whether the option to buy in the lease contract was included in the contract's implied renewal.</p><p> This Court ruled: </p><blockquote> <p> In this case, there was a contract of lease for one (1) year with option to purchase. The contract of lease expired without the private respondent, as lessee, purchasing the property but remained in possession thereof. Hence, there was an implicit renewal of the contract of lease on a monthly basis. The other terms of the original contract of lease which are revived in the implied new lease under Article 1670 of the New Civil Code are only those terms which are germane to the lessee's right of continued enjoyment of the property leased. Therefore, an implied new lease does not <i>ipso facto</i> carry with it any implied revival of private respondent's option to purchase (as lessee thereof) the leased premises. The provision entitling the lessee the option to purchase the leased premises is not deemed incorporated in the impliedly renewed contract because it is alien to the possession of the lessee. Private respondent's right to exercise the option to purchase expired with the termination of the original contract of lease for one year. The rationale of this Court is that: </p> <blockquote> <p> . . . Necessarily, if the presumed will of the parties refers to the enjoyment of possession the presumption covers the other terms of the contract related to such possession, such as the amount of rental, the date when it must be paid, the care of the property, the responsibility for repairs, etc. But no such presumption may be indulged in with respect to special agreements which by nature are foreign to the right of occupancy or enjoyment inherent in a contract of lease.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Simply put, this Court ruled that implied renewals do not include the option to buy, as it is not germane to the lessee's continued use of the property. Moreover, since Overland failed to avail of the option to buy within the stipulated period, it no longer had any right to enforce this option after that period had lapsed.</p><p> Similarly, in this case, petitioners can only invoke the right to ask for the rescission of the contract if their right to first refusal, as embodied in the original Lease Contract, is included in the implied renewal.</p><p> Article 1643 of the Civil Code provides: </p><blockquote> <p> ARTICLE 1643. In the lease of things, one of the parties binds himself to give to another the enjoyment of use of a thing for a price certain, and for a period which may be definite or indefinite. However, no lease for more than ninety-nine years shall be valid.</p> </blockquote> <p> Based on Article 1643, the lessee's main obligation is to allow the lessee to enjoy the use of the thing leased. Other contract stipulations unrelated to this—or instance, the right of first refusal—cannot be presumed included in the implied contract renewal. The law itself limits the terms that are included in implied renewals. One cannot simply presume that all conditions in the original contract are also revived; after all, a contract is based on the meeting of the minds between parties.</p><p> In <i>Arevalo Gomez Corporation v. Lao Hian Liong:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Article 1670 applies only where, before the expiration of the lease, no negotiations are held between the lessor and the lessee resulting in its renewal. Where no such talks take place and the lessee is not asked to vacate before the lapse of fifteen days from the end of the lease, the implication is that the lessor is amenable to its renewal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The concept of implied renewal is a matter of equity recognized by law. Technically, no contract between a lessor and a lessee exists from the end date of a lease contract to its renewal. But if there is no notice to vacate and the lessee remains in possession of the property leased, it would only be proper that the lessor is still paid for the use and enjoyment of the property.</p><p> Thus, implied renewal does not extend to all stipulations. Without any express contract renewal, this Court cannot presume that both parties agreed to revive all the terms in the previous lease contract.</p><p> <i>Dizon v. Court of Appeals </i>finds support in <i>Dizon v. Magsaysay</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> in which this Court also resolved whether an implied renewal of a lease contract includes a renewal of the option to purchase. It held: </p><blockquote> <p> But whatever doubt there may be on this point is dispelled by paragraph (2) of the contract of lease, which states that it was renewable for the same period of two years (upon its expiration on April 1, 1951), "<i>con condiciones expresas y specificadas que seran convenidas entre las partes</i>." This stipulation embodied the agreement of the parties with respect to renewal of the original contract, and while there was nothing in it which was incompatible with the existence of an implied new lease from month to month under the conditions laid down in Article 1670 of the Civil Code, such incompatibility existed with respect to any implied revival of the lessee's preferential right to purchase, which expired with the termination of the original contract. On this point the express agreement of the parties should govern, not the legal provision relied upon by the petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Since the implied renewal of the Lease Contract did not include the renewal of the right of first refusal, petitioners have no basis for their claim that the property should have been offered to them before it was sold to respondent Roselle. The Court of Appeals did not err in affirming the trial court's ruling that petitioners failed to state their cause of action.</p><p align="center"> <b>II</b> </p><p> Additionally, petitioners made a claim on respondent Roselle's alleged incapacity<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> due to her age, as raised for the first time in their Opposition to her Motion to Dismiss.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> In their appeal brief, they alleged: </p><blockquote> <p> 14.

The contracting party's incapacity is a ground for annulment of contract, not rescission. Article 1390 of the Civil Code states: </p><blockquote> <p> ARTICLE 1390. The following contracts are voidable or annullable, even though there may have been no damage to the contracting parties: </p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">Those where one of the parties is incapable of giving consent to a contract; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Those where the consent is vitiated by mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence or fraud. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>These contracts are binding, unless they are annulled by a proper action in court. They are susceptible of ratification.</p> </blockquote> <p> Petitioners pray for the rescission of the contract, but the ground they raised is one for annulment of contract. Article 1397 of the Civil Code specifies who may institute such action: </p><blockquote> <p> ARTICLE 1397. The action for the annulment of contracts may be instituted by all who are thereby obliged principally or subsidiarily. However, persons who are capable cannot allege the incapacity of those with whom they contracted; nor can those who exerted intimidation, violence, or undue int1uence, or employed fraud, or caused mistake base their action upon these flaws of the contract.</p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, even if this Court were to consider petitioners' action as one for annulment of contract, they are still not the proper parties to file such action. They are not parties to the Deed of Absolute Sale, and neither are they obliged principally or subsidiarity with regard to the Deed of Absolute Sale. Thus, the trial court's dismissal of their Complaint would still be proper. </p><p align="center"> <b>III</b> </p><p> Finally, the Court of Appeals also correctly affirmed the trial court's ruling that petitioners failed to comply with a condition precedent. Section 412 of Republic Act No. 7160 provides: </p><blockquote> <p> SECTION 412. C<i>onciliation. — (a) Pre-condition to Filing of Complaint in Court.</i> — No complaint, petition, action, or proceeding involving any matter within the authority of the lupon shall be filed or instituted directly in court or any other government office for adjudication, unless there has been a confrontation between the parties before the !upon chairman or the pangkat, and that no conciliation or settlement has been reached as certified by the lupon secretary or pangkat secretary as attested to by the lupon or pangkat chairman or unless the settlement has been repudiated by the parties thereto.</p> <p> (b) <i>Where Parties May Go Directly to Court</i>. —The parties may go directly to court in the following instances: </p> <blockquote> <p> (1) Where the accused is under detention; <br> (2) Where a person has otherwise been deprived of personal liberty calling for <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings;<br> (3) Where actions are coupled with provisional remedies such as preliminary injunction, attachment, delivery of personal property and support <i>pendente lite</i>; and<br> (4) Where the action may otherwise be barred by the statute of limitations. </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Generally, all parties must first undergo barangay conciliation proceedings before filing a complaint in court. None of the exceptions under the law are present in this case. Thus, assuming that petitioners had stated a cause of action, their Complaint would still be dismissed for their failure to comply with a condition precedent.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
