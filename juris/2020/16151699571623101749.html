The trial judge's evaluation of the credibility of a witness and of the witness1 testimony is accorded the highest respect because he or she has the unique opportunity to observe directly the demeanor of the witness which enables him or her to determine whether the witness is telling the truth or not, more so when it is affirmed by the CA.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[58]</sup></font> Such evaluation is, therefore, binding on the Court unless facts or circumstances of weight have been overlooked, misapprehended, or misinterpreted that, if considered, would materially affect the disposition of the case.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[59]</sup></font> Considering that appellants failed to prove that the RTC or the CA overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted some facts or circumstances, this Court affirms their finding that Judith's positive declarations on the identities of the appellants prevailed over the latter's denials and alibi.<br><br>Contrary to the contention of appellants, conspiracy exists in the present case. Under Article 8 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), a conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. The State need not prove appellants' previous agreement to commit Murder<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[60]</sup></font> and Robbery because conspiracy can be deduced from the mode and manner in which they perpetrated their criminal act.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[61]</sup></font> They acted in concert in killing Pepito and taking his properties, with their individual acts manifesting a community of purpose and design to achieve their evil purpose. All the fifteen accused as conspirators in this case are liable as co-principals. Hence, they cannot now successfully assail their conviction as co-principals in Murder and Robbery.<br><br><b>A. Murder</b><br><br>Murder is defined and punished under Article 248 of the RPC, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, which provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 248. <i>Murder.</i> — Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246 shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by reclusion temporal in its maximum period to death, if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><br>1. With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity.<br><br>2. In consideration of a price, reward, or promise.<br><br>3. By means of inundation, fire, poison, explosion, shipwreck, stranding of a vessel, derailment or assault upon a street car or locomotive, fall of an airship, by means of motor vehicles, or with the use of any other means involving great waste and ruin.<br><br>4. On occasion of any of the calamities enumerated in the preceding paragraph, or of an earthquake, eruption of a volcano, destructive cyclone, epidemic or other public calamity.<br><br>5. With evident premeditation.<br><br>6. With cruelty, by deliberately and inhumanly augmenting the suffering of the victim, or outraging or scoffing at his person or corpse.<br></blockquote>Appellants argue that they should not have been convicted of murder considering that no circumstances have been specifically alleged in the Information which would qualify the killing into murder. They cited <i>People v. Alba</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Alba) where it was ruled that the circumstance must be alleged with specificity as a qualifying circumstance; otherwise, it can only be considered as a generic aggravating circumstance. Appellants contend that <i>People v. Gano</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> clarified that Alba should be given a retroactive effect as it is more favorable to the accused. Hence, the ruling in Alba must be applied in the present case.<br><br>The argument deserves scant consideration. Section 6, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court states:<br><blockquote>Sec. 6. Sufficiency of complaint or information. — A complaint or information is sufficient if it states the name of the accused; the designation of the offense by the statute; the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the approximate time of the commission of the offense; and the place where the offense was committed. </blockquote><blockquote>When the offense is committed by more than one person, all of them shall be included in the complaint or information.<br></blockquote>The Information is sufficient if it contains the full name of the accused, the designation of the offense given by the statute, the acts or omissions constituting the offense, the name of the offended party, the approximate date, and the place of the offense. The herein Information complied with these conditions. Contrary to appellants' contention, the qualifying circumstance of "treachery" was specifically alleged in the Information. "The rule is that qualifying circumstances must be properly pleaded in the Information in order not to violate the accused's constitutional right to be properly informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Notably, the Information alleged that with treachery, the appellants shot Pepito on the head with the use of a firearm and thereafter hacked him even though he was dying and helpless on the ground, to wit:<br><br><b>Criminal Case No. 97-1258</b><br><blockquote>That at around 9:00 o'clock in the evening of July 29, 1997 at Sitio Sta. Cruz, Dansolihon, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with evident premeditation, with treachery, by taking advantage of superior strength and under cover of night, conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot, with the use of a firearm, one Pepito Angga Gunayan, hitting the latter on the head, and as Pepito Angga Gunayan fell dying, the said accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously hack and stab, with the use of bladed weapons, their victim inflicting upon the aforementioned Pepito A. Gunayan mortal wounds that eventually caused his death, to the great damage and prejudice of the wife and children of the deceased.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (Emphasis ours)</blockquote>The essence of treachery is the swift and unexpected attack on the unarmed victim without the slightest provocation on the victim's part.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The two elements of treachery, namely: (1) that at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself or herself, and (2) that the offender consciously adopted the particular means, method or form of attack employed by him or her,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> are both present in this case.<br><br>Pepito was unarmed and looking out the window to ascertain the noise outside when appellant Edimar shot him on his head which consequently knocked him on the floor. The prosecution also established that appellants consciously and deliberately adopted the mode of attack. They lurked outside Pepito's residence and waited for him to appear. When Pepito emerged from his window with a flashlight which he used to focus on and determine the people outside his house, appellant Edimar immediately shot him on the head with the use of a firearm. The location of the wound obviously indicated that the appellants deliberately and consciously aimed for the vital part of Pepito's body to ensure the commission of the crime. The attack was done suddenly and unexpectedly, leaving Pepito without any means of defense. More importantly, the subsequent hacking of Pepito when he lay lifeless on the floor indicated treachery since he was already wounded and unable to put up a defense.<br><br>Since treachery qualified the crime to murder, the generic aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength, in aid of armed men and nighttime are absorbed by and necessarily included in the former. Unless the aggravating circumstance of nighttime was purposely sought and founded on different factual bases, then nighttime can be considered as a separate generic aggravating circumstance,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[68]</sup></font> which is however not present in the case at bar. The prosecution failed to prove by sufficient evidence that nighttime was purposely and deliberately sought by the appellants. Thus, this Court holds that since treachery was alleged in the Information and duly established by the prosecution during trial, the appellants' conviction for the crime of Murder is proper.<br><br>However, evident premeditation as a qualifying circumstance cannot be appreciated in this case for failure of the prosecution to specifically allege in the Information the acts constituting it. Mere reference to evident premeditation is not sufficient because it is in the nature of a conclusion of law, not factual averments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Section 9, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court requires that the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense must be stated in "ordinary and concise language without repetition, not necessarily in the terms of the statute defining the offense." This is to sufficiently apprise the accused of what he or she allegedly committed. Thus, the Information must state the facts and circumstances alleging the elements of a crime to inform the accused of the nature of the accusation against him/her so as to enable him/her to suitably prepare his/her defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> In this case, however, the prosecution failed to specifically allege in the Information the acts constituting evident premeditation. Nevertheless, it can still be considered a generic aggravating circumstance, as in this case.<br><br>To be sure, both the RTC and the CA correctly found the presence of evident premeditation in the killing of the victim. Evident premeditation is attendant when the following requisites are proven during trial: (1) the time when the offender determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that he/she clung to his determination; (3) a sufficient lapse of time between the determination and execution, to allow him/her to reflect upon the consequences of his/her act, and to allow his/her conscience to overcome the resolution of his will.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> It presupposes a deliberate planning of the crime before executing it. The execution of the criminal act, in other words, must be preceded by cool thought and reflection. There must be showing of a plan or preparation to kill, or proof that the accused meditated and reflected upon his/her decision to execute the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the following circumstances indicated the presence of evident premeditation: (1) the meeting of all the accused at 3 o'clock in the afternoon of July 29, 1997 at Binago Forest, Salimbal, Tinagpoloan to plan the killing of Pepito; (2) the act of buying and drinking alcohol and arming themselves with four homemade guns known as paleontods, an improvised pistol and bolos; and (3) a sufficient lapse of time, that is, six hours from the time of their meeting at 3 o'clock in the afternoon until the time of killing of Pepito at 9 o'clock in the evening.<br><br>Undoubtedly, the appellants were determined to commit the crime. The commission of the crime was clearly not a product of accident, as it was evident that they planned to kill Pepito. However, being merely a generic aggravating circumstance, evident premeditation cannot qualify the killing into murder. To reiterate, since treachery was sufficiently alleged in the Information and duly proven by the prosecution, the killing of Pepito constitutes Murder and not merely Homicide as contended by the appellants. On the other hand, evident premeditation is to be considered merely as a generic aggravating circumstance which is necessary in the correct imposition of penalty.<br><br>Meanwhile, the generic aggravating circumstances of cruelty, dwelling and intoxication cannot be considered in this case. In <i>People v. Legaspi,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> the Court held that for both qualifying and aggravating circumstances to be considered in the case, they must be specifically alleged in the Information or Complaint, as provided in the amended Sections 8 and 9, Rule 110, of the Rules of Court. Otherwise, they will not be appreciated even if duly proved during the trial. Given that the Judgment of the court a quo was promulgated on November 23, 2000 wherein the ruling in Legaspi has not yet been issued, this Court gives this doctrinal rule a retroactive effect being favorable to the appellants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Hence, only the qualifying circumstance of treachery which absorbs abuse of superior strength, in aid of armed men and nighttime, as well as the generic aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation, can be considered in the present case.<br><br>The RTC and the CA correctly disregarded the voluntary surrender claimed by appellants Edimar and Carlito as a mitigating circumstance since their surrender was not for the two crimes charged in this case but for the other cases of Robbery committed in Talakag. The surrender, to be deemed voluntary, must be spontaneous in which the accused voluntarily submits himself or herself to the authorities with an acknowledgment of his or her guilt and with the intent to save them from trouble and expense of effecting his/her capture. Moreover, the voluntary surrender must be by reason of the crime for which the accused is to be prosecuted which is not the case here.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, even if we consider their voluntary surrender as a mitigating circumstance in addition to their voluntary confession of guilt, one mitigating circumstance may offset the generic aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation as to leave appellant Edimar with only one mitigating circumstance which is voluntary confession of guilt. Appellant Carlito is left with no other attending circumstance. This, however, will still not reduce by one degree the penalty imposed by the RPC for murder, that is, reclusion perpetua to death. Regardless of the number of ordinary mitigating circumstances and despite the absence of an aggravating circumstance, the penalty cannot be reduced to any degree.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> The reduction applies only when the sentence imposed by law is a divisible penalty which is either a single divisible penalty or three different penalties which are divisible into three periods which is not the case herein. Hence, the contention of the appellants that the penalty for Edimar and Carlito should be within the range of prision mayor as minimum to reclusion temporal as maximum is without basis in law.<br><br>Article 248 of the RPC provides that the presence of the attending circumstance of treachery qualified the killing into murder which is punishable by reclusion perpetua to death. Article 63 of the same Code provides that if the penalty is composed of two indivisible penalties, as in the instant case, and there is an aggravating circumstance the higher penalty should be imposed. Since evident premeditation can be considered as an ordinary aggravating circumstance, treachery, by itself, being sufficient to qualify the killing, the proper imposable penalty - the higher sanction - is death. However, in view of the enactment of Republic Act No. 9346 prohibiting the imposition of the death penalty, the penalty for the killing of Pepito is reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole. The penalty thus imposed by the RTC and affirmed by the appellate court on each appellant is correct.<br><br>As to their civil liabilities,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> since their penalty of death is reduced to reclusion perpetua because of R.A. No. 9346, the appellants shall be jointly and severally liable to pay civil indemnity in the total amount of P100,000.00, moral damages in the total amount of P100,000.00, and exemplary damages in the total amount of P100,000.00.<br><br>As to actual damages, settled is the rule that when actual damages proven by receipts during the trial amount to less than the sum allowed by the Court as temperate damages,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[78]</sup></font> the award of temperate damages is justified in lieu of actual damages which is of a lesser amount.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[79]</sup></font> Since the amount of actual damages proved during the trial, that is, P15,000.00, is less than the amount of temperate damages of P50,000.00 fixed by prevailing jurisprudence<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[80]</sup></font> for Murder, it is proper to award temperate damages in lieu of actual damages.<br><br>In addition, the monetary awards payable by the appellants are subject to interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid.<br><br><b>B. Robbery</b><br><br>Article 294 of the RPC as amended by R.A. No. 7659 reads:<br><br>ART. 294. <i>Robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons</i> -Penalties.- Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any person shall suffer:<br><blockquote>1. The penalty of reclusion perpetua to death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed, or when the robbery shall have been accompanied by rape or intentional mutilation or arson.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>5. The penalty of<i> prision correccional</i> in its maximum period to <i>prision mayor</i> in its medium period in other cases.</blockquote>Notably, the appellants were charged with separate crimes of Murder and Robbery and not the complex crime of Robbery with Homicide. A conviction for Robbery with Homicide requires that Robbery is the main purpose and objective of the malefactors and the killing is merely incidental to the Robbery. If, originally, the malefactors did not comprehend Robbery, but Robbery follows the Homicide either as an afterthought or merely as an incident of the Homicide, then the malefactor is guilty of two separate crimes, that of Homicide or Murder and Robbery, and not of the special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>In this case, the original intention of the appellants was to kill Pepito to exact revenge from Pepito for assaulting appellant Gerry. In fact, appellant Edimar immediately shot Pepito on his head when the latter looked out from his window to ascertain the people outside his house. This shows that the appellants did not intend to commit Robbery at the outset. Nonetheless, Robbery was committed incidentally by the appellants when Jimmy took Pepito's air gun and FM radio while Rogelio took the bolo after hacking the body of Pepito. Subsequently, appellant Edimar shouted "Attack!" thereby giving the other appellants the signal to ransack the other valuables of the spouses Gunayan, namely, a goat, two pigs, a fighting cock and a hen without the consent and at gun point and with use of bolos against Judith and her children.<br><br>Conspiracy having been established as earlier discussed, the appellants are guilty of Robbery under Article 294(5) of the RPC punishable by prision correccional in its maximum period to prision mayor in its medium period. The RTC and CA therefore erred when they applied the penalty prescribed by law for Robbery with Homicide when the present case charged the appellants with separate crimes of Murder and Robbery.<br><br>Absent any aggravating and mitigating circumstance, the penalty shall be applied in its medium period. In this case, the penalty prescribed by law i.e. prision correccional in its maximum period to prision mayor in its medium period has three periods namely: (a) minimum - four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day to six (6) years, one (1) month and ten (10) days; (b) medium -six years, one (1) month and eleven (11) days to eight (8) years and twenty (20) days; and (c) maximum - eight (8) years and twenty-one (21) days to ten (10) years.<br><br>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the maximum of the imposable penalty shall be eight (8) years and twenty (20) days taken from the medium period of the imposable penalty. The minimum of the penalty shall be within the full range of <i>arresto mayor</i> maximum to prision correccional medium which is one degree lower than that prescribed by law. Hence, the minimum of the penalty to be imposed shall be four (4) years and two (2) months. In sum, the appellants shall be sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional, as minimum, to eight (8) years and twenty (20) days of <i>prision mayor,</i> as maximum.<br><br>However, as regards appellants Gerry, Nestor, and Edimar, they are to be credited with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary confession of guilt. Hence, the maximum of the penalty imposed shall be in the minimum period, that is, within four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day to six (6) years, one (1) month and ten (10) days. Thus, appellants Gerry, Nestor, and Edimar shall be sentenced to four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day of <i>prision correccional </i>as minimum to six (6) years, one (1) month and ten (10) days of <i>prision mayor </i>as maximum.<br><br>In addition, the appellants shall be jointly and severally liable to pay Judith Gunayan and her two children actual damages in the total amount of F7,700.00 and to pay the legal cost.
