On May 3, 2005, at around 2:30 in the morning, while they were about to leave their restaurant and to board their car, four armed men approached them. One of the four men poked a gun at Carmelita who was seated at the front seat while another man occupied the back seat of the car. At the same time, the two other men poked a gun at Arturo who was standing on the left side of the car. Arturo was then made to sit at the back seat of the car together with one of the men. The other man sat at the driver's seat.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>When Arturo was already seated at the back seat of the car, one of the men pulled Carmelita from the front seat and occupied the seat in her stead. Thereafter, the four men sped away taking Arturo with them. Carmelita then immediately ran inside the restaurant and reported the abduction of her husband to the Angono police. During the incident, Arturo was wearing a white shirt, maong pants, and Islander slippers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>At 10:30 in the morning of the same day, Carmelita received a call from a man informing her that they have custody of Arturo and demanding the amount of P5,000,000.00 as a precondition for Arturo's release. Carmelita responded that she did not have that amount and that their house and restaurant were even loaned from the bank, which caused the man to get angry.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>At 11:30 in the morning of the same day, Carmelita received another call from someone inquiring whether she was able to raise the amount.

At 10:30 in the evening, Carmelita received another call asking her how much she was able to raise. Carmelita answered that she has P70,000.00 which angered the caller again.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On May 5, 2005, at 10:30 in the morning, a man called again and inquired from Carmelita how much she was able to raise. She told the caller that she already has P370,000.00. She also requested to talk to her husband, which was granted. During said call, Arturo told her to borrow money from his employer. However, Carmelita was only able to raise the amount of P470,000.00. She was then instructed to separately wrap the amounts of P150,000.00 and P320,000.00 in a newspaper. She was also told to place the money in a blue plastic bag.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On May 6, 2005, at 1:30 in the afternoon, Arturo's abductors instructed Carmelita to proceed to Metropolis, an establishment in Alabang, Muntinlupa. Accompanied by her son-in-law, John, Carmelita went to the designated place.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>However, upon reaching Metropolis, she was told to proceed to Robinson's Fairview in Quezon City. While waiting thereat, Carmelita received another instruction to proceed to Jollibee. When Carmelita did not agree, the caller instructed her instead to go to Sta. Lucia Mall, Cubao.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>While on their way to Sta. Lucia Mall, they received another instruction for them to proceed to Jollibee Masinag in Antipolo City, which they followed. They arrived there at around 7:30 in the evening and were instructed to use the restrooms to relieve themselves. Thereafter, they were told to go to the parking area of tricycles on Panorama Street, Marikina City. Upon reaching said location, they were again told to proceed to Purok 6, Manggahan. This time, Carmelita requested John to deliver the money in her stead. Consequently, John boarded a tricycle to reach Purok 6, Manggahan, bringing with him the money and Carmelita's cellphone.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>At around 8 o'clock in the evening, John arrived at the meeting place. He then received a phone call, informing him that somebody would approach him, and that he should give the money to that person. A few minutes later, a man approached John and took the ransom money and Carmelita's cellphone. John asked the man about his father-in-law, Arturo, and he was informed that Arturo was okay. The man then immediately left with the money and Carmelita's cellphone. John returned to the place where he parked the car.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Arturo was not released by his kidnappers despite the delivery and receipt of the ransom money.

After the body was exhumed, Carmelita and John confirmed that it was Arturo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>During the trial, Carmelita identified appellant Alvin as the man who poked a gun at her and appellant Hector as the one who pulled Arturo to the back seat of the car during Arturo's abduction on May 3, 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> On the other hand, John identified accused Bathan as the one who received the ransom money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In addition, accused-turned-state witness Mendoza testified during the trial that he was recruited by his cousin, Hector, to be a member of the Waray-Waray Kidnap for Ransom Group. He was recruited to be the cook of the group. At around 5 o'clock in the afternoon of May 2, 2005, Hector brought him to a small house in Angono, Rizal which was owned by a certain alias "Toto." Hector then left after instructing Mendoza to stay behind. When he arrived at the said house, accused Quintana, Sorima, Isidro, Bitangol, Entoy alias "Berkley," an alias "Lito," Rayga, Romeo and Antonio were already there.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Mendoza further testified that on May 3, 2005, at around 3 o'clock in the morning, Hector arrived together with accused Banaay, Romeo, Freeman, Bathan, Alvin and alias "Toto." They brought with them a man who was hogtied and wearing a white shirt, maong shorts, and Islander slippers. Mendoza later came to know the man as Arturo. As Hector instructed, Mendoza cooked for and provided food to Arturo for four days.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On May 6, 2005, around 10 o'clock in the evening, Hector, along with accused alias "Toto," alias "Ekong," Bathan, and Freeman returned to the house in Angono, Rizal on board a white taxi. Hector then gave Mendoza P16,000.00. Afterwards, Mendoza saw Hector having a conversation with accused Freeman, alias "Toto," Bathan, Banaay, and alias "Ekong." After their conversation, Hector called on accused Bitangol. Thereafter, Hector ordered accused Quintana and Gamba to bring Arturo downstairs where accused Bitangol shot him on the head four times with a 0.45-caliber gun. Arturo was then thrown into a creek.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Evidence for the Defense</i></b></center><br><br>Hector and Alvin averred that they have been working as administrators of Hacienda Ragaza in Brgy. Palanog, Jaro, Leyte since the years 2000 and 2001, respectively. On August 27, 2005, they went to Manila.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Alvin narrated that prior to August 27, 2005, he has never set foot in Manila. Similarly, Hector emphasized that he went to Manila on August 27, 2005, accompanied by Alvin, to buy spare parts for his jeepney. They met up with Mendoza in Valenzuela who agreed to help them buy the spare parts for the jeepney.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>While they were staying in a rented house in Valenzuela, a group of armed men, who introduced themselves as police officers, arrived and arrested Mendoza as well as Hector and Alvin. They were then brought to a camp in Laguna where they were individually subjected to tactical interrogation. They were accused of being members of the Waray-Waray Kidnap for Ransom Group. Hector and Alvin then claimed that they were tortured, electrocuted, and forced to admit the accusation. Thereafter, they were turned over to the PACER in Camp Crame.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Regional Trial Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br><br>On September 24, 2010, the RTC promulgated its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> finding Hector, Alvin, and Banaay guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principals for the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom with Homicide. The case against Bitangol, Bathan, Quintana, Sorima, alias "Lito," and alias "Toto," were ordered archived pending their arrest. On the other hand, the rest of the accused were acquitted for insufficiency of evidence and for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt for the crime charged. The dispositive portion of the said Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, after finding accused Hector Comista <i>y</i> Reotutar, Alvin Labra <i>y</i> Cornista and Ricardo Banaay, Jr. <i>y</i> Sinangote GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as principals for the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom with Homicide under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. 7659, this Court hereby sentences them to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> instead of the death penalty by virtue of R.A. 9346 and said accused shall not be eligible for parole under Act No. 4103, the Indeterminate Sentence Law, as amended.<br><br>In addition, the said accused are ordered to pay, jointly and severally, to the family of victim, Arturo Picones[,]through Carmelita V.

However, the CA modified the amounts of damages awarded. The dispositive portion of the CA's Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is hereby DISMISSED and the September 24, 2010 Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Bina[n]gonan, Rizal, Branch 69, in Criminal Case No. 06-528, finding Hector Comistay Reotutar, Alvin Labra <i>y</i> Cornista and Ricardo Banaay, Jr. <i>y</i> Sinangote guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, in that they are ordered to pay, jointly and severally, to the heirs of the victim, Arturo Picones, P535,000.00 as actual damages, P200,000.00 as moral damages, P100,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P75,000.00 as civil indemnity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The CA modified the award of actual damages to P535,000.00 consisting of the P470,000.00 ransom money and the duly receipted burial expenses of P65,000.00. It increased the award of exemplary damages to P100,000.00 in view of the two qualifying circumstances of demand for ransom and killing of the victim. Finally, it increased the award of moral damages to P200,000.00.<br><br>Aggrieved, appellants filed an appeal with this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Issue:</u></b></center><br><br>Whether or not the CA correctly affirmed the conviction of appellants for the crime of Kidnapping for Ransom with Homicide.<br><br><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br><br>The appeal is without merit. The CA correctly affirmed the trial court's ruling finding appellants guilty of the crime charged.<br><br><b><i>Appellants' guilt was proven beyond <br>reasonable doubt based on the <br>prosecution's evidence.</i></b><br><br>Appellants raised the following arguments in their appeal: (i) the prosecution failed to prove the perpetrator's identity beyond reasonable doubt because <i>firstly</i>, it was impossible for Carmelita to have seen the faces of the malefactors since the only source of illumination was the restaurant's signage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <i>Secondly</i>, the descriptions of the faces of the malefactors provided by Mendoza should not have been given credence because his alleged participation in the Waray Waray Kidnap for Ransom Group was limited only to acting as the cook of the group.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> They further pointed out that Mendoza failed to give an accurate description of the clothes the victim was wearing when he was killed. He testified that when the victim was shot on the head, he was already wearing a colored jacket and a cream shorts, and not the clothes he was originally wearing when he was kidnapped.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> However, Carmelita testified that she was able to identify the body of the victim because of the clothes he was wearing on the night he was abducted by the malefactors, <i>i.e.</i>, maong short pants and white t-shirt;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and (ii) the trial court erred in not appreciating the appellants' defense of alibi.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Appellants alleged that they were in Jaro, Leyte at the time the crime was committed, thus it was impossible for them to have been present at the scene of the crime in Binangonan, Rizal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The Court is not convinced with the foregoing arguments. While there may indeed be contradictions in Carmelita's and Mendoza's testimonies, the same were nevertheless minor and inconsequential and did not detract from the proven elements of the offense of Kidnapping for Ransom with Homicide. The rule is that "a few discrepancies and inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses referring to minor details [and collateral matters,] which do not touch the essence of the crime do not impair their credibility."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In addition, Carmelita testified that at the time Arturo was kidnapped, there was a light on the fence, a daylight in front of the restaurant, and the restaurant's signboard illuminated the area. Thus, she was able to recognize appellants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Furthermore, as the CA aptly held, appellants failed to give any reason why Carmelita would falsely accuse them of kidnapping her husband.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In the absence of any ill motive on the part of Carmelita to point to the appellants as the perpetrators of the crime, her testimony must be given full faith and credit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, We note that the CA affirmed the findings of the RTC. Settled is the rule that "factual findings of the RTC, when affirmed by the CA, are entitled to great weight and respect by this Court and are deemed final and conclusive when supported by the evidence on record."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Thus, We find no cogent reason to disturb their findings.<br><br><b><i>Appellants are guilty of the special complex<br>crime of Kidnapping for Ransom with<br>Homicide.</i></b><br><br>The elements of kidnapping for ransom under Article 267 of the RPC, as amended, are as follows: (a) intent on the part of the accused to deprive the victim of his/her liberty; (b) actual deprivation of the victim of his/her liberty; and (c) motive of the accused, which is extorting ransom for the release of the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In the special complex crime of Kidnapping for Ransom with Homicide, the person kidnapped is killed in the course of the detention, regardless of whether the killing was purposely sought or was merely an afterthought.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the prosecution was able to prove the foregoing elements of Kidnapping for Ransom with Homicide.<br><br><i>Firstly</i>, appellants' intent to deprive Arturo of his liberty was evident from the moment his freedom of movement was forcibly curtailed on May 3, 2005 at 2:30 in the morning, wherein appellants poked a gun at him and his wife Carmelita while they were both about to board their car, and made Arturo take the back seat of the car. Thereafter, Arturo was taken against his will to Angono, Rizal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><i>Secondly</i>, the prosecution was able to prove the actual deprivation of his liberty. Prosecution witness Mendoza testified that on May 3, 2005, appellants brought Arturo to a small house in Angono, Rizal. He further witnessed that Arturo's hands were tied at the back with a chain. In addition, he testified that he, together with some of the accused, guarded Arturo for several days until he was shot by accused Bitangol on May 6, 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br><i>Thirdly</i>, the prosecution was able to prove that ransom money was demanded for the release of Arturo. Carmelita testified that on May 3, 2005, at 10:30 in the morning, she received a call informing her that Arturo was held captive and will only be released upon payment of P5,000,000.00. Several negotiations were had between the kidnappers and Carmelita during the period of May 3 to May 5, 2005. Eventually, the kidnappers agreed to the amount of P470,000.00 which Carmelita was able to raise. Thereafter, she was instructed to wrap the money in two separate batches – Pl50,000.00 in one newspaper and the remaining P320,000.00 in another newspaper, and to place them in a blue plastic bag. On May 6, 2005, Carmelita and her son-in-law, John, received several instructions from the kidnappers as to where to proceed with the money, which they followed. Finally, she was ordered to go to Purok 6, Manggahan, to deliver the money. In turn, she requested John to go to said place.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In addition, John testified in relation to the ransom money. According to him, he rode a motorcycle and went to Purok 6, Manggahan as per instruction of the kidnappers. On his way to the said place, the kidnappers made several calls and instructions. Upon his arrival at the meeting place, the kidnappers called again and instructed him to give the ransom money to the person who will eventually approach him. When said person arrived, John handed him the ransom money; He later identified the man as accused Bathan. However, Arturo was not released by his· kidnappers despite the delivery and receipt of the ransom money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><i>Finally</i>, Arturo was killed in the course of the detention. About a month after the delivery and receipt of the ransom money, Carmelita and John were informed by a police officer from the Angono Police Station that a dead body had been found in Brgy. San Isidro, Angono, Rizal. On May 28, 2005, Carmelita and John went to the Angono Police Station and pleaded for the police to dig up the corpse of Arturo. Together with the police, Carmelita and John went to the Angono Municipal Cemetery. After the body was exhumed, Carmelita and John confirmed that it was Arturo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, appellants mainly raised <i>alibi</i> as their defense.
