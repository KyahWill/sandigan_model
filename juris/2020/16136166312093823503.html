				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court which seeks to reverse and set aside the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated March 7, 2017 and the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated July 25, 2017 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 146585 which affirmed with modification the Decision dated February 19, 2016 of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB) Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators in MVA-091-RCMB-NCR-071-02-07-2015.<br><br><center><i>The Antecedents</i></center><br><br>On March 21, 2013, Keymax Maritime Co., Ltd, (petitioner Keymax), through its local agency, Magsaysay Maritime Corp. (petitioner Magsaysay) (collectively, petitioners), hired Jose Elizalde B. Zanoria (respondent) as Chief Mate or Chief Officer on board the vessel Brilliant Sky<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> with a basic monthly salary of US$1,427.00/month.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>As Chief Mate or Chief Officer, respondent was responsible for overseeing the safety and security of the ship, crew, passengers, and cargo. He was responsible for the loading and unloading of the cargo, as well as, its safe stowage. He acted as a "watchstander," who took responsibility of what was called the "4-8 watch"â€”watching from a suitable vantage point for four hours at a time from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. and then 12 hours again later to ensure that the ship is compliant with the regulations and conventions governing safety, and with the regulations governing pollution. In other words, respondent was not only responsible for keeping the ship safe from attack or damage, but also to ensure that it would not fall below the standards set by the regulatory bodies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Respondent faithfully and religiously performed his job. However, while working on board the vessel, he had a blurring vision of the right eye.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On March 27, 2014, in Georgia, Atlanta, USA, where the vessel was at port, Dr. Markesh Manocha checked on respondent and found the latter to be suffering from <i>macular hole OD, traumatic cataract OD,</i> and <i>chorioretinal scars OD</i>.<br><br>On April 2, 2014, respondent was medically repatriated to the Philippines. Petitioners directed him to the Association of Marine Officers and Seaman's Union of the Philippines (AMOSUP) Hospital for his post-medical examination. Dr. George C. Pile (Dr. Pile), the company-designated physician, examined him and gave his initial diagnosis of <i>macular hole, right eye, senile, mature cataract, right, error of refraction</i>. Likewise, Dr. Pile diagnosed him as unfit to work and that respondent's condition was work-oriented. Hence, Dr. Pile recommended that respondent undergo "flourescein angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) right eye, and cardio-pulmonary clearance."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On April 11, 2014, respondent went back to Dr. Pile and was diagnosed with <i>lamellar macular hole, right eye, epiretinal membrane with macular edema, right eye, senile, mature, cataract, error of refraction</i>. Dr. Pile noted again that it was work-oriented; that flourescein angiography and optical coherence tomography of his right eye was done; that respondent was still for cardiopulmonary clearance prior to cataract surgery of his right eye; and that respondent started Nevenac eye drop to his right eye three times daily. Dr. Pile recommended respondent for phacoemulsification with PCIOL implantation of his right eye.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On May 23, 2014, respondent underwent phacoemulsification with PCIOL implantation of his right eye.<br><br>On May 24, 2014, respondent was discharged and was instructed to take eye drop medications. He went back to Dr. Pile for follow-up consultations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Then, on August 6, 2014, or after 122 days, Dr. Pile issued a medical certificate stating that respondent needed to come back on August 13, 2014 for final disposition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On August 13, 2014, Dr. Pile told respondent that he was already unfit to work as a seafarer and that he would be given a grading for his disability. When respondent asked petitioner Magsaysay for a copy of the medical certificate, he was never given a copy despite demands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On November 25, 2014, respondent, relying on Dr. Pile's assessment that he could no longer return to work as a seafarer, filed a grievance proceeding with the AMOSUP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On January 23, 2015, a deadlock was declared after several offers and counter-offers between the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On February 6, 2015, respondent filed a Notice to Arbitrate with the NCMB. However, no amicable settlement was likewise reached at the NCMB proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Respondent needed to support the findings of Dr. Pile that he was no longer fit to work as a seafarer because of his condition. Thus, he sought a medical opinion from an independent government ophthalmologist, Dr. Emmanuel M. Eusebio (Dr. Eusebio), who found that his illness was "permanent in nature" and "his overall capacity to work as a seaman might be compromised." Dr. Eusebio, therefore, concluded that respondent was "no longer fit to resume his previous work as a seaman." Dr. Eusebio's Medical Evaluation Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> reads:<br><br><blockquote>This is the case of Jose Elizalde Bueno Zanoria, 53 years old, male, single, Filipino, and presently residing at Kawit, Medellin, Cebu.<br><br>He sought consult because of progressive blurring of vision of the right eye of 1 year duration.<br><br>On physical examination, visual acuity with glasses were as follows:<br><br>OD: 20/200&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OS: 20/20 with correction<br><br>He was diagnosed to have senile, mature, cataract, right, for which he underwent phacoemulsification with PCIOL implantation of the right eye. There was also associated lamellar macular hole on the right eye, with error of refraction.<br><br>The above findings are permanent in nature; as such, his overall capacity to work as a seaman might be compromised. He is therefore no longer fit to resume his previous work as a seaman.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br><br>After five months from the time respondent filed his complaint with the AMOSUP, petitioners manifested that they would be filing the same complaint before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) to challenge the jurisdiction of the NCMB.<br><br>On April 20, 2015, respondent was then constrained to file a Motion to Appoint a Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators with the NCMB which was opposed by petitioners. Consequently, petitioners withdrew their complaint with the NLRC and agreed to select a Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators.<br><br>On September 4, 2015, when petitioners filed their Position Paper<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> with the NCMB, they already released Dr. Pile's Medical Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated September 22, 2014 stating that from April 7, 2014 up until the time the certification was issued, respondent was found to be unfit. The Medical Certification reads:<br><br><blockquote>This is to certify that Mr. Jose Elizalde B.

The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered and subject to the above disquisitions, the <i>petition</i> is hereby PARTLY GRANTED. The <i>Decision </i>dated February 19, 2016 and <i>Resolution</i> dated May 20, 2016 of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators in MVA-091-RCMB-NCR-071-02-07-2015 are accordingly AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION such that petitioners are now ordered to pay respondent Jose Elizalde B.

The rest of the February 19, 2016 Decision stands.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Feeling aggrieved, both parties filed their respective partial motions for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On July 25, 2017, the CA issued the assailed Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> denying the motions.<br><br>Hence, the instant petition.<br><br><center><i>Issues</i><br></center><br><blockquote>I. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS AND REVERSIBLE ERROR IN AWARDING TOTAL AND PERMANENT DISABILITY BENEFITS TO PRIVATE RESPONDENT<br><br>II. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED SERIOUS ERROR IN RULING THAT RESPONDENT IS ENTITLED TO SICKNESS ALLOWANCES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES.<br><br>III. PETITIONERS HAVE RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT BOARDED A SUBSEQUENT OCEAN-Â­GOING VESSEL WITH ANOTHER EMPLOYER DESPITE A PENDING CLAIM FOR TOTAL DISABILITY BENEFITS.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br><center><i>Ruling of the Court</i></center><br><br>The Court denies the petition for failure of the petitioners to show that the CA committed any reversible error in the challenged Decision dated March 7, 2017 and the Resolution dated July 25, 2017.<br><br>The issue of whether the CA erred in upholding the Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators' findings that respondent is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits, sickness allowance, and attorney's fees is clearly factual in nature. As such, this cannot be entertained in a Rule 45 petition where the Court's jurisdiction is limited to reviewing and revising <i>errors of law</i> that might have been committed by the courts below.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Thus, the petition should be denied in the absence of any <i>exceptional circumstances</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> as to merit the Court's review of factual questions that have already been settled by both the Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators and the CA.<br><br>The petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> likewise shows that petitioners are still hinging on the same arguments, to wit: (1) that the partial disability assessment Grade 10 as determined by the company-designated physician should be upheld by the CA;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (2) that the proper procedure under the POEA-SEC to resolve conflicting medical assessments is to refer the matter to a neutral third doctor which was not complied with or refused by the respondent;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> thus, it is only the company-designated physician's assessment that should determine the extent of respondent's disability, <i>i.e.</i>, disability grading of Grade 10 for 50% loss of vision of one eye;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (3) that attorney's fees are not to be awarded in the absence of gross and evident bad faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> These were already proffered, exhaustively discussed, and settled before the Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators and the CA.<br><br>As correctly ruled by the CA, Dr. Pile, the company-designated physician, issued the Medical Certification on September 22, 2014 containing a partial disability assessment of respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> However, the certification merely stated "[<i>d</i>]<i>isability Grade 10 for (50%) loss of vision of one eye</i>", but without an explanation or description of the disability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Further, the certification reads, "[<i>p</i>]<i>resently Visual Acuity on the right eye has improved up to 20/40 only. Left eye is still 20/20. Although vision on the right eye has remarkably improved, <u>it is still inadequate for his position.</u></i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Following the earlier ruling of the Court, in the absence of a definite assessment of respondent's fitness or disability, or failure to show how the partial disability assessment was arrived at, or without any evidence to support the assessment, then this is akin to a declaration of permanent and total disability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Further, well-settled is the rule that a partial disability signifying a continuing capacity to perform one's customary task is undeniably incompatible with the finding that a seafarer is unfit for duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In the case, Dr. Pile's assessment of respondent's disability as partial or Grade 10 for the 50% loss of vision of one eye is clearly in conflict with the declaration in the same medical certification that respondent is <i>"still inadequate for his position."</i> In other words, this should already be considered as "<i>akin to a declaration of permanent and total disability</i>." The CA ruled, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The inconsistency between the partial disability assessment â€“ which should render respondent still fit for his position â€“ and the declaration that he is no longer "adequate" for his position cannot be reconciled, compounded by the fact that the said contradiction is contained in one <i>Medical Certification</i>.<br><br>Therefore, the only just and legal conclusion that could be made from the inability of a seafarer to return to his previous position, which renders him without a steady source of income, is a declaration of permanent and total disability amounting to Grade 1 Disability under the POEA-SEC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br><br>As to the issue that the award of sickness allowance is without basis, the Court affirms the ruling of the CA that the Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators correctly found that petitioners failed to pay respondent's sickness allowance pursuant to the CBA of the parties. The only defense raised by petitioners is that the sums of money due to respondent, including the questioned sickness allowance, have already been duly paid the latter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> However, the Court finds that petitioners failed to support this defense of payment. Hence, the Panel of Voluntary Arbitrators' award of the sickness allowance in favor of respondent is hereby upheld.<br><br>Lastly, petitioners argue that respondent boarded a subsequent ocean-going vessel with another employer despite his pending claim for total disability benefits;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> that it is petitioners' stand that the award of total and permanent disability benefits should be denied as there could be no claim for disability benefits if the seafarer was subsequently engaged as a seafarer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The Court disagrees.<br><br>In <i>Crystal Shipping, Inc. v. Natividad</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Court had the occasion to rule that it was of no moment that a seafarer had recovered, for what was important was that the latter was unable to perform his customary work for more than 120 days, and this already constituted as a permanent total disability. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Petitioners tried to contest the above findings by showing that respondent was able to work again as a chief mate in March 2001. Nonetheless, this information does not alter the fact that as a result of his illness, respondent was unable to work as a chief mate for almost three years. It is of no consequence that respondent was cured after a couple of years. <u>The law does not require that the illness should be incurable. What is important is that he was unable to perform his customary work for more than 120 days which constitutes permanent total disability.</u> An award of a total and permanent disability benefit would be germane to the purpose of the benefit, which is to help the employee in making ends meet at the time when he is unable to work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br><br>Given the circumstances, the Court finds that the conclusion of the CA is not tainted with grave abuse of discretion to warrant its reversal.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
