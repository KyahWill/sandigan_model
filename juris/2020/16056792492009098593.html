She called accused-appellant in her office but she was told that the latter was busy. She called again but accused-appellant could no longer be reached. She and Lailani then discovered at the POEA that JASIA's license was suspended.

The former manager arranged a meeting and Cherry was able to talk to accused-appellant's husband, who told her that there was a hiring for service crew in Canada.

Accused-appellant told them to pay the initial placement fee and/or bond of P60,000.00. Thus, Cherry deposited the amount of P45,000.00 in accused-appellant's bank account.

In Criminal Case Nos. 143740 and 143747<br><br>Jill testified that in February 2008, she asked her cousin, Cherry to go with her to JASIA and apply as service crew in Canada. Accused­-appellant told them that there were vacant slots for service crew in Canada, but also told them that they needed to pay a placement fee in the amount of P90,000.00. Jill then deposited P45,000.00 in accused­-appellant's account as she could only pay half. She also gave all her employment requirements with accused-appellant's promise that she will be deployed in Canada before December 2008. However, she was not deployed because according to accused-appellant, there was a problem with the employer in Canada. The accused-appellant then offered her employment in the US and scheduled her for an interview at the US Embassy. However, she was denied a visa because there was proof of employment for her in the US. She then asked for the return of her placement fee which accused-appellant was unable to do.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><center><i>Version of the Accused-Appellant</i><br></center><br>Accused-appellant filed a Demurrer to Evidence (With Prior Leave of Court).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> However, the RTC denied it with respect to Criminal Case Nos. 143740, 143742, 143743, 143744, 143745, and 143747 in its Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated April 25, 2014.<br><br>On the witness stand, accused-appellant testified that she was the sole proprietor of JASIA; and that it was JASIA's practice to collect US$300.00 per applicant for its services only after the applicant was successfully deployed abroad.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant further testified that she knows the private complainants; that Jovy went to JASIA to follow-up his job application in Canada which JASIA already forwarded to the employer; that after a few months, Jovy became impatient for the Labor Market Opinion (LMO) to arrive; that consequently, she mentioned to Jovy the ongoing interview conducted by a US employer to which Jovy signified his interest; that she explained to Jovy that if he would withdraw his application in Canada, the cash bond could not be refunded anymore since it was already forwarded to the Canadian employer; and that Jovy, however, did not show up at his scheduled interview in the US Embassy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant furthermore testified that Jovy did not sign an employment contract with Jani King considering that he has not paid a cash bond for his application, and that Jovy signed a contract with New Hope and not with Jani King.<br><br>As to Adoracion, accused-appellant testified that she thought Adoracion was able to leave the country since she never heard from her again from the time her US visa was approved. It was also her US employer and not accused-appellant who processed her plane ticket.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>As regards Cherry and Jill, accused-appellant argued that each of them only paid P45,000.00 and that it was JASIA which shouldered the balance; that both were not deployed in Canada because they pulled out their applications, were unable to wait for the arrival of the LMO, and wanted to apply in the US instead. However, both failed in their interview at the US Embassy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant explained that the same thing happened to Mabelle, who became in patient waiting for the arrival of the LMO. Thus, Mabelle withdrew her application for a job in Canada and became interested in working in the US. She however failed to pass the interview for her visa.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant finally argued that she is not obliged to return the cash bonds the applicants paid because all the monies she received were delivered to the foreign employer. Moreover, the transactions happened in 2008 when she still had her license. Thus, she cannot be held liable for <i>Estafa</i>. Further, she asserted that while a suspension order was issued against JASIA, it was issued only in May 2009 after JASIA had processed in full all of the private complainants' applications.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><center><i>Ruling of the RTC</i><br></center><br>On September 15, 2015, the RTC rendered its Joint Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale, defined and punished under RA 8042 in Criminal Case No. 143740; and the crime of <i>Estafa</i> defined and punished under paragraph 2(a), Article 315 of the RPC in Criminal Case Nos. 143742, 143743, 143744, 143755, and 143747.

While the defense seemingly imputed fault on her as she allegedly failed to pass the interview of the consul at the US Embassy, the Court does not find this fatal to the case of the prosecution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> To begin with, while accused-appellant alleged that Mabelle's foreign principal was North American Management, she failed to adduce any evidence to substantiate the allegation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Moreover, while accused-appellant offered in evidence the POEA Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> dated April 6, 2015 stating that there was an approved job order for 40 housekeepers with North American Management as the direct employer, the Certification indicated that the date of approval of the job order for 40 housekeepers with North American Management was April 15, 2009. Thus, there was no approved job order at the time Mabelle deposited her placement fee in accused-appellant's BDO bank account on June 13, 2008.<br><br>As regards Jovy, the Court agrees with the RTC's factual finding in its Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> dated April 25, 2014. The RTC adopted the factual finding in its Joint Judgment-that Jovy was not deployed in Canada despite paying P65,500.00 and signing an employment contract dated April 28, 2009 with Jani King.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Moreover, the Court finds that while accused-­appellant testified that Jovy signed a contract with New Hope as evidenced by the Contract of Service<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> dated July 2, 2008, a perusal of the contract shows that the contract was not signed by any representative from New Hope.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Thus, the Contract of Service has no probative value. More importantly, Jovy convincingly testified that he learned from the POEA that there was no job order listed therein for either Jani King or New Hope. In fact, Jovy's testimony was supported by the POEA Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> dated May 25, 2011.<br><br>With respect to Adoracion, accused-appellant told Adoracion sometime in November 2008 that she can deploy her for work abroad and that there was already a job order for the US. Thus, Adoracion paid US$800.00 to accused-appellant. However, accused-appellant told her after payment to wait for the job order because she was not included in the first batch. Thus, Adoracion waited.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Upon being asked by accused-­appellant, Adoracion paid P130,000.00 and P51,000.00 as processing fees at the POEA and as payment for her plane ticket. However, as aptly observed by the RTC which the CA affirmed, Adoracion was not deployed because the ticket given to her by the accused-appellant was outdated and invalid considering that it was dated 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Further, as correctly found by the RTC, Adoracion convincingly testified that she was not able to go to the airport because accused-appellant did not return her passport and other travel documents after suppossedly processing her papers at the POEA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>As regards Cherry and Jill, accused-appellant cannot impute fault on them for not having paid the full amount of:P65,000.00 each. The CA correctly observed that while both Cherry and Jill were not able to pay the full amount, the accused-appellant still accepted the partial amount of P45,000.00 from each of them. The accused-appellant then admitted, during cross-examination, that she shouldered the remaining P15,000.00 in Cherry and Jill's respective applications.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Moreover, while accused-appellant alleged in her testimony that Cherry and Jill's foreign principals in Canada are New Hope and Global, respectively, she failed to present any evidence to prove her allegation and at least show that there is in fact an available employment for Cherry and Jill.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Finally, while accused-appellant imputes fault on Cherry and Jill for failing to pass the interviews at the US Embassy as part of their job application in the US and after their employment in Canada failed to materialize, the Court does not find this fact prejudicial to the case of the prosecution. In the first place, accused-appellant failed to identify Cherry and Jill's foreign principals in the US. This gives credence to the RTC's factual finding, which was affirmed by the CA, that their visa applications were denied by the US Embassy because there was no proof of employment for them in the US.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br><i>Estafa under Article 315(2)(a) of the RPC</i><br><br>As to the charge of <i>Estafa</i> under paragraph 2(a), Article 315 of the RPC provides in part:<br><blockquote>Art. 315. <i>Swindling</i> (<i>estafa</i>). - Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow shall be punished by:<br><br>xxxx<br><br>2.

Here, the prosecution was able to prove that the accused-appellant misrepresented to the private complainants that she could provide them with overseas employment when in fact there was none at the time she made such misrepresentation. Because of the assurances, private complainants parted with their money with the expectation of employment abroad which did not materialize; thus causing damage to private complainants to the extent of the sums of money they turned over to the accused-appellant. Further, as to Adoracion, she was made to believe that accused-appellant would purchase her a plane ticket for which she paid P51,000.00. However, she was not deployed because the ticket given to her by the accused-appellant was outdated and invalid, it being dated 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Thus, the RTC correctly found the accused-appellant guilty of <i>Estafa</i>.<br><br><center><i>Penalties</i><br></center><br>As to the offense of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale, the Court is aware that the penalties in Section 7 of RA 8042 has been amended by Section 6 of RA 10022. Thus, for illegal recruitment constituting economic sabotage, the penalty under Section 7(b) of RA 8042 of "life imprisonment and a fine of not less than P500,000.00 nor more than P1,000,000.00" has been increased to "life imprisonment and a fine of not less than P2,000,000.00 nor more than P5,000,000.00 under Section 6 of RA 10022."<br><br>In this case, the affidavits of the private complainants executed on various dates on July 2009, as well as their testimonies, indicate that the offenses were committed earlier than March 8, 2010, the date of effectivity of RA 10022. Since the penalties in Section 7 of RA 8042 are more favorable to accused-appellant, the penalties stated in RA 8042 should still apply.<br><br>Consequently, considering the accused-appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale under Section 6(m) of RA 8042, the Court finds no reason to modify the penalty imposed upon her in Criminal Case No. 143740, <i>i.e.</i>, penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.<br><br>As to the crime of <i>Estafa</i> for five counts, there is a need to modify the penalties imposed by the RTC and affirmed by the CA, in view of the enactment of RA 10951 which increased the amounts that would correspond to the penalties provided in Article 315 of the RPC. Since the amendment is favorable to accused-appellant, it shall have retroactive effect. As explained in <i>People v. Dejolde</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Article 315 of the RPC, as amended by RA 10951, now provides that the penalty of <i>arresto mayor</i> in its maximum period to <i>prision correccional</i> in its minimum period shall be imposed if the amount involved is over P40,000.00 but does not exceed P1,200,000.00. Moreover, there being no mitigating and aggravating circumstance, the maximum penalty should be between one (1) year and one (1) day to one (1) year and eight (8) months of <i>prision correccional</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence is <i>arresto mayor</i> in its minimum and medium periods, <i>i.e.</i>, between one (1) month and one (1) day to four (4) months.<br><br>In this case, considering that the amounts involved in Criminal Case Nos. 143742, 143743, 143744, 1434745, 143747 are P66,550.00, P65,500.00, P217,000.00, P45,000.00 and P45,000.00, respectively, the indeterminate penalty for each count of <i>Estafa</i> should be modified to a prison term of one (1) month and one (1) day of <i>arresto mayor</i>, as minimum, to one (1) year and eight (8) months of <i>prision correccional</i>, as maximum.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
