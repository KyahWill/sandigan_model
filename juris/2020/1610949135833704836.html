She cried and fought back but she was overpowered by [Tuyor]. Thereafter, he spread her legs and inserted his penis into AAA's private parts. [Tuyor] later wiped his penis with a piece of cloth to remove the blood that came out from AAA's vagina. He likewise threatened AAA that he would kill her siblings and her mother if she told anyone about what happened.

AAA was able to narrate four of the five crimes of rape in detail: the act of Tuyor in inserting his private organ into hers; how she struggled to fight back against the accused; the pain she experienced during the rape; the whitish substance which came out from Tuyor; how Tuyor wiped her private part; and Tuyor's threats after the crimes of rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Through AAA's narration, the RTC was fully convinced that Tuyor raped AAA. According to the court <i>a quo</i>, Tuyor can only be convicted of the crimes of simple rape and not qualified rape. Although it was proven that AAA was a minor when the crimes of rape were committed, the relationship between AAA and Tuyor was not that of a stepfather-stepdaughter's since Tuyor was not married to AAA's mother. The special qualifying circumstance of a stepfather and stepdaughter relationship where the victim is a minor, cannot be considered in this case.<br><br>Tuyor filed his appeal with the CA.
