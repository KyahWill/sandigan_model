As of June 30, 1986, NDMC's outstanding loan balance with the PNB amounted to P4,708,135,920.00. Due to NDMC's inability to pay the loan and its interest, the PNB foreclosed its properties, including the subject mining claims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On February 27, 1987, the National Government of the Philippines (Government) and the PNB executed a Deed of Transfer,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> whereby the PNB turned over several of its assets to the Government, including NDMC's mining claims and rights.<br><br>Meanwhile, Proclamation No. 50<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> was issued by then President Corazon C. Aquino on December 8, 1986, creating the Committee on Privatization (COP) and the Asset Privatization Trust (APT). The COP and the APT were primarily tasked to take title to and possession of, conserve; provisionally manage and dispose of, assets identified for privatization or disposition and transferred to APT for the benefit of the Government.<br><br>On April 21, 1995, Apex filed with the Mines and Geo-Sciences Bureau (MGB), Regional Office No. XI, Davao City applications for Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA). The applications were denominated as APSA (XI) 99 and APSA (XI) 100. On July 26, 1995, Apex filed another MPSA application denominated as APSA (XI) 112.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Apex and other claimants averred that their applications cover mining claims situated in the Municipalities of Maco, Nabunturan and Maragusan in Compostela Valley, held by them either as registered claim owners, assignees or operators.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On January 8, 1996, the NDMC filed an application for Financial and Technical Assistance Agreement (FTAA) with the MGB Regional Office No. XI, Davao City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The FTAA application was registered as FTAA No. (XI) 014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It covered, among others, the mining areas subject of Lode Lease Contract No. V-523, Mining Lease Contract Nos.

However, after the plotting was conducted, the MGB found that the FTAA application overlapped the valid mining rights belonging to other persons within the area in question.

In the main, Apex argued that NDMC's mining claims were null and void for failure to comply with the mining laws.<br><br>On December 29, 1998, NDMC filed its Answer contending that the Adverse Claim/Protest filed by Apex should be dismissed on the ground of prescription, laches, lack of cause of action, and lack of merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, NDMC's Notice of Application for FTAA was published on March 16 and 18, 1999.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]<br></sup><br>On March 24, 1999, Apex filed a manifestation and motion praying that: 1) its Adverse Claim/Protest be treated as an adverse claim against the published FTAA application of NDMC; 2) the areas free of conflict be segregated; and 3) it be allowed to file amended MPSA applications.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In its Order dated January 27, 2000, the POA granted Apex's motion and ordered the segregation of the "free areas."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> NDMC moved to reconsider the Order, but the POA denied it in its Order dated March 28, 2000.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, on December 6, 2000, Executive Order No. (EO) 323<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> was issued creating the Inter-Agency Privatization Council (PC) and the Privatization and Management Office (PMO) under the Department of Finance. EO 323 was aimed to continue the privatization of government assets and corporations.

The MAB set aside the POA Decision insofar as it declared that neither party had preferential rights over Cluster 4, and insofar as how Clusters 1 and 2 were plotted. Accordingly, NDMC was declared to have preferential rights over Cluster 4 in addition to Clusters 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. The plotting of Clusters 1 and 2 was likewise ordered amended to conform to the plotting of LLA No. V-14203-Amd and LLA No. V-14205, as published.<br><br>On December 23, 2009, Apex filed a Motion for Reconsideration (of Decision dated 28 October 2009),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> which the MAB denied in its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> dated December 26, 2013. Consequently, Apex elevated the case to the CA <i>via</i> a Petition for Review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><center><i>The Ruling of the CA</i><br></center><br>In the assailed Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated December 22, 2014, the CA ruled in favor of Apex and set aside the MAB Decision dated October 28, 2009 and Resolution dated December 26, 2013. The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition for review is GRANTED. The decision of the Mines Adjudication Board (MAB) dated October 28, 2009 and resolution dated December 26, 2013 in MAB Case No. 0156-07 and MAB Case No. 0157-07, are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Petitioner Apex Mining Company, Inc. is declared to have prior and preferential right in its applications for mineral production sharing agreement with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources pursuant to Section 29 of Rep. Act No. 7942, covering areas subject of its applications, particularly, Clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as shown in Annex 7 of the Panel of Arbitrators' decision dated July 4, 2006 with Clusters 1 and 2 to be amended to conform to the plotting of LLA No. V-14203-Amd and LLA No. V-14205 as mentioned in the Mines Adjudication Board's decision dated October 28, 2009.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA found that under Republic Act No. (RA) 7942,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> otherwise known as the Philippine Mining Act of 1995, the requirements for the filing and approval of mineral agreements are different from the requirements for the filing and approval of FTAA applications. The CA relied on the ruling in the case of <i>Diamond Drilling Corp. of the Phils. v. Newmont Phils., Inc.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> (<i>Diamond Drilling Corporation</i>), which applied Section 8<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> of DENR Administrative Order No. 63. Series of 1991 (DAO 63),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> stating in part that priority shall be given to the applicant that first filed its application over the same area. Thus, as between the MPSA applications of Apex and the FTAA application of NDMC, the CA held that Apex should be given priority since it filed its MPSA applications over the contested mining areas on April 21, 1995 and on July 26, 1996, while NDMC filed its FTAA application only on January 8, 1996.<br><br>Moreover, the CA held that DENR Memorandum dated September 17, 1997, which directed all MGB Regional Directors to close to new mining applications areas already covered by valid and existing mining claims, was not an impediment to the application of Apex. The CA ratiocinated that at the time of the issuance of the Memorandum, Apex had already filed its MPSA applications with the MGB, during which time the subject mining areas were not yet closed to miring applications.<br><br>Furthermore, the CA held that the MAB committed reversible error in upholding the mining lease contracts or published lode lease applications of NDMC in support of the latter's FTAA application despite noncompliance with RA 7942 and its imple1nenting rules and regulations (IRR) for continued recognition of its mining claims. The CA ruled that NDMC failed to submit or file any application for mineral agreement on or before September 15, 1997, the mandatory deadline for the filing of mineral agreement applications by holders of valid and existing mining claims and lease/quarry applications, pursuant to Section 113<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> of RA 7942, Section 273<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> of DAO 96-40<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (IRR of RA 7942), and Section 8<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of DENR Memorandum Order No. (DMO) 97-07.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> According to the CA, the FTAA application of NDMC does not partake of the nature of a mineral agreement. It cited Section 3(ab) of RA 7942 which defines a mineral agreement as "<i>a contract between the government and a contractor, involving mineral production-sharing agreement, co-production agreement, or joint-venture agreement</i>;" and declared that FTAA, on the other hand, is a service contract for financial and technical assistance.<br><br>The CA concluded that NDMC in effect abandoned its mining claims when it failed to file an application for mineral agreement on or before September 15, 1997. Additionally, it held that NDMC's abandonment of its mining claims is coupled by the fact of the bankruptcy and revocation of its certificate of registration by the SEC and the suspension of its mining operations.<br><br>Furthermore, the CA ruled that the MAB erred in declaring NDMC to have preferential rights in its FTAA application despite the absence of certain requirements provided under RA 7942, including the following: 1) prior evaluation of the application by the MGB; 2) findings by the MGB of the sufficiency and merit of the proposal of the FTAA; and 3) he eligibility and qualification of NDMC or its successor corporation to enter into an FTAA. The CA stressed that NDMC is presently a non-operating mining corporation whose mining exploration activities have been suspended during its insolvency and conservation by APT/PMDC.<br><br>Finally, the CA held that when APT filed the FTAA proposal on January 8, 1996 in the name of NDMC, it should not be understood to mean that the State bad undertaken by itself and on its own its mandate under Section 2,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Article XII of the 1987 Philippine Constitution (Constitution). The CA declared that the fact that NDMC was placed under APT does not mean that the State will undertake on its own the exploration and development of natural resources.<br><br>The PMDC filed a Motion for Reconsideration (of the Decision dated December 22, 2014)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and a Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration (of the Decision dated December 22, 2014).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> However, these were denied in the CA Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> dated September 23, 2015.<br><br>Hence, the instant petition with the following assignment of errors:<br><blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT RULED THAT APEX HAS PRIOR AND PREFERENTIAL RIGHT OVER APT/NDMC BY VIRTUE OF ITS EARLIER MPSA APPLICATION.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT FOUND THAT AT THE TIME OF APEX' MPSA APPLICATION, THE SUBJECT MINING AREAS ARE NOT YET CLOSED TO MINING APPLICATIONS.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT HELD THAT THE MINES AND ADJUDICATION BOARD COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR IN UPHOLDING NDMC/APT'S MINING LEASE CONTRACTS OR PUBLISHED LODE LEASE APPLICATIONS.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT RULED THAT THE MAB COMMITTED AN ERROR IN DECLARING NDMC/PMDC TO HAVE PREFERENTIAL RIGHT IN ITS FTAA APPLICATION DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER REPUBLIC ACT NO. 7942.<br><br><center>V<br></center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED WHEN IT CONCLUDED THAT APT'S FILING OF FTAA IN THE NAME OF NDMC IS NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS THE STATE'S INTENTION TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP, AND UTILIZE THE COUNTRY'S NATURAL RESOURCES.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>Essentially, the main issue to be resolved in this case is: <i>Who between the PMDC, as the successor-in-interest of NDMC, and Apex has preferential rights over the contested mining areas?</i><br><br><center><i>The Court's Ruling</i><br></center><br>The petition is impressed with merit. <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="20%"><div align="justify"><em>I.

In this regard, the findings of the MAB, as the administrative body with jurisdiction over disputes relative to mining rights, should be treated with deference in recognition of its expertise and technical knowledge over such matters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>As found by the MAB, affirming the POA, NDMC had valid and existing mining claims over the contested areas denominated as Clusters 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. Further, after evaluating the parties' respective appeals from the Decision of the POA, the MAB also found that NDMC had preferential rights over the mining areas under Cluster 4.<br><br>Cluster 1 covers NDMC's LLA No. V-14203-Amd, while Cluster 2 covers its LLA No. V-14205. As found by the POA, the notice of LLA No. V-14203-Amd was published on November 18, 1982, while the notice of LLA No. V-14205 was published on March 31, 1988 and April 7, 1988.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Pursuant to Section 48<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 463,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the law in force at that time, Apex had 15 days from the date of first publication to file its adverse claims, if any, against these applications. Further, it is stated under Section 40 of PD 463 that "[<i>i</i>]<i>f no adverse claim is filed within fifteen (15) days after the first publication, it shall be conclusively presumed that no such adverse claim exists and thereafter no objection from third parties to the grant of the lease shall be heard, except protest pending at the time of publication x x x</i>." No adverse claim or any kind of protest was filed with respect to LLA No. V-14203-Amd.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> On the other hand, the adverse claim of Apex on LLA No. V-14205 was filed on September 17, 1988, which is way beyond the 15-day period following the first date of publication on March 31, 1988.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Thus, the MAB correctly affirmed the POA in ruling that Apex was already barred from questioning the validity of NDMC's mining claims covered by Clusters 1 and 2.<br><br>The POA also found that NDMC had better rights to Cluster 3. It observed that prior to NDMC, the claims over the disputed areas under Cluster 3 were held by Myrna C. Tenorio and Fred Antonio T. Tejada, the original holders of Declarations of Location (DOL). They later executed in favor of NDMC Deeds of Assignment dated July 1, 1983 and July 17, 1987.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Apparently, there is evidence showing that NDMC had existing claims over the areas covered by Cluster 3.<br><br>With respect to the areas under Cluster 4, while the POA ruled that neither NDMC nor Apex had preferential rights over these areas, the Court finds that the MAB was correct in reversing the POA and ruling that NDMC's claim should be upheld. NDMC had been filing the required Affidavits of Annual Work Obligations and paid the occupation fees for several years on behalf of Empire, Hijo, and Goldcoast.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> On the contrary, while Apex claimed the existence of DOLs, it nonetheless admitted that these DOLs were not registered due to prior claims of NDMC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Hence, Apex had not acquired any right over Cluster 4.<br><br>The POA was also convinced that NDMC had better rights to the claims covered by Cluster 5.

APEX's APSA (XI) 112 dated 26 July 1995, (consisting of the "Edgar-IV, V and VI" blocks) appears to have been filed over areas considered closed to mining because the latter are subject to the earlier Commonwealth Act No. 137 claims of NDMC ("RA" claims). x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br></blockquote>The POA cited Section 19(c) of RA 7942 which provides that mineral agreement or financial or technical assistance agreement applications shall not be allowed "in areas covered by valid and existing mining rights."<br><br>The POA similarly found NDMC to have better rights to the claims under Cluster 6, which is contiguous to Ciuster 5.

Notably, the applications of NDMC and Apex over the same mining areas were all filed before September 15, 1997, the mandatory deadline set for the filing of mineral agreement applications <i>by holders of valid and existing mining claims and lease/quarry applications</i>.<br><br>In this case, the CA gravely erred in ruling that Apex should be given priority as its MPSA applications were filed earlier than the FTAA application of NDMC. The CA completely brushed aside the MAB's findings relative to the parties' prior claims over the areas in dispute.<br><br>As found by the MAB, prior to the effectivity of RA 7942, it was NDMC, not Apex, that had valid and existing mining claims over the contested areas denominated as Clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Regrettably, the CA altogether disregarded the factual findings of the POA and the MAB which were inevitable considerations in applying the provisions of Section 113 of RA 7942, Section 273 of the IRR of RA 7942, and Section 8 of DMO 97-07.<br><br>To highlight, the above-mentioned provisions presuppose that the applicants are <i>holders of valid and existing mining claims, and lease/quarry applications prior to the effectivity of RA 7942</i>. It is of no consequence that Apex's MPSA applications were filed earlier than NDMC's FTAA application in view of the finding that Apex had no pre­existing and valid claims over the contested areas. Verily, the preferential right under these provisions should be given to NDMC.<br><br>Apart from disregarding the prior mining lease contracts and published lode lease applications of NDMC, the CA erroneously applied Section 8 of DAO 63 as cited in the case of <i>Diamond Drilling Corporation</i>. A reading of Section 8 of DAO 63 shows that it specifically pertains to the acceptance and evaluation of FTAAs. Also, the application of this provision in the <i>Diamond Drilling Corporation</i> case did not have any relation to the provisions of Section 113 of RA 7942, Section 273 of the IRR of RA 7942, and Section 8 of DMO 97-07. Evidently, Section 8 of DAO 63 is far from being applicable to the instant case. <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="20%"><div align="justify"><em>III.

However, a precondition to the closing of these areas is provided in Section 8 of DMO 97-07. It states that <i>holders of valid and existing mining claims and lease/quarry applications</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> <i>filed prior to the effectivity of RA 7942, are required to file mineral agreement applications pursuant to Section 273 of the IRR on or before September 15, 1997</i> if they have not filed any mineral agreement applications over areas covered by such mining claims and lease/quarry applications.<br><br>As earlier stated, the MPSA applications of Apex and FTAA application of NDMC were all filed before September 15, 1997. However, since Apex had been found to have no valid and existing mining claims and lease/quarry applications over the areas covered by Clusters 1 to 6, its MPSA applications were of no consequence.<br><br>On the other hand, given that NDMC is a holder of valid and existing mining claims and lease applications over the contested areas, an important issue to address is whether its FTAA application filed on January 8, 1996 is a "mineral agreement application" within the contemplation of Section 113 of RA 7942, Section 273 of the IRR of RA 7942, and Section 8 of DMO 97-07. Another issue to address is whether the FTAA application of NDMC had closed to other mining applications the areas covered by Clusters 1 to 6.<br><br>Under RA 7942, a <i>mineral agreement</i> is defined in Section 3(ab) as "a contract between the government and a contractor, involving mineral production-sharing agreement, co-production agreement, or joint-venture agreement." Section 3(r) separately defines <i>financial or technical assistance agreement</i> as "a contract involving financial or technical assistance for large-scale exploration, development, and utilization of mineral resources."<br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Apex argues that an FTAA application is not the mineral agreement required by the IRR of RA 7942. It cited the Memorandum dated November 19, 1998 issued by the Director of the MGB which partly states: "[<i>w</i>]<i>ith Section 8 of DMO No. 97-07, it is settled that holders of valid and existing mining claims and lease/quarry applications can only apply for a Mineral Agreement, that is, Mineral Production Sharing Agreement, Co-Production Agreement or Joint Venture Agreement</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Notably, in the same Memorandum dated November 19, 1998 the MGB also stated:<br><blockquote>The case of NDMC, however, should be taken differently. Here is a situation where Government's interest is directly at stake. With NDMC at the hands of the Asset Privatization Trust (APT), it has assumed the character of a government-owned entity and, therefore, it cannot be placed in the same level with private mining applicants. A cursory review of the Mining Act, the Revised IRR and DMO No. 97-07 will show that practically all these regulatory provisions, save for the provision on Government Gratuitous Permit, refer to mineral resources disposition by contractors.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>Hence, this Office is of the position that the FTAA application of NDMC is acceptable, not because there is no prohibition in the law allowing holders of valid and existing mining claims and lease/quarry applications to enter into other modes of mining rights other than Mineral Agreements, but solely because of direct Government's interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court observes that the MOB issued the above Memorandum in the exercise of its quasi-judicial power. Quasi-judicial or administrative adjudicatory power is the power to hear and determine questions of fact to which the legislative policy is to apply and to decide in accordance with the standards laid down by the law itself in enforcing and administering the same law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> The administrative body exercises its quasi-judicial power when it performs in a judicial manner an act essentially of an executive or administrative nature, where the power to act in such manner is incidental to or reasonably necessary for the performance of the executive or administrative duty entrusted to it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Significantly, the MGB itself clarified in the Memorandum that an FTAA is not one of those considered as a mineral agreement. However, in accepting NDMC's FTAA application, the MGB took into consideration the fact that NDMC had been placed in the hands of APT and had assumed the character of a government-owned entity. The MOB set aside teclu1icalities inasmuch as the Government's interest is directly at stake.<br><br>The opinion of MGB is well taken. In the sound exercise of its quasi-judicial power, the MGB aptly considered NDMC's case as different from that of private mining applicants. The reason for MOB's acceptance of the FTAA application filed on January 8, 1996 is clear-<i>it is solely due to the direct interest of the Government over NDMC's mining claims and rights, which were already entrusted to APT at the time of the FTAA application</i>.<br><br>Notably, the MAB also stressed in its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> that the subject mining claims of NDMC were among the assets transferred by the PNB to the Government. Briefly, the MAB explained:<br><blockquote>It bears stressing that the subject mining claims were among the assets/properties transferred by PNB to the National Government. Thereafter, a certificate of sale over [NDMC]'s properties was issued to APT being then [sic] highest bidder. Pursuant to E.O. 323, the [NDMC] assets, among others, were turned over to PMO from the COP/APT. Then the assets/properties were transferred to the NRMDC, now PMDC, as trustee and disposition entity. Finally, on 07 April 2006, the PMDC and the National Government executed a Trust Agreement whereby the mining assets of x x x NDMC were transferred, conveyed and assigned to PMDC to develop and/or dispose of said properties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br></blockquote>Taking the foregoing antecedents into consideration, the Court affirms the MGB's determination that the FTAA application of NDMC should be treated differently and should be understood as the State's exercise of its right of ownership over NDMC's mining claims. In accepting NDMC's FTAA application, the MGB in this case merely recognized the rights of the Government to the mining property of NDMC, who held valid and existing mining claims over the contested areas. The application was not an FTAA application <i>per se</i>, considering that the Government cannot enter into an agreement with itself. By reason of the Government's direct interest over the mineral property of NDMC, the FTAA application was meant to close to other mining applications the areas over which the NDMC had mining claims. Apparently, these areas were among those ordered closed by then Acting DENR Secretary Antonio G. M. La Viña through his issuance of the Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> dated September 17, 1997, which enjoined all MGB Regional Directors to close to new mining locations or applications those areas covered by valid and existing mining claims held in trust by APT or other similar entities.<br><br><i>IV. Prescription does not lie against the State.</i><br><br>The CA mistakenly concluded that NDMC had in effect abandoned its mining claims when it failed to file an application for mineral agreement on or before September 15, 1997, holding that NDMC's FTAA application is not a mineral agreement within the contemplation of RA 7942. Moreover, it erred in holding that the bankruptcy revocation of NDMC's certificate of registration by the SEC and the suspension of mining operations supported the finding that NDMC had indeed abandoned its mining claims.<br><br>In arriving at the above conclusion, the CA failed to consider that it was the Government's interest that was at stake. At the time of the filing of the FTAA application, the mining claims of NDMC were among the assets and properties turned over by the PNB to the Government. These assets and properties were then placed in the possession of APT. At present, the PMDC is the trustee of NDMC's mineral property. Verily, before the Court and the CA, the Government has been represented by the PMDC, as the successor-in-interest of NDMC's mining property.<br><br>The Court affirms the CA in ruling that an FTAA is not one of the mineral agreements that holders of valid and existing mining claims and lease/quarry applications could apply for in order to close the subject areas to other mining applications. As explained by the MGB, a mineral agreement could only be any of the following: an MPSA, a co-­production agreement, or a joint venture agreement.<br><br>Nonetheless, while the FTAA is admittedly not a mineral agreement within the contemplation of RA 7942, it bears reiterating that NDMC's FTAA application was not an FTAA application <i>per se</i> and should be considered as the Government's direct interest and intention to exercise its ownership over the mineral property of NDMC. In addition, the FTAA application was also meant to close to other mining applications the mining areas over which the NDMC had mining claims. Therefore, it did not matter whether it was a mineral agreement or an FTAA that was applied for by NDMC. The sole reason that the MGB accepted the FTAA application was the Government's direct interest in the case.<br><br>At this juncture, it is worthy to emphasize Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution which pertinently states that "[<i>a</i>]<i>ll lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries, forests or timber, wildlife, flora and fauna, and other natural resources are owned by the State. x x x The exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources shall be under the full control and supervision of the State</i>." Thus, as the owner of natural resources, the State has the primary power and responsibility in their exploration, development, and utilization.<br><br>Affirming Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution is Section 4 of RA 7942 which partly reads:<br><blockquote>Section 4. Ownership of Mineral Resources. - Mineral resources are owned by the State and the exploration, development, utilization, and processing thereof shall be under its full control and supervision. The State may directly undertake such activities or it may enter into mineral agreements with contractors.<br></blockquote>Thus, the Court holds that the CA erred in concluding that the FTAA application should not be considered as the State's intention to explore, develop, and utilize the country's natural resources. To insist that the Government should enter into a specific mineral agreement under RA 7942 would be a direct affront to its power to fully control and supervise the exploration, development, and utilization of the country's mineral resources. Ultimately, it amounts to depriving the State of its ownership of all natural resources.<br><br>In any case, it is a time-honored principle that the statute of limitations or the lapse of time does not run against the State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Hence, even assuming that the NDMC did not file the FTAA application or failed to file a valid mineral agreement application on or before September 15, 1997, the areas included in the FTAA application of NDMC would still be closed to other mining applications for the simple reason that it is the Government that owns the mineral property of NDMC.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is <b>GRANTED</b>.
