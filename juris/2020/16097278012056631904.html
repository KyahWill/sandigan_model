SP No. 130731 and CA-G.R. SP No. 134905:<br><br>1. Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated August 18, 2017 reversing the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) and declaring as valid the dismissal of petitioner Domingo P.

Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated May 29, 2018 denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration.<br><br><center><b>Antecedents</b><br></center><br>On February 2, 2004, private respondent Granite Services International, Inc. (Granite Services) hired petitioner Domingo P. Gimalay as mechanical technician/rigger on a project-based employment. On January 1, 2007, petitioner was hired as a regular member of the company's work pool.<br><br>Petitioner's contract with Granite Services required him to work on various projects at different locations here and abroad. For his assignment abroad, he would receive compensation based on the stipulated rates. For the periods that he was out of assignments, he would be entitled to P15,000.00 as monthly retainer or waiting fee. This amount was later increased to P18,000.00 on January 1, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On January 25, 2012, petitioner was deployed to Ghana, Africa for a two (2) month contract on a monthly salary of USD900.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Private respondents alleged that on February 23 and 24, 2012, petitioner repeatedly violated Granite Services' safety code. First, he was allegedly spotted working on top of a compressor casing at the back of a trailer instead of working <i>from</i> the trailer. Second, petitioner allegedly did not give proper clearance to the crane operator causing a compressor casing to swing towards an employee which could have caused serious danger to the latter's life. Lastly, petitioner allegedly stood on top of a turbine without a safety harness. Outage Excellence Leader Alan Carruth saw and reported these transgressions via e-mail to Granite Services' Human Resource Manager, private respondent Daniel Sargeant. A few days later, Service Manager Bonifacio Quedi launched a formal investigation. Meanwhile, petitioner completed his overseas contract and returned to the Philippines on March 3, 2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On March 5, 2012, Service Manager Quedi called petitioner to a meeting and asked him to explain why he should not be dismissed for gross misconduct. Another meeting took place between them together with HR Manager Sargeant. On March 7, 2012, a formal notice of termination was served on petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Petitioner averred that on March 7, 2012, Granite Services' security guard prevented him from entering its premises. He claimed that even assuming that the alleged incidents were true, the penalty of dismissal was not commensurate to his so-called infractions.<br><br><center><b>The Labor Arbiter's Ruling</b><br></center><br>By Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated August 31, 2012, Labor Arbiter Alberto B. Dolosa granted the relief prayed for and declared petitioner to have been illegally dismissed:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, judgment is hereby entered declaring that the dismissal of complainant IILEGAL for failure of the respondents to substantially prove just cause and observance of due process. Consequently, respondents GRANITE SERVICES INTERNATIONAL INC. is hereby ordered to pay complainant DOMINGO P. GIMALAY, as of the date of this Decision, the following judgment awards:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="30%">1.

There was also no concrete and credible evidence that the company launched a formal investigation affording petitioner a chance to explain his side. In any case, the infractions were for "near misses." The labor arbiter found that no actual accident happened, no one was injured, and no damage was inflicted. Hence, the labor arbiter opined that admonition or reprimand would have been the commensurate penalty, not dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The labor arbiter, however, ruled that since petitioner had already completed his contract abroad at the time he was dismissed from his work, his backwages should be based on his monthly retainer or waiting fee of P18,000.00 and not on his monthly salary of USD900.00 when the alleged incidents happened.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Further, labor arbiter Dolosa ordered payment of separation pay in lieu of reinstatement because:<br><blockquote>x x x reinstatement is no longer feasible because of the existence of strained relation between the parties and the respondent's lack of intention to reinstate the complainant by their offer, by way of amicable settlement, of separation pay during the mandatory conference. Notably, the settlement through payment of separation pay failed to materialize because of the parties' disagreement as to the rate of pay to be used.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>Both parties appealed to the NRLC. On one hand, private respondents argued that petitioner was dismissed for cause; on the other, petitioner claimed that the basis for his backwages should be his latest monthly salary in Ghana in the amount of USD900.00. He did not anymore question the directive to pay separation benefits in lieu of reinstatement. His appeal, in fact, was only focused on the amount of separation benefits awarded him.<br><br><center><b>The NLRC's Ruling</b><br></center><br>Through its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated March 7, 2013, the NLRC affirmed with modification:<br><blockquote><b>Having established the illegality of the dismissal</b>, We sustain the grant of full backwages computed from the date the Complaint was dismissed up (to) the finality of this Decision, on top of the separation pay computed from January 1, 2007 likewise up to the finality of this Decision.<br><br>Both awards are based on his latest monthly salary of P264,867.17 per pay slip marked as Annexes "6-C" and "6-D", broken down as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="30%">Salary from February 1, to 15, 2012</td><td width="3%"><div align="center">= </div></td><td width="79%">P106,997.73 per Annex 6-C</td></tr><tr><td>Salary from February 16 to 28, 2012</td><td><div align="center">=</div></td><td>P157,869.44 per (A)nnex 6-D</td></tr><tr><td><div align="right">Total </div></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>P264,867.17</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Simple logic made it clear that the Complainant was hired to work, not to stand-by and do nothing. He was hired to work as Rigger and Mechanical Technician abroad whose latest monthly salary paid to him on February 29, 2012 as such was, as computed above, P264,867.17 for the month of February, 2012 (Annexes 6-C and 6(-)D/Complainant's Position Paper) therefore it should be the basis of his backwages and separation pay. The "waiting fee or retainer fee" cannot be considered as his monthly salary as Rigger and Mechanical Technician because during the waiting period, he was not doing the work for which he was being employed.<br><br>Forced to litigate to protect his rights, the Complainant is entitled to an award of attorney's fees not exceeding 10% of the judgment award.<br><br>Accordingly, the Decision is MODIFIED in that the Respondents are ordered to pay the Complainant, tentatively, the following:<br><br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="5">1.

There was also no proof that Outage Excellence Leader Carruth was petitioner's supervisor, and therefore, he could not be considered a competent witness. There was similarly no hard evidence to prove that a formal investigation was held and that petitioner was given the chance to explain his side. In the absence of substantial and procedural due process, petitioner was illegally dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The NLRC, however, ruled that for purposes of computing the backwages, petitioner's salaries abroad must be considered.

He did not wear a harness during the third incident in question because there was no hangers or knobs to which a harness could be hooked. But even assuming his act was a violation of the safety code, this did not actually result in any damage to life or property, aside from the fact that it was only his first offense in his eight (8) years of service.

Since the petition was filed only on July 6, 2018, or one (1) day late, the dispositions of the Court of Appeals had therefore become final and executory.

The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, held that private respondents were able to prove the alleged infractions.<br><br>In <b><i>Distribution &amp; Control Products, Inc. v. Santos</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the Court reiterated that in termination cases, the burden of proof rests upon the employer to show that the dismissal is for just and valid cause. Failure to do so necessarily means that the dismissal was illegal. The employer's case succeeds or fails on the strength of its evidence and not on the weakness of the employee's defense. If doubt exists between the evidence presented by the employer and the employee, the scales of justice must be tilted in favor of the latter.<br><br>To prove petitioner's alleged violations of the safety procedures, respondent company submitted the e-mail of Outage Excellence Leader Carruth,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> an Incident Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> regarding petitioner's supposed failure to sufficiently communicate with the crane operator, and the Termination Letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> signed by HR Manager Sargeant. The Court of Appeals considered these documents sufficient to hold that petitioner was dismissed for cause.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>Petitioner was charged with three (3) violations of safety procedures, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br>(a) He stood on top of the compressor casing on the back of a trailer, when he should have been working <i>from</i> the trailer;<br><br>(b) He was responsible for unclear communication between him and the crane operator which caused a casing to swing towards another employee; and<br><br>(c) He stood on top of a turbine with no safety harness.<br><br>As for the <i>first infraction</i>, no evidence other than Outage Excellence Leader Carruth's e-mail and the termination letter was presented to show that petitioner indeed stood on top of the compressor. Would a reasonably prudent person accept these documents as sufficient to prove the charge and on the basis thereof dismiss the employee from work? Certainly not. These pieces of evidence are self-serving documents which private respondents or any other person could have easily drafted. As it was not impossible for private respondents to access other witnesses, they should have secured the statements of other workers on site to corroborate their claim.<br><br>With regard to the <i>second infraction</i>, private respondents aver that petitioner failed to clearly communicate with the crane operator before signaling for the release of the casing. The Incident Report itself, however, states that he blew his whistle and gave the signal to the crane operator only after he "<i>finished checking casing alignment/center of gravity</i>." It shows that petitioner took the necessary precautions before he gave the signal to the crane operator. When the crane operator hoisted up the casing, the casing swung to the left and narrowly missed another worker.<br><br>True, an accident could have occurred, but this does not necessarily mean that petitioner failed to take the proper precautions or that the incident was due to his fault. A lot of factors could have caused the casing to swerve to the left. It could have been caused by the crane operator. It could have also been caused by the mechanics of the crane itself. It was also possible that the employee who was nearly hit by the casing was not there when petitioner gave the signal. In fine, there are several circumstances which could have led to the incident. Private respondents did not investigate these factors; neither were they able to rule them out, like any reasonably prudent person would have done. Without any investigation to support private respondents' claim, it cannot be reasonably concluded that the incident was due solely to petitioner's negligence.<br><br>As for the <i>third and last incident</i>, petitioner repeatedly avers that there was no available line to which the safety harness could be attached; private respondents insists such available line was in place.<br><br>Once again, private respondents did not present any evidence to support this allegation. They could have produced photos showing that a line was available for the harness which petitioner could have used at that time. They could have easily produced these photos, but they failed to do so. Too, they could have secured the statements of other workers on site who were allegedly able to use the line for their own safety harness. But still, private respondents failed on this score. Instead, they relied solely on the self-serving, nay, unverified report of Outage Excellence Leader Carruth.<br><br>Verily, therefore, the Court of Appeals erred when it ruled that the charges against petitioner for violation of company safety procedures were substantiated by concrete and substantial evidence.<br><br>As for procedural due process, all three (3) tribunals below were unanimous in declaring that private respondents did not comply with the twin-notice rule. Private respondents did not send a written notice to petitioner informing him of his alleged infractions, nor was there an investigation where petitioner could have been given the chance to explain his side.<br><br>All told, the absence of both substantive and procedural due process in effecting petitioner's dismissal renders it illegal.<br><br>On the consequences of the illegality of petitioner's dismissal, <b><i>Noblado v. Alfonso</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> held:<br><blockquote>In fine, respondent's lack of just cause and non-compliance with the procedural requisites in terminating petitioners' employment taints the latter's dismissal with illegality.<br><br><b>Where the dismissal was without just or authorized cause and there was no due process</b>, Article 279 of the Labor Code, as amended, mandates that the employee is entitled to <b>reinstatement without loss of seniority rights</b> and other privileges and <b>full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time the compensation was not paid up to the time of actual reinstatement</b>. However, <b>if reinstatement is no longer possible, the backwages shall be computed from the time of the employee's illegal termination up to the finality of the decision</b>.<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></center><br>In addition to payment of backwages, petitioners are also entitled to <b>separation pay</b> equivalent to one (1) month pay for every year of service, with a fraction of at least six (6) months considered as one (1) whole year, from the time of their illegal dismissal up to the finality of this judgment, as an alternative to reinstatement.<br><br>Also, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, <b>legal interest</b> shall be imposed on the monetary awards herein granted at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, an illegally dismissed employee is ordinarily entitled to: (a) reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, or in lieu thereof, separation pay equivalent to one (1) month pay for every year of service, with a fraction of at least six (6) months considered as one (1) whole year, from the time of the employee's illegal dismissal up to the finality of the judgment; and (b) full backwages inclusive of allowances and other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time compensation was not paid to the time of his actual reinstatement.<br><br>As for reinstatement, petitioner has not sought the same way back in the proceedings before the labor arbiter and up until here. On this score, we reckon with the pronouncement of the labor arbiter:<br><blockquote>x x x this Labor Arbitration Court finds that reinstatement is no longer feasible because of the existence of strained relation between the parties and the respondent's lack of intention to reinstate the complainant by their offer, by way of amicable settlement, of separation pay during the mandatory conference. Notably, the settlement through payment of separation pay failed to materialize because of the parties' disagreement as to the rate of pay to be used.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>Consequently, petitioner is entitled to backwages of one (1) month for every year of service from the time of his illegal dismissal up to finality of this Decision.<br><br>As regard the amount of petitioner's backwages, the Court agrees with the labor arbiter that petitioner's monthly retainer/waiting fee of Phpl8,000.00 and not his monthly salary in Ghana (USD900.00 per month) should be used in the computation.<br><br><b><i>Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC) v. NLRC, et al.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> instructs:<br><blockquote>An illegally dismissed employee is usually reinstated to his former position without loss of seniority rights and paid backwages from the time he was separated from work up to his actual reinstatement. The purpose of reinstatement is to restore the employee to the state or condition from which he has been removed or separated. Backwages aim to replenish the income that was lost by reason of the unlawful dismissal.<br><br>In the case at bar, we hold that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in computing private respondent's backwages based on his salary abroad. The records show that <b><i>private respondent was not illegally dismissed while working in the Middle East project</i> of the petitioner. His overseas assignment was a specific project and for a definite period.</b> Upon the completion of the project in 1984, he received all the benefits due him under the overseas contract. He then voluntarily returned to the Philippines to await his deployment in the local projects of the petitioner. Clearly, he was not illegally dismissed while working in the Middle East.<br><br><b>When private respondent prayed for reinstatement, he meant reinstatement to his position as a regular member of petitioner's work pool. If private respondent were given local assignments after his stint abroad, he would have received the local wage. This is the "loss" which backwages aim to restore.</b><br><br>In making this ruling, we take into account the principle that salary scales reflect the standard of living prevailing in the country and the purchasing power of the domestic currency. Private respondent received a higher salary rate for his work in the Middle East because the cost of living and the standard of living in that country are different from those in the Philippines. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner here was a regular member of private respondents' work pool. He was assigned in Ghana only for a specific period, <i>i.e.</i>, January 2012 to March 2012. On March 3, 2012, he returned to the Philippines. Thus, he had already completed his contract in Ghana when Granite Services dismissed him from work.<br><br>As in <b><i>PNCC</i></b>, petitioner already received all the benefits due him under the completed and concluded overseas contract. He returned to the Philippines not as a worker from Ghana but as a member of the regular work pool of Granite Services. As such, he is entitled to receive not the amount stipulated in his Ghana contract but the monthly retainer/waiting fee of P18,000.00. Consequently, the same should be the base amount for the computation of his backwages.<br><br>But petitioner argues that his salary in Ghana should be the basis for the computation of his backwages because he had not actually completed yet his overseas contract. He claims that private respondents prematurely pulled him out from Ghana in the guise of another overseas deployment.<br><br>Aside from this bare allegation, however, no evidence was adduced to prove that he was actually pulled out from Ghana in the guise of another overseas deployment. In fact, Labor Arbiter Dolosa and the NLRC found that petitioner had already finished his contract in Ghana. This factual finding is binding upon us since even the Court of Appeals did not deviate therefrom.<br><br>Verily, in accordance with the ruling in <b><i>PNCC</i></b>, petitioner's monthly retainer or waiting fee in the Philippines should be the basis for the computation of his backwages.<br><br>On the award of damages, <b><i>Leus v. St. Scholastica's College Westgrove</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> bears the ground rules:<br><blockquote>x x x A dismissed employee is entitled to <b>moral damages when the dismissal is attended by bad faith or fraud or constitutes an act oppressive to labor, or is done in a manner contrary to good morals, good customs or public policy. Exemplary damages may be awarded if the dismissal is effected in a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner</b>.<br><br>Bad faith, under the law, does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence. It imports a <b>dishonest purpose</b> or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong, or a breach of a known duty through some motive or interest or ill will that partakes of the nature of fraud.<br><br><b>It must be noted that the burden of proving bad faith rests on the one alleging it</b> since basic is the principle that good faith is presumed and he who alleges bad faith has the duty to prove the same. <i>Allegations of bad faith and fraud must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.</i><br><br>The records of this case are bereft of any clear and convincing evidence showing that the respondents acted in bad faith or in a wanton or fraudulent manner in dismissing the petitioner. That the petitioner was illegally dismissed is insufficient to prove bad faith. A dismissal may be contrary to law but by itself alone, it does not establish bad faith to entitle the dismissed employee to moral damages. The award of moral and exemplary damages cannot be justified solely upon the premise that the employer dismissed his employee without cause.<br><br>However, the petitioner is entitled to <b>attorney's fees</b> in the amount of <b>10% of the total monetary award</b> pursuant to Article 111 of the Labor Code. It is settled that where an employee was forced to litigate and, thus, incur expenses to protect his rights and interest, the award of attorney's fees is legally and morally justifiable. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>As in <b><i>Leus</i></b>, petitioner failed to show the requisite elements for the award of damages here. He failed to substantiate that private respondents acted in bad faith, or that his dismissal constitutes an act oppressive to labor, or that his dismissal was done in a manner contrary to good morals, good customs or public policy, or that his dismissal was done in wanton, oppressive, or malevolent manner.<br><br>Following both statutory and case law, petitioner should be paid attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award. This is because he was forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect his rights and interest.<br><br>Petitioner is entitled to legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) on all the monetary awards to him per annum from the finality of this Decision until fully paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Notably, however, the NLRC's judgment, which fixed a higher amount of backwages had already been executed. The only question is whether there was a full or partial satisfaction of the correct amount. On this score, there is a need for the labor arbiter to recompute the executed amount <i>vis-a-vis</i> the judgment amount. Whatever amount may still be deficient or paid in excess should be satisfied by or refunded to private respondents, as the case may be.<br><br>One final point. There is no proof that private respondents Joseph Medina, Daniel Sargeant, and April Anne Junio acted with malice or bad faith. They cannot be held solidarily liable with Granite Services.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> This is especially true for private respondent April Anne Junio who was not even impleaded as party respondent before the labor tribunals.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
