CV No. 99885. <p align="center"> <b>The Facts and Antecedent Proceedings</b> </p><p> As culled from the CA's recital of the facts and the records of the instant case, the essential facts and antecedent proceedings are as follows: </p><p> Petitioner Redentor and his aunt, petitioner Casiana, alleged that the former's parents, the Spouses Alejandro and Rosalinda Catapang (Sps. Catapang), obtained a loan from respondent Lipa Bank. The loan was secured by a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage over the Sps. Catapang's property located at Barrio Namuco, Rosario, Batangas, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-50140.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p><p> As the Sps. Catapang failed to pay their loan obligation, the mortgage was foreclosed. The Sps. Catapang also failed to exercise their right of redemption. Thereafter, in February 1999, the aforesaid property was consolidated in the name of respondent Lipa Bank and a new title,<i> i.e</i>., TCT No. 102308, was issued in its favor. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p> Subsequently, the Sps. Catapang, who were allowed by respondent Lipa Bank to stay in the property, offered to repurchase the property. However, respondent Lipa Bank refused to negotiate with them. Instead, in June 1999, respondent Lipa Bank offered to sell the property to petitioner Redentor, who respondent Lipa Bank perceived to be in a better financial position, for the amount of P1,500,000.00. Respondent Lipa Bank then executed a Sales Contract<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated June 30, 1999 with petitioner Redentor, which provided that a downpayment of P400,000.00 should be paid by petitioner Redentor upon the signing and execution of the Sales Contract. </p><p> However, out of the required P400,000.00 downpayment, only the amount of P200,000.00 was paid by petitioner Redentor. In order to secure the complete amount of downpayment, upon the advice of respondent Lipa Bank's loan division head, Mr. Damian, petitioner Redentor supposedly secured a loan of P270,000.00 with respondent Lipa Bank. As collateral for the said loan, petitioner Redentor presented and submitted to respondent Lipa Bank the owner's duplicate copy of a TCT covering a certain parcel of land registered in the name of his aunts Gregoria Catapang and petitioner Casiana,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>i.e.</i>, TCT No. T-52886<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (the subject property). </p><p> Allegedly, without petitioner Redentor's knowledge and consent, respondent Lipa Bank successfully convinced petitioner Casiana to sign a Promissory Note<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated June 30, 1999 for a P270,000.00 loan and a Deed of Real Estate Mortgage<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated August 6, 1999 over the subject property for P1,440,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners Redentor and Casiana alleged that the execution of the aforesaid Promissory Note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage was tainted with fraud, undue influence, and trickery, considering that petitioner Casiana was allegedly not a borrower of respondent Lipa Bank and that she has never been a party to the Sales Contract. Petitioner Casiana also alleged that she did not receive any proceeds from the P270,000.00 loan. In short, petitioners Redentor and Casiana allege that the Promissory Note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage executed by the latter supposedly in relation to the Sales Contract were procured with fraud as petitioner Casiana had nothing to do with the repurchase of the subject property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> Hence, petitioners Redentor and Casiana filed a Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated February 14, 2006 before the Regional Trial Court of Rosario, Batangas, Branch 87 (RTC), praying that the Promissory Note and the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage be declared null and void. Petitioners Redentor and Casiana also prayed that the Sales Contract be declared null and void, arguing that it was dependent on the supposedly null and void Promissory Note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage. Further, petitioners Redentor and Casiana also asked for the refund of the amount of P200,000.00 paid by petitioner Redentor and for the return by respondent Lipa Bank of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. T-52886. The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 06-010. </p><p> On the part of respondent Lipa Bank, it alleged in its Answer with Counterclaim<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated May 18, 2006 that petitioner Redentor voluntarily entered into a Sales Contract with the former on June 30, 1999, with petitioner Redentor's father Alejandro even witnessing the execution of the said Contract. Petitioner Redentor was able to pay P200,000.00 of the P400,000.00 downpayment that was agreed upon by the parties. Respondent Lipa Bank then claimed that it was petitioner Redentor himself who wanted to secure a loan in the amount of P270,000.00 in order to fully pay the downpayment. According to respondent Lipa Bank, it was petitioner Redentor, together with petitioner Casiana, who voluntarily and willingly submitted to respondent Lipa Bank the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. T-52886 so that the subject property could be used as collateral to secure the loan.</p><p> With respect to the Promissory Note for P270,000.00 and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage, respondent Lipa Bank, through its lone witness, respondent Lipa Bank's Vice President, Johnson Melo (Melo), claimed that such transactions were entered into by petitioner Casiana as transactions separate from the Sales Contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> According to respondent Lipa Bank, petitioner Casiana issued the Promissory Note in the amount of P270,000.00, as secured by the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage, not in relation to the Sales Contract, but for the purchase of machineries, preventive maintenance of rice mill equipment, and for a motor vehicle repair shop, as indicated on the face of the Promissory Note. Also, respondent Lipa Bank alleged that petitioner Casiana received the net proceeds of her personal loan with respondent Lipa Bank, as evidenced by a Disbursement Voucher and Credit Ticket.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>The Ruling of the RTC</b> </p><p> After the trial, the RTC issued its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated September 9, 2011, the dispositive portion of which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered: </p> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">Declaring the Sales Contract entered into by plaintiff Redentor Catapang with defendant bank as valid and effective;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Declaring the Promissory Note and Real Estate Mortgage signed by plaintiff Casiana Catapang null and void and ineffective;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Ordering the defendant to release and surrender TCT No. T-52886 in favor of plaintiff Casiana Catapang;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Ordering defendant to pay plaintiff Casiana Catapang the amount of P30,000.00 as and by way of moral damages and the amount of P20,000.00 as and by way of attorney's fees. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The RTC held that the Sales Contract entered into by petitioner Redentor and respondent Lipa Bank is valid and effective, and thus denied petitioner Redentor's prayer for the refund of the P200,000.00 downpayment paid to respondent Lipa Bank.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> As to the Promissory Note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage, the RTC held them to be null and void for having been procured with fraud.

The CA likewise held that the documents presented by respondent Lipa Bank, <i>i.e., </i>Disbursement Voucher and Credit Ticket dated June 30, 1999, was sufficient proof that petitioner Casiana actually received the proceeds of the loan with respondent Lipa Bank.

The evidence revealed that when respondent Lipa Bank's representative asked petitioner Casiana to sign the aforesaid documents, he openly misrepresented the very substance, tenor, and purpose of these documents, taking advantage of petitioner Casiana's lack of education and failure to understand English.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> This establishes the failure to agree as to the subject matter of the aforesaid documents rendering the Promissory Note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage null and void. </p><p> Respondent Lipa Bank contends that petitioner Casiana freely, willfully, and knowingly borrowed P270,000.00 from respondent Lipa Bank, as evidenced by the Promissory Note dated June 30, 1999, which she signed on the same day.

She is a plain housewife<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and never engaged in the operation or management of a rice mill.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p> In fine, the Court finds that respondent Lipa Bank was not able to controvert the positive testimonies of petitioners Redentor and Casiana's witnesses, which clearly substantiate the fact that petitioner Casiana, being only a Grade 6 graduate, did not understand English and was unable to read and comprehend the tenor of the Promissory Note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage which she signed — documents which were opposite to her understanding of why she lent to petitioner Redentor her owner's duplicate copy of the subject property. </p><p> As important, the very fact that respondent Lipa Bank took the posture that the Promissory Note and the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage were proof that it was petitioner Casiana herself who had borrowed money for a business that did not exist tells the Court that it unduly took advantage of petitioner Casiana's poor education. </p><p> This finding is not diminished whatsoever by the testimony of respondent Lipa Bank's Vice President Melo, whose testimony never refuted the testimony of Alayon. Moreover, Melo's testimony was purely <i>hearsay</i>. </p><p> On direct examination, Melo admitted that during the time of the subject transaction, he was not yet Vice President of respondent Lipa Bank and that he was the head of Human Resource Management.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Melo also admitted that he was not fully aware as to petitioner Casiana's transactions with respondent Lipa Bank because "during that time I was not yet on that transaction, sir"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and that "I cannot give you an information because I was not yet there when the loan was granted."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p> In this regard, the Court finds it highly erroneous that the CA took cognizance of two documents presented by Melo in his Judicial Affidavit,<i> i.e</i>., the Disbursement Voucher and Credit Ticket dated June 30, 1999, in reaching the conclusion that petitioner Casiana received the proceeds of the loan. As these were signed together with the Promissory Note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage on June 30, 1999, then they were, as already explained, likewise signed by petitioner Casiana without any understanding and comprehension of their tenor. </p><p> Moreover, as readily admitted by Melo under oath, he had no participation and personal knowledge whatsoever as to the execution of these documents. He was not a signatory to the documents. He did not witness their execution. Nor did he testify that he is familiar with the signatures contained therein as he was not privy to the transaction. Under Section 20, Rule 132 of the Revised Rules on Evidence, before a private document is admitted in evidence, it must be authenticated either by the person who executed it, the person before whom its execution was acknowledged, any person who was present and saw it executed, or who after its execution, saw it and recognized the signatures, or the person to whom the parties to the instruments had previously confessed execution thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Therefore, with the Disbursement Voucher and Credit Ticket not having been authenticated by a competent witness, the documents are inadmissible. Hence, there is no evidence on record that proves that petitioner Casiana received any loan proceeds from respondent Lipa Bank. </p><p> Interestingly, while respondent Lipa Bank vigorously asserts that the loan transaction of petitioner Casiana is legitimate and that such transaction had nothing to do with petitioner Redentor and his family's quest to repurchase the Sps. Catapang's former property, in the same breath, it expressed in its pleadings that it was "Alejandro Catapang, through his son plaintiff Redentor Catapang, who had all the motivations to induce and influence his own sister plaintiff Casiana Catapang to again extend accommodation to him by allowing her interest in the subject property to be used as collateral security."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> This is an admission on the part of respondent Lipa Bank that petitioner Casiana was<i> induced and influenced</i> in executing the Promissory Note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage.</p><p> All in all, respondent Lipa Bank's assertion that the loan obligation entered into by petitioner Casiana is above-board and that the latter received the proceeds of the loan has <i><u>no basis in evidence</u></i>. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Under Article 1332 of the Civil Code, respondent Lipa Bank has the burden of proving that the terms of the loan documents were fully explained to petitioner Casiana.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Article 1332 of the Civil Code states that when a contract is in a language not understood by one of the parties, and mistake or fraud is alleged, the person enforcing the contract has the burden of proving that the terms of the contract were fully explained to the contracting party: </p><blockquote> <p>ART. 1332. When one of the parties is unable to read, or if the contract is in a language not understood by him, and mistake or fraud is alleged, the person enforcing the contract must show that the terms thereof have been fully explained to the former. </p> </blockquote> <p> Article 1332 was intended for the protection of a party to a contract who is at a disadvantage due to his illiteracy, ignorance, mental weakness or other handicap. This article contemplates a situation wherein a contract has been entered into, but the consent of one of the parties is vitiated by mistake or fraud committed by the other contracting party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> As explained by recognized Civil Law Commentator, former CA Justice Eduardo P. Caguioa, Article 1332, which is a new provision taken from American law, is justified by the Code Commission by the fact that in this country, there is a fairly large number of illiterates and documents are usually drawn up in English or Spanish. The above article shifts the burden of proof from the party alleging the mistake to the party enforcing the contract. It also alters the rule that a party is presumed to know the meaning of a document which he signed. Hence, if one of the parties is unable to read or if the contract is in a language not understood by him, and he alleges fraud or mistake, the burden of proving that the terms of the contract have been fully explained to the former is shifted to the person enforcing the contract. If this burden is not satisfied, the presumption of mistake or fraud stands unrebutted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></p><p> In <i>Lim v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> a Deed of Confirmation of Extrajudicial Partition, which was written in English, was entered into by an elderly woman who does not understand English. The Court found that since it was proven that the said woman was unable to understand English, the burden was on the other contracting party to prove that the content of the said Deed was explained to the elderly woman. Because such burden was not met, the Deed was annulled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></p><p> Applying the foregoing to the instant case, the Court concurs with the factual finding of the RTC that petitioner Casiana is not capable of understanding English and that she did not understand the words in the Promissory Note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage as they were in the English language. The Court finds the RTC's factual finding supported by the evidence on record.</p><p> As testified by petitioner Casiana on direct examination, her highest educational attainment was Grade 6<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> and that she does not understand English.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> On cross-examination, petitioner Casiana reiterated that she cannot comprehend the English language.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Petitioner Casiana's testimony on her failure to understand English and low educational attainment is corroborated by Rosalinda Catapang, who testified that petitioner Casiana is only an elementary graduate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> </p><p> In fact, during Casiana's cross-examination, the RTC itself observed the witness and unequivocally stated on record that "<u>[s]he does not know English, whether she is college graduate or not, she does not know english</u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> </p><p> It must be stressed that, as a general rule, the evaluation of testimonial evidence and the condition of the witnesses by the trial courts is accorded great respect precisely because it is in the best position to observe first-hand the demeanor of the witnesses, a matter which is important in determining whether what has been testified to may be taken to be the truth or falsehood.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> </p><p> In disregarding the RTC's factual finding, the CA reasoned that because petitioner Casiana had previously mortgaged her rights and interests over the subject property in favor of her brother, Alejandro Catapang, it shows that petitioner Casiana was able to comprehend the subject loan documents. The CA's argument is bereft of logic. The fact that petitioner Casiana was able to previously mortgage the subject property does not support in any way the CA's belief that she understands the English language or that she understood "<i>garantiya</i>" correctly. It is a <i>non sequitur</i> argument. </p><p> In believing that petitioner Casiana understood English and was able to comprehend the tenor of the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage, the CA relied heavily on the notarization of the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage. Upon careful examination of the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage, however, it is clear that it was irregularly notarized. </p><p> It is not disputed that the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage, which was dated and supposedly notarized on August 6, 1999, was actually signed and executed by petitioner Casiana on June 30, 1999 at her residence. Alayon, respondent Lipa Bank's own employee, unequivocally testified that he went alone to the residence of petitioner Casiana on June 30, 1999. Aside from petitioner Casiana's husband, there were no other persons present. There were no witnesses to the signing of the documents, contrary to what is stated in the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p><p> As admitted by Alayon during trial, when petitioner Casiana signed the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage, there was no notary public who witnessed the same: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">By the way, did you have any companion when you went to the house of Casiana Catapang?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">None, sir. </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td><div align="justify">Did you have with you a Notary Public when you went to the house of Casiana Catapang?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">None, sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>Therefore, contrary to what was stated in the jurat of the notarization portion of the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage, petitioner Casiana did not appear in person before the notary public, did not sign the document in the presence of the notary public, and did not take an oath or affirmation before the notary public. Further, as seen in the jurat of the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage itself, there was no competent evidence of petitioner Casiana's identity that was provided and indicated on the document. It is clear to the Court that the said document was first signed by petitioner Casiana on June 30, 1999 and was belatedly notarized by the notary public without the affiant's presence on August 6, 1999. Hence, contrary to the assertion of the CA, the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage does not enjoy any presumption of regularity. Indisputably, the notarization of the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage was a sham. </p> <p> In plain terms, since it was established that the Promissory Note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage were in a language not understood by petitioner Casiana, in accordance with Article 1332 of the Civil Code, the burden shifted to respondent Lipa Bank to prove that it was able to fully explain the terms of the documents to petitioner Casiana, and that the loan documents were not executed by mistake or through fraud. </p><p> The evidence on record shows that respondent Lipa Bank was not able to satisfy this burden. As established by the testimony of respondent Lipa Bank's own representative, Alayon, the terms of the Promissory Note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage were not explained whatsoever to petitioner Casiana. Worse, respondent Lipa Bank misrepresented to petitioner Casiana that she was signing documents that merely provided for a "<i>garantiya</i>" of petitioner Redentor's loan. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Epilogue: The Fiduciary Duty of Banking Institutions.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>In sum, the Court nullifies the Promissory Note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage for lacking the essential requisite of consent. Hence, the reinstatement of the RTC's Decision dated September 9, 2011 is warranted. Aside from restoring the RTC's award of moral damages and attorney's fees, the Court likewise awards <i>exemplary damages</i> in favor of petitioner Casiana. </p><p> The banking industry is one impressed with great public interest as it affects economies and plays a significant role in businesses and commerce. Hence, "[t]he public reposes its faith and confidence upon banks, such that 'even the humble wage-earner has not hesitated to entrust his life's savings to the bank of his choice, knowing that they will be safe in its custody and will even earn some interest for him.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> This is the reason why the fiduciary nature of the banks' functions is well-entrenched in jurisprudence. </p><p> "The law allows the grant of exemplary damages by way of example for the public good. The public relies on the banks' sworn profession of diligence and meticulousness in giving irreproachable service. The level of meticulousness must be maintained at all times by the banking sector."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> </p><p> In the instant case, respondent Lipa Bank took advantage of the faith and trust bestowed upon it as a banking institution and acted without the level of professionalism, meticulousness, good faith, trustworthiness, and fidelity to the public expected from every banking institution.
