				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Court resolves the Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Resolutions dated June 23, 2014<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and October 22, 2015<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R SP No.134435.<p> </p><center> <i>The Antecedents</i><p> </p></center> On October 14, 1996, Spouses Agerico and Carmelita Abrogar (petitioners) obtained a loan amounting to P11,250,000.00 from respondent Land Bank of the Philippines (Land Bank). The loan was secured by a real estate and chattel mortgage<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> executed by petitioners in Land Bank's favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><p> Petitioners, however, eventually defaulted in the payment of their loan. This prompted Land Bank to commence extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings on the mortgaged properties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> To stop the foreclosure proceedings, petitioners filed a Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> against Land Bank before Branch 51, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Puerto Princesa City for specific performance and damages with application for a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order. Petitioners prayed, among others, that the RTC order Land Bank to allow them to settle their obligation pursuant to the Letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated October 5, 1998 which contained the bank's proposed terms and conditions for the restructuring of their loan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p> </p><center> <i>Ruling of the RTC</i><p> </p></center> In its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> dated April 1, 2011, the RTC dismissed the Complaint for lack of a cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It explained that:<p> </p><blockquote> [Petitioners'] lawful obligation is to settle its delinquent account with [Land Bank] in order that the latter may perform its mandate of extending financial assistance to those who are qualified.<p> x x x [Petitioners] ought to bear in mind that restructuring their loan is not part of their original contract. It is merely a privilege accorded to them by [Land Bank]. They cannot invoke that as a demandable right When [Land Bank] refused to adopt their own interpretation, they should have taken that as being equivalent to a denial of their request for restructuring. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p></blockquote><p> The RTC likewise denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> in its Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated November 25, 2013. Petitioners thereafter elevated the case <i>via</i> a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA.</p><p> </p><center> <i>Ruling of the CA</i><p> </p></center> In its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated June 23, 2014, the CA dismissed the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> for: (a) being the wrong mode of appeal;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and (b) lack of an affidavit of service, pursuant to Section 13, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><p> The CA stressed that the proper recourse for petitioners was to file an ordinary appeal under Section 2(a), Rule 41 and <i>not</i> to resort to the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Moreover, the CA noted that even if the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> was treated as an ordinary appeal, it would still be dismissed for having been filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period provided under Rule 41.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p> Petitioners moved for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> but the CA denied the motion in its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated October 22, 2015. Consequently, petitioners filed the present Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> before the Court assailing the CA Resolutions.</p><p> </p><center> <i>The Issue</i><p> </p></center> The sole issue for the Court's resolution is whether the CA correctly dismissed the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> outright for being the wrong mode of appeal.<p> </p><center> <i>The Court's Ruling</i><p> </p></center> The petition is without merit.<p> It is settled that a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> may only be resorted to in cases where there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> "The extraordinary remedy of<i> certiorari</i> is not a substitute for a lost appeal; it is not allowed when a party to a case fails to appeal a judgment to the proper forum, especially if one's own negligence or error in one's choice of remedy occasioned such loss or lapse."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> As the remedies of appeal and <i>certiorari</i> are <i>mutually exclusive, certiorari </i>will <i>not</i> prosper if appeal is an available remedy to a litigant, even if the ground is grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p> In this case, the proper recourse for petitioners was to appeal the Decision dated April 1, 2011, which was rendered by the RTC in the exercise of its original jurisdiction, under Section 2(a)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of Rule 41 and <i>not </i>to resort to <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. Since the remedy of an ordinary appeal was undeniably available to petitioners, the CA correctly dismissed their Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> for being the wrong mode of appeal.</p><p> In an attempt to justify their plea for the liberal application of the Rules, petitioners insist that they should not be bound by their former counsel's negligence in choosing to file the wrong remedy because it would deprive them of their property without due process of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p> This argument, however, is untenable. After all, "the negligence of the counsel binds the client, even mistakes in the application of procedural rules."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The only exception to this doctrine is ''when the reckless or gross negligence of the counsel deprives the client of due process of law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In such a case, the counsel's error must be so <i>palpable </i>and <i>maliciously exercised</i> that it would viably be the basis for disciplinary action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Thus, "for the exception to apply, the client must prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was maliciously deprived of information that he could not have acted to protect his interests."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p> Here, petitioners clearly failed to allege and prove that their former counsel was motivated by malice in choosing to file a<i> certiorari </i>petition instead of an ordinary appeal before the CA. For clarity and precision, the pertinent portion of their petition is quoted below:</p><p> </p><blockquote> The petitioners herein appear to be deprived of the benefits of the [P6,000,000.00] appraisal of their property by [Land Bank], arising from the gross negligence of their former counsel on record. The error of the former counsel on record in choosing [to file a] petition for [<i>certiorari</i>] under [R]ule 65 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, rather than ordinary appeal, must be considered gross negligence on the part of the counsel, and such gross negligence will cause the petitioners deprivation of property without due process of law. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </blockquote><p> Petitioners' mere allegation of gross negligence, <i>without</i> any showing of malicious intent on the part of their former counsel, does not suffice for the exception to apply.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> To be sure, "malice is never presumed but must be proved as a fact."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> This, petitioners evidently failed to do.</p><p> Based on these considerations, the Court finds no basis to relax the rules of procedure in this case. The Court notes that the RTC Decision dated April 1, 2011 has long attained finality, given petitioners' failure to interpose an appeal within the reglementary period provided under the Rules. Consequently, the Court can no longer exercise its appellate jurisdiction to review this Decision, even <i>if </i>it is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is <b>DENIED</b>.
