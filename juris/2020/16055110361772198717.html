				<H3>OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, COMPLAINANT, V. HON. MARILYN B. LAGURA-YAP, FORMER PRESIDING JUDGE, BRANCH 28, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MANDAUE CITY, CEBU (NOW ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE COURT OF APPEALS), RESPONDENT.<br><br>

D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an administrative complaint against Hon. Marilyn B. Lagura-Yap, Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals, in her capacity as then Presiding Judge, Branch 28, Regional Trial Court (<em>RTC</em>), Mandaue City, Cebu, for gross inefficiency and incompetence for failing to decide cases within the reglementary period to decide, and for dishonesty for her failure to indicate in her application for the position of Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals her caseload and/or cases submitted for decision, and to accurately and truthfully reflect the actual number of cases submitted for decision in the Monthly Report of Cases submitted to the Office of the Court Administrator (<i>OCA</i>). <p> To recapitulate, Hon. Lagura-Yap filed her application for the position of Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals on September 20, 2011 with the Judicial and Bar Council (<i>JBC</i>). Subsequently, on February 24, 2012, Hon. Lagura-Yap was appointed as Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals. She then requested for the issuance of a Certificate of Clearance. On July 30, 2012, Atty. Tranne Lee Digao-Ferrer, Branch Clerk of Court, Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu, issued a Certification which enumerated the one hundred thirty-four (134) pending cases submitted for decision during her stint as presiding judge of Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p><p>Thus, in its Memorandum Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated October 17, 2012, the OCA averred that Hon. Lagura-Yap neither requested for additional time to decide the subject cases nor did she give a valid reason regarding the non-resolution of the said pending cases. Consequently, the OCA withheld the processing of Hon. Lagura-Yap's application for clearance. </p><p>The OCA likewise stated that in the nomination letter dated November 28, 2011 issued to Hon. Lagura-Yap, she was reminded of A.M. No. 04-5-19-SC which requires that before she could take her oath of office and assume her new responsibilities, she should submit a certification manifesting that she had decided or disposed of the cases assigned to her in her previous position. However, Hon. Lagura-Yap still failed to submit the required certification, and just took her oath of office and assumed her new responsibilities without resolving all the cases submitted for decision in Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p><p> Thus, considering Hon. Lagura-Yap's administrative liability arising from her failure to decide pending cases submitted for resolution prior to her promotion, the OCA recommended to the Court that (a) the matter be re-docketed as a regular administrative matter against Hon. Lagura-Yap, former Presiding Judge, Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu; (b) she be imposed a fine in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) for gross inefficiency for her failure to decide one hundred twenty-eight (128) cases submitted for decision within the reglementary period prior to her promotion; and (c) she be admonished to be more circumspect in the performance of her sworn duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p><p> On November 26, 2012, in a Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the Court, upon the recommendation of the OCA, resolved to re-docket this matter as a regular administrative matter against Hon. Lagura-Yap.</p><p> Subsequently, in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated March 13, 2013, the Court directed the OCA to: </p><blockquote> <p> 1) Investigate further whether or not the respondent, in her application to the position of Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals filed before the Judicial and Bar Council, failed to indicate her case load and/or cases submitted for decision that were pending before her court at the time of her application. </p> <p> 2) Investigate further if respondent filed a true and accurate monthly report to the OCA with respect to the status of pending cases and cases submitted for decision before her court prior to and at the time of her application to the position of Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals. </p> <p> 3) Make a report on such findings, together with its recommendation, within ten (10) days from receipt of this Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, in compliance with the Court's Resolution, the OCA organized a team to conduct a judicial audit and physical inventory of pending cases, including cases submitted for decision and cases with unresolved/pending motions, in Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu. </p> <p> Thereafter, based on the team's audit report, it was discovered that there were one hundred thirty-three (133) criminal cases and thirty-five (35) civil cases submitted for decision in Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu, before Hon. Lagura-Yap's promotion. There were one (1) criminal case with an unresolved motion filed on January 22, 2010 and five (5) civil cases with pending motions, the earliest of which was filed on September 6, 2011. Many of those cases were later decided/resolved by then Acting Presiding Judges Raphael B. Yrastorza and Sylva G. Aguirre-Paderanga. </p><p> The complete list of cases submitted for decision and incidents submitted for resolution before Hon. Lagura-Yap while she was yet the Presiding Judge of Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu, is as follows: </p><blockquote> <p align="center">CRIMINAL CASES <br> SUBMITTED FOR DECISION </p> <table width="100%" border="1"> <tbody><tr> <td width="18%"><div align="center">CASE NO. </div></td> <td width="18%"><div align="center">ACCUSED</div></td> <td width="18%"><div align="center">NATURE</div></td> <td width="46%"><div align="center">LATEST COURT ACTION </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="center">DU - 8168 </div></td> <td><div align="center">Duran</div></td> <td><div align="center">Rape</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> <table width="98%" border="0" align="center"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"> Order dated Jan. 12, 2005 (Judge Yap), the exhibits formally offered by Pros.

In particular, there were one hundred forty (140) cases submitted for decision that were beyond the reglementary period to decide even prior to the filing of her application before the JBC on September 20, 2011, but which she failed to disclose in her application submitted to the JBC.</p> <p> Thus, upon the recommendation of the OCA, in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated February 13,2019, the Court resolved to (1) TREAT the instant memorandum as an administrative complaint against Hon. Lagura-Yap, Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals, in her capacity as then Presiding Judge, Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu; (2) FURNISH Hon. Lagura-Yap with a copy of the OCA Memorandum dated July 2, 2018; and (3) DIRECT her to file her COMMENT thereon within twenty (20) days from notice, explaining why she should not be administratively held liable for gross inefficiency and incompetence for failing to decide one hundred sixty (160) cases within the reglementary period to decide, and for dishonesty for her failure to indicate in her application for the position of Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals her caseload and/or cases submitted for decision, and for failing to accurately and truthfully reflect the actual number of cases submitted for decision in the Monthly Report of Cases submitted to the OCA.</p> <p> In her Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated June 20, 2019, Hon. Lagura-Yap alleged that the ninety (90)-day period to decide cannot be reckoned with in some cases because there was no memorandum filed and/or that there was no order issued submitting the case for decision. She further asserted that if there were such orders, the ninety (90)-day period could not have expired during her time because she had transferred to the Court of Appeals on February 24, 2012. She claimed that if the Court will consider her justifications, the reported one hundred sixty (160) cases can be reduced to only one hundred eighteen (118) cases.</p> <p> She further alleged that Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu, is not a special drugs court. Hon. Lagura-Yap implores the indulgence of the Court not to consider the period of fifteen (15) days to decide drug cases, as mandated by Section 90 of Republic Act No. 9165, against her. She alleged that Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu, where she presided then, was not a special drugs court. It was a regular court which also became a special court to hear, try and decide cases involving the (1) killings of political activists and a member of the media; (2) election contests of elective municipal officials; and (3) environmental cases. </p> <p> Hon. Lagura-Yap also seeks the indulgence of the Court in that she gave preference in deciding the shabu laboratory drugs cases assigned to her and left the others pending as she moved to the Court of Appeals. She claimed that the high-profile drugs cases spanned a period of seven (7) years, from 2005 to 2012. However, on February 1, 2012, in DU-12549 and DU-12780, she promulgated a Joint Judgment convicting the accused. She also claimed that she prioritized two environmental cases, MDE-182 and MAN-646, due to the urgent nature of the applications for environmental protection orders and/or injunctive reliefs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p> <p> She further alleged that on top of her numerous responsibilities, she was also the Executive Judge of the RTC, Mandaue City, from February 28, 2007 to February 24, 2012. She also averred that in May 2010, Atty. Grace V. Fernandez, who was the branch clerk of court of Branch 28, transferred to Branch 18, and it was only in July 2011 that another branch clerk of court was appointed to the position. For these reasons, Hon. Lagura-Yap claimed that the number of cases in her previous court that were not decided on time rose significantly from 2010 to 2011 when there was no branch clerk of court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p> <p> Hon. Lagura-Yap seeks the kind understanding of the Court as during her stint as presiding judge of Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu, she also lost her husband and her mother on August 9, 2008 and September 26, 2010, respectively. She lamented that as she was grieving over their loss, her docket continued to rise and it eventually took a toll on her ability to dispose cases on time.</p> <p> As to her alleged failure to file the true and accurate reports of the status of pending cases and cases submitted for decision prior to and at the time of her application for the position of Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals, Hon. Lagura-Yap explained that when she applied for the position of Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals, Atty. Ma. Theresa B. Magturo, JBC Chief of Office, Office of Recruitment, Selection and Nomination, wrote her a letter on July 19, 2007 and August 14, 2007, requiring her to submit certain documents, among which was a verified statement of her caseload and average monthly output of actions during the preceding two (2)-year period. As proof of compliance, she gave a certification dated August 28, 2007. However, she was not considered for the position.</p> <p> Three years later, when she applied for the second time on September 22, 2010, Atty. Capacite required her to submit the following documents only, to wit:</p> <ol><li> IBP Certificate of Good Standing </li><li> Sworn Medical Certificate with findings or impressions on the results of the medical examination </li><li>Transcript of School Records </li><li>Certification of Admission to the Bar with Bar rating</li><li> Income Tax Return</li><li> Clearances from NBI, Ombudsman, Office of the Bar Confidant </li><li> Police Clearance </li><li>Sworn Statement that applicant was not a candidate for any elective office in the immediately preceding election</li><li> Two sample decisions<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></li></ol> <p> Hon. Lagura-Yap was under the impression that the tenor of the September 22, 2010 letter was to the effect that the JBC no longer required her to submit another certification of her current caseload, thus, in good faith, she did not anymore execute another certification of her current caseload. She claimed that she believed in good faith that the only requirements needed were only the ones stated in Atty. Capacite's letter.</p> <p> Hon. Lagura-Yap emphasized that while it is true that she submitted a certification dated August 28, 2007 in her application in 2006, she denied that she used the same certification in her application on September 20, 2011. She reiterated that it was Atty. Capacite who wrote her on September 22, 2010, requiring her to submit certain documents and it did not include the certification of current caseload. Thus, in compliance, she submitted only the required documents as stated in Atty. Capacite's letter, and without the certification of caseload. Hon. Lagura-Yap lamented that it was unfair to insinuate that she used the same 2007 Certification of Caseload to support her 2011 application or that she omitted to submit it.</p> <p> She further bewailed the fact that the audit team used the August 2011 and January 2012 Monthly Report of Cases as bases to prove that she did not file the true and accurate reports with respect to the status of pending cases and cases submitted for decision, prior to and at the time of her application as Associate Justice. She asserted that the monthly reports in August 2011 and January 2012 relate to two specific months that do not constitute as bases to reckon the average monthly output of actions during the two (2)-year period that preceded the 2011 application.</p> <p> As to her failure to comply with A.M. No. 04-5-19-SC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Hon. Lagura-Yap resented that she failed to comply with the requirement of Section 8. She, however, asserted that it was by mere inadvertence as she really thought that she had already complied with all her requirements since she was not notified anymore to submit another certification of her caseload prior to her transfer. She claimed that she eventually became busy as she transitioned to her new job and station that she failed to recall to submit another certification. </p> <p> Finally, Hon. Lagura-Yap admitted that (1) she was not able to decide one hundred eighteen (118) cases in Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu, within the ninety (90)-day period when she took her oath as Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals on February 24, 2012; (2) she failed to comply with Section 8 of A.M. No. 04-5-19-SC regarding the submission of another certification that she had disposed all cases assigned to her in Branch 28, upon her promotion to the Court of Appeals; (3) she had no certification of the status of pending cases and cases submitted for decision at the time of her application in September 2011 as she was not required by the JBC; but (4) she had filed a verified statement of her caseload and average output of actions during the preceding two (2)-year period when she first applied as Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals in 2006. She, thus, implored the Court's exercise of its benevolence and prayed that the recommended amount of fine be reduced after consideration of her justifications.</p> <blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>RULING</b></p> </blockquote> <p> After a perusal of the record, the Court concurs with the findings and recommendations of the OCA.</p> <p> The Constitution expressly provides that all lower courts should decide or resolve cases or matters within three (3) months from the date of submission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Section 5, Canon 6 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> likewise provides:</p> <blockquote> <p> Sec. 5. Judges shall perform all judicial duties, including the delivery of reserved decisions, efficiently, fairly and with reasonable promptness. </p> </blockquote> <p> Accordingly, this Court has laid down certain guidelines to ensure compliance with this mandate. More particularly, Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 13-87<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> provides: </p> <blockquote> <p> 3. Judges shall observe scrupulously the periods prescribed by Article VIII, Section 15, of the Constitution for the adjudication and resolution of all cases or matters submitted in their courts.</p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, all cases or matters must be decided or resolved within twelve (12) months from date of submission by all lower collegiate courts while all other lower courts are given a period of three (3) months to do so. </p> <p> Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 1-88<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> further states: </p> <blockquote> <p> 6.1 All Presiding Judges must endeavor to act promptly on all motions and interlocutory matters pending before their courts. </p> </blockquote> <p> Given the foregoing rules, the Court cannot overstress its policy on prompt disposition or resolution of cases. Delay in the disposition of cases is a major culprit in the erosion of public faith and confidence in the judicial system, as judges have the sworn duty to administer justice without undue delay. Thus, judges have been constantly reminded to strictly adhere to the rule on the speedy disposition of cases and observe the periods prescribed by the Constitution for deciding cases, which is three (3) months from the filing of the last pleading, brief or memorandum for lower courts. To further impress upon judges such mandate, the Court has issued guidelines (Administrative Circular No. 3-99 dated January 15, 1999) that would ensure the speedy disposition of cases and has therein reminded judges to scrupulously observe the periods prescribed in the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p> <p> In the present case and by her admissions alone, Hon. Lagura-Yap's guilt is undisputed. She admitted her (1) failure to decide one hundred eighteen (118) pending cases within the ninety (90)-day period; (2) failure to comply with Section 8 of A.M. No. 04-5-19-SC regarding the submission of a certification that she had disposed all cases assigned to her in Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu, upon her promotion to the Court of Appeals; and (3) failure to submit a certification of the status of pending cases and cases submitted for decision at the time of her application in September 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p> <p> We have considered the justifications and explanations proffered by Hon. Lagura-Yap — heavy caseload, voluminous records, death of family members, and being understaffed — which, while may be recognized as true and reasonable, are not sufficient to exonerate her from liability. To be sure, the mandatory nature of the period to decide cases provided under the Constitution cannot be considered as beyond the limits of acceptability or fairness. </p> <p> We are also aware of the heavy caseload of trial courts, as well as the different circumstances or situations that judges may encounter during trial, such as those averred by Hon. Lagura-Yap. Thus, the Court has allowed reasonable extensions of time needed to decide cases, but such extensions must first be requested from the Court. Whenever a judge cannot decide a case promptly, all he has to do is to ask the Court for a reasonable extension of time to resolve it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Unfortunately for Hon. Lagura-Yap, she did not avail of such remedy. A judge cannot by herself choose to prolong the period for deciding cases beyond that authorized by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p> <p> In <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Lopez, et al</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> the Court reminded "judges to decide cases with dispatch" and "that the failure of a judge to decide a case within the required period is not excusable and constitutes gross inefficiency, and non-observance of this rule is a ground for administrative sanction against the defaulting judge." </p> <p> Furthermore, we likewise cannot countenance Hon. Lagura-Yap's failure to submit before the JBC the certification stating the status of pending cases and cases submitted for decision at the time of her application in September 2011 as former Presiding Judge of Branch 28, RTC, Mandaue City, Cebu. </p> <p> However, we cannot simply impute upon Hon. Lagura-Yap that she was dishonest by the mere fact that she has failed to submit the certification. Other than her failure to submit the certification, there was no evidence at all that would show that she intentionally did not submit the certification in order to give herself an advantage and secure the promotion. While, we do not tolerate the acts of Hon. Lagura-Yap in failing to disclose in her application her caseload which could be material and relevant in assessing her eligibility for promotion, we, however, find it harsh to punish Hon. Lagura-Yap severely for her erroneous judgment. Suffice it to say that while her defense of good faith may be difficult to prove as clearly it is a question of intention, a state of mind, erroneous judgment on the part of Hon. Lagura-Yap does not, however, necessarily connote the existence of bad faith or malice, or an intention to defraud. Be that as it may, we must emphasize that while an erroneous judgment does not equate to bad faith or dishonesty, Hon. Lagura-Yap should likewise know that prudence demands that she should disclose such information no matter how irrelevant it may appear to her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p> <p> It must be likewise pointed out that we do not find anything on record to show that the JBC-ORSN reminded Hon. Lagura-Yap of her lacking certification during her application and before her promotion. It was only after Hon. Lagura-Yap requested for clearance that this issue of non-submission of certification cropped up. The JBC-ORSN is the one tasked to determine the completeness of the applicant's documentary requirements. Thus, as a matter of procedure, they should have made the proper inquiry and verification with regard to the lacking requirements of Hon. Lagura-Yap, moreso, since said informations are easily verifiable considering that the latter is actually an official of the Court. </p> <p> Indeed, in administrative proceedings, only substantial evidence is required to warrant disciplinary sanctions. We define substantial evidence<i> as relevant evidence as a <b>reasonable mind </b>might accept as adequate to support a conclusion</i>. Thus, after much consideration of the facts and circumstances, while the Court has not shied away in imposing the strictest penalty to erring employees, neither can we think and rule unreasonably in determining whether an employee deserves disciplinary sanction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></p> <p align="center"> <b>PENALTY</b></p> <p> The administration of justice demands that those who don judicial robes be able to comply fully and faithfully with the task set before them. As frontline officials of the judiciary, judges should, at all times, act with efficiency and with probity. They are duty-bound not only to be faithful to the law, but likewise to maintain professional competence. The pursuit of excellence must be their guiding principle. This is the least that judges can do to sustain the trust and confidence which the public reposed on them and the institution they represent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p> <p> Thus, in <i>Office of the Court Administrator v.

All cases and incidents had been submitted for decision or resolution, and the reglementary period to decide or resolve the cases or incidents had already lapsed on the date of his retirement.</p> <p> In <i>OCA v.
