The prosecution alleged that at around 11:20 in the morning of March 18, 2010, a team of operatives from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), led by Intelligence Officer (IO) 1 Myrian Aceron Balbada (IO1 Balbada), successfully conducted a buy-bust operation against accused-appellant at his residence in Barangay Limaha, Butuan City, during which one (1) plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance was recovered from his possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The PDEA officers also arrested Jessica and Jefferson, who purportedly conspired with accused-appellant in committing the alleged crime.

Since there is no indication that the said courts overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case, the Court finds no reason to deviate from their factual findings. <br><br>Further, the Court observes that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drug had been properly preserved since the PDEA team sufficiently complied with the chain of custody rule under Section 21, Article II of RA 9165. <br><br>In cases for Illegal Sale and/or Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640, it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the <i>corpus delicti </i>of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]&nbsp; </sup>Failing to prove the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti </i>renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and hence, warrants an acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <br><br>To establish the identity of the dangerous drugs with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law · requires, <i>inter alia, </i>that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The law further requires that the said inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: <i>(a) </i>if <b>prior</b> to the amendment of RA 9165 by RA 10640,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> a representative from the media <i> <u>AND</u> </i>the DOJ, and any elected public official; <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> or <i> (b) </i> if <b>after</b> the amendment 9165 by RA 10640, an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <i> <u>OR</u></i> the media.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The law requires the presence of these witnesses primarily "to ensure the establishment of the chain of custody and remove any suspicion of switching, planting, or contamination of evidence. "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <br><br>In this case, records<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> show that after accused-appellant was arrested, IO1 Balbada immediately took custody of the seized drug and personally conducted the requisite marking, inventory,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and photography right at the place of arrest in the presence of accused-appellant himself,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> as well as an elected public official, <i>i.e., </i>Brgy. Captain Abucejo, media representatives, <i> i.e., </i>Licup and Brangan, and a DOJ representative, <i>i.e., </i>Bedrijo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Subsequently, the illegal drug was delivered by IO1 Balbada to the crime laborator y<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> for examination,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and later brought to court for safekeeping,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> where it was duly presented, identified; and admitted as evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Accordingly, the chain of custody over the seized drug remained unbroken, and the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti </i>had been properly preserved; hence, accused-appellant's conviction must stand. <br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.

Resurreccion, </i>618 Phil. 520, 532 [2009].) Hence, the failure to immediately mark the confiscated items at the place of arrest neither renders them inadmissible in evidence nor impairs the integrity of the seized drugs, as the conduct of marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team is sufficient compliance with the rules on chain of custody. (See <i>People v. Tumulak, </i>791 Phil. 148, 160-161 [2016]; and <i>People v.
