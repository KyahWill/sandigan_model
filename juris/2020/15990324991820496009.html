				<H3>RE: ANONYMOUS COMPLAINT AGAINST JUDGE LAARNI N. DAJAO, PRESIDING JUDGE, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 27, SIOCON, ZAMBOANGA DEL NORTE<BR><BR>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DELOS SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><center><b>The Case</b></center><br><br>This administrative matter pertains to the vulgar and unbecoming conduct of Judge Laarni N. Dajao (Judge Dajao), Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 27, Siocon, Zamboanga del Norte, constituting violations of Sections 1 and 2, Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br><br>In an anonymous letter-complaint dated 15 January 2014, an unknown person accused Judge Dajao of (1) manifesting a pattern of unprofessional conduct in terms of language and deed, as observed from a number of his hearings; (2) detailing his name and position in documents as Dr. Laarni N. Dajao, Ph.D (CL-HC); and (3) making malicious and degrading statements in his Order dated 27 November 2013 in Criminal Case Nos. 2013-08-05 (1049), 2013-08-06 (1050) and 2013-08-07 (1051) for illegal possession of firearms and ammunitions, entitled <i>"People of the Philippines v. Julman Asim."</i><br><br>The letter-complaint expressed that in the Order dated 27 November 2013, Judge Dajao used words which were malicious, degrading, and disgraceful to the image of the court and the legal profession. In the said Order, the anonymous observer posited that Judge Dajao mentioned "big dick/penis, homophobic <i>baklita</i>, idiot, <i>ugok</i>, psychopath" and imputed a "sexual relationship with a man who is the accused in his sala, etc." The letter-complaint also cited that Judge Dajao placed "Dr." and "Ph.D." beside his name, a questionable act since judges are enjoined to foster humility in their profession. Thus, the complaint prayed that Judge Dajao be reprimanded and disciplined for unprofessional conduct.<br><br>In his Comment dated 6 May 2014, Judge Dajao stated that the sole purpose of the complaint was to malign him. He declared that the criminal cases which were the subject of his 27 November 2013 Order were all dismissed without prejudice. As such, Judge Dajao expressed that he could not answer the complaint. Also, Judge Dajao mentioned that he already accepted the apology of the PDEA Regional Director in behalf of the PDEA operatives included in the said Order. Thus, Judge Dajao prayed that the complaint not be acted upon.<br><br><center><b>The Office of the Court Administrator's<br>Report and Recommendation</b></center><br><br>In its Report dated 26 January 2016, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) found Judge Dajao to be administratively liable for vulgar and unbecoming conduct. The OCA stated that the 27 November 2013 Order of Judge Dajao granted the Omnibus Motion to Quash submitted by the defense. In the same Order, Judge Dajao asserted that a defendant should not be harassed with various prosecutions based upon the same act by splitting the same into various charges, all emanating from the same law violated, when the prosecution could easily embody them in a single information. The OCA observed that Judge Dajao used intemperate language in the said Order and frowned upon Judge Dajao's act of adding "Dr." and "Ph.D." to his name giving the impression that he is egotistical and wants to be recognized by litigants as having excelled in other fields.<br><br>The OCA made this recommendation:<br><br><blockquote>(1) the instant administrative complaint be RE-DOCKETED as a regular administrative matter against Judge Laarni N. Dajao. Presiding Judge, Branch 27, Regional Trial Court, Siocon, Zamboanga del Norte; and<br><br>(2) respondent Judge Dajao be found LIABLE for vulgar and unbecoming conduct and be FINED in the amount of Five Thousand Pesos (Php 5,000.00), with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of a similar offense shall be dealt with more severely.</blockquote><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br><br>We adopt the findings and recommendation of the OCA.<br><br>In the Order dated 27 November 2013, which is the subject matter of this administrative case, issued by Judge Dajao pertaining to three criminal cases for illegal possession of firearms and ammunitions, the pertinent portions provide:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREAS:<br><br>1.

LAARNI N. DAJA O Ph.D (CL-HC)</b><br>Presiding Judge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div></blockquote><blockquote>(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Sections 1 and 2 of Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> which covers propriety state:<br><br><blockquote>Propriety and the appearance of propriety are essential to the performance of all the activities of a judge.<br><br>SECTION 1. Judges shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of their activities.<br><br>SECTION 2. As a subject of constant public scrutiny, judges must accept personal restrictions that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen and should do so freely and willingly. In particular, judges shall conduct themselves in a way that is consistent with the dignity of the judicial office.</blockquote><br><br>Moreover, a judge should possess the virtue of <i>gravitas</i>. He should be learned in the law, dignified in demeanor, refined in speech and virtuous in character. Besides having the requisite learning in the law, he must exhibit that hallmark judicial temperament of utmost sobriety and self-restraint. In this connection, he should be considerate, courteous and civil to all persons who come to his court. A judge who is inconsiderate, discourteous or uncivil to lawyers, litigants or witnesses who appear in his sala commits an impropriety.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In the present case, insulting and insensitive language used by Judge Dajao in the Order he issued such as "idiot", "psychopath", "big dick (penis)", "sadistic", and "homophobic baklita" is a language not befitting a judge. It must be emphasized that judges are enjoined to always be temperate, patient and courteous both in conduct and language. Here, Judge Dajao's unguarded written words, as well as insinuations of a sexual relationship between the parties involved in the case he was hearing, fell short of the standards expected of a magistrate of the law and constituted vulgar and unbecoming conduct that eroded public confidence in the judiciary.<br><br>In <i>Spouses Jacinto v. Judge Vallarta</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> we held that from the standpoint of conduct and demeanor expected of members of the bench, a resort to intemperate language only detracts from the respect due them and becomes self-destructive. The judicial office circumscribes the personal conduct of a magistrate and imposes a number of restrictions. This is a price that judges have to pay for accepting and occupying their exalted positions in the administration of justice. Irresponsible or improper conduct on their part erodes public confidence in the judiciary. Thus, it is their duty to avoid any impression of impropriety in order to protect the image and integrity of the judiciary.<br><br>Also, we agree with the OCA in declaring that "the act of Judge Dajao in adding "Dr." and "Ph.D" to his name in the subject order gives the impression that he is egotistical, and wants to be recognized by the litigants that other than being a magistrate, the inclusion of a title in the order, other than his official designation as a judge, was unwarranted."<br><br>Canon 2, Rule 2.02 of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides that "a judge should not seek publicity for personal vainglory." Used in its ordinary meaning, vainglory refers to an individual's excessive or ostentatious pride, especially in one's achievements. Canon 1 on Integrity and Canon 2 on Propriety of the Code of Judicial Conduct proscribes judges from engaging in self-promotion and indulging their vanity and pride.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Here, the inclusion of the titles "Dr." and "Ph.D" by Judge Dajao in the questioned Order is a clear example of self-promotion and vanity and disseminates unnecessary publicity. In <i>Office of the Court of Administrator v. Floro, Jr.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> we held that judges are held to a higher standard and must act within the confines of the code they observe. Judges should not use the courtroom as platform for announcing their qualifications especially to an audience of lawyers and litigants who very well might interpret such publicity as a sign of insecurity. Verily, the public looks upon judges as the bastion of justice — confident, competent and true. And to discover that this is not so, as the judge appears so unsure of his capabilities that he has to court the litigants and their lawyers' approval, definitely erodes public confidence in the judiciary.<br><br>Further, it should be borne in mind that it is the express mandate of the Canons of Judicial Ethics that "justice should not be bounded by the individual idiosyncrasies of those who administer it. A judge should adopt the usual and expected method of doing justice, and not seek to be extreme or peculiar in his judgment, or spectacular or sensational in the conduct of his court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Section 10 (1), Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court classifies vulgar and unbecoming conduct as a light charge, for which a fine<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of not less than One Thousand Pesos (1,000.00) but not exceeding Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) may be imposed. We adopt the recommendation of the OCA that Judge Dajao be fined in the amount of Five Thousand Pesos (5,000.00), with a severe warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future shall be dealt with more severely.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> we find respondent Judge Laarni N. Dajao, Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 27, Siocon, Zamboanga del Norte, <b>GUILTY</b> of <b>VULGAR and UNBECOMING CONDUCT</b> and impose on him a <b>FINE </b>in the amount of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00), with a severe warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future shall be dealt with more severely.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Perlas-Bernabe, (Chairperson), A.
