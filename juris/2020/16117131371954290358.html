Both buildings are located in Legaspi Village, which at that time was already a bustling business and commercial area with numerous establishments and busy streets. Rada and V.A. Rufino streets lie parallel to each other, with Rodriguez Street, a two-lane road approximately 12 meters wide situated in between. Feliza Building is located at the back of Frabella I Condominium, such that the exhaust of the blowers from the air-conditioning units at Feliza Building faces the direction of the rear of Frabella I Condominium.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p><p>From the first to ninth floor of Feliza Building, there are air-conditioning units served by 36 blowers, with four blowers for each floor located outside the building's windows facing Frabella I Condominium.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Only a portion of the rear side of Feliza Building faces Frabella I Condominium, while the remaining portion of Feliza Building faces the Thailand Embassy, a building adjacent to Frabella I Condominium.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p>Petitioner contends that respondent's blowers generate excessive noise and irritating hot air blown towards the direction of Frabella I Condominium. The noise and hot air are claimed to be a nuisance to petitioner and the tenants of Frabella I Condominium.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p>According to petitioner, it had complained to respondent about the blowers in at least three letters dated April 11, 1995, June 6, 1995 and August 14, 2000, all of which were ignored.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> It had also attempted to settle its complaint with respondent through other actions filed prior to the civil case. On March 10, 2001, petitioner filed a complaint with the Pollution Adjudication Board (<em>PAB</em>) for the abatement of noise and/or pollution and damages, with a plea of injunctive relief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In a letter dated March 7, 2002, petitioner filed a complaint with then Makati City Mayor Jejomar C.

Thus, petitioner sought the assistance of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (<em>MMDA</em>) and Makati Commercial Estate Association (<em>MACEA</em>). The MMDA and MACEA conducted an ocular inspection and found that the noise is on the intolerable level and exceeds the allowable standard level of 65 decibels per Section 78 (b) of Presidential Decree No. 984.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p>A series of noise pollution tests conducted by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (<em>DENR</em>) in late 1995 up to early 1996 and in 2000 likewise bore the same result.

Tenant-witness Ma. Cristina A. Lee (<em>Lee</em>) who was occupying Unit 9-D facing Rodriguez Street testified that when she moved in Frabella I Condominium on June 2003, she noticed the loud noise and hot air going toward the direction of her unit, and upon checking, she noted it was coming from the blowers of the air-conditioning units of Feliza Building. Eventually, she never opened her balcony door and kept her air-conditioning units operating most of the time. She complained to the administration of the noise and hot air, but continued to occupy her unit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p><p>Jaime Matias (<em>Matias</em>), General Manager of MACEA, testified that MACEA is an association of property owners within the Makati Central District. Sometime in 1995, MACEA received a letter-complaint from petitioner in connection with the noise coming from the blowers of the air-conditioning units of Feliza Building. In response, MACEA wrote a letter to respondent advising it to adopt remedial measures, which it failed to do. MACEA then sought the assistance of the DENR and Makati City Engineering Office. This resulted in the conduct of noise level measurements and the issuance of a Cease and Desist Order by the Makati City Government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></p><p>Sometime in 2001, MACEA conducted its own monitoring of the noise and MACEA imposed a daily fine on respondent, which the latter protested. The testing in 2001 was done using MACEA's own equipment (rayon noise level meter) with the supervision of MACEA's Assistant Manager who was assisted by security guards.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p>Sometime in 2005, MACEA hired the services of the Technical Experts on Environmental Management which also conducted noise level tests and found that the noise level exceeded the allowable level of 65 decibels.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p><p>Francisco Cabeltis, Jr., Sanitary Inspector of Makati City Health Department testified that acting on a letter-request of petitioner, he and Romualdo Panopio conducted an ocular inspection on March 2, 2002 and found that there is still an intolerable noise emitted by the air-conditioning units of Feliza Building. In conducting the test, no special equipment was used other than the physical senses of their eyes and ears.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p><p>Lemelie Pascua (<em>Pascua</em>) testified that she was then an Environmental Management Specialist of the DENR and that she conducted an investigation on August 29, 2000 and September 27, 2000. On cross-examination, Pascua stated that the sound readings identified different sources of noise coming from the Thailand Embassy Building and some passing cars. She further noted that even when the blowers of Feliza Building were not in operation, the noise level already exceeded the permissible limits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p><em><strong>Evidence presented by respondent</strong></em></p><p>Raulito Dumangon, who was authorized to represent respondent, testified that when Feliza Building was constructed in 1989, the vicinity was already a commercial area. At the time of Feliza Building's operation in 1990 up to 1995 when Frabella I Condominium was constructed, its air-conditioning units were not changed or altered, yet respondent never received complaints regarding the operation of its blowers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p>He also testified that respondent voluntarily made modifications and rectifications to improve the condition of the air-conditioning units of Feliza Building. In 2000, respondent engaged the services of MBA Urethane Products Contractor to install soundproofing materials (<em>i.e.,</em> two inches of thick layer of polyurethane) on all the air-conditioning units in all the floors of the Feliza Building. In February 2006, respondent hired Polar Wind Airconditioning and Refrigeration, Inc., which replaced the blowers and air-condensers of the air-conditioning units at the sixth to tenth floors of the Feliza Building, and installed on its roof deck five units of condenser fans. Respondent also installed re-routing ducts to divert and re-route the air away from Frabella I Condominium and towards V.A. Rufino Street.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Respondent commenced the operation of the newly-installed air-condensers at the roof deck of the Feliza Building on June 28, 2006. The Office of the Building Official of Makati issued a Certificate of Operation that allowed respondent to operate its air-conditioning units.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p>Engineer Albert Lusterio (<em>Engr. Lusterio</em>), a Sanitary Engineer of the Makati City Health Department, testified that the Makati Health Office conducted a sound reading measurement and based on the results of the test, issued a closure order, to which respondent objected based on some technicality on the measurement. The City Health Officer then decided to avail the services of an independent sound expert, IAA Technologies, to conduct the measurement and reading of the noise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p><p>The testing was done on November 22, 2008 at 1:00 a.m. After the said test, it was determined that the sound produced by the blowers is within the standard during the daytime. The Makati City Government then lifted the Closure Order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p><p>Dar Quintos (<em>Quintos</em>), owner of IAA Technologies and expert in audio and acoustics, was deputized by the Makati City Health Department to conduct the noise pollution tests on the air-conditioning system.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Quintos testified that he was the one who conducted the noise pollution test on that early morning of November 22, 2008, and rendered a report on his findings that the noise measured 63.4 decibels. Prior to that, on November 13, 2010, he also conducted a noise pollution test with a result that the noise measured 61.3 decibels, which he stated to be even below the noise levels specified in Makati Municipal Ordinance No. 93-181.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> He furnished his report to the Makati City Health Department, which then issued to respondent a permit to operate the air-conditioning units of Feliza Building.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p><p>The record also shows that the RTC issued an Order dated January 14, 2008, directing the Makati City Health Officer or her duly authorized representative to conduct a noise pollution test in the portion of Rodriguez Street located between Feliza Building and Frabella I Condominium on January 18, 2008. Hence, the Environment Health and Sanitation Division of the Makati Health Department carried out the noise pollution test in Rodriguez Street and inside Frabella I Condominium, and thereafter prepared and submitted the inspection report.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p>The RTC summoned Sanitation Inspector Felipe Albayda, Jr. (<em>Albayda</em>) from the Makati Health Department, who conducted the test.

It held:</p><blockquote><p>In the instant case, there is preponderant evidence consisting of the testimonies of its witness, to convince the Court that the thirty six (36) blowers in defendant's Feliza Building generate noise and blow hot air in the direction of plaintiff's Frabella I Condominium which annoys and offends the plaintiff and its tenants, the noise being monophonic and intense, and the hot air constantly blown towards its building, thus being of such character as to produce actual physical discomfort and annoyance to any person of ordinary sensibilities, rendering adjacent property less comfortable and valuable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The RTC permanently enjoined respondent from turning on and/or operating all the 36 blowers of the air-cooled condensers, and awarded petitioner temperate damages based on the loss of earnings by 25% to 30% on its revenue from rental of its units, exemplary damages and attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p><p>Respondent moved for reconsideration of the RTC's Decision and for the inhibition of the presiding judge. Both motions having been denied by the RTC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> respondent filed an appeal before the CA.</p><p align="center"><strong>Ruling of the CA</strong></p><p>On appeal, respondent averred that the RTC erred in relying on the testimony of a single tenant of Frabella I Condominium, tenant-witness Lee, and on the obsolete sound tests conducted sometime in 1995 and 2005. Respondent also argued that the RTC disregarded its recent evidence showing that the noise levels of the blowers are already within reasonable levels based on the readings and sound tests conducted thereon, and that the Makati City government has been continuously allowing respondent to conduct its business and operate its air-conditioning system in Feliza Building, as shown by various permits and certificates of authority to operate air-conditioning units. Further, respondent questioned the RTC's award of temperate and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></p><p>Petitioner, on the other hand, argued that the evidence it presented was not obsolete, and it was able to prove the merit of its case by a preponderance of evidence as shown by the results of the testing done on January 18, 2008, which it asserts to have greater probative value than the testing conducted on November 22, 2008. Moreover, the RTC did not base its decision on the testimony of a single tenant considering the numerous letter-complaints of other tenants that were offered in evidence, and that witness Lee testified on behalf of all tenants similarly situated. On the award of damages and attorney's fees, petitioner averred that such was proper in light of respondent's continuous failure to act upon its complaints.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p><p>In its Decision dated June 19, 2018, the CA granted respondent's appeal, and reversed and set aside the RTC's Decision dated November 28, 2014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p><p>The CA held that the standard used by the RTC, which is "whether it annoys or offends the senses of the plaintiff and its tenants in Frabella I Condominium" is not the accurate standard in determining the sufficiency of evidence of the existence of actionable nuisance entitling petitioner to relief and damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In reaching such conclusion, the CA relied on the case of <em>AC Enterprises, Inc. v. Frabelle Properties Corporation</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> which notably involved the same parties and factual antecedents, but had stemmed from a denial of respondent's motion to dismiss before the RTC:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><blockquote><p>Based on the foregoing, the mere existence of noise and hot air complained of by the plaintiff as offensive to sensibilities and causes discomfort and annoyance are not enough to prove that the noise and/or hot air is an actionable nuisance.</p><p>The Supreme Court laid down the correct tests or standards of actionable nuisance, to wit:</p><p>1) Whether rights of property, of health or of comfort are so injuriously affected by the noise in question that the sufferer is subjected to a loss which goes beyond the reasonable limit imposed upon him by the condition of living, or of holding property, in a particular locality in fact devoted to uses which involve the emission of noise although ordinary care is taken to confine it within reasonable bounds; or in the vicinity of property of another owner who, though creating a noise, is acting with reasonable regard for the rights of those affected by it;</p><p>2) In every case the question is one of reasonableness. What is a reasonable use of one's property and whether a particular use is an unreasonable invasion of another use and enjoyment of his property so as to constitute a nuisance cannot be determined by exact rules, but must necessarily depend upon the circumstances of each case, such as locality and the character of the surroundings, the nature, utility and social value of the use, the extent and nature of the harm involved, the nature, utility and social value of the use or enjoyment invaded, and the like; and</p><p>3) Annoyances and discomforts must not be more than those ordinarily to be expected in the community or district, and which are incident to the lawful conduct of such trades and businesses. If they exceed what might be reasonably expected and cause unnecessary harm, then the court will grant relief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p></blockquote><p>In applying the above standard, the CA found that petitioner failed to discharge its burden of proving nuisance. It emphasized that the testimony of only one tenant-witness Lee, was not sufficient evidence on the extent and nature of the discomfort caused to the tenants of Frabella I Condominium. It was not shown by petitioner that the perception, sensibility and lifestyle of Lee represented the normal and ordinary level of sensitivity and habits of living of the other tenants who had supposedly been offended also by the noise and hot air from Feliza Building. The CA also took cognizance of the fact that notwithstanding the discomforts raised, Lee continued to occupy her unit and did not vacate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p><p>The CA also considered that the sound test reports from 1995 to 2008. It observed that based on the latest findings and reports of the Environmental Management Bureau and the Makati City government, the noise level in the area surrounding the Feliza Building and Frabella I Condominium is already within normal allowance limits for a commercial area. Consequently, the Makati City government issued to respondent the licenses and permits for the operation of new air-conditioning and machinery units, as well as operation of its business.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p><p>Finding an absence of preponderance of evidence of the existence of actionable nuisance and for lack of sufficient evidence of the petitioner's claim of loss of business rental income, the CA found that the RTC committed reversible error in ordering the closure of respondent's 36 blowers and in awarding temperate and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></p><p>Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> which was denied in the CA Resolution dated February 18, 2019.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></p><p>Thus, petitioner filed this petition for review on <em>certiorari</em>, raising the following arguments:</p><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FAULTING PETITIONER FOR PRESENTING ONLY ONE (1) OF THE TENANTS COMPLAINING OF THE NUISANCE.</li><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT PETITIONER FAILED TO PROVE AND TO ESTABLISH THE REQUIRED DEGREE OF EVIDENCE.</li><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN GIVING WEIGHT TO THE PERMITS AND LICENSES ISSUED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF MAKATI CITY TO FELIZA BUILDING.</li><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS ALSO ERRED IN REVERSING THE AWARD GRANTED BY THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT TO PETITIONER FOR TEMPERATE, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><p>In its Comment, respondent argues that the CA correctly ruled that the petitioner failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that the noise emanating from the air-conditioning units of Feliza Building constitutes a nuisance, and that petitioner is not entitled to the payment of temperate and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></p><p align="center"><strong>The Issues</strong></p><p align="center">I.

People of the Philippines</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> the Court held:</p><blockquote><p>A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, its resolution must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants, but must rely solely on what the law provides on the given set of facts. If the facts are disputed or if the issues require an examination of the evidence, the question posed is one of fact. The test, therefore, is not the appellation given to a question by the party raising it, but whether the appellate court can resolve the issue without examining or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is a question of fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Citations omitted)</p></blockquote><p>A question of fact requires this court to review the truthfulness or falsity of the allegations of the parties. This review includes assessment of the probative value of the evidence presented.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></p><p>In this case, petitioner in seeking a determination if the CA erred in its appreciation of the evidence presented, asks this Court to assess the probative value of the evidence presented and therefore raises a question of fact.</p><p>However, these rules admit of exceptions, which were listed in <em>Osmundo Medina v.

The Court will proceed to resolve the present petition.</p><p><em><strong>Burden of proof in nuisance claims</strong></em></p><p>In this case, petitioner, as plaintiff, has the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that the noise from the blowers of Feliza Building is an actionable nuisance. After due consideration of the factual findings of the trial court, we rule that petitioner failed to discharge its burden.</p><p>Under Section 1, Rule 131 of the Revised Rules on Evidence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> the burden of proof is on the party establishing his or her claim, which in this civil case is the plaintiff, petitioner herein:</p><blockquote><p>Burden of proof is the duty of a party to present evidence on the facts in issue necessary to establish his or her claim or defense by the amount of evidence required by law.

First Issue: Actionable Nuisance</strong></p><p>Article 694 of the Civil Code defines nuisance:</p><blockquote><p>A nuisance is any act, omission, establishment, business, condition of property, or anything else which: (1) Injures or endangers the health or safety of others; or (2) Annoys or offends the senses; or (3) Shocks, defies or disregards decency or morality; or (4) Obstructs or interferes with the free passage of any public highway or street, or any body of water; or (5) Hinders or impairs the use of property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></p></blockquote><p>The Civil Code classifies nuisances as public or private. A private nuisance has been defined as one which violates only private rights and produces damages to but one or a few persons.

Indeed, whether or not the noise level of the blowers of Feliza Building comply with or exceed the noise level limits imposed by the NPCC or Makati City government is not controlling in a determination of nuisance. In <em>Velasco</em>, wherein we found the existence of nuisance, apart from the results of the noise pollution tests, it was also proven that the complainant's ailments were caused by his inability to sleep due to the incessant noise with consequent irritation coming from the transformers that were continuously operational day and night.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup></p><p>In the case at bar, several noise pollution tests were conducted and presented to the lower court as evidence. Of the noise pollution tests conducted, most indicated that the noise level of the blowers exceeded 65 decibels, while the recent one conducted on November 22, 2008 yielded a result of 61.3 decibels. The noise pollution tests have conflicting findings, but we consider the November 22, 2008 test to be most reliable.</p><p>Petitioner presented evidence on multiple noise pollution tests conducted, with results indicating that the noise level of the blowers exceeded 65 decibels, while respondent presented evidence of the noise pollution tests conducted on November 13, 2008 and November 22, 2008.</p><p>Petitioner presented evidence on multiple tests conducted over a long period of time from 1995 to January 2008.

First, the tests were conducted by an independent entity, IAA Technologies, which was deputized by the Makati City Health Department.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Second, IAA Technologies is a sound expert using equipment designed for noise pollution testing and not merely relying on physical senses. Third, the tests were conducted late in the evening to minimize the recording of external sounds that are present during the daytime, thus capturing with more accuracy the noise level of the blowers. Fourth, these were the most recent tests conducted and submitted to the trial court, and the results had not been subsequently negated. Fifth, aside from the submission of the reports, the personnel that conducted the tests presented his testimony on the conduct and results thereof, and was able to justify the reliability of the tests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup></p><p>The report on the November 13, 2008 and November 22, 2008 noise pollution test shows that the noise level of the blowers of Feliza Building is at 61.3 and 63.4 decibels, respectively,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> which is below the 65-decibel limit provided under Makati City Ordinance No. 93-181.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> We observe that technological advancements, heightened commercial activity, and over crowdedness in the Makati City Business District has increased through the years, while the 65-decibel limit has not been updated since 1980 and 1993 to reflect the evolving nature of the locality wherein more noise is expected with increased activity. Nevertheless, respondent still exerted reasonable efforts in maintaining an acceptable noise level that meets the limits provided under NPCC Memorandum Circular No. 002, Series of 1980 and Makati City Ordinance No. 93-181. While compliance with noise level limits is not tantamount to the absence of nuisance, we find that being within allowable limits supports respondent's position that there is no actionable nuisance in this case considering it was acting within the limitations of what the law itself views as permissible.</p><p><em><strong>Issuance of permits and licenses by the Makati City government</strong></em></p><p>Petitioner argues that the CA erred in giving weight to the permits and licenses issued by the Makati City government to respondent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> We agree with petitioner that the issuance of permits and licenses should not be given significant weight in the determination of nuisance.

More importantly, the Makati City government cannot through the exercise of granting permits and licenses determine nuisance in light of our pronouncement that local government units do not have power to declare a particular thing as a nuisance unless such is a nuisance <em>per se</em>. This matter is to be resolved by the courts in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Thus in <em>AC Enterprises</em>, we held:</p><blockquote><p><strong>A finding by the LGU that the noise quality standards under the law have not been complied with is not a prerequisite nor constitutes indispensable evidence to prove that the defendant is or is not liable for a nuisance and for damages</strong>. Such finding is merely corroborative to the testimonial and/or other evidence to be presented by the parties.

All it means is that a bar to the use imposed by planning law, in the public interest, has been removed. Logically, it might be argued, the grant of planning permission for a particular activity in 1985 or 2002 should have no more bearing on a claim that that activity causes a nuisance than the fact that the same activity could have occurred in the 19th century without any permission would have had on a nuisance claim in those days.</p><p>Quite apart from this, it seems wrong in principle that, through the grant of a planning permission, a planning authority should be able to deprive a property-owner of a right to object to what would otherwise be a nuisance, without providing her with compensation, when there is no provision in the planning legislation which suggests such a possibility. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Guided by the foregoing, we find the grant of permits and licenses by the Makati City government, while corroborative to the other evidence presented by the parties,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> to be of little weight in our determination of nuisance.</p><p><em><strong>Locality and character of surroundings</strong></em></p><p>This Court has found that the reasonable use of one's property is dependent as well on the locality and character of surroundings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Guided by foreign jurisprudence, we now consider the locality and character of surroundings of the properties involved.</p><p>In <em>Coventry</em>, the character of locality factor was determinative on the the court's assessment of nuisance. The court emphasized that the starting point in a nuisance claim is the "proposition that the defendant's activities are to be taken into account when assessing the character of the locality."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> The injurious effect of a defendant's activity would depend greatly on the circumstances of the locality where it actually occurs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup></p><p>Feliza Building and Frabella I Condominium are located in the bustling Legaspi Village at the heart of the Makati Central Business District.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> In any urban and commercial area, noise is expected from the business activities, passing vehicles, construction and development, and residents and commuters. Despite the efforts made to minimize the recording of external noise in the noise pollution tests conducted on Feliza Building, still some noise was recorded and contributed to the resulting reported noise levels.</p><p>The noise entering Frabella I Condominium is not only from the blowers of Feliza Building, but a combination of noise naturally expected from a very busy area where commercial activities are prevalent. While noise is expected given the locality and character of the surroundings, it must not be more than those ordinarily expected. Otherwise, it shall be considered a nuisance. We held in <em>AC Enterprises</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Persons who live or work in thickly populated business districts must necessarily endure the usual annoyances and of those trades and businesses which are properly located and carried on in the neighborhood where they live or work. <strong>But these annoyances and discomforts must not be more than those ordinarily to be expected in the community or district, and which are incident to the lawful conduct of such trades and businesses</strong>. If they exceed what might be reasonably expected and cause unnecessary harm, then the court will grant relief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> (Citation omitted and emphasis supplied)</p></blockquote><p>Hence, as we consider the locality and character of the Makati Central Business District in which the properties are situated, we must determine if the sounds from the blowers of Feliza Building are ordinarily to be expected in the district and lawful to the conduct of respondent's business or if they exceed what might be reasonably expected and cause unnecessary harm.</p><p>We find that the sounds from the blowers of Feliza Building are ordinarily to be expected in the Makati Central Business District and are lawful to the conduct of respondent's business. The use of air-conditioning units in commercial and office spaces, such as those in Feliza Building, is part of ordinary local business conditions and is expected in the commercial rental industry, especially considering that the Philippines is a tropical country with higher levels of heat intensity. Moreover, considering the limited available real estate in Makati Central Business District, buildings are closely located to each other; in this case, only 12 meters of road separate Frabella I Condominium and Feliza Building, thus sounds coming from buildings in the proximity are expected to be heard.</p><p>The sounds complained of do not exceed what might be reasonably expected and do not cause unnecessary harm. An illustration of unreasonable use of property can be found in <em>Rattigan v. Wile</em> wherein the United States (US) court found that the defendant's placement of items near the plaintiffs' property was intended to harass his neighbors, and although the said placement served a mixed purpose, defendant could have still accomplished his goals without undue hardship upon plaintiffs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> As compared to the defendant in <em>Rattigan</em>, the respondent in this case did not intentionally cause harm or undue hardship to petitioner, but acted within reasonable expectations and even made efforts to minimize any disturbance its blowers might have been causing.</p><p>In <em>Kasper v. H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc.</em>, the US court emphasized that the character of the locality is a circumstance of great importance in a determination of noise nuisance: "That a noise is disagreeable and disturbing to ordinary people is not enough. It must also be unreasonable under all the circumstances. The character of the locality is a circumstance of great importance."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> The court did not find nuisance holding that the plaintiff's property was located in an industrial area, which is subject to conditions other than defendant's business that tend to make the vicinity less desirable for residential purposes, and that the defendant conducted its business without any more noise than is reasonably necessary for its business, even building a high fence to reduce the noise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup></p><p>Applying the doctrine in <em>Kasper</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> we similarly find the absence of nuisance considering the character and locality of the surroundings of the properties involved. The noise level of the Makati Central Business District is expected to be higher than other areas considering the magnitude of activity therein. It has been established that in conducting its business leasing commercial and office spaces, respondent did not act to make the vicinity less desirable, nor did it cause any more noise than that which was reasonably necessary to operate its air-conditioning units.</p><p><em><strong>Injurious effect in the health or comfort of ordinary people</strong></em></p><p>Ultimately, the determining factor is that the noise is of such character as to produce <strong>actual physical discomfort and annoyance to a person of ordinary sensibilities</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup></p><p>In <em>Velasco</em>, we ruled that the noise from defendant's substation transformers was a nuisance, being of a much higher level than the ambient sound of the locality and having aggravated plaintiff's medical condition.

We do not agree with petitioner's assertion that tenant-witness Lee is presumed to be of ordinary sensibilities, as this is an evidentiary matter that cannot be presumed but must be proven by petitioner in support of its claim of nuisance.</p><p>Moreover, we find that petitioner failed to prove that the noise of respondent's blowers injuriously affects the health or comfort of ordinary people in the vicinity to an unreasonable extent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Apart from the sentiments of tenant-witness Lee, no other evidence was provided to show how the noise of respondent's blowers had adversely affected the community. The complaint of tenant-witness Lee that she had to keep her balcony door closed and air-conditioning units operational is not an unreasonable burden to an ordinary person though it might be peculiarly bothersome to one.</p><p>The sentiments and experiences of tenant-witness Lee cannot be presumed to be shared by the other tenants in the community so as to establish that ordinary persons living in that community would regard the noise to be a nuisance. If ordinary persons living in the community would not regard the sound to be a nuisance, there can be no actionable nuisance even if the idiosyncrasies of a particular member thereof, in this case tenant-witness Lee, may make the sound unendurable to her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup></p><p>In determining what is reasonably acceptable and what is invasive to a community, the court in <em>Rattigan</em> appreciated the evidence that being a residential community, there was implicit intolerance of the activities of defendant. Moreover, the plaintiff presented expert testimony that showed how one who might otherwise have rented Edgewater to decline to do so because of defendant's activities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> In the case at bar, no such evidence was presented to show how respondent's activities affected the rental opportunities and value of Frabella I Condominium. It is also worth noting that petitioner's sole tenant-witness Lee continued to reside in and did not vacate Frabella I Condominium despite the alleged discomfort caused to her by the noise and hot air.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> Neither did petitioner present any evidence of loss of rental opportunities and value due to respondent's operation of blowers, other than observations from its own personnel. In fact, petitioner's Vice President, witness Albutra, testified that she observed the noise from the blowers as early as when the Frabella I Condominium was being constructed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> Despite such observations of noise, petitioner successfully sold and rented out units, thus negating petitioner's assertion of the detrimental effects of respondent's blowers on the rental opportunities and value of Frabella I Condominium.</p><p>We are further guided by <em>Stevens v. Rockport Granite Company</em>, wherein the US Court emphasized that the number of people concerned by the noise should be considered in reaching a conclusion as to the standard, which is what ordinary people, acting reasonably, have a right to demand in the way of health and comfort under all circumstances:</p><blockquote><p>It is not enough that a person of peculiar temperament, unusual sensibilities or weakened physical condition, may be affected. Nor is a noise protected if persons of exceptional strength and robustness, or whose faculties have become benumbed by close business or other experience with it, are not disturbed. <strong>The pertinent inquiry is whether the noise materially interferes with the physical comfort of existence, not according to exceptionally refined, uncommon, or luxurious habits of living, but according to the' simple tastes and unaffected notions generally prevailing among plain people. <u>The standard is what ordinary people, acting reasonably, have a right to demand</u> in the way of health and comfort under all the circumstances.

On the basis of the testimony of tenant-witness Lee alone, it is difficult to accept that her peculiar temperament is reflective of that of ordinary people. We find petitioner's evidence to be lacking not because it had presented only one tenant-witness to testify on the effects of the noise, but because its evidence as a whole failed to establish how the noise from the blowers is harmful to the health or comfort of ordinary people.</p><p><em><strong>Other harms raised</strong></em></p><p>Petitioner claims that the noise and hot air from respondent's blowers had caused some tenants to vacate Frabella I Condominium and decreased the rental value by 25% to 30%.</p><p>In <em>Rattigan</em>, the court ruled there was a nuisance and that damages were ascertainable because it found the residential community intolerant of defendant's activities. Its finding was supported by expert opinion that one who might have otherwise rented in the locality would probably decline to do so because of defendant's activities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup></p><p>In this case, other than its bare assertions, petitioner failed to adduce any reliable evidence in support of its claim of lost rental opportunities and decrease in income.

We are guided by the US Court's pronouncement in <em>Tortorella v. H.

It relied on the testimony of its witness Albayda, a sanitation inspector, who had testified that based on his experience and training, the daily continuous intense noise produced by the blowers of Feliza Building may result in unhealthy consequences to people.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> However, other than witness Albayda's observations as a sanitation inspector, no medical evidence or expert testimony was presented to prove the existence of the harm allegedly caused by the noise of the blowers.</p><p>Another claim we address is petitioner's allegation that the baby of a certain Mr. and Mrs. Taku Himeno (<em>Mr. and Mrs. Himeno</em>), one of the tenants of Frabella I Condominium, suffered a seizure due to the sounds coming from Feliza Building, as testified by witness Albayda.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> Albayda is a sanitation inspector with no medical knowledge or expertise to be a reliable witness in proving the connection between the sound and the baby's seizure. Moreover, he himself did not witness to seizure, but is presenting hearsay on what might have happened to the baby of Mr. and Mrs. Himeno. The fact that Mr. and Mrs. Himeno did not testify or file any complaint against respondent after this alleged incident casts doubt on whether respondent's operation of its blowers really caused such harm.</p><p>In <em>Velasco</em>, this Court found that the noise caused by defendant's transformers resulted in an actual harm to plaintiff's medical condition because of the medical evidence and expert testimony presented to prove the connection between the incessant noise caused by defendant and the deteriorating health condition of plaintiff. Clearly, this is not the case here as no medical evidence or expert testimony was presented. Neither was there any evidence presented from those with direct knowledge on the alleged harms caused by the noise of the blowers.</p><p>Further, in <em>Tortorella</em>, the court did not find nuisance even if it recognized that the noise was annoying and disturbing to the tenant of plaintiff, tending to cause irritability and headaches and affecting sleep, and had affected rental value to some extent. The court ruled that there was no nuisance because no one on the subject premises had suffered materially from the noise in comfort or health, and the operation of the factory did not unreasonably interfere with the comfort, health or property of the plaintiff.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> In the absence of proof of material suffering in comfort or health, we are constrained to rule that there is no actionable nuisance.</p><p>Therefore, in light of the foregoing discussion and after a careful consideration of the facts and applicable law, We rule in favor of respondent and affirm the findings of the CA that there was no actionable nuisance caused by respondent's operation of its blowers.</p><p>Thus, in the absence of proof of material suffering in comfort or health, we do not find the sound of the blowers to be a nuisance.</p><p><strong>II.

Wrong without damage, or damage without wrong, does not constitute a cause of action, since damages are merely part of the remedy allowed for the injury caused by a breach or wrong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Even assuming petitioner suffered some loss, as it had failed to prove nuisance, there is no injury caused by respondent to petitioner to entitle the latter to an award of damages. In situations of <em>damnum absque injuria</em> or damage without injury, wherein the loss or harm was not the result of a violation of legal duty, there is no basis for an award of damages. There must first be a breach of duty and imposition of liability before damages may be awarded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> At most, we can consider this to be a case of <em>damnum absque injuria</em>, for which petitioner is not entitled to an award of damages.</p><p>In <em>Tortorella</em>, the court did not award damages to the petitioner that had similarly claimed loss of rental value because there was no nuisance found in the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> In the case at bar, there being no actionable nuisance, respondent was not in breach of duty but in the lawful exercise of its ownership rights, and therefore, there is no basis to sustain an award of damages in favor of petitioner.</p><p>Petitioner is not entitled to the temperate and exemplary damages and attorney's fees it claims.</p><p>Temperate damages are only awarded by virtue of the wrongful act of a party<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> when the court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot, from the nature of the case, be provided with certainty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> Exemplary damages are awarded when the act of the offender is attended by bad faith or done in wanton, fraudulent, or malevolent manner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> As discussed, petitioner failed to prove nuisance, thus there is no wrongful act to serve as basis for an award of temperate or exemplary damages in its favor.</p><p>As regards attorney's fees, we similarly find petitioner not entitled because the instant case does not fall under any of the grounds set forth in Article 2208 of the Civil Code.</p><p>In view of the foregoing, we find no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the CA.</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is <strong>DENIED</strong>.
