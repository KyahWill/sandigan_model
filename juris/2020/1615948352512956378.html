He was referred to the surgical emergency ward of AZ Klina hospital. The physicians suggested the removal of the tumor, which was postponed due to the imminent departure of the vessel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> On February 2, 2009, a team of doctors in Belguim removed Alcid's tumor. He likewise underwent a CT scan which showed a clear bone defect of the skull. Imaging suggested a primary tumor or a metastasis of a remote tumor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Further examinations showed multiple lung metastases, and swelling on his leg, which was suspected to be the primary tumor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p> After a combined examination of the biopsies on the forehead tumor and the mass in the leg, Alcid was diagnosed to be suffering from alveolar soft part sarcoma.

Dr. Alegre expounded that soft tissue alveolar sarcoma is "a highly vascular tumor that is muscular in origin.

In her Medical Certificate, Dr. Peneyra confirmed that Alcid was suffering from alveolar soft part sarcoma with brain, lung and bone metastases. She related medical studies revealing that exposure to chemicals such as ethylene oxide have lead to a possible risk of developing malignant tumors in the breast, pancreas, stomach and hematolymphoid organs,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and that for Alcid, "there is limited evidence in humans for the carcinogenecity of ethylene oxide."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p>Likewise, on September 17, 2009, Alcid consulted with Internist and Cardiologist Dr. Efren R.

However, respondents rejected his claims. </p><p> On June 15, 2009, Alcid initiated a grievance before the AMOSUP pursuant to the terms of the CBA. However, the parties failed to reach an amicable settlement during the mandatory conferences.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> Subsequently, Alcid filed a Notice to Arbitrate before the NCMB.

His work was strenuous and he had to contend with the harsh environment at the sea.

He was unable to work for more than 120 days and his disability went beyond 240 days.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Accordingly, the NCMB awarded permanent disability benefits under the CBA,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and sickness allowance equivalent to US$2,252.00 (120 days or four months of Alcid's basic monthly salary of US$563.00).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The NCMB further ordered the reimbursement of P255,733.87, which represents the additional medical expenses Alcid incurred.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p> Finally, the NCMB awarded attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the total monetary award considering that Alcid was compelled to hire the services of counsel to protect his rights and interests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> The dispositive portion of the NCMB ruling reads: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, a decision is hereby rendered, <b>ORDERING</b> herein respondents Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc., and/or Worldwide Crew, In., to jointly and solidarily pay complainant Alcid C.

During his employment, he was exposed to carcinogens such as benzene, hydrocarbons, chemicals, crude oil, gasoline, lubricants and other harmful cleaning solutions. He likewise suffered from extreme weather conditions involving intense heat and freezing cold. His long period of exposure, which spanned over five terms, contributed to the development or aggravation of his illness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, petitioners claim that the CA erred in giving more credence to the findings of the company-designated physician, who is not an expert in the field of cancer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> On the other hand, Alcid's chosen physician, Dr. Peneyra, is an oncologist.

Likewise, said obligation lasts until the company-designated physician has assessed the level of disability or has confirmed the absence of a work-relation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Hence, their duty to provide medical treatment ceased as soon as the illness was declared to have no causal connection with the nature of his job.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Moreover, under the CBA, the respondents' obligation for medical care and treatment lasts for 130 days after initial hospitalization.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS</b></p> <p> x x x x</p> <p>B. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS </p> <p> The liabilities of the employer when the seafarer suffers work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract are as follows: </p> <p> 1. The employer shall continue to pay the seafarer his wages during the time he is on board the vessel; </p> <p> 2. If the injury or illness requires medical and/or dental treatment in a foreign port, the employer shall be liable for the full cost of such medical, serious dental, surgical and hospital treatment as well as board and lodging until the seafarer is declared fit to work or to be repatriated. <b>However, if after repatriation, the seafarer still requires medical attention arising from said injury or illness, he shall be so provided at cost to the employer until such time he is declared fit or the degree of his disability has been established by the company-designated physician. </b></p> <p> 3. Upon sign-off from the vessel for medical treatment, the seafarer is entitled to <b>sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage until he is declared fit to work or the degree of permanent disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician but in no case shall this period exceed one hundred twenty (120) days.</b> </p> <p> For this purpose, the seafarer shall submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three working days upon his return except when he is physically incapacitated to do so, in which case, a written notice to the agency within the same period is deemed as compliance. Failure of the seafarer to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result in his forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits.</p> <p> If a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment, a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the employer and the seafarer. The third doctor's decision shall be final and binding on both parties. </p> <p> <b>4. Those illnesses not listed in Section 32 of this Contract are disputably presumed as work related. </b></p> <p> 5. Upon sign-off of the seafarer from the vessel for medical treatment, the employer shall bear the full cost of repatriation in the event the seafarer is declared (1) fit for repatriation; or (2) fit to work but the employer is unable to find employment for the seafarer on board his former vessel or another vessel of the employer despite earnest efforts. </p> <p> <b>6. In case of permanent total or partial disability of the seafarer caused by either injury or illness the seafarer shall be compensated in accordance with the schedule of benefits enumerated in Section 32 of his Contract. </b>Computation of his benefits arising from an illness or disease shall be governed by the rates and the rules of compensation applicable at the time the illness or disease was contracted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Based on the foregoing, should the seafarer suffer a work-related illness during his employment, the employer shall be liable to provide medical attention and treatment, grant a sickness allowance equivalent to the seafarer's basic wage, and award a disability benefit in case of permanent total or partial disability. The grant of these benefits is premised on the seafarer's compliance with the requisites provided under the POEA-SEC, coupled with proof that the illness is in fact work­ related. </p><p> Notably, the POEA-SEC defines a work-related illness as "any sickness resulting to disability or death as a result of an occupational disease listed under Section 32-A of this Contract with the conditions set therein satisfied."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Relatedly, Section 20(B)(4) fills in the lacuna, adding that any illness which is not listed in Section 32 is disputably presumed to be work-related.

In doing so, reasonable proof or a probability that his work caused, or at least increased the risk of contracting his illness shall suffice: </p><blockquote> <p> For illnesses not mentioned under Section 32, the POEA-SEC creates a disputable presumption in favor of the seafarer that these illnesses are work­ related. However, notwithstanding the presumption, We have held that on due process grounds, the claimant-seafarer must still prove by substantial evidence that his work conditions caused or, at least, increased the risk of contracting the disease. This is because awards of compensation cannot rest entirely on bare assertions and presumptions. In order to establish compensability of a non­ occupational disease, reasonable proof of work-connection is sufficient - direct causal relation is not required. Thus, probability, not the ultimate degree of certainty, is the test of proof in compensation proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> A similar ruling was rendered in <i>Heirs of the Late Manalo N Licuanan, represented by his wife Virginia S.

OSG Shipmanagement Manila, Inc., et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> a case that is similar to the one at hand, this Court awarded disability benefits in favor of the seafarer who proved that his functions as a third officer aggravated his sarcoma: </p><blockquote> <p> David showed that part of his duties as a Third Officer of the crude tanker M/T Raphael involved 'overseeing the loading, stowage, securing and unloading of cargoes.' As a necessary corollary, David was frequently exposed to the crude oil that M/T Raphael was carrying. The chemical components of crude oil include, among others, sulphur, vanadium and arsenic compounds. Hydrogen sulphide and carbon monoxide may also be encountered, while benzene is a naturally occurring chemical in crude oil. I<b>t has been regarded that these hazardous chemicals can possibly contribute to the formation of cancerous masses.</b> </p> <p> In this case, David was diagnosed with MFH (now known as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma [UPS]), which is a class of soft-tissue sarcoma or an illness that account for approximately 1% of the known malignant tumors. As stated by Dr. Peña of the MMC, who was consulted by the company-designated physician, the etiology of soft tissue sarcomas are multifactorial. However, some factors are associated with a higher risk. These factors include exposure to chemical carcinogens like some of the chemical components of crude oil. <b>Clearly, David has provided more than a reasonable nexus between the nature of his job and the disease that manifested itself on the sixth month of his last contract with respondents. It is not necessary that the nature of the employment be the sole and only reason for the illness suffered by the seafarer. It is sufficient that there is a reasonable linkage between the disease suffered by the employee and his work to lead a rational mind to conclude that his work may have contributed to the establishment or, at the very least, aggravation of any pre-existing condition he might have had. </b></p> <p> This reasonable connection has not been convincingly refuted by respondents. On the contrary, respondents do not deny the functions performed by David on board M/T Raphael or the cargo transported by the tanker in which he was assigned. At best, respondents have cited contrary researches suggesting that the chemicals in crude oil do not induce the kind of disease contracted by David—a soft tissue sarcoma, which can supposedly occur to anybody regardless of the nature of their employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> It is all too apparent therefore, that although the POEA-SEC provides a disputable presumption of work-relatedness, the seafarer must still establish a reasonable nexus between his employment and illness. At the very least, he must prove through substantial evidence that there exists a probability that his working conditions caused or aggravated his illness. Of course, the employer shall not sit idly while the seafarer endeavors to prove causation. Rather, the employer must overcome the disputable presumption of work-relatedness. Failing therein, the seafarer's illness will be deemed work-related, thereby entitling him to receive compensation. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><b><i>Alcid sufficiently established a reasonable nexus between his working conditions as an able seaman and his development of alveolar soft part sarcoma</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>In the performance of his duties as an able seaman, Alcid was exposed to various harmful and injurious chemicals, such as fumes, gasoline, ethylene, propylene, butane, methane, naphthalene, and dust while on-board the M/V Corral Nettuno, an oil chemical tanker. </p><p> Likewise, he performed strenuous tasks on a daily basis, such as lifting, carrying and moving heavy materials and equipment. He frequently rendered overtime work which added to his stress and fatigue. He also contended with the adverse conditions at sea, and the extreme temperatures which shifted from sweltering heat to intense cold. These daily occurrences made his life on board the vessel physically and mentally taxing. He experienced these stressful conditions over a span of five employment contracts since 2001. </p><p> It bears noting that Dr. Peneyra identified medical studies which revealed that men exposed to chemicals such as thylene and ethylene oxide developed sarcoma.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Alcid's line of work, which involved constant and prolonged exposure to similar harmful carcinogenic chemicals, exacerbated by the stress and fatigue of work on-board, triggered and aggravated his illness. </p><p> The respondents failed to submit counter-evidence to refute Dr. Peneyra's medical findings. Instead, they adamantly insisted that Alcid's illness was caused by a genetic chromosomal abnormality as stated by Dr. Alegre. Respondents likewise attacked Dr. Peneyra's competence to assess Alcid, and faulted Alcid for not submitting himself for examination to a third physician. </p><p> <b>The respondents' arguments fail to persuade. </b></p><p> The length of time that Dr. Peneyra treated Alcid is irrelevant in disproving the probability that the latter's disease was aggravated by his work. This Court notes that Dr. Alegre and Dr. Peneyra rendered a similar diagnosis both confirmed that Alcid was afflicted with alveolar soft part sarcoma. The only disparity in their assessments is the causal relation of the illness and Alcid's working conditions. On the one hand, Dr. Alegre immediately dismissed the possibility of work connection, tersely concluding, sans any substantiation, that the disease is caused by a genetic chromosomal abnormality. On the other hand, Dr. Peneyra filled in this gap, by elaborating that even though the illness may have been caused by a chromosomal abnormality, there have been medical findings which showed a correlation between exposure to harmful chemicals and the development of sarcoma, thereby proving that Alcid's work conditions aggravated his illness. </p><p> Suffice to say, in <i>Licayan v.

In that case, we held that under Section 20(8)(3) of the POEA-SEC, referral to a third physician in case of contrasting medical opinions (between the company-designated physician and the seafarer-appointed physician) is a mandatory procedure that must be expressly requested by the seafarer: a consequence of the provision, the company can insist on its disability rating even against a contrary opinion by another physician, unless the seafarer signifies his intent to submit the disputed assessment to a third physician. <b>We clarify, however, that Section 20(B)(3) refers only to the declaration of fitness to work or the degree of disability.</b><b><i> It does not cover the determination of whether the disability is work-related. </i></b> There is nothing in the POEA-SEC which mandates that the opinion of the company-designated physician regarding work-relation should prevail or that the determination of such relation be submitted to a third physician. </p> <p> It bears emphasis that, in the present case, it is not disputed that Obrero's illness is permanent in nature.<b> The only issue here is work-relatedness.

If the seafarer suffers permanent disability while in service on board the ship, or while traveling to or from the ship, as a result of an accident, regardless of fault, but excluding injuries and consequent disability caused by his willful act, and provided that his ability to work as a seafarer is consequently reduced, he shall be entitled to compensation in addition to his sick pay according to the provisions hereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> It is clear from the foregoing provision that the disability benefit may only be awarded if the seafarer suffers a permanent disability as a result of an accident. </p><p> The NCMB misinterpreted the provision when it opined that the qualifying phrase "<i>as a result of an accident</i>" applies only to the preceding phrase "<i>or while traveling to or from the ship</i>." It erroneously concluded that as long as the seafarer suffers a permanent disability, he may claim compensation under the CBA even if the disability was not caused by an accident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> </p><p> This Court agrees with the CA's interpretation of Article 26.1. To be clear, said provision pertains to two possible scenarios, namely: (i) the seafarer suffers a permanent disability <i>while in service on board the ship </i>as a result of an accident; or (ii) the seafarer suffers a permanent disability <i>while traveling to or from the ship </i>as a result of an accident. Certainly, the use of a comma between the scenarios implies a disassociation or independence. Thus, the qualifier "<i>as a result of an accident</i>" applies to both scenarios, not solely to its preceding phrase. </p><p> Accordingly, the evident intention of the parties is to provide compensation only in case of an accident during the seafarer's employment. Considering that Alcid's permanent disability was caused by an illness, not an accident, he is not entitled to compensation under the CBA. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>Alcid is entitled to a sickness allowance and the reimbursement of his medical</i><em> expenses, subject to a proper recomputation</em></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>To reiterate, Section 20(B) of the 2000 POEA-SEC requires the employer to shoulder the seafarer's medical treatment after repatriation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> and to pay sickness allowance,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> and disability benefit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> </p><p> In <i>The Late Alberto B. Javier, et al. v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc., et al</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> the Court explained the rationale behind each benefit and stressed that they constitute separate and distinct liabilities: </p><blockquote> <p> In reading these provisions, the Court observes the evident intent of the POEA-SEC to<b> treat these liabilities of the employer separately and distinctly from one another by treating the different items of liability under separate paragraphs.</b> These individual paragraphs, in turn, show the bases of each liability that are unique from the others. This formulation is in keeping with the POEA's mandate under Executive Order No. 247 to 'secure the best terms and conditions of employment of Filipino contract workers and ensure compliance therewith' and to 'promote and protect the well-being of Filipino workers overseas.'</p> <p> Accordingly, Section 20-B (2), paragraph 2, of the POEA-SEC imposes on the employer the liability to provide, at its cost, for the medical treatment of the repatriated seafarer for the illness or injury that he suffered on board the vessel until the seafarer is declared fit to work or the degree of his disability is finally determined by the company-designated physician. This liability for medical expenses is conditioned upon the seafarer's compliance with his own obligation to report to the company-designated physician within three (3) days from his arrival in the country for diagnosis and treatment. The medical treatment is aimed at the speedy recovery of the seafarer and the restoration of his previous healthy working condition. </p> <p> Since the seafarer is repatriated to the country to undergo treatment, his inability to perform his sea duties would normally result in depriving him of compensation income. To address this contingency, Section 20-B (3), paragraph 1, of the POEA-SEC imposes on the employer the obligation to provide the seafarer with sickness allowance that is equivalent to his basic wage until the seafarer is declared fit to work or the degree of his permanent disability is determined by the company-designated physician. The period for the declaration should be made within the period of 120 days or 240 days, as the case may be. </p> <p> Once a finding of permanent (total or partial) disability is made either within the 120-day period or the 240-day period, Section 20-B (6) of the POEA­ SEC requires the employer to pay the seafarer disability benefits for his permanent total or partial disability caused by the work-related illness or injury. In practical terms, a finding of permanent disability means a permanent reduction of the earning power of a seafarer to perform future sea or on board duties; permanent disability benefits look to the future as a means to alleviate the seafarer's financial condition based on the level of injury or illness he incurred or contracted. </p> <p> <b>The separate treatment of, and the distinct considerations in, these three kinds of liabilities under the POEA-SEC can only mean that the POEA-SEC intended to make the employer liable for each of these three kinds of liabilities. In other words, employers must: (1) pay the seafarer sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage in addition to the medical treatment that they must provide the seafarer with at their cost; and (2) compensate the seafarer for his permanent total or partial disability as finally determined by the company-designated physician. Significantly, too, while Section 20 of the POEA-SEC did not expressly state that the employer's liabilities are cumulative in nature – so as to hold the employer liable for the sickness allowance, medical expenses and disability benefits – it does not also state that the compensation and benefits are alternative or that the grant of one bars the grant of the others.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> (Emphasis supplied and citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> <p> Consequently, in addition to a full disability benefit of US$60,000.00 under Section 20(B)(6) of the POEA-SEC, Alcid is likewise entitled to a sickness allowance US$2,252.00, which represents his basic salary of US563.00 multiplied by four months (or 120 days), pursuant to Section 20(B)(3) of the POEA-SEC. </p><p> However, this Court takes note of the respondents' statement in their Comment that they have paid a sickness allowance of US$1,388.73, as evidenced by their Check Disbursement Vouchers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> Petitioners did not refute this.

Both sections speak of medical treatment after the seafarer's repatriation. </p><p> Based on the records, Alcid was repatriated and was confined at St. Luke's hospital on April 14, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Meanwhile, Dr. Alegre issued his Medical Report denying any work-connection between Alcid's employment and his illness on April 27, 2009.

Nonetheless, this does not justify an indiscriminate grant of awards, over and above what the POEA-SEC and/or the CBA mandate.
