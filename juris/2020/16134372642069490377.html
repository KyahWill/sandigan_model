The CA upheld the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the prosecution and rejected Cruz's version of the events as lacking in credibility and for inconsistencies in the testimonies of the defense's witnesses. However, the CA no longer discussed Cruz's invocation of the justifying circumstance of fulfillment of duty, and the mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender and/or sufficient provocation.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote><b><i>WHEREFORE</i></b>, premises considered, the decision of the court a quo in Criminal Case No. 08-263728 finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide as well as in Criminal Case no. 08-263729 finding the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of frustrated homicide is <b>AFFIRMED</b> <i>in toto</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote>Aggrieved, Cruz sought reconsideration of the above Decision but was denied by the CA in a Resolution dated January 21, 2015.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br>Cruz argues that the justifying circumstances of self-defense and lawful performance of duty should be appreciated in his favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Alternatively, he maintains that his criminal liability should be mitigated given the sufficient provocation on the part of Bernardo, and by his voluntary surrender.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) counters that the justifying and mitigating circumstances raised by Cruz are not supported by evidence on record.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Additionally, the OSG argues, as it did before the CA, that with respect to the death of Torralba, Cruz should be held guilty of homicide instead of just reckless imprudence resulting in homicide because Torralba's death was brought about by the same felonious act of shooting at Bernardo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><b><center>Issue</center></b><br>The parties submit the following issues for resolution of the Court:<br><blockquote>1.

Whether the CA committed a reversible error when it upheld the RTC ruling that, with respect to the death of Torralba, Cruz is guilty only of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide instead of homicide.</blockquote><b><center>The Court's Ruling</center></b><br>An appeal by the accused in criminal cases throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>After a judicious review of the records of the case at bar, the Court finds that a modification of the assailed CA Decision is in order.<br><br><b><i>Cruz was not acting in self-defense or <br>fulfillment of duty</i></b><br><br>Cruz argues that he should not be held criminally liable for the death of Torralba and the injuries sustained by Bernardo because he was acting in self-defense and in the performance of his duty as a police officer. The Court finds no merit in his position.<br><br>On the matter of self-defense, the Court concurs with the findings of both the RTC and the CA that Cruz's act of shooting was not precipitated by any unlawful aggression on the part of Bernardo. In self-defense, the accused bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence the concurrence of the following elements: (1) unlawful aggression; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the unlawful aggression; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Of these three elements, the existence of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim is the most important.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The test for the presence of unlawful aggression is whether aggression from the victim put in real peril the life or personal safety of the person defending himself, and such peril must not be an imagined or imaginary threat.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Accordingly, (a) there must be a physical or material attack or assault; (b) the attack or assault must be actual, or, at least, imminent; and (c) the attack or assault must be unlawful.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>As found by the RTC and the CA, Cruz failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it was Bernardo who first drew a gun. Thus, in the absence of unlawful aggression on the part of Bernardo, the plea of self-defense must necessarily fail.<br><br>There is also no merit in Cruz's claim that he was acting in the fulfillment of his duties as a police officer at the time of the shooting incident.<br><br>To successfully invoke this justifying circumstance, an accused must prove that: (1) he acted in the performance of a duty; and (2) the injury inflicted or offense committed is the necessary consequence of the due performance or lawful exercise of such duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> It has already been established-by the consistent factual findings of the RTC and CA, which gave more credence to the facts as narrated by the prosecution-that Cruz's act of shooting Bernardo was without any justifiable cause. Consequently, there is no basis to conclude that Cruz's actions were committed in furtherance of his police duties. Moreover, the fact that he reported for duty on the day of the incident,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> does not necessarily prove that he was, at that time, acting by reason of and in the fulfillment of his duty as a police officer. Clearly, the justifying circumstance of fulfillment of duty has no application in this case.<br><br>Having pleaded self-defense, Cruz essentially admitted to the felonious act of shooting Bernardo and inflicting fatal injuries upon the latter. On this score, the Court concurs with the findings of the RTC and CA that Cruz is guilty of frustrated homicide.<br><br><b><i>The death of Torralba amounts to homicide</i></b><br><br>Considering that the death of Torralba was caused by the same felonious act of shooting at Bernardo, the OSG is correct when it argues that Cruz should be held guilty of homicide as originally charged.<br><br>Torralba, an eight-year old boy, was at the wrong place and time during the shooting incident. While Cruz did not intend to end the life of this child, the latter's death is a crime of homicide in accordance with Article 4 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) and prevailing jurisprudence.<br><br>Under Article 4, criminal liability is incurred "by any person committing a felony (<i>delito</i>) although the wrongful act done be different from that which he intended." Accordingly, the author of the felony shall be criminally liable for the direct, natural and logical consequence thereof, whether intended or not. For this provision to apply, it must be shown, however, (a) that an intentional felony has been committed, and (b) that the wrong done to the aggrieved party be the direct, natural and logical consequence of the felony committed by the offender.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The Court finds these elements present in this case.<br><br>It has already been established that Cruz committed an intentional felony when he fired multiple shots at Bernardo. The death of Torralba, who was hit by one of those bullets intended for Bernardo, is a direct, natural, and logical consequence of said intentional felony. The death of Torralba is an example of <i>aberratio ictus</i>.<br><br>In <i>People v. Adriano y Samson</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> a case where one of the victims was a mere by-stander hit by a stray bullet, the Court explained the principle of <i>aberratio ictus</i> under Article 4 of the RPC, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>We refer back to the settled facts of the case. Bulanan, who was merely a bystander, was killed by a stray bullet. He was at the wrong place at the wrong time.<br><br>Stray bullets, obviously, kill indiscriminately and often without warning, precluding the unknowing victim from repelling the attack or defending himself. At the outset, Adriano had no intention to kill Bulanan, much less, employ any particular means of attack. Logically, Bulanan's death was random and unintentional and the method used to kill her, as she was killed by a stray a bullet, was, by no means, deliberate. Nonetheless, Adriano is guilty of the death of Bulanan under Article 4 of the Revised Penal Code, pursuant to the doctrine of <i>aberratio ictus</i>, which imposes criminal liability for the acts committed in violation of law and for all the natural and logical consequences resulting therefrom. While it may not have been Adriano's intention to shoot Bulanan, this fact will not exculpate him. Bulanan's death caused by the bullet fired by Adriano was the natural and direct consequence of Adriano's felonious deadly assault against Cabiedes.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As we already held in <i>People v. Herrera</i> citing <i>People v. Hilario</i>, "[t]he fact that accused killed a person other than their intended victim is of no moment." Evidently, Adriano's original intent was to kill Cabiedes. However, during the commission of the crime of murder, a stray bullet hit and killed Bulanan. Adriano is responsible for the consequences of his act of shooting Cabiedes. This is the import of Article 4 of the Revised Penal Code. As held in <i>People v. Herrera</i> citing <i>People v. Ural</i>:<br><blockquote>Criminal liability is incurred by any person committing a felony although the wrongful act be different from that which is intended. One who commits an intentional felony is responsible for all the consequences which may naturally or logically result therefrom, whether foreseen or intended or not. The rationale of the rule is found in the doctrine, ["<i>el que es causa de la causa es causa del mal causado</i>"], or he who is the cause of the cause is the cause of the evil caused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>Moreover, a finding of <i>dolo</i> or malice on the part of Cruz is simply incompatible with criminal negligence under Article 365 of the RPC which defines reckless imprudence as that which "x x x consists in voluntary, <b>but without malice</b>, doing or failing to do an act from which material damage results by reason of inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the person performing or failing to perform such act, taking into consideration his employment or occupation, degree of intelligence, physical condition and other circumstances regarding persons, time and place, x x x"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Thus, it was erroneous to characterize Torralba's death as one resulting from reckless imprudence.<br><br><b><i>Cruz is only entitled to the mitigating <br>circumstance of voluntary surrender</i></b><br><br>While Cruz is guilty of frustrated homicide and homicide, he is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender under Article 13, paragraph 7, of the RPC which requires "[t]hat the offender had voluntarily surrendered himself to a person in authority or his agents, x x x"<br><br>For this mitigating circumstance to be appreciated, the following elements must be present: 1) the offender has not been actually arrested; 2) the offender surrendered himself to a person in authority or the latter's agent; and 3) the surrender was voluntary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> All three elements are present in this case. As shown by the records, Cruz surrendered his person and service firearm to his superior immediately after the shooting incident.<br><br>Cruz declared in his Memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> dated September 9, 2008 addressed to his station commander that:<br><blockquote>After the incident the undersigned police officer immediately surrendered to his superior as well as his service firearm and turned over to the General Assignment Section (MPD-GAS) for investigation, x x x"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></blockquote>It is also indicated in the Booking Sheet and Arrest Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> dated September 10,2008 that Cruz was "Apprehended By: Voluntary Surrender."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Likewise, it is stated in the Crime Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> dated September 10, 2008 that after the incident, Cruz "x x x fled the scene and surrendered] himself to his Station Commander P/SUPT. ROLANDO MIRANDA of [PS-1] [Manila Police] District x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The Booking Sheet and Arrest Report as well as the Crime Report were admitted by and offered in evidence by the prosecution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> These pieces of evidence clearly and convincingly establish the fact that Cruz had not been actually arrested, but had instead immediately and voluntarily surrendered himself and his service firearm to a person in authority. Thus, he is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.<br><br>The same, however, cannot be said with respect to his claim of sufficient provocation on the part of the Bernardo.<br><br>Under Article 13, paragraph 4, of the RPC, the criminal liability of the accused shall be mitigated if "x x x sufficient provocation or threat on the part of the offended party immediately preceded the act" of the accused. Sufficient provocation refers to "any unjust or improper conduct or act of the victim adequate enough to excite a person to commit a wrong, which is accordingly proportionate in gravity."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> In order to be mitigating, provocation on the part of the victim must be sufficient and should immediately precede the act of the offender.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Cruz argues that Bernardo's acts of suddenly overtaking him, blocking his path and almost colliding with his motorcycle, as well as his acts of shouting, drawing and aiming a gun at Cruz, amount to sufficient provocation. The evidence on record, however, does not support this.<br><br>As mentioned earlier, Cruz failed to prove that it was Bernardo who first drew a gun. Both the RTC and CA gave more credence to the consistent testimonies of the prosecution witnesses who testified that Cruz drew his gun and fired at Bernardo immediately after their short but heated exchange of words, as corroborated by the medical observation with respect to the trajectory of the bullet that hit Bernardo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>The evidence shows that it was Cruz who first drew and fired his gun. While his firing was preceded by a short verbal altercation, this still does not amount to sufficient provocation. The short exchange of words between Bernardo and Cruz, though heated, is not adequate to elicit such grave reaction as the firing of a gun. Thus, the mitigating circumstance of sufficient provocation cannot be appreciated in favor of Cruz.<br><br><b><i>Penalties and Damages</i></b><br><br>Given the Court's findings that the death of Torralba amounts to homicide, and that Cruz is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, the penalties imposed upon him shall be modified accordingly.<br><br>The penalty prescribed for homicide is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> while the penalty prescribed for frustrated homicide is <i>prision mayor</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law and considering the fact that Cruz is entitled to one mitigating circumstance, the imposable penalty is any period within the range of the penalty that is one a degree lower than that prescribed by law, as the minimum, and the minimum period of the penalty prescribed by law, as the maximum. Accordingly, the Court imposes upon Cruz the penalty of: (a) eight years and one day of <i>prision mayor</i>, as minimum, to 12 years and one day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as maximum, for his crime of homicide; and, (b) two years, two months and one day of <i>prision correccional</i>, as minimum to six years and one day of <i>prision mayor</i>, as maximum, for his crime of frustrated homicide.<br><br>The Court also deems it proper to modify the award of damages to conform with prevailing jurisprudence.
