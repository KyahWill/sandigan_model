Oscar Belleza, Norberto A. Murillo, Reina Mae A. Nasino, Dario Tomada, 
Emmanuel Bacarra, Oliver B. Rosales, and Lilia Bucatcat (petitioners) 
filed a petition before this Court entitled "<i>In the Matter of the Urgent Petition for the Release of Prisoners on Humanitarian Grounds in the Midst of the COVID</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>-19 <i>Pandemic</i>."
 Here, petitioners allege that they are prisoners and are among the 
elderly, sick, and pregnant population of inmates exposed to the danger 
of contracting COVID-19 where social distancing and self-isolation 
measures are purportedly impossible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 As such, they are invoking this Court's power to exercise "equity 
jurisdiction" and are seeking "temporary liberty on humanitarian 
grounds" either on recognizance or on bail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 Moreover, they are also asking the Court to order the creation of a 
"Prisoner Release Committee" similar to those set up in other countries 
to conduct a study and implement the release of prisoners in congested 
penal facilities. In seeking their provisional release on recognizance 
or bail, petitioners essentially argue that: (a) their continued 
confinement which poses a high risk of contracting COVID-19 is 
tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment proscribed under the 
Constitution;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (b) the 
United Nations (UN) standards, particularly the UN Standard Minimum 
Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules), imposes a 
duty on the part of the State to protect the health and safety of 
prisoners consistent with the guarantees of the right to life;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (c) the government's response to the pandemic is not enough to protect the safety of the inmates;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 (d) the government should take a cue from other countries which 
undertook measures to decongest their jails by releasing eligible 
prisoners;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (e) the Court 
may brush aside procedural rules and grant temporary liberty based on 
humanitarian reasons and equity jurisdiction;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and (f) it is not feasible for them to file petitions for <i>certiorari</i> with the trial courts due to the Luzon-wide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  </p><p> For respondents' part who are represented by the Office of the
 Solicitor General, they filed their comment opposing petitioners' plea 
for their temporary release and for the creation of a Prisoner Release 
Committee and argued that: (a) petitioners are valuable members of the 
Communist Party of the Philippines — New People's Army — National 
Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) who have committed heinous crimes and are
 merely taking advantage of the current public health as well as the 
"fickle arena of public opinion" situation in seeking for their 
temporary release based on humanitarian reasons;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 (b) the government has adequate medical facilities, personnel and 
measures to address the threat of COVID-19 in jails and other detention 
facilities;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (c) 
petitioners have ample remedies under this Court's several circulars 
which addressed the needs to decongest the jails in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (d) petitioners violated the doctrine of hierarchy of courts;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 (e) the grant or denial of bail, the evaluation of petitioners' 
respective medical conditions, and the determination of whether or not 
the evidence of guilt is strong are questions of fact which should be 
determined by the trial courts;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (f) petitioners cannot be temporarily released on recognizance because they were charged with capital offenses;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (g) petitioners cannot be granted provisional liberty based on equity because governing laws exist;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (h) the doctrine espoused in <i><b>Enrile v. Sandiganbayan</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> is inapplicable because petitioners present a threat to public safety due to their supposed membership in the CPP-NPA-NDF;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 (i) releasing petitioners violates the equal protection clause as there
 is no substantial difference between them and the rest of the detainees
 as everyone is equally vulnerable to COVID-19;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 and (j) the Philippines is not bound to adopt the manner of 
decongesting jails undertaken by other countries as they operate under 
their own set of laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>

  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"> <b><u>Ruling</u></b>
  </p><p> The Supreme Court is a collegiate judicial body whose rulings 
and binding opinions are the results of its members' collective and 
majoritarian consensus. The doctrines it establishes do not depend on 
the judgment or will of a sole magistrate as such is the spirit of 
collegiality. Thus, after initial deliberations and exchanges of ideas, 
it was collectively realized that the instant case presents several 
complex issues making the interaction of applicable principles ridden 
with far-reaching implications. Nonetheless, the members of this Court 
have unanimously arrived at the conclusion to treat the petition as 
petitioners' application for bail or recognizance, as well as their 
motions for other practicable and suitable confinement arrangements 
relative to the alleged serious threats to their health and lives.  
  </p><p> At the outset, it is a settled rule that the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 Relatedly, a direct invocation of this Court's original jurisdiction is
 generally proscribed to prevent inordinate demands upon its time and 
attention which are better devoted to those matters within its exclusive
 jurisdiction as well as to prevent further over-crowding of its docket.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p>
 Concomitantly, the Constitution guarantees the right to bail of all the
 accused except those charged with offenses punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> when the evidence of guilt is strong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> However, in cases where the offense is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua </i>and where the evidence of guilt is strong, bail is a matter of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 Here, trial courts are granted the discretion to determine in bail 
applications whether there is strong evidence of guilt on the part of 
the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> A summary hearing is conducted merely for the purpose of determining the weight of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
 Only after weighing the pieces of evidence as contained in the summary 
will the judge formulate his own conclusion as to whether the evidence 
of guilt against the accused is strong based on his discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Therefore, the entitlement to bail is a question of fact.</p><p> In this case, petitioners have been charged with offenses punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.
 As such, they are not entitled to bail as a matter of right. 
Consequently, there is a need to conduct summary hearings for the 
purpose of weighing the strength of the prosecution's evidence as to 
petitioners' guilt. This process entails a reception and an evaluation 
of evidence which the trial courts are competent to handle. The 
foregoing holds true with respect to the motions for other confinement 
arrangements which also necessitate reception and evaluation of evidence
 by a trial court. Hence, being a court of last resort, this Court 
ingeminates and reminds the Bench and the Bar that it is not the proper 
avenue or forum to ventilate factual questions especially if they are 
presented for adjudication on the first instance.</p><p> Like the case of <b><i>Versoza v. People, et al.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and <b><i>Cruz, et al. v. Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources, et al.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
 the Court deems it fitting to have the other remaining issues threshed 
out in the separate opinions of its members that are attached to and 
made integral parts of this Decision.</p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing reasons, the Court <b>TREATS </b>the
 present petition as petitioners' applications for bail or recognizance 
as well as their motions for other confinement arrangements, and <b>REFERS</b> the same to the respective trial courts where their criminal cases are pending, which courts are hereby <b>DIRECTED </b>to
 conduct the necessary proceedings and consequently, resolve these 
incidents with utmost dispatch. Accordingly, the proceedings before this
 Court are considered <b>CLOSED</b> and <b>TERMINATED</b>.</p><p> No pronouncement as to costs. </p><p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b>

  <p align="center"><b><br></b></p><p align="center"><b>SEPARATE OPINION</b></p>
  <p><strong>PERALTA, <em>C.J.</em>:</strong></p>
  <p> I join the majority in treating the instant petition as 
petitioners' application for bail or recognizance. I submit this 
opinion, however, in order to articulate my views on some salient 
points.</p>
<p> The instant Petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
calls for the release of prisoners on humanitarian grounds in the midst 
of the pandemic created by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)
 that now grips the world at the neck.</p><p> Petitioners, who deem 
themselves as political prisoners detained in various penal institutions
 in the country, profess that they are most vulnerable to COVID-19 as 
they are either elderly, pregnant, or afflicted with hypertension and/or
 diabetes. Believing that an outbreak of the disease in their respective
 places of confinement is not unlikely owing to what they perceive to be
 hellish conditions in highly-congested local prisons, they fear that 
they stand to be the most susceptible to infection if and when such 
outbreak does occur.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p><p>
 In support of this bid, petitioners cite a number of medical reports 
and abstracts tending to demonstrate that the elderly, sickly and those 
already afflicted with certain ailments, are the easiest victims of the 
novel disease.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Thus, they 
plead for their release from confinement either on bail or recognizance,
 as well as for the creation, by directive of the Court, of a Prisoner 
Release Committee with accompanying ground rules for the conditional 
release of similarly situated prisoners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 They invoke humanitarian considerations based on international law 
principles, specifically those embodied in the Revised United Nations 
Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (<i>The Mandela Rule of 2015</i>) and Article 9.1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (<i>ICCPR</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p> By way of Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the Office of the Solicitor General (<i>OSG</i>)
 advocates for the dismissal of the petition based on outright violation
 of judicial hierarchy. It explains that the plea should be offered 
before the courts where petitioners' respective cases are being heard, 
and not directly with the High Court. It also calls attention to the 
fact that petitioners have all been charged and, except for one<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 who has already met conviction and is currently serving sentence, are 
under prosecution for non-bailable offenses in relation to their alleged
 membership in the CPP-NPA-NDF. More than half of them are in custody at
 Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City and none of them has yet been reported to
 exhibit signs of infection. </p><p> As said, the Petition must be treated as petitioners' application for bail or recognizance. </p><p align="center"> <b>I</b>
</p><p> The release of petitioners on bail is restricted by twin 
fundamental provisions of the Constitution and the Rules of Court. 
Section 7 of Rule 114 of the Rules of Court instructs that a person 
charged with a capital offense or with an offense punishable by<em> reclusion perpetua</em> or life imprisonment shall not be entitled to bail when the evidence of guilt is strong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 The rule echoes from Section 13, Article III of the Constitution which 
stresses that bail, while ordinarily a right of an accused, is not 
available to those charged of a capital offense or an offense punishable
 by life imprisonment or <i>reclusion perpetua</i> when the evidence of guilt is strong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
</p><p> Here, petitioners are all charged with crimes or offenses that are punishable by death, life imprisonment or <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.
 Worse, one of them was already convicted by the trial court. Hence, 
none of the petitioners can claim to be entitled to bail as a matter of 
right. Their entitlement to bail is a matter reposed to judicial 
discretion—particularly, to the discretion of the court where their 
cases are pending. </p><p> The question of whether petitioners are 
deserving of provisional liberty, much more of whether the evidence of 
guilt against them are strong, are certainly questions of fact. 
Resolving such questions in the first instance is not, and has never 
been, the province of this Court. It is not difficult to see the merit 
in the OSG's argument, therefore, that the instant petition suffers from
 infirmity—for the same not only ignores the doctrine of hierarchy of 
courts—but also implores this Court to act on a matter that lies outside
 its competence as it is not ordinarily legally equipped to evaluate 
evidence respecting the right to bail.</p><p> Indeed, judicial 
discretion in granting bail may be exercised only after pertinent 
evidence is submitted to a court during a bail hearing after due notice 
to the prosecution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The 
necessity, if not indispensability, of a bail hearing under the 
circumstances is all the more revealed if we consider that certain 
factors in the fixing of a bail bond—such as the nature and 
circumstances of the crime, character and reputation of the accused, the
 weight of the evidence against him, the probability of the accused 
appearing at the trial, whether or not the accused is a fugitive from 
justice, and whether or not the accused is under bond in other 
cases—unequivocally require the presentation of evidence and a 
reasonable opportunity for the prosecution to refute it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p>
 Yet, petitioners argue that it would be unreasonable to require them to
 follow the usual procedure in applying for bail given the threat of the
 COVID-19 pandemic and the fact that the whole Luzon has been placed 
under enhanced community quarantine. </p><p> The argument fails to convince. </p><p>
 We remind petitioners that neither the pandemic nor the executive 
declaration of a Luzon-wide lockdown has the effect of suspending our 
laws and rules, much less of shutting down the Judiciary. </p><p> 
Contrary to petitioners' insinuation, applying for bail before trial 
courts has not been rendered infeasible even amidst the COVID-19 
pandemic and the Luzon-wide lockdown. In Administrative Circular (<i>AC</i>) No. 31-2020, issued on March 16, 2020, this Court explicitly assured that court hearings on urgent matters—including that of "<i>petitions, motions or pleadings related to bail</i>"—will continue during the entire period of the community quarantine. </p><p>
 In addition, the Court has issued several circulars specifically aimed 
at facilitating and expediting the release of certain persons deprived 
of liberty (<i>PDL</i>) at the height of the present COVID-19 pandemic. Thus:</p><p> </p><blockquote>1.) In AC No. 33-2020,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
 the Court specifically allowed the electronic filing of applications 
for bail and granted trial court judges a wider latitude of discretion 
for a lowered bail amount effective during the period of the present 
public health emergency. The Circular also sanctioned the electronic 
transmission of bail application approvals and directed the consequent 
release order to be issued within the same day to the proper law 
enforcement authority or detention facility to enable the release of the
 accused. <p></p><p> 2.) In AC No. 34-2020,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 on the other hand, the Court expanded the efficacy of electronic filing
 of criminal complaints and informations, together with bail 
applications, to keep up with the executive determination of the need to
 extend the period of the enhanced community quarantine in critical 
regions of the country. </p><p> 3.) In AC No. 37-2020,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 the Court ordered the pilot-testing of videoconference hearings on 
urgent matters in criminal cases, including bail applications, in 
critical regions where the risk of viral transmission is high. </p><p> 4.) Finally, in AC No. 38-2020,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 the Court authorized the grant of reduced bail and recognizance to 
indigent PDLs pending the continuation of the proceedings and the

<p> An examination of the substance of the instant Petition would further reveal its inaptness. </p><p> Invoking equity considerations, petitioners allude to the doctrines in <i>Enrile v. Sandiganbayan, et al</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and <i>De la Rama v. The People's Court</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 where the accused were allowed temporary liberty on account of proven 
medical condition as their continued incarceration was shown to be 
further injurious to their health and would endanger their lives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The OSG, on the other hand, rebuffs this allusion by positing that <i>Enrile</i> cannot be relied upon as a precedent because it is a <i>pro hac vice</i> ruling. </p><p> While I believe that petitioners' invocation of <i>Enrile</i> is misplaced, I take exception to the OSG's characterization of the ruling in that case as <i>pro hac vice</i>. </p><p> <i>Pro hac vice</i> is a Latin term meaning "<i>for this one particular occasion</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Similarly, a <i>pro hac vice</i> ruling is one "<b><i>expressly qualified as x x x cannot be relied upon as a precedent to govern other cases</i>.</b>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The Court never expressly qualified the<i> Enrile</i> ruling as having only a <i>pro hac vice</i>
 application. In fact, the Court, even if it minded to, could not have 
validly made such qualification, considering that the promulgation of <i>pro hac vice</i> decisions has already been declared as illegal in our jurisdiction. In the 2017 <i>en banc</i> case of <i>Knights of Rizal v. DMCI Homes, Inc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> we held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> <i>Pro hac vice</i> means a specific decision does not constitute a
 precedent because the decision is for the specific case only, not to be
 followed in other cases. <b>A <i>pro hac vice</i> decision violates 
statutory law - Article 8 of the Civil Code - which states that 
"judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the 
Constitution shall form part of the legal system of the Philippines</b>." The decision of the Court in this case cannot be <i>pro hac vice</i> because by mandate of the law every decision of the Court forms part of the legal system of the Philippines. <b>If
 another case comes up with the same facts as the present case, that 
case must be decided in the same way as this case to comply with the 
constitutional mandate of equal protection of the law. Thus, a <i>pro hac vice</i> decision also violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.</b> (Emphasis supplied) </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Petitioners err in their invocation of <i>Enrile</i> simply because the circumstances in that case are different from the circumstances herein. </p><p> <i>First</i>, the petitioner in <i>Enrile</i>—the Senator Juan Ponce Enrile—underwent bail hearing with the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> prior to his resort to this Court. What Senator Enrile assailed before this Court then was the Sandiganbayan's denial of his <i>Motion to Fix Bail</i> and its <i>Motion for Reconsideration</i>.
 In the instant case, however, petitioners are asking the Court to grant
 their provisional liberty by way of bail or recognizance without filing
 a motion before the trial courts having jurisdiction over their 
respective cases. </p><p> <i>Second</i>, in his bail hearing for the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>,
 Senator Enrile was able to present evidence of his current fragile 
state of health. Based on that, the Court was able to infer that Senator
 Enrile's advanced age and ill health required special medical 
attention. On the other hand, to prove their medical conditions, 
petitioners herein attached medical certificates and other documents in 
their petition. However, the Court cannot simply take judicial notice of
 petitioners' age and health conditions. Judicial notice is the 
cognizance of certain facts that judges may properly take and act on 
without proof because these facts are already known to them; it is the 
duty of the court to assume something as matters of fact without need of
 further evidentiary support.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 Age and health conditions necessitate the presentation of evidence. 
This further emphasizes the need to conduct a bail hearing. </p><p> <i>Lastly</i>, Senator Enrile's medical condition was not the only consideration why he was afforded the benefit of bail. In <i>Enrile</i>,
 the Court affirmed the right to bail because Senator Enrile was 
likewise not shown to be a danger to the community and his risk of 
flight was nil - a conclusion that was impelled not only by his social 
and political standing, but also by his voluntary surrender to the 
authorities. Thus -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> In our view, his social and political standing and his having 
immediately surrendered to the authorities upon his being charged in 
court indicate that the risk of his flight or escape from this 
jurisdiction is highly unlikely. His personal disposition from the onset
 of his indictment for plunder, formal or otherwise, has demonstrated 
his utter respect for the legal processes of this country. We also do 
not ignore that at an earlier time many years ago when he had been 
charged with rebellion with murder and multiple frustrated murder, he 
already evinced a similar personal disposition of respect for the legal 
processes, and was granted bail during the pendency of his trial because
 he was not seen as a flight risk. With his solid reputation in both his
 public and his private lives, his long years of public service, and 
history's judgment of him being at stake, he should be granted bail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The Court is mindful that a contagion within the country's penal 
institutions is neither unlikely nor impossible. Yet, we take judicial 
notice of the fact that following the executive declaration of a public 
health emergency in March, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (<i>BJMP</i>)
 and the Bureau of Corrections, under a joint mandate to protect the 
health and safety of all PDLs and detention prisoners, have implemented 
preventive and precautionary measures against a potential COVID-19 
outbreak in detention and correctional facilities. The measures include 
the total lockdown of penal institutions, the designation of isolation 
facilities within premises, the procurement of personal protective 
equipment, as well as nutrition and on-site education campaigns. Only 
recently, the Bureau of Corrections has also put in place necessary 
infrastructure to provide inmates facility for online visits/video 
conference with their relatives. </p><p> Be that as it may, petitioners 
would now have the Court follow the global trend of late, whereby 
various governments have taken swift unprecedented measures in 
decongesting prison facilities by allowing an exodus of prisoners on 
conditional or temporary liberty to mitigate the effects of an on-site 
community transmission of COVID-19 or otherwise curb that possibility. 
It bears to stress, however, that these initiatives were based on laws 
and rules prevailing in those jurisdictions. For instance, the directive
 for the release of prisoners in the territories of India applies only 
to those convicted or charged with offenses punishable with less than 
seven years of jail term.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p>
 At any rate, the Philippines did not lag behind in this respect. As I 
have already pointed out, this Court - mindful of the circumstantial 
vulnerabilities present in detention and correctional facilities across 
the country, as well as of the limits of its own power and competence - 
has already caused, through its various issuances in response to the 
pandemic, the seamless release of 33,790<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
 detention prisoners in a most expeditious way but in line with existing
 fundamental laws, rules and legal processes. Such issuances, in turn, 
complement on-going efforts by executive agencies to expedite the 
release of PDLs via parole, pardon and executive clemency. Indeed, the 
latest figures from the Department of Justice indicate that, as a direct
 result of implementing its <i>Interim Rules on Parole and Executive Clemency</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> which took effect last May 15, 2020, the Board of Pardons and Parole (<i>BPP</i>)
 was already able to grant parole to 221 PDLs, recommend the release on 
conditional pardon of 56 others, and endorse the commutation of sentence
 of 56 more from May 18, 2020 to June 10, 2020—a period of only less 
than a month.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> These, in addition to the earlier reported release by the BJMP of some 4,188 PDLs from March 17 to April 30, 2020.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
 Undeniably, such parallel efforts by the Judiciary and executive show 
the government's commitment in maximizing, nay, in exhausting, every 
available legal means in order to decongest the country's detention and 
correction facilities amidst the current national health crisis. </p><p align="center"> <b>III</b>
</p><p> At this juncture, we stress that unless there is clear showing 
that petitioners are actually suffering from a medical condition that 
requires immediate and specialized attention outside of their current 
confinement - as, for instance, an actual and proven exposure to or 
infection with the novel coronavirus - they must remain in custody and 
isolation incidental to the crimes with which they were charged, or for 
which they are being tried or serving sentence. Only then can there be 
an actual controversy and a proper invocation of humanitarian and equity
 considerations that is ripe for this Court to determine. </p><p> We 
come to the conclusion that petitioners are probably seeking 
administrative - not judicial - remedies that would genuinely address 
their concerns in regard to which this Court, as overseer of the 
Judiciary, could exercise no other prerogative than to: (a) treat the 
instant petition as petitioners' application for bail or recognizance, 
(b) refer the same to the respective trial courts where their criminal 
cases are pending for resolution and (c) direct said courts to resolve 
such incidents with deliberate dispatch. That judicial remedy is 
unavailable to the reliefs prayed for, is all the more apparent from 
their collective sentiment that the government-imposed quarantine and 
lockdown measures, which in the interim necessarily denied them of 
supervised access to their families and friends, have negatively 
affected their mental well-being. As they hereby complain about 
languishing in isolation, they fail to see that in truth, the rest of 
the outside world is likewise socially isolating as a basic 
precautionary measure in response to a pandemic of this kind. They 
lament the lingering fear of a potential infection within their 
confinement on account of their respective physical vulnerabilities and 
hereby plead that they be indefinitely set free, without realizing it is
 that same exact fear which looms outside of prison walls. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, I vote to: (a) <b>TREAT </b>the instant petition as petitioners' application for bail or recognizance, (b) <b>REFER</b> the same to the respective trial courts where their criminal cases are pending for resolution, and (c) <b>DIRECT</b> said courts to resolve such incidents with deliberate dispatch.<br><br></p><p> </p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT">

  <p align="center"><b><br></b></p><p align="center"><b>SEPARATE OPINION</b> </p>
  <p><b>PERLAS-BERNABE, <i>J</i>.:</b> </p>
  <p>I concur in the result. As I have proposed from the inception of 
this case, the instant petition should be treated as petitioners' 
respective applications for bail/recognizance, as well as their motions 
for suitable and practicable confinement arrangements, and consequently,
 be referred to the proper trial courts for the conduct of further 
proceedings. However, due to the collective decision of the membership 
to confine the <em>ponencia</em> to this unanimous disposition subject 
to separate opinions on some significant constitutional issues, I am 
impelled to submit this Separate Opinion to explain the reasons and 
justifications for my concurrence.</p>
  <p align="center"> <b>I. Prayer for Release on Bail/Recognizance.</b>
  </p><p>Primarily, petitioners seek direct recourse to the Court for 
their temporary release on recognizance or, in the alternative, bail, 
"for the duration of the state of public health emergency, national 
calamity, lockdown[,] and community quarantine due to the threats of x x
 x [Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)]."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  </p><p> At its core, bail "acts as a reconciling mechanism to 
accommodate both the accused's interest in pretrial liberty and 
society's interest in assuring the accused's presence at trial."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Its purpose is "to guarantee the appearance of the accused at the trial, or whenever so required by the trial court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 Similarly, "[r]ecognizance is a mode of securing the release of any 
person in custody or detention for the commission of an offense" but is 
made available to those who are "unable to post bail due to abject 
poverty."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
  </p><p> Our Constitution and statutes prescribe a legal framework in 
granting bail or recognizance to persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) 
pending final conviction. The Constitution denies bail, as a matter of 
right, to "those charged with offenses punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> when evidence of guilt is strong."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 In the same vein, Republic Act No. (RA) 10389, known as the 
"Recognizance Act of 2012," provides that recognizance is not a matter 
of right when the offense is punishable by "death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, or life imprisonment"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and as per its implementing rules, "when the evidence of guilt is strong,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> consistent with the Constitution.
  </p><p> When the accused is charged with an offense punishable by death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i>,
 or life imprisonment, the usual procedure is for the accused to apply 
for bail with notice to the prosecutor. Thereafter, the judge is 
mandated to conduct a hearing to primarily determine the existence of 
strong evidence of guilt or lack of it, against the accused. When the 
evidence of guilt is not strong, the judge is then tasked to fix the 
amount of bail taking into account the guidelines set forth in Section 
9, Rule 114 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure. In <i>Cortes v. Catral</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Court explained:
    </p><blockquote>
      <p> [W]hether bail is a matter of right or of discretion, 
reasonable notice of hearing is required to be given to the prosecutor 
or fiscal or at least he must be asked for his recommendation because in
 fixing the amount of bail, the judge is required to take into account a
 number of factors such as the applicant's character and reputation, 
forfeiture of other bonds or whether he is a fugitive from justice.</p>
      <p> When a person is charged with an offense punishable by death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i>[,]
 or life imprisonment, bail is a matter of discretion. Rule 114, Section
 7 of the Rules of Court states: "No person charged with a capital 
offense, or an offense punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or life 
imprisonment when the evidence of guilt is strong, shall be admitted to 
bail regardless of the stage of the criminal action." <u>Consequently, when the accused is charged with an offense punishable by death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i>[,]
 or life imprisonment, the judge is mandated to conduct a hearing, 
whether summary or otherwise in the discretion of the court, not only to
 take into account the guidelines set forth in Section 9, Rule 114 of 
the Rules of Court, but primarily to determine the existence of strong 
evidence of guilt or lack of it, against the accused</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> Pursuant to procedural rules, the accused may also seek a reduction of the recommended bail amount,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> or seek a release through recognizance upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
    </p><p> In this case, petitioners are all charged with offenses that are punishable by death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, or life imprisonment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In fact, one of them had already been convicted by the trial court and her appeal is pending resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 Petitioners have not shown that any of them has filed the necessary 
bail applications. It was neither shown that bail hearings were 
conducted in their respective cases in order to determine whether or not
 there exists strong evidence of guilt against them, which would, in 
turn, determine their qualification or disqualification for the reliefs 
prayed for. 
    </p><p> "Strong evidence of guilt" entails the submission of 
evidence by the parties, and consequently, a circumspect factual 
determination. <b>The Court is not a trier of facts</b>, and hence, is not competent to engage itself in such a laborious endeavor. <b>Institutionally,
 the Court does not function like a trial court where hearings are 
conducted for the presentation of evidence by the litigants involved. </b>Accordingly,
 it is incapable of determining whether or not any of the petitioners 
may be released on bail or recognizance pursuant to the provisions of 
law and the Constitution. 
    </p><p> This notwithstanding, petitioners seek temporary liberty - 
specifically, through bail or recognizance - on humanitarian grounds, 
invoking this Court's equity jurisdiction. It is hornbook doctrine, 
however, that equity comes into play only in the absence of law. "Equity
 is justice outside legal provisions, and must be exercised in the 
absence of law, not against it."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 As mentioned, there is a prescribed legal framework in granting bail or
 recognizance to PDLs pending final conviction. Bail or recognizance 
cannot be granted to persons who are charged with capital offenses when 
the evidence of guilt against them is strong. <b>Hence, the Court would 
be betraying its mandate to apply the law and the Constitution should it
 prematurely order the release of petitioners on bail or recognizance <i><u>absent the requisite hearing to determine whether or not the evidence of guilt against them is strong</u></i>.</b> While it is noted that this was done in the past in the case of <i>Enrile v. Sandiganbayan</i> (<i>Enrile</i>),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the majority ruling in that case should be deemed as "<i>pro hac vice</i>" in light of the past Senator's "solid reputation in both his private and public lives"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and "his fragile state of health"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> which deserved immediate medical attention. 
    </p><p> To understand the peculiarity of<i> Enrile</i>, one may simply consult the majority Decision therein which would readily show, on its face, that <b>no
 bail hearing to determine the existence of "strong evidence of guilt" 
against Enrile was conducted. In fact, the absence of this requisite 
hearing was precisely the reason why the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> denied Enrile's motion to fix bail on the ground of prematurity:</b>
    </p><blockquote>
      <p> On June 5, 2014, the Office of the Ombudsman charged Enrile and several others with plunder in the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>
 on the basis of their purported involvement in the diversion and misuse
 of appropriations under the Priority Development Assistance Fund 
(PDAF). On June 10, 2014 and June 16, 2014, Enrile respectively filed 
his Omnibus Motion and Supplemental Opposition, praying, among others, 
that he be allowed to post bail should probable cause be found against 
him. The motions were heard by the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> after the Prosecution filed its Consolidated Opposition. </p>
      <p> On July 3, 2014, the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> issued its 
resolution denying Enrile's motion, particularly on the matter of bail, 
on the ground of its prematurity[,] considering that Enrile had not yet 
then voluntarily surrendered or been placed under the custody of the 
law. Accordingly, the<i> Sandiganbayan</i> ordered the arrest of Enrile. </p>
      <p> On the same day that the warrant for his arrest was issued, 
Enrile voluntarily surrendered to Director Benjamin Magalong of the 
Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) in Camp Crame, Quezon 
City, and was later on confined at the Philippine National Police (PNP) 
General Hospital following his medical examination. </p>
      <p> Thereafter, Enrile filed his Motion for Detention at the PNP 
General Hospital, and his Motion to Fix Bail, both dated July 7, 2014, 
which were heard by the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> on July 8, 2014. In support
 of the motions, Enrile argued that he should be allowed to post bail 
because: (a) the Prosecution had not yet established that the evidence 
of his guilt was strong; (b) although he was charged with plunder, the 
penalty as to him would only be <i>reclusion temporal</i>, not<i> reclusion perpetua</i>; and (c) he was not a flight risk, and his age and physical condition must further be seriously considered. </p>
      <p> On July 14, 2014, the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> issued its first assailed resolution denying Enrile's Motion to Fix Bail, disposing thusly: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> . . . <b>[I]t is only after the prosecution shall have 
presented its evidence and the Court shall have made a determination 
that the evidence of guilt is not strong against accused Enrile can he 
demand bail as a matter of right. Then and only then will the Court be 
duty-bound to fix the amount of his bail. </b></p>
        <p> <b><u>To be sure, no such determination has been made by the
 Court. In fact, accused Enrile has not filed an application for bail. 
Necessarily, no bail hearing can even commence. It is thus exceedingly 
premature for accused Enrile to ask the Court to fix his bail</u></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied) </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p> To my mind, the majority ruling in <i>Enrile</i>, which in turn, cited <i>De La Rama v. The People's Court</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 is an unusual judicial precedent which strays from the prescribed legal
 course on bail or recognizance. For a person charged with a capital 
offense, a bail hearing is necessary to determine whether or not the 
accused may nonetheless be released on account of the established 
finding that the evidence against him or her is not strong. This 
requirement finds force in none other than our Constitution. At any 
rate, the foregoing special considerations taken into account by the 
majority therein were not shown to attend in this case. Hence, 
petitioners cannot invoke the <i>Enrile</i> ruling to successfully obtain their desired relief. 
    </p><p> Petitioners, however, should not be completely barren of any relief from this Court. <b>In the <i>interest of substantial justice</i>,
 and considering that the present petition is the first of its kind in 
the context of this novel public health situation, the Court may relax 
the usual procedure requiring that bail applications be first filed 
before the trial courts, and instead, treat the instant petition as 
petitioners' respective bail applications and refer the same to the 
proper trial courts.</b> Thereafter, the trial courts having 
jurisdiction over petitioners' respective cases must determine the 
merits of the bail applications. <b>However, before proceeding, they 
must first ascertain whether or not previous bail applications have been
 filed by petitioners and their status</b>. This <b>preliminary determination</b> upon referral to the respective trial courts would result into the following possible scenarios: 
    </p><p> (1) If a bail application had already been previously filed 
and consequently denied by the trial court, then the denial must stand 
on the ground that there is already a determination that the evidence of
 guilt against the accused-petitioner charged with a capital offense is 
strong and hence, need not be re-litigated further; 
    </p><p> (2) If a bail application had already been previously filed 
but had yet to be resolved by the trial court, the bail hearings should 
just continue, taking into account the submissions in the present 
petition; or
    </p><p> (3) If no bail application was previously filed and bail 
hearings have yet to be conducted to determine whether or not the 
evidence of guilt against an accused-petitioner charged with a capital 
offense is strong, then the trial court must, with notice to the 
prosecutor, conduct the necessary proceedings to make such 
determination. 
    </p><p> Once it is determined that the evidence against an 
accused-petitioner (or any accused for that matter) is not strong and 
hence, qualified for bail or recognizance, he or she should then be 
given an opportunity to present evidence showing, <i>inter alia</i>, his
 or her age and medical condition. As per our Rules of Criminal 
Procedure, these factors must be taken into account in determining the 
reasonable amount of bail to be imposed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
    </p><p> To reiterate, this petition is the first of its kind in the 
context of this novel public health situation. It is apt to mention that
 the petition was filed back on April 8, 2020.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 Judicial notice may be taken of the fact that at that time, the 
COVID-19 pandemic was at its unnerving onset. Public uncertainty, 
confusion, and paranoia were at their peak, and the government, as a 
whole, was just beginning to reckon the proper policy approach in 
dealing with a pandemic of historical and global proportions. Therefore,
 with the life-concerning threat of the COVID-19 pandemic hanging above 
their heads, petitioners directly resorted to this Court to seek their 
temporary release. Verily, humanitarian considerations juxtaposed 
against the novelty of the public health situation, especially with the 
emerging public perception at that time, dictate that instead of denying
 the petition outright, partial relief be accorded to them. 
    </p><p> It deserves highlighting that there would be no harm in 
treating the petition as petitioners' respective bail applications, and 
referring them to the proper trial courts. <b>The procedure for referral
 as herein proposed is not some groundbreaking innovation; it is but 
analogous to remand directives which have been customarily done by the 
Court.</b> Needless to state, non-traditional procedures such as this are clearly within the powers of the Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 and are permissible when there are compelling reasons to further the 
higher interests of substantial justice, as in this case. While this may
 not be the ordinary procedure, the circumstances so warrant the 
discretionary relaxation of our rules. 
    </p><p> A caveat, however, must be made: the unique situation of 
petitioners as being the first litigants to file such petition before 
the Court only obtains as to them. Henceforth, it is my view that PDLs 
similarly situated as petitioners should follow the existing rules of 
procedure and Court issuances on filing bail/recognizance applications 
before the proper inferior courts having jurisdiction over their 
respective cases. 
    </p><p align="center"> <b>II. Prayer for "Other Non-Custodial Measures." </b>
    </p><p> Our laws on bail or recognizance do not account for prison 
conditions as a ground for provisional liberty under these specific 
legal modes. Under our existing legal framework, the right to be 
released on bail or recognizance is anchored only on the nature of the 
charge and on whether or not there exists strong evidence of guilt 
against the accused. Nevertheless, nothing prevents an accused from 
seeking a different imprisonment arrangement if he or she is able to 
prove that his or her life is greatly prejudiced by his or her continued
 confinement. Neither are courts prohibited from granting an accused 
such practicable alternative confinement arrangements to protect his or 
her life, although not considered as bail or recognizance in the 
traditional sense of our laws. After all, our statutes command that 
"[n]o judge or court shall decline to render judgment by reason of the 
silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the laws,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 and "[i]n case of doubt in the interpretation or application of laws, 
it is presumed that the lawmaking body intended right and justice to 
prevail."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
    </p><p> As our current legal framework does not specify the 
parameters for these reliefs, it is submitted that they be adjudged 
according to the deliberate indifference standard adopted in foreign 
jurisprudence. However, before delving into this topic, I find it 
imperative to discuss some fundamental principles relative to the right 
to life in light of the subhuman conditions of our prison system. This 
springs from the insinuations during the deliberations on this case that
 it is the legislative's task to remedy our subhuman prison conditions, 
and that the right to life does not include the right against cruel and 
unusual punishment under Section 19, Article III of the 1987 
Constitution. 
    </p><p> There is no quibbling that courts are duty-bound to 
recognize a person's right to life, and grant permissible reliefs 
despite, and to reiterate, the silence, obscurity or insufficiency of 
our laws. This command is founded on none other than the fundamental 
law, particularly in our Bill of Rights enshrined in the Constitution. <b>A person's right to life </b>–<b> whether accused of a crime or not </b>–<b>
 is inalienable and does not take a back seat nor become dormant just 
because of the lack of necessary legislation to address our subhuman 
prison conditions.</b> <u>When the right to life is at stake, the Bill 
of Rights operates; making a fair and just ruling to preserve the right 
to life is not entirely dependent on some unpassed legislation that 
directs the structural improvement of our jails or allocates budget to 
improve our penal institutions</u>. It must be borne in mind that Section 4 (a) of RA 10575<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> expressly states that: 
    </p><blockquote>
      <p> Section 4. <i>The Mandates of the Bureau of Corrections.</i> - x x x</p>
      <p> (a) Safekeeping of National Inmates - The safekeeping of 
inmates shall include decent provision of quarters, food, water and 
clothing <b>in compliance with established United Nations standards</b>.
 The security of the inmates shall be undertaken by the Custodial Force 
consisting of Corrections Officers with a ranking system and salary 
grades similar to its counterpart in the [Bureau of Jail Management and 
Penology (BJMP)]. (Emphasis supplied) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> This is in accord with the State's policy expressed in Section 2 of the same law: 
    </p><blockquote>
      <p> Section 2. <i>Declaration of Policy</i>. - <b>It is the policy
 of the State to promote the general welfare and safeguard the basic 
rights of every prisoner incarcerated in our national penitentiary.</b> 
It also recognizes the responsibility of the State to strengthen 
government capability aimed towards the institutionalization of highly 
efficient and competent correctional services. </p>
      <p> Towards this end, the State shall provide for the 
modernization, professionalization and restructuring of the Bureau of 
Corrections (BuCor) by upgrading its facilities, increasing the number 
of its personnel, upgrading the level of qualifications of their 
personnel and standardizing their base pay, retirement and other 
benefits, making it at par with that of the [BJMP]. (Emphasis supplied) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> These United Nations standards pertain to the Nelson Mandela Rules issued by the UN General Assembly: 
    </p><blockquote>
      <p> The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, 
originally adopted by the First UN Congress on the Prevention of Crime 
and the Treatment of Offenders in 1955, constitute the <b>universally acknowledged minimum standards for the management of prison facilities and the treatment of prisoners</b>,
 and have been of tremendous value and influence in the development of 
prison laws, policies and practices in Member States all over the world.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p>

    <p> With the foregoing in mind, it is therefore incorrect to say 
that the Nelson Mandela Rules are absolutely not judicially enforceable 
in our jurisdiction. By authority of our laws, courts may already 
recognize the effects of our subhuman prison conditions and grant proper
 reliefs based on the circumstances of the case. To be sure, the lack of
 laws allocating budget for the structural improvement of our jails in 
order to address subhuman conditions does not mean that our courts are 
powerless to grant permissible reliefs which are grounded on the Bill of
 Rights of our Constitution. In this relation, it must be emphasized 
that when the court grants such reliefs, it does not venture in policy 
making or meddle in matters of implementation; <i><u>after all, it 
cannot compel - as petitioners do not even pray to compel - Congress to 
make laws or pass a budget for whatever purpose</u></i>. <b>Policy 
making towards improving our jail conditions is a separate and distinct 
function from adjudicating Bill of Rights concerns upon a valid claim of
 serious and critical life threats while incarcerated.</b> The former is within the province of Congress, the latter is within the Court's.

 protection of the right against cruel and unusual punishment pursuant

    <p> However, nowhere is it shown that the Framers intended to 
completely insulate the matter of subhuman jail conditions from judicial
 relief when a substantial relation to a person's right to life is 
convincingly made. <b>In my opinion, the right to life permutates to the
 prohibition against any form of cruel and unusual punishment against 
one's person. When serious and critical threats to one's life are 
adequately proven by virtue of one's conditions while incarcerated, the 
Court must fill in the void in the law and grant permissible reliefs.</b>
 Under extraordinary circumstances, temporary transfers or other 
confinement arrangements, when so proven to be practicable and 
warranted, may be therefore decreed by our courts if only to save the 
life of an accused, who is, after all, still accorded the presumption of
 innocence. Indeed, an accused cannot just be left to perish and die in 
jail in the midst of a devastating global pandemic, without any recourse
 whatsoever. At the risk of belaboring the point, the lack of laws 
addressing the subhuman conditions of our prison system does not mean 
that our courts are rendered powerless to grant permissible reliefs, 
especially to those who have yet to be finally convicted of the crimes 
they were charged with. <b>The Court's duty to protect our Bill of Rights is constant – respecting the right to life is constant.</b>
 To deny relief on the excuse that it is Congress' responsibility to 
institutionally improve our prison systems is tantamount to judicial 
abdication of this perpetual tenet. </p>
    <p> At this juncture, it is relevant to point out that the main thrust of preventive imprisonment is not to punish <b>–</b> as there is yet no penalty <b>–</b>
 but rather, to protect society from potential convicts and their 
propensity to commit further crimes. Preventive imprisonment also 
ensures that the court having jurisdiction over the case may properly 
conduct the necessary proceedings and effectuate its decision. In <i>United States v. Salerno</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>
 the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) touched upon this basic
 premise that pretrial detention does not serve as a punishment for 
dangerous individuals: 
    </p><blockquote>
      <p> Although a court could detain an arrestee who threatened to 
flee before trial, such detention would be permissible because it would 
serve the basic objective of a criminal system <b>–</b> bringing the accused to trial. x x x</p>
      <p> x x x x</p>
      <p> We conclude that the detention imposed by the Act falls on the regulatory side of the dichotomy. <b>The
 legislative history of the Bail Reform Act clearly indicates that 
Congress did not formulate the pretrial detention provisions as 
punishment for dangerous individuals. </b>x x x <b>Congress instead perceived pretrial detention as a potential solution to a pressing societal problem.</b> x x x There is no doubt that <b>preventing danger to the community is a legitimate regulatory goal</b>. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (Emphases supplied, citations omitted) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> While, as recognized above, "preventing danger to the community 
is a legitimate regulatory goal," an accused's right to life borne from 
critical subhuman conditions cannot be just sacrificed at the altar of 
police power if there are <b>practicable alternative solutions</b> to 
both ensure his or her continued detention, as well as his or her 
survival. Again, preventive imprisonment is not yet a penalty. To let an
 accused perish in jail because of<b> the</b> <b>deliberate indifference of the State</b>
 towards his or her medical conditions is even worse than a penalty 
because he or she has been effectively sentenced to death absent a final
 determination of his or her guilt. Surely, there must be some form of 
judicial relief to, at the very least, balance these various interests. 
    </p><p> The <b>deliberate indifference standard</b> is based on 
jurisprudence from the United States, where we have patterned the Bill 
of Rights of our own Constitution. As rationalized by SCOTUS, "when the 
State takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his 
will, [as in the case of prisoners,] the Constitution imposes upon it a 
corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and 
general well-being."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In the case of <i>Estelle v. Gamble</i> (<i>Estelle</i>),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>
 the SCOTUS, however, qualified that it is the State's "deliberate 
indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners [which] constitutes 
the 'unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain' x x x proscribed by the 
Eighth Amendment." In <i>Estelle</i>, it was held: 
    </p><blockquote>
      <p> <b>We therefore conclude that <u>deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners</u> constitutes the "unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain," </b>x x x <b>proscribed
 by the Eighth Amendment. This is true whether the indifference is 
manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner's needs</b> x x x <b>or by prison guards in intentionally denying or delaying access to medical care</b> x x x <b>or intentionally interfering with the treatment once prescribed.</b> x x x <b>Regardless
 of how evidenced, deliberate indifference to a prisoner's serious 
illness or injury states a cause of action under § 1983.</b></p>
      <p> x x x x</p>
      <p> x x x [<b>I</b>]<b>n the medical context, an inadvertent failure to provide adequate medical care cannot be said to constitute</b> "<b>an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain</b>" <b>or to be</b> x x x "<b>repugnant to the conscience of mankind.</b>"
 Thus, a complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or 
treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical 
mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment. Medical malpractice does not 
become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a 
prisoner. <b><u>In order to state a cognizable claim, a prisoner must 
allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate 
indifference to serious medical needs. It is only such indifference that
 can offend "evolving standards of decency" in violation of the Eighth 
Amendment</u></b>. x x x (Emphases and underscoring supplied, citations omitted) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> Since the SCOTUS's promulgation of <i>Estelle</i>, the 
"deliberate indifference" standard has been used in succeeding cases in 
order to determine whether or not a supposed inadequacy in medical care 
received by an inmate may constitute a violation of the Eighth 
Amendment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> This standard was further refined in <i>Helling v. McKinney</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (<i>Helling</i>),
 wherein the SCOTUS introduced two (2) elements that may help in 
determining whether there exists such violation, namely the objective 
and subjective factors. The existence of these factors must be proven 
with evidence showing that: (a) the prisoner was deprived of a basic 
human need or that he or she had an objectively serious medical 
condition (<i>objective factor</i>); and (b) the prison officials knew 
about the prisoner's need or condition, which they consciously 
disregarded by actions beyond mere negligence (<i>subjective factor</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>
    </p><p> To clarify, the <i>objective factor </i>should involve a determination of <b>whether
 or not the inmate is exposed to a risk which seriously and critically 
threatens his or her right to life while incarcerated</b>. As stated in <i>Helling</i>,
 such determination requires more than a scientific and statistical 
inquiry into the seriousness of the potential harm and the likelihood 
that such injury to health will actually be caused by the inmate's 
exposure to such risk. It also requires the court to assess whether 
society considers the risk that the inmate complains of to be so grave 
that it violates contemporary standards of decency to expose anyone 
unwillingly to such a risk. In other words, the prisoner must show that 
the risk of which he or she complains of is not one that today's society
 chooses to tolerate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>
    </p><p> On the other hand, the <i>subjective factor </i>should involve an inquiry of the prison authorities' attitude and conduct in dealing with the risk complained of by the inmate, <i>i.e.</i>,
 whether or not such attitude and conduct are tainted with deliberate 
indifference to the serious medical needs of the inmate. On this note, 
further US case law suggests that the existence of "deliberate 
indifference" on the part of prison authorities involves a 
"state-of-mind" inquiry on their part.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>
 Such deliberate indifference "can be evidenced by 'repeated examples of
 negligent acts which disclose a pattern of conduct by the prison 
medical staff or it can be demonstrated by '<b>proving that there are 
such systematic and gross deficiencies in staffing, facilities, 
equipment, or procedures that the inmate population is effectively 
denied access to adequate medical care</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>
    </p><p> <b>While the relief portion of the instant petition prays 
for petitioners' temporary release on recognizance or in the 
alternative, bail, petitioners also ask this Court that they be released
 through "other non-custodial measures</b>,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>
 asserting their right to life, and not to be subjected to cruel and 
unusual punishment based on the Bill of Rights of our Constitution. As 
implied by the <i>ponencia</i>'s disposition, the Court has not turned a blind eye away from these pleas that are, after all, founded on our fundamental law. <b>Thus,
 similar to the referral of petitioners' applications for 
bail/recognizance, the Court has adopted the proposal to instead, treat 
the instant petition as petitioners' motions for suitable but 
practicable confinement arrangements. In my own view, I submit that 
these motions should be adjudged according to the above-mentioned 
parameters of deliberate indifference.</b>
    </p><p> Nonetheless, it must be highlighted that in the same way 
that the Court is unequipped to make a factual determination on whether 
or not the evidence of guilt against any of the petitioners is strong, 
it is equally unequipped to make a factual determination of whether or 
not the State has breached the "deliberate indifference" standard with 
respect to the confinement conditions of each petitioner. <b>The jail 
conditions of each petitioner vis-à-vis their own medical status are 
distinct from one another and cannot be sweepingly assumed without the 
benefit of a dedicated proceeding for the purpose.</b> Hence, the Court 
cannot just yet grant petitioners any form of temporary release outside 
the traditional modes of bail or recognizance, without the benefit of a 
full-blown hearing therefor. As earlier intimated, the petition must 
therefore be referred to the respective trial courts in order for them 
to ascertain the peculiarities of each petitioner's situation and assess
 the same in accordance with the parameters stated above. Once it is 
determined that there exists a "deliberate indifference" on the part of 
the State, these courts may then accord the accused confinement 
arrangements that are logistically practicable under the given situation
 (<i>e.g.</i>, transfers to other detention facilities, directive to 
minimize capacity in the accused's jail, isolation, etc.), taking into 
account not only the side of the accused but also the submissions of the
 State, in particular, the prison officials in charge of the custody of 
the accused. This is clearly warranted, considering the averments of 
respondents that the BuCor and the BJMP have implemented various health 
policies, protocols, and measures to ensure that they will be able to 
take care of their inmates should the latter catch COVID-19, and that 
the Court, through Office of the Court Administrator Circular No. 
91-2020<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> in relation to A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>
 has already provided guidelines towards decongesting penal facilities 
and humanizing conditions of PDLs pending hearing of their cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>
 Notably, the accused may choose to assail the ruling of the trial 
courts on this score, as well as on their respective bail applications 
should they be dissatisfied, although the same must be coursed through 
the proper proceeding in accordance with our rules of procedure.
    </p><p align="center"> <b>III. Prayer for the Creation of a Prisoner Release Committee.</b>
    </p><p> Petitioners also pray for the creation of a Prisoner Release Committee<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>
 which would be tasked to urgently study and implement the release of 
all other prisoners. However, it is beyond the power of the Court to 
institute policies that are <b>not judicial in nature</b>. Unlike the 
reliefs discussed above that entail (1) the relaxation of procedural 
rules and (2) the enforcement of the Bill of Rights, this measure is 
tantamount to a directive that squarely interferes with <b>institutional administration</b>, which the Court cannot do. There is simply <b>no legal or equitable basis</b>
 for the Court to dictate the establishment of an administrative body 
that will study and implement the release of all other prisoners. While 
the Court understands the plight of petitioners in light of this 
unprecedented public health emergency, the creation of a similar 
Prisoner Release Committee is a policy matter best left to the 
discretion of the political branches of government.
    </p><p> The other permissible reliefs discussed above are, however, 
herein accorded in order to assuage petitioners' health concerns, 
subject to the trial courts' determinations through the proper findings 
of fact for the purpose.
    </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, I vote to: (<i>a</i>) <b>TREAT</b> the petition as petitioners Dionisio S. Almonte, <i>et al.</i>'s respective applications for bail and motions for other confinement arrangements as discussed in this Opinion; (<i>b</i>) <b>REFER</b>
 the bail applications and motions to the trial courts for further 
proceedings in accordance with the parameters herein stated; and (<i>c</i>) <b>DENY</b> the prayer for the creation of a Prisoner Release Committee.

      <p> <b>LEONEN, <i>J</i>.:</b>
      </p>
      <p> Our country's perennial jail congestion has made persons 
deprived of liberty all the more vulnerable to the most virulent of 
infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Thus, in view of the Petition's
 factual assertions and broad arguments, I concur with the unanimous 
decision of this Court to refer this case to the trial courts to 
determine, upon the parties' proper motion or petition, whether there 
are factual bases to support their temporary release. 
      </p><p> Nonetheless, consistent with our constitutional duty to 
recognize the intrinsic value of every human being, as well as our power
 to provide guidance to the Bench and Bar, we should clarify the 
following: 
      </p><p> First, the traditional mode of securing the release of any
 accused on trial or on appeal is through bail or recognizance. As Chief
 Justice Diosdado Peralta (Chief Justice Peralta) said, trial courts 
should conscientiously and consistently implement all of this Court's 
applicable guidelines on fixing the amount of bail to plea bargaining.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> I reiterate my opinion in <i>Enrile v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 that a release on bail or recognizance should comply with the 
Constitution, laws, and rules and regulations. Any release contrary to 
these cannot be countenanced. Thus, in seeking release on bail or 
recognizance, petitioners should go to the trial courts to determine the
 facts that would entitle them to the relief. 
      </p><p> Second, persons deprived of liberty should be able to file
 an action for violations of their constitutional right against cruel, 
inhuman, and degrading punishment, and their rights to life, health, and
 security. As proposed by Senior Associate Justice Estela Perlas-Bernabe
 (Justice Perlas-Bernabe), we should not diminish the possibility that 
they may avail of these rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 This Court is not powerless to ensure that these fundamental rights are
 respected and implemented. It is why this Court exists. This aspect of 
judicial review, to measure the constitutionality of a government act or
 inaction vis-a-vis a legal right, is even more established than the 
expanded jurisdiction now contained in Article VIII, Section 1 of the 
1987 Constitution. 
      </p><p> Thus, I opine that Article III, Section 19 of the Bill of 
Rights, which addresses the conditions of detention and service of 
sentence, may be invoked by a detainee or a convict through either mode:
 (1) a motion for release when the case is still on trial or on appeal; 
or (2) a petition for habeas corpus as a post-conviction remedy, 
consistent with <i>Gumabon v. Director of Prisons</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
        </p><p> Nonetheless, mere invocation of the violation of 
constitutional rights is not enough for the courts to afford relief. One
 must allege and provide factual basis showing: (a) the existing 
inhuman, degrading, or cruel conditions not organic or consistent with 
the statutory punishment imposed; (b) the violation of a clear, 
enforceable statutory or constitutional provision, including those which
 may refer to judicially discernable international standards adopted in 
this jurisdiction; (c) a clear demand on the relevant agencies of 
government to address the grievance; and (d) the intentional or 
persistent refusal or negligence on the part of the government 
agency—whether the warden, director of prisons, local government unit, 
or Congress—to address the proven situation and statutory or 
constitutional provisions. 
        </p><p> We should emphasize that all provisions in the Bill of 
Rights are justiciable. However, in deference to the other 
constitutional organs, a violation of the constitutional rights of 
persons deprived of liberty anchored on existing jail or health 
conditions should first be addressed by the executive and legislative 
branches. Thus, before a court may give due course to such a cause of 
action, there must be a showing that the movant or petitioner has made a
 clear demand on the relevant agencies, and that there has been a denial
 or unreasonable negligence on their part. 
        </p><p> Finally, as a distinguishing initiative of the Peralta 
Court, I suggest a measure that is grounded on social justice: a writ of
 <i>kalayaan</i>. This will be similar to the writ of <i>kalikasan</i> 
or the writ of continuing mandamus in environmental cases, but geared 
toward addressing jail congestion. It shall be issued when all the 
requirements to establish cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment are 
present. It shall also provide an order of precedence to bring the 
occupation of jails to a more humane level. Upon constant supervision by
 an executive judge, the order of release will prioritize those whose 
penalties are the lowest and whose crimes are brought about not by 
extreme malice but by the indignities of poverty. 
        </p><p> Jail congestion affects so many individuals, most of 
them poor and invisible. The dawn of the COVID-19 pandemic has made this
 a more urgent concern. It is time that we, as the Supreme Court, 
address this through the clearest guidance to our lower courts. 
        </p><p> Indeed, this case is unprecedented, for we are given the
 opportunity to define the limitations of the expanded executive power 
during a pandemic, as well as to address jail congestion—a longstanding 
problem that has pervaded our justice system. The issues involved here 
bear upon not only the role of the Judiciary, but also our collective 
humanity, as we adapt to the unique circumstances brought upon by the 
pandemic. 
        </p><p> In this case, petitioners are detainees who pray for 
their temporary release on recognizance or on bail, invoking 
humanitarian considerations on account of their advanced age and 
compromised health conditions, as well as the spread of COVID-19 in 
congested jails. They ask that their release be allowed while the 
country is in the state of public health emergency, national calamity, 
lockdown, and community quarantine. They also pray for the creation of a
 "prisoner release committee" that shall issue ground rules and 
implement the release of all those similarly situated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
        </p><p> With many of them sick, elderly, and pregnant—those most
 vulnerable to the disease—petitioners maintain that their continuing 
detention threatens their life and health. This, they assert, 
transgresses their right against cruel, degrading, and inhuman 
punishment under Article III, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
        </p><p> Petitioners likewise invoke their rights under 
international law principles and conventions, including: (1) the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; (2) the Convention
 Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment; (3) the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules);<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 (4) the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and 
Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok Rules); and (5) 
the United Nations Principles for Older Persons.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
        </p><p> Petitioners also point out that the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights has recommended the decongestion of jails 
by releasing the most vulnerable prisoners. They point out how the 
governments of Ethiopia, Sudan, Germany, Canada, India, Iran, 
Afghanistan, Turkey, Australia, and New Jersey in the United States have
 begun releasing prisoners upon acknowledging the gravity of the 
pandemic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
        </p><p> As such, petitioners pray that this Court apply equity 
in their situation. They assert that their release will not prejudice 
the State or the prosecution, and will lessen state costs and health 
risks to jail personnel. They insist that they are not flight risks, 
citing the quarantine and their advanced age, physical conditions, and 
lack of resources to avoid trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> They further point out that they are not hardened criminals, as the charges against them are due to political beliefs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> They likewise stress that they have not yet been convicted, and are thus presumed innocent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
        </p><p> Furthermore, petitioners cite the Implementing Rules and
 Regulations of Republic Act No. 10575, which states that this Court may
 order the release or transfer of any inmate, especially if not yet 
convicted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
        </p><p> Petitioners maintain prisoners' vulnerability to COVID-19.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> They point out that social distancing is impossible in jails, with some housing up to 534% capacity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> They assert that the national government has not provided adequate health measures in detention facilities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> While recognizing some measures set up in jails, they insist that these are not sufficient to prevent the disease's spread.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> They also raise mental health issues, their contact with the outside world having been more limited.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
        </p><p> Finally, petitioners assert that this Court has allowed bail on humanitarian grounds in <i>Enrile v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and <i>Dela Rama v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> after accounting for the petitioners' health conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
        </p><p> In an April 17, 2020 Resolution, this Court required 
respondents to submit their comment and their verified reports on the 
necessary interim preventive measures in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
        </p><p> For their part, respondents pray that the Petition be 
outright dismissed for petitioners' failure to comply with the doctrine 
of hierarchy of courts. They maintain that petitioners should have gone 
to the court where their criminal cases are pending.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 Moreover, respondents argue that the Petition raises questions of facts
 which only the lower courts may determine. Humanitarian grounds and the
 COVID-19 pandemic are allegedly not compelling reasons to seek direct 
recourse to this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
        </p><p> Respondents also claim that petitioners cannot be 
temporarily released on recognizance or on bail. They say recognizance 
cannot be granted as petitioners have all been charged with offenses 
punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 Specifically, petitioners are allegedly members of the Communist Party 
of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front 
(CPP-NPA-NDF), which has been identified as a terrorist organization in 
2017.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> As to bail, 
respondents point out that it is a matter of discretion which requires 
notice and hearing, in line with due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
        </p><p> Respondents maintain that petitioners cannot rely on <i>Enrile</i> because it is a <i>pro hac vice</i>
 ruling. It does not apply to petitioners who are all high-ranking 
leaders of CPP-NPA-NDF, a terrorist organization. Moreover, since 
petitioners had previously violated the terms of their provisional 
release, respondents say they are flight risks and not entitled to 
temporary release.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
        </p><p> Respondents assert that petitioners invoke preferential 
treatment. They claim that granting the Petition will violate the equal 
protection clause, there being no substantial difference between 
petitioners and the other prisoners who are also languishing in jail 
despite the threat of COVID-19.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
 They characterize the Petition as a tool of deception used by the 
CPP-NPA-NDF by taking advantage of the pandemic to justify the release 
of its high-profile members.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
        </p><p> Finally, respondents allege that the government has 
taken several health and protection measures to ensure the safety of 
persons deprived of liberty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> They assert that the Philippines is not required to follow suit with foreign governments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The provisions on release of prisoners and prison congestion, they maintain, is not one of the grounds for release.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>
        </p><p> In reply, petitioners justify their direct recourse to 
this Court because of the novel question of law brought about by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. While they admit that their medical conditions are 
questions of fact, they maintain that this Court may resolve the 
legality of releasing the elderly, sickly, and those in critical 
conditions based on humanitarian considerations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
 They allege that this Court, exercising its equity jurisdiction, may 
grant their provisional release because of the lack of speedy and 
adequate remedies in the lower courts, as with the ravaging effects of 
the COVID-19 pandemic in highly congested jail systems.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>
        </p><p> Petitioners argue that a substantial distinction exists 
for this Court to allow them provisional liberty because of their status
 as detainees yet to be convicted, their advanced ages, and existing 
medical conditions. They plead that such classification of detainees be 
applied to others similarly situated who must also be allowed temporary 
release for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>
        </p><p> Petitioners claim that respondents failed to curtail the
 spread of COVID-19 in several of its institutions, as the issue of 
physical distancing, a key measure to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak in 
prisons, remains unaddressed. Petitioners pray for this Court to take 
judicial notice of the overcrowding and subhuman conditions in 
correctional facilities in the Philippines, and to rule that prison 
systems are not equipped with medical and health care facilities to 
address the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>
        </p><p> I join this Court in referring this matter to the 
appropriate trial courts, which will determine whether there are factual
 bases to support petitioners' temporary release. In the trial courts, 
petitioners may pray for their provisional release by: (a) applying for 
bail or recognizance; or (b) filing an action for a violation of their 
constitutional rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>

        </p><p> The traditional mode of securing provisional release of an accused pending trial or appeal is through bail or recognizance. 
        </p><p> Article III, Section 13 of the 1987 Constitution provides:

        </p><p> In <i>People v. Escobar</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45] </sup>this Court explained that the right to bail is premised on the presumption of innocence: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> Bail is the security given for the temporary release of a person who has been arrested and detained but "whose guilt has<i> not</i>
 yet been proven" in court beyond reasonable doubt. The right to bail is
 cognate to the fundamental right to be presumed innocent. In <i>People v. Fitzgerald</i>: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> The right to bail emanates from the [accused's 
constitutional] right to be presumed innocent. It is accorded to a 
person in the custody of the law who may, by reason of the presumption 
of innocence he [or she] enjoys, be allowed provisional liberty upon 
filing of a security to guarantee his [or her] appearance before any 
court, as required under specified conditions. . . . (Citations omitted)
 </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> Bail may be a matter of right or judicial discretion. The 
accused has the right to bail if the offense charged is "not punishable 
by death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or life imprisonment" before 
conviction by the Regional Trial Court. However, if the accused is 
charged with an offense the penalty of which is death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, or life imprisonment — "regardless of the stage of the criminal prosecution'" — <i>and </i>when evidence of one's guilt is not strong, then the accused's prayer for bail is subject to the discretion of the trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> There are instances when posting bail is no longer required,
 but these must be provided in the law or in the Rules of Court. Rule 
114, Section 16 of the Rules of Court provides such instances:  
        </p><blockquote> When a person has been in custody for a period 
equal to or more than the possible maximum imprisonment prescribed for 
the offense charged, he shall be released immediately, without prejudice
 to the continuation of the trial or the proceedings on appeal. If the 
maximum penalty to which the accused may be sentenced is <i>destierro</i>, he shall be released after thirty (30) days of preventive imprisonment.
            <p> A person in custody for a period equal to or more than 
the minimum of the principal penalty prescribed for the offense charged,
 without application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law or any modifying 
circumstance, shall be released on a reduced bail or on his own 
recognizance, at the discretion of the court. (16a)          
        </p></blockquote>
        In 2014, this Court, through A.M. No. 12-11-2-SC, issued 
guidelines to enforce the accused's rights to bail and speedy trial to 
decongest holding jails and to humanize the conditions of detainees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Section 5 provides:

 this Court defined recognizance as a record entered in court allowing 
for the release of an accused subject to the condition that they will 
appear for trial: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Section 1, Rule 110, of the Rules of Court, provides that 
"bail is the security required and given for the release of a person who
 is in the custody of the law, that he will appear before any court in 
which his appearance may be required as stipulated in the bail bond or 
recognizance." Under this, there are two methods of taking bail: (1) by 
bail bond and (2) by recognizance. A bail bond is an obligation given by
 the accused with one or more sureties, with the condition to be void 
upon the performance by the accused of such acts as he may legally be 
required to perform. <i>A recognizance is an obligation of record,

        Under Republic Act No. 10389, or the Recognizance Act of 2012,

 Court enumerated the instances when release on recognizance is allowed 
under Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure: 
        </p><blockquote> Under Rule 114, §15 of the Rules of Court, the 
release on recognizance of any person under detention may be ordered 
only by a court and only in the following cases: (a) when the offense 
charged is for violation of an ordinance, a light felony, or a criminal 
offense, the imposable penalty for which does not exceed 6 months 
imprisonment and/or P2,000 fine, under the circumstances provided in 
R.A. No. 6036; (b) where a person has been in custody for a period equal
 to or more than the minimum of the imposable principal penalty, without
 application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law or any modifying 
circumstance, in which case the court, in its discretion, may allow his 
release on his own recognizance; (c) where the accused has applied for 
probation, pending resolution of the case but no bail was filed or the 
accused is incapable of filing one; and (d) in case of a youthful 
offender held for physical and mental examination, trial, or appeal, if 
he is unable to furnish bail and under the circumstances envisaged in 
P.D. No. 603, as amended (Art. 191).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Citation omitted) </blockquote>
        The other modes of release are reflected in the Bureau of Corrections Operating Manual, which provides the following:
        <blockquote>
          <p> SECTION 1.<i> Basis for Release of an Inmate</i>. — An inmate may be released from prison: </p>
          <ol start="" type="a"><li> upon the expiration of his sentence;</li><li> by order of the Court or of competent authority; or </li><li> after being granted parole, pardon or amnesty. </li></ol>
          <p> SECTION 2. <i>Who May Authorize Release.</i> — The following are authorized to order or approve the release of inmates: </p>
          <ol start="" type="a"><li> the Supreme Court or lower courts, in cases of acquittal or grant of bail;</li><li> the President of the Philippines, in cases of executive clemency or amnesty; </li><li> the Board of Pardons and Parole, in parole cases; and </li><li>the Director, upon the expiration of the sentence of the inmate. </li></ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Similarly, the Revised Bureau of Jail Management and 
Penology Comprehensive Operations Manual provides the modes and 
guidelines for the release of inmates. Section 31 states in part: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> SECTION 31. <i>Modes and Guidelines for Release</i>. — The following modes and guidelines shall be observed when inmates are to be released from detention: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> 1. An inmate may be released through: </p>
            <ol start="" type="a"><li> Service of sentence; </li><li>Order of the Court;</li><li> Parole;</li><li>Pardon; and </li><li>Amnesty. </li></ol>
            <p> . . . . </p>
            <p> 3. No inmate shall be released on a mere verbal order or
 an order relayed via telephone. The release of an inmate by reason of 
acquittal, dismissal of case, payment of fines and/or indemnity, or 
filing of bond, shall take effect only upon receipt of the release order
 served by the court process server. The court order shall bear the full
 name of the inmate, the crime he/she was charged with, the criminal 
case number and such other details that will enable the officer in 
charge to properly identify the inmate to be released; </p>
            <p> 4. Upon proper verification from the court of the 
authenticity of the order, an inmate shall be released promptly and 
without unreasonable delay. </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Incidentally, alternative custodial arrangements are in 
place for specific instances. Case in point, temporary leave from jail 
for serious illness is allowed; however, this leave is <i>not</i> a release on bail, but a hospitalization leave that requires court approval: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> SECTION 65. <i>Leave from Jail</i>. — Leave from jail shall be allowed in very meritorious cases, like the following: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> 1. Death or serious illness of spouse, father, mother, brother, sister, or children. </p>
            <p> 2. Inmates who are seriously ill or injured may, under 
proper escort, be allowed hospitalization leave or medical attendance. 
However, such leave shall require prior approval of the Courts having 
jurisdiction over them; </p>
            <p> Provided, however, that in life and death cases where 
immediate medical attention is imperative, the warden, at his/her own 
discretion, may allow an inmate to be hospitalized or moved out of jail 
for medical treatment; Provided further, that when the emergency has 
ceased as certified by the attending physician, the warden shall cause 
the inmate's immediate transfer back to the jail, except when there is a
 court order directing him to continue the inmates confinement in a 
hospital until his/her recovery or upon order of the Court for his/her 
immediate return to the jail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p>

trial courts. To allow the automatic release of detainees on a single 
factor, without evaluating other factors, will create a substantive 
right and predetermine an entitlement to a provisional liberty, which 
courts have no power to do.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Justice Reyes also notes that petitioners' allegations are not sufficient to justify a direct recourse to this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>
        </p><p> I agree with my colleagues that this Court cannot 
exercise its equity jurisdiction to supplant the express provisions on 
bail and recognizance. 
        </p><p> A court's exercise of equity jurisdiction often comes 
into play when special circumstances reveal an inflexibility in its 
statutory or legal jurisdiction, or an inadequacy in available laws, 
such that it is unable to render substantive justice. In <i>Reyes v. Lim</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>
        </p><blockquote> Equity jurisdiction aims to do complete justice
 in cases where a court of law is unable to adapt its judgments to the 
special circumstances of a case because of the inflexibility of its 
statutory or legal jurisdiction. Equity is the principle by which 
substantial justice may be attained in cases where the prescribed or 
customary forms of ordinary law are inadequate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Citations omitted) </blockquote>
        Equity jurisdiction finds basis in Article 9 of the Civil Code, 
which states that "[n]o judge or court shall decline to render judgment 
by reason of the silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the laws."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Essentially, equity "fills the open spaces in the law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>
        <p> This Court's equity jurisdiction has been exercised in cases
 where the absence or insufficiency of an express provision or 
procedural rule will result in unjust enrichment or prevent rightful 
restitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> It has also 
been applied where a strict application of procedural rules will 
overrule "strong considerations of substantial justice[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> In <i>Orata v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> this Court held:

of cases, in the exercise of equity jurisdiction decided to disregard 
technicalities in order to resolve the case on its merits based on the 
evidence.
            <p> Furthermore, it is well settled that litigations should,
 as much as possible, be decided on their merits and not on 
technicalities; that every party-litigant must be afforded the amplest 
opportunity for the proper and just determination of his case, free from
 unacceptable plea of technicalities. This Court has ruled further that 
being a few days late in the filing of the petition for review does not 
merit automatic dismissal thereof. And even assuming that a petition for
 review is filed a few days late, where strong considerations of 
substantial justice are manifest in the petition, this Court may relax 
the stringent application of technical rules in the exercise of its 
equity jurisdiction. In addition to the basic merits of the main case, 
such a petition usually embodies justifying circumstances which warrant 
Our heeding the petitioner's cry for justice, inspite of the earlier 
negligence of counsel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Citations omitted)         
        </p></blockquote>
        However, this Court has repeatedly clarified that equity only applies when there is an <i>absence</i> in the law. It cannot overrule, infringe, or disregard express provisions of law. In <i>Heirs of Soriano v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup>
        <blockquote> As often held by this Court, equity is available 
only in the absence of law and not as its replacement. All abstract 
arguments based only on equity should yield to positive rules, (judicial
 rules of procedure) which pre-empt and prevail over such persuasions.

assumption thereof by invoking its equity jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Citations omitted) </blockquote>

        In <i>Antioquia Development Corporation v. Rabacal</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>
        <blockquote> We stress that equity, which has been aptly 
described as "justice outside legality," is applied only in the absence

        The law has positive provisions on bail and recognizance. This 
Court cannot supplant such provisions on the sole basis of its equity 
jurisdiction. These grounds, processes, and requirements are provided 
under the Constitution, laws, and Rules of Court, and must still earn 
respect.
        <p> This is precisely why I dissented in <i>Enrile</i>. 
        </p><p align="center"> <b>I (A) </b>
        </p><p> Justice Delos Santos holds that <i>Enrile</i> does not

 Further, this Court cannot take judicial notice of their respective 
health and medical conditions. Finally, he opines that the petitioner in
 <i>Enrile</i> has proven that he was neither a danger to the community nor a flight risk. 
        </p><p> I agree that <i>Enrile</i> does not apply in this case. However, my reasons differ from those of Chief Justice Peralta and Justice Delos Santos. 
        </p><p> In <i>Enrile v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87] </sup>the petitioner, then Senator Juan Ponce Enrile (Enrile), was charged with plunder, punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.
 Later, when a warrant for his arrest was served, he proceeded to the 
Criminal Investigation and Detection Group of the Philippine National 
Police and filed a Motion to Fix Bail. He asserted that his voluntary 
surrender and age were extenuating circumstances that would lower the 
imposable penalty to <i>reclusion temporal</i>. He also argued that he was not a flight risk because of his age and physical condition. 
        </p><p> While his Motion was pending, Enrile filed a Motion for 
Detention at the Philippine National Police General Hospital or in 
another medical facility, "arguing that 'his advanced age and frail 
medical condition' merited hospital arrest."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup>
 This was granted until further orders from the Sandiganbayan. Later, 
the Sandiganbayan denied Enrile's Motion to Fix Bail for being 
premature, stating that he has not applied for bail and, thus, no bail 
hearing had been had. 
        </p><p> When the case was brought to this Court, the majority 
allowed Enrile to post bail on account of his fragile health and 
advanced age. I dissented, for several reasons. 
        </p><p> First, the laws, rules, and doctrines on bail clearly require a hearing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Contrary to Chief Justice Peralta's opinion, there was no bail hearing in <i>Enrile</i>.
 As aptly pointed out by Justice Perlas-Bernabe, the absence of a bail 
hearing was precisely why the Sandiganbayan rejected the Motion to Fix 
Bail for being premature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup>
        </p><p> Furthermore, I opined that medical conditions requiring 
special treatment should be pleaded and heard in the bail hearing, 
because: (1) these are questions of fact which must be proven and 
authenticated; and (2) the prosecution should have the right to due 
process by being given an opportunity to rebut or verify the 
allegations. In that case, Enrile's medical condition, or any other 
humanitarian reason, was not raised as a ground for bail in any of his 
pleadings. Yet, the majority still granted his bail by taking judicial 
notice of a doctor's certification. 
        </p><p> Second, I opined that bail for humanitarian 
considerations is not found in the Constitution, or in any law or rule 
of procedure. There is likewise no specific international law that 
compels the release of an accused on account of his medical condition. 
        </p><p> Thus, I discussed that the release of detainees on 
humanitarian grounds needs clear legal basis and guidelines. Otherwise, 
it will simply be based on the court's discretion—"unpredictable, 
partial, and solely grounded on the presence or absence of human 
compassion on the day that justices of this court deliberate and vote."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup>
 Thus, bail cannot be granted solely by invoking a human right 
principle. Constitutional rights apply to all, but it should not be 
upheld by disregarding or suspending the rule of law. 
        </p><p> Still, Justice Lazaro-Javier asserts that the standards applied in <i>Enrile</i> were clear-cut. She opines that <i>Enrile</i>
 provided a two-step test to authorize the grant of discretionary bail: 
"(1) the detainee will not be a flight risk or danger to the community; 
(2) there are special, humanitarian, and compelling circumstances."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>
        </p><p> I disagree. In fact, Enrile's release raised several 
questions that reveal the lack of clear guidelines: Is his release 
because of his advanced age? Is it because he suffers from medical 
conditions or because those conditions were aggravated by incarceration?
 Is it due to a medical emergency? Can the release on bail be shortened 
once the medical emergency has been addressed? What medical conditions 
allow for the release on bail? Does it apply only to those on trial for 
plunder, or to others with crimes punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> 
or life imprisonment? Does it apply only to senators or those of similar
 stature? Incidentally, these are the very questions that the Petition 
now before this Court seeks to test.
        </p><p> Third, I noted that, when hospital treatment is 
necessary, courts usually do not grant bail, but only modify the 
conditions for one's detention. The accused's release should also not be
 longer than the time needed to address the medical condition. Yet, the 
majority in <i>Enrile</i> granted bail even if the Sandiganbayan did not
 find Enrile suffering from a unique and debilitating disease. The 
majority even permitted him to undergo hospital arrest. 
        </p><p> Finally, I discussed that alternative custodial 
arrangements should not favor only wealthy, powerful, and networked 
detainees. The right to liberty applies to all individuals. Special 
privileges should be granted only under clear, transparent, and reasoned
 circumstances. The majority's grant of bail was clearly a special 
accommodation for Enrile. It lacked neutrality and impartiality as it 
found a better argument for the petitioner, at the expense of the 
prosecution. 
        </p><p> I note Chief Justice Peralta's opinion that the ruling in <i>Enrile</i> is not a <i>pro hac vice </i>ruling since <i>pro hac vice</i> rulings have been declared illegal in <i>Knights of Rizal v. DMCI Homes, Inc.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup>
 I also note Justice Lazaro-Javier's opinion that Enrile forms part of 
the law of the land as a legally binding decision, and her refusal to 
treat it as <i>pro hac vice</i> ruling to avoid the notion that this Court lays down doctrines that solely serve the powerful and privileged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup>
        </p><p> I, however, join Justices Caguioa and Perlas-Bernabe in reaffirming that <i>Enrile</i> is a <i>pro hac vice</i> ruling, applicable only to the unique considerations accorded to Enrile.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> I agree that the ruling in <i>Enrile</i> does not support the Constitution, the rules, and jurisprudence. It is a stray decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup>
 that cannot be a binding precedent, because there was no hearing to 
determine whether the evidence of his guilt was not strong. 
        </p><p> I maintain my opinion in <i>Enrile</i> here. Release on 
bail for humanitarian considerations or medical conditions is not found 
in the Constitution, in any local or international law, or in any rule 
of procedure. While petitioners enjoy the constitutional rights to life 
and health, these rights do not result in the automatic grant of bail 
for those who are of advanced age and frail health. 
        </p><p> Detainees cannot be allowed temporary release without 
following the law. If petitioners or any other detainees seek to be 
released on bail, a hearing is necessary to determine the amount of 
bail. If they are charged with a crime punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or life imprisonment, a hearing is necessary to determine whether the evidence of guilt is strong. 
        </p><p> Should a new ground for temporary release be allowed or 
an alternative custodial arrangement be provided, the rule must be clear
 as to who are qualified: What age? What medical conditions or health 
concerns? What crimes? For how long? In any case, the right to equal 
protection of the laws must always be kept in mind, so that no special 
privilege or accommodation would be extended to anyone else, as what 
happened in <i>Enrile</i>. Alternative custodial arrangements should be 
granted only under clear, transparent, and reasoned circumstances. They 
must always bow to the relevant laws and rules of procedure, subject to 
continuous review by the trial court. 
        </p><p> Thus, this Petition should be referred to the proper 
trial courts to determine whether there is basis for their release on 
bail or recognizance. Before petitioners may be released, they must 
first establish before the trial courts the facts, circumstances, and 
qualifications that will warrant their release on bail or recognizance.
        </p><p align="center"> <b>I (B)</b>
        </p><p> Justices Perlas-Bernabe and Delos Santos both hold that 
there is wisdom in depriving the accused of liberty pending trial. Their
 continued detention ensures the court's jurisdiction over them, secures
 their participation in the proceedings, and prevents them from 
committing another crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup>
        </p><p> However, Justice Delos Santos concludes that detaining 
the criminally accused pending the determination of their guilt is part 
of police power.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> I qualify his conclusion. 
        </p><p> The State's "capacity to prosecute and punish crimes" is part of its police power. In <i>Tawahig v. Hon. Lapinid</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup>
        </p><blockquote> A crime is "an offense against society." It "is a breach of the security and peace of the people at large[.]"
            <p> A criminal action, where "the State prosecutes a person 
for an act or omission punishable by law," is thus pursued "to maintain 
social order." It "punish[es] the offender in order to deter him [or 
her] and others from committing the same or similar offense, . . . 
isolate[s] him [or her] from society, reform[s] and rehabilitate[s] him 
[or her]." One who commits a crime commits an offense against all the 
citizens of the state penalizing a given act or omission: "a criminal 
offense is an outrage to the very sovereignty of the State[.]" 
Accordingly, a criminal action is prosecuted in the name of the "People"
 as plaintiff. Likewise, a representative of the State, the public 
prosecutor, "direct[s] and control[s] the prosecution of [an] offense." 
As such, a public prosecutor is:          
        </p></blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote> [T]he representative not of an ordinary party to a
 controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern 
impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and 
whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it 
shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he [or she] 
is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the 
twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.
 </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote> The <i>capacity to prosecute and punish crimes is an attribute of the State's police power</i>.
 It inheres in "the sovereign power instinctively charged by the common 
will of the members of society to look after, guard and defend the 
interests of the community, the individual and social rights and the 
liberties of every citizen and the guaranty of the exercise of his 
rights."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </blockquote>
        Police power cannot justify denying a person's right to 
provisional liberty. The Constitution provides that all persons, except 
those punished with <i>reclusion perpetua</i> whose evidence of guilt is strong, have a right to provisional liberty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> What justifies the accused's deprivation of liberty is the determination that the evidence of guilt is strong:
        <blockquote> In the present case, it is uncontroverted that petitioner's application for bail and for release on recognizance was denied. <i>The
 determination that the evidence of guilt is strong, whether ascertained
 in a hearing of an application for bail or imported from a trial 
court's judgment of conviction, justifies the detention of an accused as
 a valid curtailment of his right to provisional liberty. </i>This 
accentuates the proviso that the denial of the right to bail in such 
cases is "regardless of the stage of the criminal action." <i>Such 
justification for confinement with its underlying rationale of public 
self defense applies equally to detention prisoners like petitioner or 
convicted prisoners</i> appellants like Jalosjos. As the Court observed in <i>Alejano v. Cabuay</i>,
 it is impractical to draw a line between convicted prisoners and 
pre-trial detainees for the purpose of maintaining jail security; and <i>while
 pre-trial detainees do not forfeit their constitutional rights upon 
confinement, the fact of their detention makes their rights more limited
 than those of the public</i>. The Court was more emphatic in <i>People v. Hon. Maceda</i>: </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote> As a matter of law, when a person indicted for an offense is arrested, he is deemed placed under the custody of the law. <i>He is placed in actual restraint of liberty in jail so that he may be bound to answer for the commission of the offense</i>.
 He must be detained in jail during the pendency of the case against him
 unless he is authorized by the court to be released on bail or on 
recognizance. Let it be stressed that all prisoners whether under 
preventive detention or serving final sentence cannot practice their 
profession nor engage in any business or occupation, or hold office, 
elective or appointive, while in detention. This is a necessary 
consequence of arrest and detention. </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote> These inherent limitations, however, must be taken 
into account only to the extent that confinement restrains the power of 
locomotion or actual physical movement. It bears noting that in 
Jalosjos, which was decided <i>en banc</i> one month after Maceda, the 
Court recognized that the accused could somehow accomplish legislative 
results. The trial court thus correctly concluded that the presumption 
of innocence does not carry with it the full enjoyment of civil and 
political rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote>
        <p>Justice Delos Santos even advances the following parameters

        <p>Thus, Justice Delos Santos justifies petitioners' continued 
detention by invoking public safety. He claims that the serious nature 
of the crimes charged against them, being related to their alleged 
membership in the CPP-NPA-NDF, makes their continued confinement "a 
legitimate and vital concern of national security."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup></p>
        <p> He is ready to make a pronouncement on petitioners' 
participation as alleged key members of CPP-NPA-NDF and declare them as 
terrorists,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> albeit 
limited to determining "a reasonable link or relation between the 
assailed government measures or concerns and the legitimate objectives 
regarding general welfare in times of emergency."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup>
 From this, he infers that petitioners' continued detention is justified
 because releasing them without bail hearings would endanger national 
security.
        </p><p> I cannot find the reasonable link that Justice Delos 
Santos claims to exist between the continued detention of petitioners as
 alleged members of CPP-NPA-NDF and the State's objective of suppressing
 the pandemic. We cannot take judicial notice of the news reports of 
alleged armed attacks against the military and police distributing 
relief goods.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> Simply, these are not proper matters of judicial notice, whether mandatory or discretionary.
        </p><p> Rather, as Justice Reyes notes, this Court must refrain from making conclusions on the merits of petitioners' pending cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> as it is premature to make pronouncements based on unverified information.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup>
 Both he and Justice Lazaro-Javier share the opinion that petitioners' 
membership in the CPP-NP-NDF is an allegation that is still being 
litigated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup>
        </p><p> I echo their sentiments. There being no bail hearings, the evidence of petitioners' guilt has not yet been established. 
        </p><p> To use the nature of the alleged crimes to justify 
petitioners' continued confinement denies them not only of due process, 
but also of their right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. As 
Justice Perlas-Bernabe states, "an accused cannot just be left to perish
 and die in the midst of a devastating global pandemic, without any 
recourse whatsoever."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> National security and public safety are no blanket excuses to violate the accused's constitutional rights.
        </p><p> Thus, without the appropriate hearing in the trial 
courts, this Court should not conclude if petitioners are entitled to 
release on bail or recognizance based on the crimes charged against 
them.

        <p> In <i>Alejano v. Cabuay</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup>
 this Court defined punishment as a chastisement that causes suffering 
through harm or incapacitation that is more severe than the discomfort 
of detention:
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> An action constitutes a punishment when (1) that action 
causes the inmate to suffer some harm or "disability," and (2) the

        </blockquote>
        <p> Despite a few statutes and rules promoting the 
rehabilitation of offenders, our criminal justice system is primarily 
punitive, seeking to deter and penalize felonies and crimes through 
imprisonment and fines. Thus, the Constitution does not prohibit 
retributive justice in itself. What it prohibits is cruel, degrading, or
 inhuman punishment.
        </p><p> The previous constitutions did not include punishment 
that is "degrading or inhuman." Both the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions 
respectively read:

        <p> With the enactment of the 1987 Constitution, the words "degrading or inhuman punishment" were added to the prohibition.
        </p><p> In <i>David v. Senate Electoral Tribunal</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup>
 this Court discussed that interpreting the text of the Constitution 
involves reviewing how the text has evolved from its previous 
iterations. The formulation of provisions usually involves a 
reassessment of old ones in order to better address any shortcomings the
 old rules failed to account for:
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> Interpretation grounded on textual primacy likewise looks 
into how the text has evolved. Unless completely novel, legal provisions
 are the result of the re-adoption — often with accompanying 
re-calibration — of previously existing rules. Even when seemingly 
novel, provisions are often introduced as a means of addressing the 
inadequacies and excesses of previously existing rules. </p>
          <p> One may trace the historical development of text: by 
comparing its current iteration with prior counterpart provisions, 
keenly taking note of changes in syntax, along with accounting for more 
conspicuous substantive changes such as the addition and deletion of 
provisos or items in enumerations, shifting terminologies, the use of 
more emphatic or more moderate qualifiers, and the imposition of heavier
 penalties. The tension between consistency and change galvanizes 
meaning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> The adding of "inhuman" and "degrading" to the prohibited 
punishment reveals that these words are meant to be treated separately 
from cruel or unusual punishment, and meant to address different 
circumstances. 
        </p><p> In <i>People v. Dionisio</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup>
 this Court explained that punishment is cruel and unusual when the 
penalties imposed are inhuman, barbarous, and shocking to the 
conscience: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> Neither fines nor imprisonment constitute in themselves 
cruel and unusual punishment, for the constitutional stricture has been 
interpreted as referring to penalties that are inhuman and barbarous, or
 shocking to the conscience and fines or imprisonment are definitely not
 in this category. </p>
          <p> Nor does mere severity constitute cruel and unusual punishment. In <i>People vs. Estoista</i>, 93 Phil. 655, this Court ruled: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> "It takes more than merely being harsh, excessive, out 
of proportion, or severe for a penalty to be obnoxious to the 
Constitution. The fact that the punishment authorized by the statute is 
severe does not make it cruel and unusual.' Expressed in other terms, it
 has been held that to come under the ban, the punishment must be 
'flagrantly and plainly oppressive,' 'wholly disproportionate to the 
nature of the offense as to shock the moral sense of the community.' 
(Idem.) Having in mind the necessity for a radical measure and the 
public interest at stake, we do not believe that five years' confinement
 for possessing firearms, even as applied to appellant's and similar 
cases, can be said to be cruel and unusual, barbarous, or excessive to 
the extent of being shocking to public conscience. It is of interest to 
note that the validity on constitutional grounds of the Act in question 
was contested neither at the trial nor in the elaborate printed brief 
for the appellant; it was raised for the first time in the course of the
 oral argument in the Court of Appeals. It is also noteworthy, as 
possible gauge of popular and judicial reaction the duration of the 
imprisonment stipulated in the statute, that some members of the court 
at first expressed opposition to any recommendation for executive 
clemency for the appellant, believing that he deserved imprisonment 
within the prescribed range."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>

        <p> In <i>Maturan v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup>
 this Court reiterated that it is the punishment's character, not its 
severity, that makes it cruel and inhuman. It would have to be an 
infliction of "corporeal or psychological punishment that strips the 
individual of [their] humanity":
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> We have already settled that the constitutional 
proscription under the Bill of Rights extends only to situations of 
extreme corporeal or psychological punishment that strips the individual
 of his humanity. The proscription is aimed more at the form or 
character of the punishment rather than at its severity, as the Court 
has elucidated in <i>Lim v. People</i>, to wit: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> Settled is the rule that a punishment authorized by 
statute is not cruel, degrading or disproportionate to the nature of the
 offense unless it is flagrantly and plainly oppressive and wholly 
disproportionate to the nature of the offense as to shock the moral 
sense of the community. <b>It takes more than merely being harsh, 
excessive, out of proportion or severe for a penalty to be obnoxious to 
the Constitution. </b>Based on this principle, the Court has 
consistently overruled contentions of the defense that the penalty of 
fine or imprisonment authorized by the statute involved is cruel and 
degrading. </p>
            <p> In <i>People vs. Tongko</i>, this Court held that <b>the
 prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment is generally aimed at 
the form or character of the punishment rather than its severity in 
respect of its duration or amount, and applies to punishments which 
never existed in America or which public sentiment regards as cruel or 
obsolete. This refers, for instance, to those inflicted at the whipping 
post or in the pillory, to burning at the stake, breaking on the wheel, 
disemboweling and the like. The fact that the penalty is severe provides
 insufficient basis to declare a law unconstitutional and does not, by 
that circumstance alone, make it cruel and inhuman.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted) </p>

          <p>SECTION 5. <i>Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment</i>.
 — Other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment refers to a
 deliberate and aggravated treatment or punishment not enumerated under 
Section 4 of this Act, inflicted by a person in authority or agent of a 
person in authority against another person in custody, which attains a 
level of severity sufficient to cause suffering, gross humiliation or 
debasement to the latter. The assessment of the level of severity shall 
depend on all the circumstances of the case, including the duration of 
the treatment or punishment, its physical and mental effects and, in 
some cases, the sex, religion, age and state of health of the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment involves causing 
suffering, gross humiliation, or debasement to a person in custody. 
Torture, on the other hand, generally involves intentionally causing 
severe mental or physical agony for a specific purpose or for any reason
 based on discrimination. 
        </p><p> The right against torture and cruel, inhuman, and 
degrading punishment is absolute. It is protected in all cases—even in 
times of war or a public emergency:

punishment as criminal acts shall apply to all circumstances. A state of
 war or a threat of war, internal political instability, or any other 
public emergency, or a document or any determination comprising an 
"order of battle" shall not and can never be invoked as a justification 
for torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or 
punishment. </p>

the CHR and by agencies of government concerned such as the Department 
of Justice (DOJ), the Public Attorney's Office (PAO), the PNP, the 
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and the AFP. A prompt 
investigation shall mean a maximum period of sixty (60) working days 
from the time a complaint for torture is filed within which an 
investigation report and/or resolution shall be completed and made 
available. An appeal whenever available shall be resolved within the 
same period prescribed herein; </p>
            <p> (b) To have sufficient government protection against all
 forms of harassment, threat and/or intimidation as a consequence of the
 filing of said complaint or the presentation of evidence therefor. In 
which case, the State through its appropriate agencies shall afford 
security in order to ensure his/her safety and all other persons

other cruel, degrading and inhuman treatment or punishment shall be 
disposed of expeditiously and any order of release by virtue thereof, or
 other appropriate order of a court relative thereto, shall be executed

        <p> In <i>Secretary of National Defense v. Manalo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup>
 this Court granted the first petition for a writ of amparo, recognizing
 the right to life, liberty, and security of victims of enforced 
disappearances. It clarified that the right to life is not only a 
guarantee of the right to live, but to <i>live securely</i>, assured that the State will protect the security of one's life and property: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> <i>While the right to life under Article III, Section 1 guarantees essentially the right to be alive</i>
 — upon which the enjoyment of all other rights is preconditioned — the 
right to security of person is a guarantee of the secure quality of this
 life, viz.: "The life to which each person has a right is not a life 
lived in fear that his person and property may be unreasonably violated 
by a powerful ruler. <i>Rather, it is a life lived with the assurance 
that the government he established and consented to, will protect the 
security of his person and property.</i> The ideal of security in life 
and property. . . pervades the whole history of man. It touches every 
aspect of man's existence." In a broad sense, <i>the right to security 
of person "emanates in a person's legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of 
his life, his limbs, his body, his health, and his reputation</i>. It 
includes the right to exist, and the right to enjoyment of life while 
existing, and it is invaded not only by a deprivation of life but also 
of those things which are necessary to the enjoyment of life according 
to the nature, temperament, and lawful desires of the individual."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> In the same case, this Court expounded that the right to 
security, as an adjunct of the right to life, is broken down to its 
essential components: (1) freedom from fear; (2) guarantee of "bodily 
and psychological integrity or security"; and (3) government protection 
of rights: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> A closer look at the right to security of person would yield various permutations of the exercise of this right. </p>
          <p> <i>First, the right to security of person is "freedom from fear"</i>.
 In its "whereas" clauses, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(UDHR) enunciates that "a world in which human beings shall enjoy 
freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been 
proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people." Some 
scholars postulate that "freedom from fear" is not only an aspirational 
principle, but essentially an individual international human right. <i>It is the "right to security of person" as the word "security" itself means "freedom from fear"</i>. Article 3 of the UDHR provides, viz.: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> In furtherance of this right declared in the UDHR, Article
 9 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR) also provides for the right to security of person, viz.: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> 1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of 
person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No 
one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in 
accordance with such procedure as are established by law. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> The Philippines is a signatory to both the UDHR and the ICCPR. </p>
          <p> . . . . </p>
          <p> <i>Second, the right to security of person is a guarantee of bodily and psychological integrity or security</i>.
 Article III, Section II of the 1987 Constitution guarantees that, as a 
general rule, one's body cannot be searched or invaded without a search 
warrant. Physical injuries inflicted in the context of extralegal 
killings and enforced disappearances constitute more than a search or 
invasion of the body. It may constitute dismemberment, physical 
disabilities, and painful physical intrusion. As the degree of physical 
injury increases, the danger to life itself escalates. Notably, in 
criminal law, physical injuries constitute a crime against persons 
because they are an affront to the bodily integrity or security of a 
person. </p>
          <p> <i>Physical torture, force, and violence are a severe 
invasion of bodily integrity. When employed to vitiate the free will 
such as to force the victim to admit, reveal or fabricate incriminating 
information, it constitutes an invasion of both bodily and psychological
 integrity as the dignity of the human person includes the exercise of 
free will.</i> Article III, Section 12 of the 1987 Constitution more specifically proscribes bodily and psychological invasion, viz.: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> (2) No torture, force, violence, threat or intimidation,
 or any other means which vitiate the free will shall be used against 
him (any person under investigation for the commission of an offense). 
Secret detention places, solitary, incommunicado or other similar forms 
of detention are prohibited. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> Parenthetically, under this provision, threat and 
intimidation that vitiate the free will—although not involving invasion
 of bodily integrity—nevertheless constitute a violation of the right 
to security in the sense of "freedom from threat" as afore-discussed. </p>
          <p> Article III, Section 12 guarantees freedom from 
dehumanizing abuses of persons under investigation for the commission of
 an offense. Victims of enforced disappearances who are not even under 
such investigation should all the more be protected from these 
degradations. </p>
          <p> An overture to an interpretation of the right to security 
of person as a right against torture was made by the European Court of 
Human Rights (ECHR) in the recent case of Popov v. Russia. In this case,
 the claimant, who was lawfully detained, alleged that the state 
authorities had physically abused him in prison, thereby violating his 
right to security of person. Article 5(1) of the European Convention on 
Human Rights provides, viz.: "Everyone has the right to liberty and 
security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the 
following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law 
..." (emphases supplied) Article 3, on the other hand, provides that 
"(n)o one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment." Although the application failed on the facts 
as the alleged ill-treatment was found baseless, the ECHR relied heavily
 on the concept of security in holding, viz.: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> . . . the applicant did not bring his allegations to the
 attention of domestic authorities at the time when they could 
reasonably have been expected to take measures in order to ensure his 
security and to investigate the circumstances in question. </p>
            <p> . . . . </p>
            <p> . . . the authorities failed to ensure his security in 
custody or to comply with the procedural obligation under Art. 3 to 
conduct an effective investigation into his allegations. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> The U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women has also made a statement that the protection of the 
bodily integrity of women may also be related to the right to security 
and liberty, viz.: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> . . . gender-based violence which impairs or nullifies 
the enjoyment by women of human rights and fundamental freedoms under 
general international law or under specific human rights conventions is 
discrimination within the meaning of article 1 of the Convention (on the
 Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women). These rights
 and freedoms include . . . the right to liberty and security of person.
 </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> <i>Third, the right to security of person is a guarantee of protection of one's rights by the government</i>.
 In the context of the writ of amparo, this right is built into the 
guarantees of the right to life and liberty under Article III, Section 1
 of the 1987 Constitution and the right to security of person (as 
freedom from threat and guarantee of bodily and psychological integrity)
 under Article III, Section 2. The right to security of person in this 
third sense is a corollary of the policy that the State "guarantees full
 respect for human rights" under Article II, Section 11 of the 1987 
Constitution. As the government is the chief guarantor of order and 
security, the Constitutional guarantee of the rights to life, liberty 
and security of person is rendered ineffective if government does not 
afford protection to these rights especially when they are under threat.
 Protection includes conducting effective investigations, organization 
of the government apparatus to extend protection to victims of 
extralegal killings or enforced disappearances (or threats thereof) 
and/or their families, and bringing offenders to the bar of justice. The
 Inter-American Court of Human Rights stressed the importance of 
investigation in the <i>Velasquez Rodriguez Case</i>, viz.: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> (The duty to investigate) must be undertaken in a 
serious manner and not as a mere formality preordained to be 
ineffective. An investigation must have an objective and be assumed by 
the State as its own legal duty, not as a step taken by private 
interests that depends upon the initiative of the victim or his family 
or upon their offer of proof, without an effective search for the truth 
by the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </p>

        <p> In his separate opinion in <i>People v. Echegaray</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> Justice Artemio V. Panganiban discussed that the right to life includes the right to enjoy it with dignity and honor: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> So too, all our previous Constitutions, including the 
first one ordained at Malolos, guarantee that "(n)o person shall be 
deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law." This 
primary right of the people to enjoy life — life at its fullest, life in
 dignity and honor — is not only reiterated by the 1987 Charter but is 
in fact fortified by its other pro-life and pro-human rights provisions.
 <i>Hence, the Constitution values the dignity of every human person and
 guarantees full respect for human rights, expressly prohibits any form 
of torture which is arguably a lesser penalty than death</i>, emphasizes
 the individual right to life by giving protection to the life of the 
mother and the unborn from the moment of conception and establishes the 
people's rights to health, a balanced ecology and education. </p>
          <p> This Constitutional explosion of concern for man more than
 property, for people more than the state, and for life more than mere 
existence augurs well for the strict application of the constitutional 
limits against the revival of death penalty as the final and 
irreversible exaction of society against its perceived enemies. </p>
          <p> Indeed, volumes have been written about individual rights 
to free speech, assembly and even religion. But the most basic and most 
important of these rights is the right to life. Without life, the other 
rights cease in their enjoyment, utility and expression.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> An essential component of the right to life, and equally fundamental, is the right to health. In <i>Spouses Imbong v. Ochoa, Jr.</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup>
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> A component to the right to life is the constitutional 
right to health. In this regard, the Constitution is replete with 
provisions protecting and promoting the right to health. </p>
          <p> Section 15, Article II of the Constitution provides: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> Section 15. The State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> A portion of Article XIII also specifically provides for the States' duty to provide for the health of the people, viz.: </p>
          <p align="center">HEALTH</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Section 11. The State shall adopt an integrated and 
comprehensive approach to health development which shall endeavor to 
make essential goods, health and other social services available to all 
the people at affordable cost. There shall be priority for the needs of 
the underprivileged, sick, elderly, disabled, women, and children. The 
State shall endeavor to provide free medical care to paupers. </p>
            
            <p> Section 12. The State shall establish and maintain an 
effective food and drug regulatory system and undertake appropriate 
health, manpower development, and research, responsive to the country's 
health needs and problems. </p>
            <p> Section 13. The State shall establish a special agency 
for disabled persons for their rehabilitation, self-development, and 
self-reliance, and their integration into the mainstream of society.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p> The right to life and the right to health are guaranteed in 
our international laws. Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human
 Rights provides that everyone has a right to health, well-being, and 
medical care: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> (1) <i>Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself</i>
 and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care 
and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of
 unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of
 livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. </p>
          <p> (2) Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care 
and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall 
enjoy the same social protection. (Emphasis supplied) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> The International Covenant on Economic and Social and 
Cultural Rights also provides that everyone has the right to attain the 
highest standard of physical and mental health. To this end, state 
parties shall undertake all measures to prevent, treat, and control 
epidemics. Article 12 states: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> Article 12 </p>
          <p> 1. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize 
the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health. </p>
          <p> 2. The steps to be taken by the States Parties to the 
present Covenant to achieve the full realization of this right shall 
include those necessary for: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> (a) The provision for the reduction of the 
stillbirth-rate and of infant mortality and for the healthy development 
of the child; </p>
            <p> (b) The improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene; </p>
            <p> (c) <i>The prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases</i>; </p>
            <p> (d) The creation of conditions which would assure to all
 medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness.

        These rights—the right against torture, cruel, degrading, and 
inhuman punishment; and the rights to life and health—are all anchored 
on the State's policy to value human dignity and to guarantee full 
respect for human rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup>
        
        <p> Reiterating the State's policy, the Anti-Torture Act<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> extends these rights to all persons, including those detained, jailed, imprisoned, or held under custody: 
        </p><blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            <p> (a) To value the dignity of every human person and guarantee full respect for human rights; </p>
            <p> (b) To ensure that the human rights of all persons, 
including suspects, detainees and prisoners are respected at all times; 
and that no person placed under investigation or held in custody of any 
person in authority or, agent of a person in authority shall be 
subjected to physical, psychological or mental harm, force, violence, 
threat or intimidation or any act that impairs his/her free will or in 
any manner demeans or degrades human dignity; </p>
            <p> (c) To ensure that secret detention places, solitary, <i>incommunicado</i> or other similar forms of detention, where torture may be carried out with impunity, are prohibited; and </p>
            <p> (d) To fully adhere to the principles and standards on 
the absolute condemnation and prohibition of torture as provided for in 
the 1987 Philippine Constitution; various international instruments to 
which the Philippines is a State party such as, but not limited to, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the

        <p> This State policy is likewise found in the laws and rules 
governing the two (2) agencies tasked with the safekeeping and 
reformation of inmates and detainees: (1) the Bureau of Corrections; and
 (2) the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology. 
        </p><p> Created under Republic Act No. 10575, the Bureau of 
Corrections is in charge of safekeeping and instituting reformation 
programs to national inmates sentenced to more than three years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup>

Justice, which has supervisory powers over its regulatory and 
quasi-judicial functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup>
        </p><p> Section 2 of the law declares that every prisoner's basic rights should be safeguarded and their general welfare promoted:

policy of the State to promote the general welfare and safeguard the 
basic rights of every prisoner incarcerated in our national 
penitentiary. It also recognizes the responsibility of the State to 
strengthen government capability aimed towards the institutionalization 
of highly efficient and competent correctional services. </p>
          <p> Towards this end, the State shall provide for the 
modernization, professionalization and restructuring of the Bureau of 
Corrections (BuCor) by upgrading its facilities, increasing the number 
of its personnel, upgrading the level of qualifications of their 
personnel and standardizing their base pay, retirement and other 
benefits, making it at par with that of the Bureau of Jail Management 
and Penology (BJMP). </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Under Section 3 of the law, the Bureau of Corrections is duty
 bound to provide the inmates' basic needs and to take measures for 
their reformation and reintegration into society: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> SECTION 3. <i>Definition of Terms</i>. — </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> (a) <i>Safekeeping</i>, which is the custodial component
 of the BuCors present corrections system, shall refer to the act that 
ensures the public (including families of inmates and their victims) 
that national inmates are provided with their basic needs, completely 
incapacitated from further committing criminal acts, and have been 
totally cut off from their criminal networks (or contacts in the free 
society) while serving sentence inside the premises of the national 
penitentiary. This act also includes protection against illegal 
organized armed groups which have the capacity of launching an attack on
 any prison camp of the national penitentiary to rescue their convicted 
comrade or to forcibly amass firearms issued to prison guards. </p>
            <p> (b) <i>Reformation</i>, which is the rehabilitation 
component of the BuCor's present corrections system, shall refer to the 
acts which ensure the public (including families of inmates and their 
victims) that released national inmates are no longer harmful to the 
community by becoming reformed individuals prepared to live a normal and
 productive life upon reintegration to the mainstream society. </p>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p> As provided in Section 4, the inmates' basic needs include 
"decent provision of quarters, food, water and clothing in compliance 
with established United Nations standards." The Bureau of Corrections 
shall likewise institute several reformation programs, as follows: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> SECTION 4. <i>The Mandates of the Bureau of Corrections</i>.
 — The BuCor shall be in charge of safekeeping and instituting

 [are] those rules which derive from principles that the legal

 the international community."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup>
        </p><p> These definitions have been incorporated in <i>Bayan Muna v. Romulo</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup>
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> "The term '<i>jus cogens</i>' means the 'compelling law.'" Corollary, "a<em> jus cogens</em> norm holds the highest hierarchical position among all other customary norms and principles." As a result, <i>jus cogens</i> norms are deemed "peremptory and non-derogable."When applied to international crimes, "<i>jus cogens</i>
 crimes have been deemed so fundamental to the existence of a just 
international legal order that states cannot derogate from them, even by
 agreement." </p>
          <p> These <i>jus cogens</i> crimes relate to the principle of 
universal jurisdiction, i.e., "any state may exercise jurisdiction over 
an individual who commits certain heinous and widely condemned offenses,
 even when no other recognized basis for jurisdiction exists." "The 
rationale behind this principle is that the crime committed is so 
egregious that it is considered to be committed against all members of 
the international community" and thus granting every State jurisdiction 
over the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Among the fundamental rights established as <i>jus cogens</i> are the right to life and the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup>
 These non-derogable international customary norms have been reiterated 
in several conventions that the Philippines signed and ratified, as 
previously discussed. 
        </p><p> In any case, the non-derogable international laws are 
not the only rules governing the international community. For instance, a
 treaty creating the World Trade Organization, or a Security Council 
Resolution defining a terrorist organization, are non-peremptory in that
 accession is optional; yet, they still have significant effects on the 
international community. As elegantly captured in Justice Antonio 
Carpio's dissent in <i>Bayan Muna</i>: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> Some customary international laws have been affirmed and 
embodied in treaties and conventions. A treaty constitutes evidence of 
customary law if it is declaratory of customary law, or if it is 
intended to codify customary law. In such a case, even a State not party
 to the treaty would be bound thereby. A treaty which is merely a formal
 expression of customary international law is enforceable on all States 
because of their membership in the family of nations. For instance, the 
Vienna Convention on Consular Relations is binding even on non-party 
States because the provisions of the Convention are mostly codified 
rules of customary international law binding on all States even before 
their codification into the Vienna Convention. Another example is the 
Law of the Sea, which consists mostly of codified rules of customary 
international law, which have been universally observed even before the 
Law of the Sea was ratified by participating States. </p>
          <p> Corollarily, treaties may become the basis of customary 
international law. While States which are not parties to treaties or 
international agreements are not bound thereby, such agreements, if 
widely accepted for years by many States, may transform into customary 
international laws, in which case, they bind even non-signatory States.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Therefore, the Nelson Mandela Rules and its precedent, the 
United Nations Minimum Standard on the Treatment of Prisoners, cannot 
simply be disregarded as non-binding norms. The principles and 
fundamental rights on which these declarations are based—the right to 
life, the prohibition of torture, and the prohibition of cruel and 
unusual punishment—have attained a <i>jus cogens</i> status. These Rules have been adhered to and transformed into local legislation and incorporated in our penal institutions. 
        </p><p> To view a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly as not being <i>jus cogens</i>,
 only being recommendatory, is limited. It fails to consider that a 
resolution of the United Nations General Assembly may be any of the 
following: (1) an articulation of a customary international norm; (2) a 
reiteration of existing treaty obligations; (3) a reflection of emerging
 international norms and standards, or commonly referred to as "soft 
law"; or (4) a binding source of obligation that is judicially 
enforceable once acceded to by a member state. 
        </p><p> <i>First</i>, the Nelson Mandela Rules articulates 
customary international norms on the treatment of prisoners. These are 
based on one's fundamental dignity, including those under confinement. 
These are codified into several declarations and conventions that the 
Philippines have ratified. 
        </p><p> In <i>Razon v. Tagitis</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup>
 this Court recognized "resolutions relating to legal questions in the 
[United Nations] General Assembly" as material sources of international 
customs: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> The most widely accepted statement of sources of 
international law today is Article 38 (1) of the Statute of the 
International Court of Justice, which provides that the Court shall 
apply "international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted 
as law." The material sources of custom include State practice, State 
legislation, international and national judicial decisions, recitals in 
treaties and other international instruments, a pattern of treaties in 
the same form, the practice of international organs, and resolutions 
relating to legal questions in the UN General Assembly. Sometimes 
referred to as "evidence" of international law, these sources identify 
the substance and content of the obligations of States and are 
indicative of the "State practice" and "<i>opinio juris</i>" requirements of international law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> It is erroneous to dismiss the Nelson Mandela Rules just 
because the United Nations General Assembly resolutions are only 
recommendatory. The preambulatory clauses of Resolution No. 70/175,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup>
 which adopted the Nelson Mandela Rules, state that the precedent United
 Nations Minimum Standard on the Treatment of Prisoners has already

 the detention of prisoners and that they have been of significant value
 and influence."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup>
        </p><p> <i>Second</i>, a resolution of the United Nations

international norms and standards, or commonly referred to as "soft

"significant normative reference for national legislators, courts, 
correctional administrators, and advocates on a range of prison 
conditions issues."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup>
        </p><p> In <i>Pharmaceutical and Health Care Association of the Philippines v. Duque III</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> this Court held that a "soft law," while not necessarily binding, has great political influence: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> "Soft law" does not fall into any of the categories of 
international law set forth in Article 38, Chapter III of the 1946 
Statute of the International Court of Justice. It is, however, an 
expression of non-binding norms, principles, and practices that 
influence state behavior. Certain declarations and resolutions of the UN
 General Assembly fall under this category. The most notable is the UN 
Declaration of Human Rights, which this Court has enforced in various 
cases, specifically, <i>Government of Hongkong Special Administrative 
Region v. Olalia, Mejoff v. Director of Prisons, Mijares v. Rañada and 
Shangri-la International Hotel Management, Ltd. v. Developers Group of 
Companies, Inc</i>. </p>
          <p> The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a 
specialized agency attached to the UN with the mandate to promote and 
protect intellectual property worldwide, has resorted to soft law as a 
rapid means of norm creation, in order "to reflect and respond to the 
changing needs and demands of its constituents."' Other international 
organizations which have resorted to soft law include the International 
Labor Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization (in the 
form of the <i>Codex Alimentarius</i>). </p>
          <p> WHO has resorted to soft law. This was most evident at the
 time of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Avian flu 
outbreaks. </p>
          <p> Although the IHR Resolution does not create new 
international law binding on WHO member states, it provides an excellent
 example of the power of "soft law" in international relations. 
International lawyers typically distinguish binding rules of 
international law-"hard law"-from non-binding norms, principles, and 
practices that influence state behavior-"soft law." WHO has during its 
existence generated many soft law norms, creating a "soft law regime" in
 international governance for public health. </p>
          <p> The "soft law" SARS and IHR Resolutions represent 
significant steps in laying the political groundwork for improved 
international cooperation on infectious diseases. These resolutions 
clearly define WHO member states' normative duty to cooperate fully with
 other countries and with WHO in connection with infectious disease 
surveillance and response to outbreaks. </p>
          <p> This duty is neither binding nor enforceable, but, in the 
wake of the SARS epidemic, the duty is powerful politically for two 
reasons. First, the SARS outbreak has taught the lesson that 
participating in, and enhancing, international cooperation on infectious
 disease controls is in a country's self interest . . . if this warning 
is heeded, the "soft law" in the SARS and IHR Resolution could inform 
the development of general and consistent state practice on infectious 
disease surveillance and outbreak response, perhaps crystallizing 
eventually into customary international law on infectious disease 
prevention and control.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>

The BuCor shall be in charge of safekeeping and instituting reformation 
programs to national inmates sentenced to more than three (3) years. </p>

The BuCor shall operate with a directorial structure. It shall undertake
 reception of inmates through its Directorate for Reception and 
Diagnostics (DRD), formerly Reception and Diagnostic Center (RDC), 
provide basic needs and security through its Security and Operations 
Directorates, administer reformation programs through its Reformation 
Directorates, and prepare inmates for reintegration to mainstream 
society through its Directorate for External Relations (DER), formerly

classification (i.e., maximum, medium and minimum security risk), 
inmates shall also be internally classified by the DRD and segregated

        </p><p> I disagree. This Court has the power to compel the Bureau of Corrections to implement Section 4 of Republic Act No. 10575. 
        </p><p> Judicial action on the enforcement of a law is based on a
 cause of action, which is "the act or omission by which a party 
violates the right of another."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> Article VIII, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution states: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> SECTION 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law. </p>
          <p> Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving <i>rights which are legally demandable and enforceable</i>,
 and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of 
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of 
any branch or instrumentality of the Government. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> What determines judicial power is the existence of one's 
right and its violation by another person or entity. This power is not 
restricted by the vagueness of the words used in the law, or the absence
 of parameters as to what constitutes a violation of the right. 
        </p><p> Regardless, Section 4 of Republic Act No. 10575 clearly 
creates a right and indicates the standards by which that right is 
fleshed out. Petitioners assert a violation of that right. There is, 
thus, a cause of action that calls for the exercise of judicial power. 
        </p><p> I oppose creating a distinction between self-executing 
provisions and not self-executing provisions in statutes. I had 
previously maintained that this should not be made in any of the 
constitutional provisions, as it "creates false second-order 
constitutional provisions":
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> I do not agree, however, in making distinctions between self-executing and non-self-executing provisions. </p>
          <p> A self-executing provision of the Constitution is one 
"complete in itself and becomes operative without the aid of 
supplementary or enabling legislation." It "supplies [a] sufficient rule
 by means of which the right it grants may be enjoyed or protected." "[ 
I]f the nature and extent of the right conferred and the liability 
imposed are fixed by the constitution itself, so that they can be 
determined by an examination and construction of its terms, and there is
 no language indicating that the subject is referred to the legislature 
for action," the provision is self-executing. </p>
          <p> On the other hand, if the provision "lays down a general 
principle," or an enabling legislation is needed to implement the 
provision, it is not self-executing. </p>
          <p> To my mind, the distinction creates false second-order 
constitutional provisions. It gives the impression that only 
self-executing provisions are imperative. </p>
          <p> All constitutional provisions, even those providing 
general standards, must be followed. Statements of general principles 
and policies in the Constitution are frameworks within which branches of
 the government are to operate. The key is to examine if the provision 
contains a prestation and to which branch of the government it is 
directed. If addressed either to the legislature or the executive, the 
obligation is not for this Court to fulfill. </p>
          <p> . . . . </p>
          <p> There are no second-order provisions in the Constitution. 
We create this category when we classify the provisions as 
"self-executing" and "non-self executing." Rather, the value of each 
provision is implicit in their normative content.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> The same can be said of all statutes. Mandatory provisions 
should be deemed as imperative, and their authoritative or operative 
effect should not be diminished on account of their "vagueness" or the 
lack of parameters. It cannot be assumed that a statute is not meant to 
be complied with. To do so is to nullify the mandatory language of the 
provision and render legislative power useless. 
        </p><p> Compliance with legal provisions cannot solely depend on
 the presence of specific implementing rules and regulations. Justice 
Delos Santos recognized this himself when he discussed that the 
implementing rules and regulations—containing matters related to the 
standards under the Nelson Mandela Rules—is subordinate legislation, 
which is not a source of substantive rights and obligations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup>
        </p><p> As Justice Lazaro-Javier says, laws that use general 
terms, like the Nelson Mandela Rules, do not make them any less 
judicially enforceable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup> 
Even if a certain law lacks a degree of specificity, the executive 
branch must still comply with its mandate. Similarly, courts should not 
shy away from interpreting what constitutes compliance with the law 
using the rules on statutory construction. Courts are not meant to 
create new parameters, but to interpret statutes. We can neither shirk 
from this duty nor excuse the other government branches' failure to 
comply with their legal mandates. 
        </p><p> I also agree with Justice Lazaro-Javier's position that 
budgetary restrictions, while it may be a factor in implementation, do 
not determine the existence and enforceability of a right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup>
 As she aptly points, this Court should not be restricted by the State's
 budget concerns in determining the existence and enforcement of a 
right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[189]</sup>
        </p><p> It is not the Nelson Mandela Rules as written that 
should be in focus. What is relevant are the founding principles of 
international law on which the Nelson Mandela Rules are based. The first
 sentence of the Nelson Mandela Rules' preambulatory clause states that 
in its adoption, the United Nations General Assembly was guided by the 
"fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person,
 without distinction of any kind."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[190]</sup>
 These fundamental human rights include the right to life and the 
prohibition against torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading 
punishment, both of which are anchored on one's inherent dignity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[191]</sup>
        </p><p> These principles are affirmed by the 1987 Constitution as a State policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[192]</sup>
 Thus, persons deprived of liberty must be treated with humanity and 
with respect for their inherent dignity. Furthermore, "provisions on the
 right to life, prohibition from torture, inhuman and degrading 
treatment, and slavery remain free from any derogation whatsoever, 
having acquired a <i>jus cogens</i> character."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[193]</sup>
        </p><p> More important, the Philippines' compliance with the 
United Nations standards should be assessed based on how the country 
understood the implications of adherence to these standards. This is 
done by examining the texts of applicable local legislations and 
administrative issuances of penal institutions. These local and 
international rules and standards operationalize the State's duty on the
 safekeeping of its prisoners and affirm how the inherent dignity of a 
person is to be valued, even when deprived of liberty. 
        </p><p> As discussed at length earlier, our local laws and the 
international standards we have adhered to reveal that while our 
prisoners and detainees' right to liberty is restricted, their right to 
be treated humanely, including their right to reasonably safe, sanitary,
 and sufficient provisions and facilities, is not suspended and is not 
merely recommendatory. Thus, no extraordinary circumstance, not even the
 global COVID-19 pandemic, can justify actions violating these 
fundamental rights. 
        </p><p align="center"> <b>IV</b>
        </p><p> Considering the various sources of rights of persons 
deprived of liberty, incarcerated individuals may file an appropriate 
action based on a violation of these rights. 
        </p><p> Violations of the constitutional right against cruel, 
degrading, and inhuman punishment, the rights to life and health, the 
rights of prisoners and detainees under international law principles and
 conventions, and our own local laws, rules, and procedures are 
justiciable matters. 
        </p><p> I agree with Justice Perlas-Bernabe that we should not 
diminish the possibility that persons deprived of liberty may avail of 
their rights as listed in the Bill of Rights, including their right to 
be protected against cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[194]</sup>
        </p><p> Under Article VIII, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution, 
courts are given judicial power "to settle actual controversies 
involving <i>rights which are legally demandable and enforceable</i>, 
and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of 
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of 
any branch or instrumentality of the Government."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[195]</sup>
        </p><p> The Bill of Rights is an enumeration of rights that are <i>legally demandable and enforceable</i>.
 Courts will hear and decide cases involving violations of these rights,
 or any statute providing standards to comply with these rights. This 
aspect of judicial review, to measure the constitutionality of a 
government act or inaction vis-a-vis an enumeration of an individual or 
group right, is even more established than the expanded jurisdiction now
 contained in Article VIII, Section 1. 
        </p><p> Thus, with respect to actual controversies involving 
violations of fundamental constitutional rights, this Court is not 
powerless to ensure its respect and implementation. It is precisely why 
this Court exists. 
        </p><p> I thus disagree with Justice Delos Santos' statement 
that "only Congress has the constitutional power to address subhuman 
conditions that plague our penal institutions."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[196]</sup>
 He would have this Court "defer to the political branches as regards 
the matter of selecting the most appropriate strategy to maintain public
 order and preserve public safety."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[197]</sup> Such position reduces the Judiciary's role in relation to the Constitution, especially the Bill of Rights.
        </p><p> First, petitioners' cause of action calls for this 
Court's interpretation of constitutional text. When this Court 
interprets the Constitution and fleshes out its text, its decisions form
 part of the law of the land. The Judiciary's constitutional 
interpretations are guided not only by the Constitution itself, but by 
precedents that have construed the text and articulated its intent 
through particular circumstances. In <i>David v. Senate Electoral Tribunal</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[198]</sup>
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> Reading a certain text includes a consideration of 
jurisprudence that has previously considered that exact same text, if 
any. Our legal system is founded on the basic principle that "[j]udicial
 decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution shall 
form part of [our] legal system." Jurisprudence is not an independent 
source of law. Nevertheless, judicial interpretation is deemed part of 
or written into the text itself as of the date that it was originally 
passed. This is because judicial construction articulates the 
contemporaneous intent that the text brings to effect. Nevertheless, one
 must not fall into the temptation of considering prior interpretation 
as immutable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[199]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Since petitioners anchor their cause of action on their 
constitutionally protected rights, courts have the power to settle the 
controversy, and to articulate and apply what the Constitution, 
statutes, and rules and regulations provide in relation to the right. 
        </p><p> Furthermore, the vagueness of the Bill of Rights' 
provisions does not detract from their enforceability. In fact, they 
were written so to leave room for future instances that can shed further
 light on how the provisions are to be interpreted. The Constitution is 
not meant to pertain to a specific moment that would restrict its 
application to a limited set of facts. Rather, it is meant to 
encapsulate circumstances that may go beyond what was initially imagined
 by its framers. Thus, when faced with a justiciable controversy, the 
Judiciary has the power to define what constitutes a violation of these 
provisions.
        </p><p> In <i>J. M. Tuason &amp; Company, Inc. v. Land Tenure Administration</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[200]</sup>
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> It could thus be said of our Constitution as of the United
 States Constitution, to borrow from Chief Justice Marshall's 
pronouncement in <i>M'Culloch v. Maryland</i> that it is "intended to 
endure for ages to come and consequently, to be adapted to the various 
crisis of human affairs." It cannot be looked upon as other than, in the
 language of another American jurist, Chief Justice Stone, "a continuing
 instrument of government." Its framers were not visionaries, toying 
with speculations or theories, but men of affairs, at home in 
statecraft, laying down the foundations of a government which can make 
effective and operative all the powers conferred or assumed, with the 
corresponding restrictions to secure individual rights and, 
anticipating, subject to the limitations of human foresight, the 
problems that events to come in the distant days ahead will bring. Thus a
 constitution, to quote from Justice Cardozo, "states or ought to state 
not rules for the passing hour, but principles for an expanding future."
 </p>
          <p> To that primordial intent, all else is subordinated. Our 
Constitution, any constitution, is not to be construed narrowly or 
pedantically, for the prescriptions therein contained, to paraphrase 
Justice Holmes, are not mathematical formulas having their essence in 
their form, but are organic living institutions, the significance of 
which is vital nor formal. There must be an awareness, as with Justice 
Brandeis, not only of what has been, but of what may be. The words 
employed by it are not to be construed to yield fixed and rigid answers 
but as impressed with the necessary attributes of flexibility and 
accommodation to enable them to meet adequately whatever problems the 
future has in store. It is not, in brief a printed finality but a 
dynamic process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[201]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>

        <p> In <i>Secretary of Justice v. Lantion</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[202]</sup>
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> The due process clauses in the American and Philippine 
Constitutions are not only worded in exactly identical language and 
terminology, but more importantly, they are alike in what their 
respective Supreme Courts have expounded as the spirit with which the 
provisions are informed and impressed, the elasticity in their 
interpretation, their dynamic and resilient character which make them 
capable of meeting every modern problem, and their having been designed 
from earliest time to the present to meet the exigencies of an undefined
 and expanding future. The requirements of due process are interpreted 
in both the United States and the Philippines as not denying to the law 
the capacity for progress and improvement. Toward this effect and in 
order to avoid the confines of a legal straitjacket, the courts instead 
prefer to have the meaning of the due process clause "gradually 
ascertained by the process of inclusion and exclusion in the course of 
the decisions of cases as they arise" (Twining vs. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 
78). Capsulized, it refers to "the embodiment of the sporting idea of 
fair play" (Ermita-Malate Hotel and Motel Owner's Association vs. City 
Mayor of Manila, 20 SCRA 849 [1967]). It relates to certain immutable 
principles of justice which inhere in the very idea of free government 
(Holden vs. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[203]</sup> </p>

        <p> Thus, in my separate opinion in <i>Samahan ng mga Progresibong Kabataan (SPARK) v. Quezon City</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup> emphasized that the right to life and liberty under the Bill of Rights evolves and expands to our current realities: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> It is in this sense that the constitutional listing of the
 objects of due process protection admits amorphous bounds. The 
constitutional protection of life and liberty encompasses a penumbra of 
cognate rights that is not fixed but evolves — expanding liberty — 
alongside the contemporaneous reality in which the Constitution 
operates. <i>People v. Hernandez</i> illustrated how the right to liberty is multi-faceted and is not limited to its initial formulation in the due process clause: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> [T]he preservation of liberty is such a major 
preoccupation of our political system that, not satisfied with 
guaranteeing its enjoyment in the very first paragraph of section (1) of
 the Bill of Rights, the framers of our Constitution devoted paragraphs 
(3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), 
(18), and (21) of said section (1) to the protection of several aspects 
of freedom. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> While the extent of the constitutional protection of life 
and liberty is dynamic, evolving, and expanding with contemporaneous 
realities, the mechanism for preserving life and liberty is immutable: 
any intrusion into it must be with due process of law and must not run 
afoul of the equal protection of the laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>

        <p> In <i>Social Weather Stations, Inc. v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup>
 this Court discussed that judicial interpretation entails a holistic 
approach—considering both the history and the contemporary, the 
realities and the ideals, as effected by the Constitution and statutes: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> Interestingly, both COMELEC and petitioners appeal to what
 they (respectively) construe to be plainly evident from Section 
5.2(a)'s text: on the part of COMELEC, that the use of the words "paid 
for" evinces no distinction between direct purchasers and those who 
purchase via subscription schemes; and, on the part of petitioners, that
 Section 5.2(a)'s desistance from actually using the word "subscriber" 
means that subscribers are beyond its contemplation. The variance in the
 parties' positions, considering that they are both banking on what they
 claim to be the Fair Election Act's plain meaning, is the best evidence
 of an extant ambiguity. </p>
          <p> Second, statutory construction cannot lend itself to 
pedantic rigor that foments absurdity. The dangers of inordinate 
insistence on literal interpretation are commonsensical and need not be 
belabored. These dangers are by no means endemic to legal 
interpretation. Even in everyday conversations, misplaced literal 
interpretations are fodder for humor. A fixation on technical rules of 
grammar is no less innocuous. A pompously doctrinaire approach to text 
can stifle, rather than facilitate, the legislative wisdom that 
unbridled textualism purports to bolster. </p>
          <p> Third, the assumption that there is, in all cases, a 
universal plain language is erroneous. In reality, universality and 
uniformity in meaning is a rarity. A contrary belief wrongly assumes 
that language is static. </p>
          <p> <i><b>The more appropriate and more effective approach is,
 thus, holistic rather than parochial: to consider context and the 
interplay of the historical, the contemporary, and even the envisioned.</b>
 Judicial interpretation entails the convergence of social realities and
 social ideals. The latter arc meant to be effected by the legal 
apparatus, chief of which is the bedrock of the prevailing legal order: 
the Constitution. Indeed, the word in the vernacular that describes the 
Constitution — saligan — demonstrates this imperative of constitutional 
primacy.</i> </p>
          <p> Thus, we refuse to read Section 5.2(a) of the Fair 
Election Act in isolation. Here, we consider not an abstruse provision 
but a stipulation that is part of the whole, <i>i.e</i>., the statute of
 which it is a part, that is aimed at realizing the ideal of fair 
elections. We consider not a cloistered provision but a norm that should
 have a present authoritative effect, to achieve the ideals of those who
 currently read, depend on, and demand fealty from the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </p>

 this Court discussed that a resort to these deliberations should be the
 last option, as doing so would be prone to "subjective interpretation" 
and "the greatest errors":
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> In the hierarchy of the means for constitutional 
interpretation, inferring meaning from the supposed intent of the 
framers or fathoming the original understanding of the individuals who 
adopted the basic document is the weakest approach. </p>
          <p> These methods leave the greatest room for subjective 
interpretation. Moreover, they allow for the greatest errors. The 
alleged intent of the framers is not necessarily encompassed or 
exhaustively articulated in the records of deliberations. Those that 
have been otherwise silent and have not actively engaged in 
interpellation and debate may have voted for or against a proposition 
for reasons entirely their own and not necessarily in complete agreement
 with those articulated by the more vocal. It is even possible that the 
beliefs that motivated them were based on entirely erroneous premises. 
Fathoming original understanding can also misrepresent history as it 
compels a comprehension of actions made within specific historical 
episodes through detached, and not necessarily better-guided, modern 
lenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[210]</sup> </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Moreover, the original intent of the Constitution's framers 
is not always uniform with the original understanding of the people who 
ratified it. In <i>Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[211]</sup>
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> While it is permissible in this jurisdiction to consult 
the debates and proceedings of the constitutional convention in order to
 arrive at the reason and purpose of the resulting Constitution, resort 
thereto may be had only when other guides fail as said proceedings are 
powerless to vary the terms of the Constitution when the meaning is 
clear. Debates in the constitutional convention "are of value as showing
 the views of the individual members, and as indicating the reasons for 
their votes, but they give us no light as to the views of the large 
majority who did not talk, much less of the mass of our fellow citizens 
whose votes at the polls gave that instrument the force of fundamental 
law. We think it safer to construe the constitution from what appears 
upon its face." <i>The proper interpretation therefore depends more on 
how it was understood by the people adopting it than in the framer's 
understanding thereof</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[212] </sup>(Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </p>

punishment is solely left for Congress to address.

        </p><p> Considering that the violation of constitutional rights 
is a justiciable matter, aggrieved persons deprived of liberty can file 
an action in the proper trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[213]</sup>
        </p><p> If yet to be convicted, such that the case is still on 
trial or on appeal, detainees should be able to file a motion for 
release invoking a violation of their constitutional right. If already 
convicted with finality, a prisoner should be able to file for a writ of
 <i>habeas corpus</i>. This is in line with <i>Gumabon v. Director of the Bureau of Prisons</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[214]</sup>
 where this Court allowed the release of prisoners after a finding that 
their detention violated their constitutional right to equal protection 
of the laws: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> 1. The fundamental issue, to repeat, is the availability of the writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>
 under the circumstances disclosed. Its latitudinarian scope to assure 
that illegality of restraint and detention be avoided is one of the 
truisms of the law. It is not known as the writ of liberty for nothing. 
The writ imposes on judges the grave responsibility of ascertaining 
whether there is any legal justification for a deprivation of physical 
freedom. Unless there be such a showing, the confinement must thereby 
cease. If there be a valid sentence it cannot, even for a moment, be 
extended beyond the period provided for by law. Any deviation from the 
legal norms call for the termination of the imprisonment. </p>
          <p> . . . . </p>
          <p> 2. Where, however, the detention complained of finds its 
origin in what has been judicially ordained, the range of inquiry in a 
habeas corpus proceeding is considerably narrowed. For if "the person 
alleged to be restrained of his liberty is in the custody of an officer 
under process issued by a court or judge or by virtue of a judgment or 
order of a court of record, and that the court or judge had jurisdiction
 to issue the process, render the judgment, or make the order," the writ
 does not lie. That principle dates back to 1902, when this Court 
announced that <i>habeas corpus</i> was unavailing where the person 
detained was in the custody of an officer under process issued by a 
court or magistrate. That is understandable, as during the time the 
Philippines was under American rule, there was necessarily an adherence 
to authoritative doctrines of constitutional law there followed. </p>
          <p> One such principle is the requirement that there be a finding of jurisdictional defect. As summarized by Justice Bradley in <i>Ex parte</i>
 Siebold, an 1880 decision: "The only ground on which this court, or any
 court, without some special statute authorizing it, will give relief on
 <i>habeas corpus</i> to a prisoner under conviction and sentence of 
another court is the want of jurisdiction in such court over the person 
or the cause, or some other matter rendering its proceedings void." </p>
          <p> There is the fundamental exception though, that must ever 
be kept in mind. Once a deprivation of a constitutional right is shown 
to exist, the court that rendered the judgment is deemed ousted of 
jurisdiction and <i>habeas corpus</i> is the appropriate remedy to assail the legality of the detention. </p>
          <p> 3. Petitioners precisely assert a deprivation of a 
constitutional right, namely, the denial of equal protection. According 
to their petition: "In the case at bar, the petitioners were convicted 
by Courts of First Instance for the very same rebellion for which 
Hernandez, Geronimo, and others were convicted. The law under which they
 were convicted is the very same law under which the latter were 
convicted. It had not and has not been changed. For the same crime, 
committed under the same law, how can we, in conscience, allow 
petitioners to suffer life imprisonment, while others can suffer only <i>prision mayor</i>?" </p>
          <p> They would thus stress that, contrary to the mandate of 
equal protection, people similarly situated were not similarly dealt 
with. What is required under this constitutional guarantee is the 
uniform operation of legal norms so that all persons under similar 
circumstances would be accorded the same treatment both in the 
privileges conferred and the liabilities imposed. As was noted in a 
recent decision: "Favoritism and undue preference cannot be allowed. For
 the principle is that equal protection and security shall be given to 
every person under circumstances, which if not identical are analogous. 
If law be looked upon in terms of burden or charges, those that fall 
within a class should be treated in the same fashion, whatever 
restrictions cast on some in the group equally binding on the rest." </p>
          <p> The argument of petitioners thus possesses a persuasive 
ring. The continued incarceration after the twelve-year period when such
 is the maximum length of imprisonment in accordance with our 
controlling doctrine, when others similarly convicted have been freed, 
is fraught with implications at war with equal protection. That is not 
to give it life. On the contrary, it would render it nugatory. 
Otherwise, what would happen is that for an identical offense, the only 
distinction lying in the finality of the conviction of one being before 
the Hernandez ruling and the other after, a person duly sentenced for 
the same crime would be made to suffer different penalties. Moreover, as
 noted in the petition before us, after our ruling in <i>People v. Lava</i>,
 petitioners who were mere followers would be made to languish in jail 
for perhaps the rest of their natural lives when the leaders had been 
duly considered as having paid their penalty to society, and freed. Such
 a deplorable result is to be avoided.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[215]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> However, to be entitled to the reliefs mentioned, one must 
first allege and prove the following: (a) the existing inhuman, 
degrading, or cruel conditions not organic or consistent with the 
statutory punishment imposed; (b) the violation of a clear, enforceable 
constitutional provision or a local or international law; (c) a clear 
demand on the relevant agencies of government; and (d) the intentional 
or persistent refusal or negligence on the part of the government agency
 or official to address the cruel conditions of the violation of the 
statutory or constitutional provisions. 
        </p><p> Justice Perlas-Bernabe finds that our laws addressing 
jail congestion are lacking, and the rules on release on bail or 
recognizance do not expressly consider the conditions of confinement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[216]</sup> Thus, she and Justice Caguioa borrow the "deliberate indifference standard" used in the United States cases of <i>Estelle v. Gamble</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup> and <i>Helling v. McKinney</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup>
        </p><p> While I agree that those cases may be relevant to this case, these are only persuasive to this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[219]</sup> Rather, the guidelines in <i>Alejano v. Cabuay</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[220]</sup>
 the same case where this Court discussed punishment, may be used in 
granting reliefs against violations of the right against cruel, 
degrading, and inhuman punishment, right to life, and right to health of
 persons deprived of liberty. 
        </p><p> In the 2005 case of <i>Alejano</i>, junior military 
officers staged a mutiny against the then President and took control of 
Oakwood Premier Luxury Apartments. After a failed attempt, they 
voluntarily surrendered and were taken in custody. Later, they filed a 
petition for <i>habeas corpus</i>, alleging that their confinement 
conditions violated their right against cruel and unusual punishment. 
They specifically cry afoul on the bars that separated them from their 
visitors and the iron grills and plywood in their individual cells. 
        </p><p> This Court dismissed the petition, as the petitioners 
failed to convince the court to infer punishment from the inherent 
restrictions of confinement: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> Petitioners further argue that the bars separating the 
detainees from their visitors and the boarding of the iron grills in 
their cells with plywood amount to unusual and excessive punishment. 
This argument fails to impress us. <i>Bell v. Wolfish</i> pointed out 
that while a detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of 
guilt in accordance with due process of law, detention inevitably 
interferes with a detainee's desire to live comfortably. <b><i>The fact 
that the restrictions inherent in detention intrude into the detainees' 
desire to live comfortably does not convert those restrictions into 
punishment. It is when the restrictions are arbitrary and purposeless 
that courts will infer intent to punish. Courts' will also infer intent 
to punish even if the restriction seems to be related rationally to the 
alternative purpose if the restriction appears excessive in relation to 
that purpose.</i></b> Jail officials are thus not required to use the 
least restrictive security measure. They must only refrain from 
implementing a restriction that appears excessive to the purpose it 
serves. </p>
          <p> We quote <i>Bell v. Wolfish</i>: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> One further point requires discussion. The petitioners 
assert, and respondents concede, that the "essential objective of 
pretrial confinement is to insure the detainees' presence at trial." 
While this interest undoubtedly justifies the original decision to 
confine an individual in some manner, we do not accept respondents' 
argument that the Government's interest in ensuring a detainee's 
presence at trial is the only objective that may justify restraints and 
conditions once the decision is lawfully made to confine a person. "If 
the government could confine or otherwise infringe the liberty of 
detainees only to the extent necessary to ensure their presence at 
trial, house arrest would in the end be the only constitutionally 
justified form of detention." The Government also has legitimate 
interests that stem from its need to manage the facility in which the 
individual is detained. These legitimate operational concerns may 
require administrative measures that go beyond those that are, strictly 
speaking, necessary to ensure that the detainee shows up at trial. For 
example, the Government must be able to take steps to maintain security 
and order at the institution and make certain no weapons or illicit 
drugs reach detainees. Restraints that are reasonably related to the 
institution's interest in maintaining jail security do not, without 
more, constitute unconstitutional punishment, even if they are 
discomforting and are restrictions that the detainee would not have 
experienced had he been released while awaiting trial. We need not here 
attempt to detail the precise extent of the legitimate governmental 
interests that may justify conditions or restrictions of pretrial 
detention. It is enough simply to recognize that in addition to ensuring
 the detainees' presence at trial, the effective management of the 
detention facility once the individual is confined is a valid objective 
that may justify imposition of conditions and restrictions of pretrial 
detention and dispel any inference that such restrictions are intended 
as punishment. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> An action constitutes a punishment when (1) that action 
causes the inmate to suffer some harm or "disability," and (2) the 
purpose of the action is to punish the inmate. Punishment also requires 
that the harm or disability be significantly greater than, or be 
independent of, the inherent discomforts of confinement. </p>
          <p> <i>Block v. Rutherford</i>, which reiterated <i>Bell v. Wolfish</i>,
 upheld the blanket restriction on contact visits as this practice was 
reasonably related to maintaining security. The safety of innocent 
individuals will be jeopardized if they are exposed to detainees who 
while not yet convicted are awaiting trial for serious, violent offenses
 and may have prior criminal conviction. Contact visits make it possible
 for the detainees to hold visitors and jail staff hostage to effect 
escapes. Contact visits also leave the jail vulnerable to visitors 
smuggling in weapons, drugs, and other contraband. The restriction on 
contact visits was imposed even on low-risk detainees as they could also
 potentially be enlisted to help obtain contraband and weapons. The 
security consideration in the imposition of blanket restriction on 
contact visits was ruled to outweigh the sentiments of the detainees. </p>
          <p> <i>Block v. Rutherford</i> held that the prohibition of 
contact visits bore a rational connection to the legitimate goal of 
internal security. This case reaffirmed the "handsoff" doctrine 
enunciated in <i>Bell v. Wolfish,</i> a form of judicial self-restraint,
 based on the premise that courts should decline jurisdiction over 
prison matters in deference to administrative expertise. </p>
          <p> In the present case, we cannot infer punishment from the 
separation of the detainees from their visitors by iron bars, which is 
merely a limitation on contact visits. The iron bars separating the 
detainees from their visitors prevent direct physical contact but still 
allow the detainees to have visual, verbal, non-verbal and limited 
physical contact with their visitors. The arrangement is not unduly 
restrictive. In fact, it is not even a strict noncontact visitation 
regulation like in <i>Block v. Rutherford</i>. The limitation on the 
detainees' physical contacts with visitors is a reasonable, non-punitive
 response to valid security concerns. </p>
          <p> The boarding of the iron grills is for the furtherance of 
security within the ISAFP Detention Center. This measure intends to 
fortify the individual cells and to prevent the detainees from passing 
on contraband and weapons from one cell to another. The boarded grills 
ensure security and prevent disorder and crime within the facility. The 
diminished illumination and ventilation are but discomforts inherent in 
the fact of detention, and do not constitute punishments on the 
detainees. </p>
          <p> We accord respect to the finding of the Court of Appeals 
that the conditions in the ISAFP Detention Center are not inhuman, 
degrading and cruel. Each detainee, except for Capt. Nicanor Faeldon and
 Capt. Gerardo Gambala, is confined in separate cells, unlike ordinary 
cramped detention cells. The detainees are treated well and given 
regular meals. The Court of Appeals noted that the cells are relatively 
clean and livable compared to the conditions now prevailing in the city 
and provincial jails, which are congested with detainees. The Court of 
Appeals found the assailed measures to be reasonable considering that 
the ISAFP Detention Center is a high-risk detention facility. Apart from
 the soldiers, a suspected New People's Army ("NPA") member and two 
suspected Abu Sayyaf members are detained in the ISAFP Detention Center.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> In <i>Alejano</i>, this Court adopted the tests in the United States case of <i>Bell v. Wolfish</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[222]</sup>
 in determining the "intent to punish" from the restrictions and 
conditions of confinement: (1) if these are arbitrary, purposeless, and 
do not satisfy a government interest; (2) assuming that there is an 
alternative government interest (<i>i.e</i>. facilities' operational concerns), if the conditions appear "excessive in relation to that purpose."
        </p><p> Applying these tests, this Court held that the bar 
installation was not unduly restrictive, and intended to secure the 
detainees. Also, the illumination and ventilation were held to be 
"inherent in the fact of detention, and do not constitute punishments on
 the detainees." Moreover, this Court held that their overall 
conditions—their individual confinement, regular meals, clean and 
livable cells—were not inhuman, degrading, and cruel, as compared to the
 congested city and provincial jails. Thus, this Court did not infer an 
intent to punish in their case. 
        </p><p> I maintain that persons deprived of liberty have a cause
 of action for violation of the right against cruel, degrading, and 
inhuman punishment if their current state of detention is no longer 
organic to the fact of their detention. As Justice Caguioa pointed out,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup> <i>Alejano</i>
 affirmed that the violations of the constitutional rights of persons 
deprived of liberty are within the court's power of review. In <i>Alejano</i>: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> The ruling in this case, however, does not foreclose the 
right of detainees and convicted prisoners from petitioning the courts 
for the redress of grievances. Regulations and conditions in detention 
and prison facilities that violate the Constitutional rights of the 
detainees and prisoners will be reviewed by the courts on a case-by-case
 basis. The courts could afford injunctive relief or damages to the 
detainees and prisoners subjected to arbitrary and inhumane conditions. 
However, <i>habeas corpus</i> is not the proper mode to question 
conditions of confinement. The writ of habeas corpus will only lie if 
what is challenged is the fact or duration of confinement. (Citations 
omitted)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup> </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Contrary to <i>Alejano</i>, however, I view that a petition for <i>habeas corpus</i> may also be a proper remedy to question conditions of confinement. 
        </p><p> Thus, in allowing petitioners' temporary release, the 
ultimate issue to be resolved is whether or not the State has been 
maintaining their jail or detention facilities in compliance with the 
Constitution, local laws, and international standards on the rights of 
persons deprived of liberty. 
        </p><p> However, a mere allegation that constitutional rights 
have been violated is insufficient. I agree with Justice Caguioa that 
the causal link between notorious jail conditions and a person deprived 
of liberty's exclusion from the standard of care available to a free 
person must be proven first. This is necessary to sustain a cause of 
action anchored on the right against cruel and inhuman punishment and 
relevant international laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup>
        </p><p> Thus, to reiterate, petitioners must be able to satisfy 
the following requisites: (a) the existing inhuman, degrading, or cruel 
conditions not organic or consistent with the statutory punishment 
imposed; (b) the violation of a clear, enforceable constitutional 
provision or a local or international law; (c) a clear demand on the 
relevant government agency; and (d) the government agency's intentional 
or persistent refusal or negligence to address the cruel conditions of 
the violation of the statutory or constitutional provisions. 
        </p><p> I emphasize the third and fourth requisites: before the 
court can conclude a violation of constitutional rights, there must have
 been a clear demand on the relevant government agency, and in turn, a 
wanton denial or unreasonable negligence on the agency's part. This is 
in keeping with the doctrine of separation of powers. As Justice Caguioa
 correctly puts it, addressing jail congestion is a "policy question and
 formulation" under the jurisdiction of the executive and legislative 
branches of government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup> Thus, the courts must first defer to the capabilities of the other constitutional organs. 
        </p><p align="center"> <b>VI</b>
        </p><p> In this case, the claims of petitioners in relation to 
these standards clearly require the presentation of evidence in the 
trial court. Several factual determinations must be made before a ruling
 can be had on whether there is a violation of their constitutional 
rights. 
        </p><p> It is correct that this Court may take judicial notice 
of the nature of COVID-19 and the longstanding jail congestion which has
 plagued the Philippine jails. This unresolved crisis is a significant 
threat to the right to life, health, and security of persons in 
congested penal facilities, whose conditions make social distancing 
impossible. 
        </p><p> While factual allegations must be proven by evidence, 
courts may take judicial notice of particular circumstances. Rule 129, 
Sections 1 to 3 of the Rules of Court state: 
        </p><blockquote>
          <p> SECTION 1. <i>Judicial notice, when mandatory</i>. — A 
court shall take judicial notice, without the introduction of evidence, 
of the existence and territorial extent of states, their political 
history, forms of government and symbols of nationality, the law of 
nations, the admiralty and maritime courts of the world and their seals,
 the political constitution and history of the Philippines, <i>the official acts of the legislative, executive and judicial departments of the Philippines</i>, the laws of nature, the measure of time, and the geographical divisions. </p>
          <p> SECTION 2. <i>Judicial notice, when discretionary</i>. — A court may take judicial notice of matters which are of <i>public knowledge</i>, or are capable of unquestionable demonstration, or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial functions. </p>
          <p> SECTION 3. Judicial <i>notice, when hearing necessary.</i>
 — During the trial, the court, on its own initiative, or on request of a
 party, may announce its intention to take judicial notice of any matter
 and allow the parties to be heard thereon. </p>
          <p> After the trial, and before judgment or on appeal, the 
proper court, on its own initiative or on request of a party, may take 
judicial notice of any matter and allow the parties to be heard thereon 
if such matter is decisive of a material issue in the case. (Emphasis 
supplied) </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> From these, this Court has summed up the requisites of judicial notice. In <i>State Prosecutors v. Muro</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[227]</sup> </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p> Generally speaking, matters of judicial notice have three 
material requisites: (1) the matter must be one of common and general 
knowledge; (2) it must be well and authoritatively settled and not 
doubtful or uncertain; and (3) it must be known to be within the limits 
of the jurisdiction of the court. The principal guide in determining 
what facts may be assumed to be judicially known is that of notoriety. 
Hence, it can be said that judicial notice is limited to facts evidenced
 by public records and facts of general notoriety.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[228]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p>
          <p> Thus, this Court may take judicial notice of the state of 
jail congestion in the Philippines, the nature of transmission of 
COVID-19, and its deadly effects. </p>

        <p>The Commission on Audit found that the jail populations 
increased because of the increase in drug-related cases, pendency of

concerned government agencies in addressing the congestion problems in 
all jail facilities; </p>

          <p> (c) require the Regional Bids and Awards Committee to 
ensure timely completion of all procurement activities pertaining to the
 construction and/or improvement of all jail facilities in order to 
decongest overcrowded jails; and</p>
          <p> (d) enhance and intensify the GCTA process and give more 
emphasis on the Recognizance Act for detainees early release without 
necessarily completing their sentence which could significantly reduce 
jail population and congestion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[235]</sup> </p>

 In 2016, it raised its concern against the deplorable living conditions

          <p> 27. <i>The Committee is concerned at the persistence of 
appalling conditions of detention prevailing in the State party, both in
 police lock-up cells and the jails and detention facilities run by the 
Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, which do not meet minimum 
international standards and may constitute ill-treatment or torture. </i>It
 is particularly concerned at the persistence of critical and chronic 
overcrowding in all detention facilities, some of which may be operating
 at 380 percent of capacity. Conditions in all places of deprivation of 
liberty include dilapidated and small cells, in some of which detainees 
are forced to sleep while sitting or standing, unsanitary conditions, 
inadequate amounts of food, poor nutrition, insufficient natural and 
artificial lighting and poor ventilation, which cause inter-prisoner 
violence and the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, the
 incidence of which is extremely high. The Committee is particularly 
alarmed at information that tuberculosis eradication programmes were not
 a priority in the past because they were seen as irrelevant to the 
maintenance of security. The Committee is concerned about sexual 
violence against detained persons and about the treatment of detainees 
belonging to minorities (arts. 2, 11 and 16).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[238]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p>

        </p><p> COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new type 
of coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2). Generally, coronaviruses cause respiratory infections to 
humans, which range from mild to severe. The Middle East Respiratory 
Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, both viral outbreaks 
that had swept the Philippines years ago, were both caused by 
coronaviruses.

        </p><p> The common symptoms of this disease include fever, dry 
cough, and tiredness. Some manifestations include aches and pains, nasal
 congestion, sore throat, diarrhea, <i>anosmia</i> (loss of smell), and <i>dysgeusia</i> (loss of taste).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[241]</sup> These signs begin mildly and may gradually progress.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[242]</sup>
        </p><p> According to the World Health Organization, 80% of 
infected persons recover from COVID-19 without needing hospital 
treatment. However, one of every five people becomes seriously ill and 
develops difficulty breathing. Any person can be seriously ill, but 
those who are of advanced age, and those with underlying medical 
problems such as high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes,
 cancer, or immunosuppression have a higher chance of worsening 
conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[243]</sup>
        </p><p> COVID-19 is highly contagious.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[244]</sup>
 Some get infected but do not develop any symptoms or feel unwell; some 
only experience mild symptoms. However, even those with zero to very 
mild symptoms can transmit the virus if they carry it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[245]</sup>
 In fact, COVID-19 has since spread worldwide, prompting the World 
Health Organization to declare it a pandemic—the first one caused by a 
coronavirus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[246]</sup>
        </p><p> The World Health Organization had initially found that 
the virus spreads when a COVID-19-positive person expels small droplets 
from the nose or mouth through speaking, coughing, or sneezing. People 
can catch COVID-19 "if they breathe in these droplets," or if they 
touched objects or surfaces on which the droplets are expelled and then 
they touched their eyes, nose, or mouth. It later noted that "airborne 
transmission of the virus can occur in health care settings where 
specific medical procedures, called aerosol generating procedures, 
generate very small droplets called aerosols." It also reported that 
some outbreaks in indoor crowded spaces suggested the possibility of 
combined aerosol and droplet transmission, citing examples such as 
during choir practice, in restaurants or in fitness classes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[247]</sup>
        </p><p> Thus, the World Health Organization lists several 
recommendations to prevent transmission. These include frequent hand 
hygiene, physical distancing, respiratory etiquette, avoiding "crowded 
places, close-contact settings and confined and enclosed spaces with 
poor ventilation," wearing fabric masks, and "good environmental 
ventilation in all closed settings and appropriate environmental 
cleaning and disinfection."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[248]</sup>
        </p><p> As of now, there is no vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and no proven cure for COVID-19.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[249]</sup>
        </p><p> All these factors have caused the entire world to undergo extraordinary changes to cope with the situation.

 and declared a national emergency. President Rodrigo Duterte was also 
given emergency powers to address the state of public health emergency.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup>
        </p><p> Several levels of community quarantine measures—general,
 enhanced, to extreme enhanced along with their modified versions—were 
imposed all over the country, depending on each locality's situation. 
Notably, work was suspended in the executive branch, and the other 
branches were encouraged to follow suit. Private enterprises made 
flexible work arrangements. Land, domestic air, and domestic sea travel 
to and from Metro Manila were suspended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup>
 Local governments started imposing curfews, implementing quarantine 
passes, providing support to health workers, and distributing relief 
goods.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[258]</sup>
        </p><p> Quarantine was extended several times,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[259]</sup>
 and was subsequently modified based on the locality after consideration
 of the developments of the COVID-19 epidemiological curve, health 
capacity, and economic, security, and social factors.
        </p><p> Yet, based on publicly available Department of Health 
data, the total number of cases continues to rise. In particular, 
Moreover, several news reports announced positive cases of and deaths 
related to COVID-19 in jails.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[260]</sup>
        </p><p> While the Bureau of Corrections and the Bureau of Jail 
Management and Penology submitted Verified Reports on the measures taken
 to address the disease, they admit that social distancing is necessary 
to disrupt the spread of the virus. They also concede that this is 
unachievable in all of the penal facilities in the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[261]</sup> Petitioners invoke the general absence of adequate medical and healthcare facilities to respond to basic needs of prisoners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[262]</sup>
        </p><p> Clearly, the nature of COVID-19 and the jail congestion 
in this country are matters that all courts may take judicial notice of.
 The fact of overcrowding in jails and the transmissibility of COVID-19 
no longer need further proof. However, even if this Court takes judicial
 notice of these circumstances, there are several facts that must first 
be determined in relation to the confinement of petitioners or any other
 person deprived of liberty seeking release. 
        </p><p> This includes, among others, the latest data on jail 
congestion and measures taken to address the chronic problem of jail 
overcapacity; the capabilities of the prison systems where petitioners 
are detained to prevent the spread of COVID-19; the demands made by 
petitioners to the detention facilities; any unjustified refusal or 
negligence on the part of the detention facilities to act on their 
concerns. 
        </p><p> Courts cannot grant a blanket release without 
determining these facts. Petitioners must establish the basis for their 
temporary release. To be released based on a violation of their 
constitutional rights, petitioners must still show the circumstances of 
their own detention and prove they are deprived of the basic and minimum
 standards of imprisonment. They should establish the individual 
conditions of their confinement which are not organic or consistent with
 the punishment imposed on them. They must invoke which constitutional 
rights are violated. They must show they have made a clear demand on the
 relevant government agencies, and that the latter intentionally or 
persistently refused or negligently failed to act on their concerns. 
They must ultimately show that the responsible government 
instrumentality has been compliant or negligent with constitutional, 
international, and local provisions and standards protecting their 
rights. 
        </p><p> Justice Lazaro-Javier opines that while this Court may take judicial notice of jail congestion,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup>
 the infringement of the minimum standards required under the law do not
 constitute cruel and inhuman punishment. To her, while it affects the 
severity of the punishment, it is merely incidental to the punishment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup>
        </p><p> She also agrees that jail congestion has a bigger impact on petitioners' right to life during the pandemic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup>
 However, she finds that it cannot be said that the increased risks 
caused by COVID-19 on their right to life, security and health are the 
fault of respondents, such that the violation can be attributed to them.
 She holds that respondents committed no positive act to increase 
petitioners' risks or worsen the situation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup>
 Neither are they guilty of inaction or idleness since they have taken 
positive measures to minimize the spread of the virus and infection 
among the prisoners. Even assuming their measures were not sufficient, 
the inadequacy is attributable to other factors beyond the control and 
authority of respondents, including the unpredictability of the 
pandemic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[267]</sup>
        </p><p> Similarly, without trial on the merits, Justice Delos 
Santos is ready to conclude that petitioners' continued detention is not
 unnecessarily oppressive because they failed to show that the State has
 been "indifferent to their clinical needs."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[268]</sup>
        </p><p> These are already factual conclusions that may only be 
determined in a proper hearing in the trial courts. I suggest that 
before this Court make any finding, a full-blown hearing is necessary. 
Without it, it cannot be established that jail congestion and the 
general lack of adequate medical facilities preclude respondents from 
preventing the spread of COVID-19 in its facilities. Without it, the 
question of whether petitioners' constitutional rights were violated 
remains unanswered.

        </p><p> Finally, I suggest a measure grounded on social justice: that this Court provide a remedy called the writ of <i>kalayaan</i>. 
        </p><p> I recognize the many efforts and feats of this Court 
under Chief Justice Peralta's leadership to facilitate the release of 
qualified persons deprived of liberty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[269]</sup>
        </p><p> However, I urge this Court to move even further. In 
recognition of the pervasiveness of congestion in our jails, this Court 
should fashion a remedy called the writ of <i>kalayaan</i> similar to the writ of <i>kalikasan</i> or the writ of continuing mandamus in environmental cases. 
        </p><p> This Court is not without precedent in formulating rules
 to address pervasive and urgent violations of constitutional rights 
with transcendental effects. In <i>Metropolitan Manila Development Authority v. Concerned Residents of Manila Bay</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[270]</sup>
 this Court issued, for the first time, a writ of continuing mandamus 
ordering various administrative agencies to fulfill their respective 
mandates to clean up and restore Manila Bay. Having appreciated the 
extraordinary circumstances, the urgency of the situation, and the 
extreme environmental degradation of Manila Bay, this Court upheld the 
right to a balanced and healthful ecology through the writ. 
        </p><p> This Court likewise recognized that it needed to 
formulate special rules of procedure to enforce environmental laws and 
finally address the continuing violations of these laws. On April 10, 
2010, it promulgated the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases for 
the enforcement or violations of environmental and other related rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[271]</sup> The Rules provide the procedure for the issuance of a writ of <i>kalikasan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[272]</sup>
 an "extraordinary remedy that covers environmental damages the 
magnitude of which transcends both political and territorial 
boundaries."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[273]</sup> The Rules also provide the issuance of a continuing mandamus,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[274]</sup> a "distinct procedure than that of ordinary civil actions for the enforcement/violation of environmental laws."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[275]</sup>
        </p><p> This time, a writ of <i>kalayaan</i> should be issued 
when all the requirements to establish cruel, inhuman, and degrading 
punishment are present. This is necessary considering that the continued
 and malicious congestion of our jails does not affect only one 
individual. Its issuance is grounded on this Court's rule-making 
authority and the extreme situation brought upon by the COVID-19 
pandemic. As in <i>Metropolitan Manila Development Authority</i>, this 
Court is again being called to address a systemic problem that even the 
most basic health protocols to prevent the spread of the virus cannot, 
address. Jail congestion is as virulent as COVID-19 itself, especially 
in the face of an unprecedented global pandemic.
        </p><p> The writ of <i>kalayaan</i> may require a more constant 
supervision by an executive judge for the traditional or extraordinary 
releases of convicts or detainees. It should provide an order of 
precedence in order to bring the occupation of jails to a more humane 
level. Those whose penalties are the lowest and whose crimes are brought
 about, not by extreme malice, but by the indignities of poverty may be 
prioritized. 
        </p><p> Certainly, the writ of <i>kalayaan </i>will be the distinguishing initiative of the Peralta Court—a measure that is grounded on social justice. 
        </p><p> Persons deprived of liberty do not shed their humanity 
once they are taken into custody, yet the perennial congestion that 
plague our jails do not reflect this. Instead, they reveal our failure 
to respect the very fundamental rights that the State has guaranteed to 
protect. This wrong, which we have allowed to persist, is all the more 
pressing in the face of a highly contagious and deadly disease. Persons 
deprived of liberty are in need of more remedies to ensure that their 
detention do not prejudice their right to live. 
        </p><p> Jail congestion harms so many individuals—most of them 
poor, and therefore, invisible. The dawn of the COVID-19 pandemic has 
only made this a more urgent concern. We cannot just watch and sit idly 
by. 
        </p><p> <b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote that the Petition be referred
 to the appropriate trial courts to determine, upon proper motion or 
petition of the parties, whether there are factual bases supporting the 
temporary release of petitioners on the following grounds: 
        </p><p> First, they are entitled to release on bail or recognizance, if still applicable; or
        </p><p> Second, there is a violation of their constitutional 
right against cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment or other related 
constitutional rights, such that they may file either: (1) a motion for 
release if the case is still on trial or on appeal; or (2) petition a 
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> as a post-conviction remedy. The grant of 
these remedies is subject to the establishment of the following 
requisites: (a) existing inhuman, degrading, or cruel conditions not 
organic or consistent with the statutory punishment imposed; (b) the 
conditions violate clear, enforceable statutory or constitutional 
provisions including judicially discernable international standards 
adopted in this jurisdiction; (c) a clear demand on the relevant 
government agency to address their grievance; and (d) the conditions are
 the result of intentional or persistent refusal or negligence on the 
part of the government agency, be it the warden, director of prisons, 
local government unit, or Congress. 
        </p><p> I also vote that this Court <i>En Banc</i> create a subcommittee under the Committee on Rules to immediately draft a proposal for a writ of <i>kalayaan</i>
 to set the clearest guidance for the lower courts in adjudicating 
proven violations of the right against cruel, inhuman, and degrading 
punishment as a result of continuous congestion of detention centers or 
jails.

 a prisoner was injured while unloading a bale of cotton from a truck. 
He filed a civil action for deprivation of rights against the Director 
of the Department of Corrections, the warden of the prison, and its 
medical doctors, alleging that the inadequate medical treatment 
subjected him to cruel and inhuman punishment. <br>
    The U.S. Supreme Court recognized the government's responsibility to
 provide medical care for its prisoners. Failure to do so may constitute
 a cause of action for cruel and inhuman punishment. First, however, the
 prisoner must allege "acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to 
evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs," which 
constitutes "unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain" and in worst 
cases, "physical torture or a lingering death." Moreover, this 
deliberate indifference to a prisoner's serious medical needs must be of
 such nature that offends the contemporary standards of decency as 
expressed in prison regulations. This means that not every accident or 
medical malpractice is sufficient. There must be a deliberate disregard 
of a prisoner's serious medical condition, delay, or complete denial of 
access to treatment, or intentional interference to a prescribed 
treatment.
        </p><p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup> 509 U.S. 25 (1993). In <i>Helling</i>,
 the deliberate indifference test was dissected into its subjective and 
objective components. The prisoner filed a civil action for damages and 
injunction against various prison officials. Roomed with another 
prisoner who daily smoked five packs of cigarettes sold by the prison 
store, he raised health damage that constituted cruel and unusual 
punishment. <br>
    The U.S. Supreme Court held that the conditions of confinement are 
included in the scope of the right against cruel and unusual punishment.
 The reason is that in depriving liberty, the State renders prisoners 
unable to care for themselves. In a series of cases, the Court had 
categorically held that the protection against cruel and unusual 
punishment extends to "'sufficiently imminent dangers" such that a 
"remedy for unsafe conditions need not await a tragic event." <br>
    While the Court affirmed that a cause of action exists under cruel 
and unusual punishment, the case was remanded to the trial courts to 
prove the objective and subjective components of such right. The 
objective factor consists of the prisoner's exposure to a grave risk 
that is not tolerated in the modern society. Moreover, the prisoner's 
exposure is of the nature that violates contemporary standards of 
decency. On the other hand, the subjective factor pertains to prison 
management showing deliberate indifference of the detention officers to 
the risks and exposure of the prisoner.

          </p><p> The dystopian picture above that the Court refused to 
turn its gaze from was drawn over five decades ago, and yet the 
insufferable state of affairs in the penitentiary persists even today. 
So that although we, as a society, may have made dizzying advances in 
fields we consider of great consequence, because the least of us have 
continued to groan in unspeakable living conditions, and our detention 
facilities are constantly breaking at the seams, one must wonder how far
 we have truly come. Surely, we must have asked at one point if perhaps 
more than the deficient fiscal scaffolding and authoritative say-so, our
 institutions suffer the more destructive lack of empathy.
          </p><p> This long-standing problem has been brought to the 
foreground by the current exigencies the country is facing, and the 
Court's decision to refer the instant petition to the concerned trial 
courts for the conduct of bail hearings and other proceedings is 
agreeably the better approach to take under the circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 While I agree that the Court cannot grant the petitioners' prayer for 
temporary release in the absence of a proper bail hearing, I also remain
 unconvinced that the Court, on its own, is powerless to protect the 
most vulnerable among us, especially those who cannot help themselves. 
Certainly in this case, the Court's mandate as the final and ultimate 
dispenser of justice must be more real than mere rhetoric. As proof of 
the Court's capacities, I write this Opinion to highlight the steps that
 the Court has already swiftly undertaken in response to the current 
pandemic. I also submit this Opinion to elaborate on my position and to 
expound on several issues raised by the petitioners, particularly the 
Court's equity jurisdiction, the propriety of using humanitarian 
considerations as a ground for the allowance of bail, and the invocation
 of the petitioners' rights under domestic and international law. This 
Opinion imagines that there may be no more opportune time for all 
material institutions to revisit their powers and awaken perceived 
apathies than now, with both historical underpinnings and the current 
crisis taking us all to task, by exposing once more that the unbearable 
conditions of persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) in our country is 
neither truly noticed nor new.

          </p><p> The instant <i>Urgent Petition for the Release of Prisoners on Humanitarian Grounds in the Midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic</i> directly filed before this Court is essentially an application for bail or recognizance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The petitioners, who are allegedly political prisoners charged with crimes punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and life imprisonment, seek their provisional release on bail or recognizance on the basis of humanitarian grounds. Citing <i>Enrile v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (<i>Enrile</i>),
 the petitioners plead that the Court exercise its equity jurisdiction 
and grant them temporary liberty as their health conditions and 
continued incarceration make them highly vulnerable to COVID-19.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
          </p><p> <i>On the requirements for bail</i>
          </p><p> Bail is the security required and given for the 
release of a person in custody of the law to guarantee his appearance 
before the court as may be required under specified conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 Recognizance, on the other hand, refers to "an obligation of record, 
entered into before some court or magistrate duly authorized to take it,
 with the condition to do some particular act, the most usual condition 
in criminal cases being the appearance of the accused for trial."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 If a person in custody or detention is unable to post bail due to 
abject poverty, he may be released on recognizance to the custody of a 
qualified member of the <i>barangay</i>, city or municipality where the accused resides.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
          </p><p> Section 13, Article III of the Constitution states that all persons, <u>except</u> those charged with offenses punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> <u>when evidence of guilt is strong</u>,
 shall, before conviction, be bailable by sufficient sureties, or be 
released on recognizance as may be provided by law. As a corollary 
matter, Section 7, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court provides that 
regardless of the stage of the criminal prosecution, no person charged 
with a capital offense, or an offense punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or life imprisonment, shall be admitted to bail <u>when evidence of guilt is strong</u>. Further, Republic Act No. (R.A.) 10389<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> or the <i>Recognizance Act of 2012</i>,
 states that the release on recognizance of any person in custody or 
detention for the commission of an offense is a matter of right when the
 offense is <i><u>not</u></i> punishable by death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, or life imprisonment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
          </p><p> Thus, before conviction, bail is either a matter of 
right or discretion. It is a matter of right when the offense charged is
 punishable by any penalty lower than <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. However, bail becomes a matter of judicial discretion if the offense charged is punishable by death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, or life imprisonment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 The court's discretion is, however, limited only to determining whether
 or not the evidence of guilt is strong. Consequently, bail is to be 
granted if evidence of guilt is not strong, and denied if evidence of 
guilt is strong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
          </p><p> In <i>Obosa v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Court reiterated its pronouncement in <i>De la Camara v. Enage</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 on the purpose of bail and the rationale for denying the said relief to
 persons charged with capital offenses when the evidence of guilt is 
strong:
          </p><blockquote>
            <p>x x x Before conviction, every person is bailable except 
if charged with capital offenses when the evidence of guilt is strong. 
Such a right flows from the presumption of innocence in favor of every 
accused who should not be subjected to the loss of freedom as thereafter
 he would be entitled to acquittal, unless his guilt be proved beyond 
reasonable doubt. Thereby a regime of liberty is honored in the 
observance and not in the breach. It is not beyond the realm of 
probability, however, that a person charged with a crime, especially so 
where his defense is weak, would just simply make himself scarce and 
thus frustrate the hearing of his case. A bail is intended as a 
guarantee that such an intent would be thwarted. It is, in the language 
of Cooley, a 'mode short of confinement which would, with reasonable 
certainty, insure the attendance of the accused' for the subsequent 
trial. Nor is there anything unreasonable in denying this right to one 
charged with a capital offense when evidence of guilt is strong, as the 
likelihood is, rather than await the outcome of the proceeding against 
him with a death sentence, an ever-present threat, temptation to flee 
the jurisdiction would be too great to be resisted. x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Italics omitted)</p>
          </blockquote>
          In cases when bail is a matter of judicial discretion, the 
grant or denial thereof hinges on the singular issue of whether or not 
the evidence of guilt of the accused is strong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> As observed in the Court's Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 this necessarily requires the conduct of a bail hearing where the 
prosecution has the burden to prove that evidence of guilt is strong, 
subject to the right of the defense to cross-examine witnesses and 
introduce evidence in its own rebuttal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 The Court cannot perform the aforementioned bail hearing because of the
 well-entrenched principle that it is not a trier of facts. The Court's 
jurisdiction is limited to reviewing errors of law that may have been 
committed by the lower courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 The discretion to grant or deny bail is primarily lodged with the trial
 court judge who is mandated under the rules to: (1) conduct a summary 
hearing and receive the prosecution's evidence; and (2) provide, in its 
order granting or denying bail, a summary of the evidence for the 
prosecution and his own assessment thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
          <p> As mentioned, the petitioners are all charged with offenses that are punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>
 or life imprisonment. Thus, their entitlement to bail is clearly a 
matter of judicial discretion. However, there is no showing that any of 
them had applied for bail or that bail hearings were conducted to 
determine whether the evidence of guilt against them is strong. 
Nevertheless, aware of such absence of bail application or hearing, the 
petitioners have nonetheless proceeded directly to the Court praying for
 it to grant them temporary liberty through bail or recognizance based 
on humanitarian grounds, invoking the Court's equity jurisdiction. The 
petitioners cite the ruling of the Court in <i>Enrile</i> to support their cause.

          <p>In order to properly invoke the Court's equity 
jurisdiction, the controlling test is whether or not a court of law is 
unable to adapt its judgments to the special circumstances of a case as a
 result of the inflexibility of its statutory or legal jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 Its aim is to enable the Court to rule on the basis of substantial 
justice in an instance when the prescribed or customary forms of 
ordinary law prove inadequate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
          </p><p> In a number of cases, the Court has found equity 
jurisdiction as sufficient justification for the relaxation of rules in 
order to give way to substantial merit and justice. In the early case of
 <i>Catigbac v. Leyesa</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 equity jurisdiction was invoked in affording a litigant with a remedy 
through an action that did not exist in the Code of Civil Procedure. The
 Court ruled that although the existing body of rules no longer provided
 for such an ancient action, such was deemed to have subsisted by virtue
 of a substantive right granted under Article 384 of the Civil Code. The
 Court there held that where there is a right, there is also a remedy, 
and equity jurisdiction steps in to scaffold the gap between the 
substantive right granted and a remedy that ensures that right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
          </p><p> In the 1973 case of <i>De los Reyes v. Ramolete</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
 involving the question of ownership over a disputed land between bona 
fide possessors on the one hand, and valid patent holders on the other, 
the Court found that equity jurisdiction could be used to "set matters 
right". Still, in the succeeding case of <i>Serrano v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
 which concerned the true nature of a purported contract of sale, the 
Court iterated that procedural rules are not to be applied rigidly at 
the expense of merit.
          </p><p> Apart from cases of restitution, equity jurisdiction has also been invoked in criminal cases. In <i>Curammeng v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> which involved an erroneous mode of appeal from a conviction, the Court ruled: 
          </p><blockquote> Nevertheless, if a rigid application of the 
rules of procedure will tend to obstruct rather than serve the broader 
interests of justice in light of the prevailing circumstances of the 
case, such as where strong considerations of substantive justice are 
manifest in the petition, the Court may relax the strict application of 
the rules of procedure in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote>
          <p>Further, in <i>Daan v. Hon. Sandiganbayan (Fourth Division)</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
 where the accused therein was allowed to enter a plea bargain proposal 
pursuant to the higher interest of justice and fair play, the Court 
discussed the concept of equity as follows: </p>
          <blockquote> Equity as the complement of legal jurisdiction 
seeks to reach and do complete justice where courts of law, through the 
inflexibility of their rules and want of power to adapt their judgments 
to the special circumstances of cases, are incompetent so to do. Equity 
regards the spirit of and not the letter, the intent and not the form, 
the substance rather than the circumstance, as it is variously expressed
 by different courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </blockquote>
          <p> Even in extradition cases, the equity jurisdiction of the Court was invoked, as seen in <i>Secretary of Justice v. Lantion</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>
          </p><blockquote> We have ruled time and again that this 
Court's equity jurisdiction, which is aptly described as "justice 
outside legality," may be availed of only in the absence of, and never 
against, statutory law or judicial pronouncements (<i>Smith Bell &amp; Co., Inc. vs. Court of Appeals</i>, 267 SCRA 530 [1997]; <i>David-Chan vs. Court of Appeals</i>,
 268 SCRA 677 [1997]). The constitutional issue in the case at bar does 
not even call for "justice outside legality," since private respondent's
 due process rights, although not guaranteed by statute or by treaty, 
are protected by constitutional guarantees. We would not be true to the 
organic law of the land if we choose strict construction over guarantees
 against the deprivation of liberty. That would not be in keeping with 
the principles of democracy on which our Constitution is premised.
              <p> Verily, as one traverses treacherous waters of 
conflicting and opposing currents of liberty and government authority, 
he must ever hold the oar of freedom in the stronger arm, lest an errant
 and wayward course be laid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>           
          </p></blockquote>
          <p> <b>Ultimately, the Court's equity jurisdiction is found to
 be a sufficient justification for the relaxation of rules in order to 
give way to substantial merit of the case and the higher interest of 
justice.</b>
          </p><p> Indeed, the peculiar nature of the instant petition 
prays for both prompt and blanket relief to be applied to differentiated
 cases of the individual petitioners. Thus, while I recognize their plea
 to resolve the instant petition based on compassion and humanitarian 
considerations, the want of necessary factual details brought about by a
 proper bail hearing precludes this Court from a full calibration of 
each petitioner's eligibility for either release on bail or 
recognizance.

          <p>In this regard, I agree with the position of some of my colleagues that the case of <i>Enrile</i> is inapplicable to the instant petition, though my reasoning differs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
          </p><p> To recall, the Court in <i>Enrile</i> allowed therein 
petitioner to post bail on account of his advanced age and frail health –
 despite the fact that petitioner was charged with plunder and the 
absence of a proper hearing to determine whether the evidence of guilt 
against him is strong. This is inconsistent with the unambiguous 
Constitutional provision, which provides that a person shall not be 
entitled to bail if s/he is charged with an offense punishable, by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> when evidence of guilt is strong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Moreover, the same is contrary to established rules<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and settled jurisprudence<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>
 on the necessity of a hearing for bail application when bail is 
discretionary. I was not yet part of the Court when the case was decided
 in 2015. Upon motion for its reconsideration however, being already a 
member of the Court, I voted to grant the motion and joined the dissent 
of Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>
          </p><p> Consistent with my dissent therein, it is my position that <i>Enrile </i>should
 not be considered as having set a precedent inasmuch as it has not 
since found favor in subsequent decisions by the Court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>
 and the ruling by the majority therein does not find support in the 
Constitution and well-established rules and jurisprudence on bail 
proceedings. Hence, I agree with the position of Senior Associate 
Justice Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe that the ruling in <i>Enrile </i>should be viewed as <i>pro hac vice</i> in light of the special and unique considerations accorded to petitioner therein.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>
          </p><p> For the same reason above, I disagree with the suggestion during deliberations that <i>Enrile</i>
 laid down a two-step test to authorize the grant of bail when it is 
discretionary to do so: (a) the detainee will not be a flight risk or a 
danger to the community; and (b) there exist special, humanitarian and 
compelling circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The ruling in <i>Enrile</i>
 deviates from entrenched legal principles concerning bail and it cannot
 be used to create doctrine for subsequent cases. To reiterate, 
petitioner therein was allowed to post bail even though he was charged 
with an offense punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, without any 
showing through a hearing that the evidence of his guilt is not strong. 
Having skirted the minimum requirements under the Constitution regarding
 bail, the ruling in <i>Enrile</i> should not be used to set precedent for cases involving discretionary bail. 
          </p><p> Moreover, the grant of bail in <i>Enrile</i> on the 
basis of petitioner's age and health rests on shaky ground as the 
circumstances therein were quite peculiar. As illustrated in Justice 
Leonen's Dissenting Opinion therein:  
          </p><blockquote> Neither was there grave abuse of discretion 
by the Sandiganbayan when it failed to release accused on bail for 
medical or humanitarian reasons. His release for medical and 
humanitarian reasons was not the basis for his prayer in his Motion to 
Fix Bail filed before the Sandiganbayan. Neither did he base his prayer 
for the grant of bail in this Petition on his medical condition.
              <p> The grant of bail, therefore, by the majority is a 
special accommodation for petitioner. It is based on a ground never 
raised before the Sandiganbayan or in the pleadings filed before this 
court. The Sandiganbayan should not be faulted for not shedding their 
neutrality and impartiality. It is not the duty of an impartial court to
 find what it deems a better argument for the accused at the expense of 
the prosecution and the people they represent. 
              </p><p> The allegation that petitioner suffers from 
medical conditions that require very special treatment is a question of 
fact. We cannot take judicial notice of the truth contained in a 
certification coming from one doctor. This doctor has to be presented as
 an expert witness who will be subjected to both direct and 
cross-examination so that he can properly manifest to the court the 
physical basis for his inferences as well as the nature of the medical 
condition of petitioner. Rebutting evidence that may be presented by the
 prosecution should also be considered. All this would be proper before 
the Sandiganbayan. Again, none of this was considered by the 
Sandiganbayan because petitioner insisted that he was entitled to bail 
as a matter of right on grounds other than his medical condition.   
              </p><p> Furthermore, the majority's opinion—other than the
 invocation of a general human rights principle—does not provide clear 
legal basis for the grant of bail on humanitarian grounds. Bail for 
humanitarian considerations is neither presently provided in our Rules 
of Court nor found in any statute or provision of the Constitution. </p>
              <p> This case leaves this court open to a justifiable 
criticism of granting a privilege ad hoc: only for one person—petitioner
 in this case. </p>
              <p> Worse, it puts pressure on all trial courts and the 
Sandiganbayan that will predictably be deluged with motions to fix bail 
on the basis of humanitarian considerations. The lower courts will have 
to decide, without guidance, whether bail should be granted because of 
advanced age, hypertension, pneumonia, or dreaded diseases. They will 
have to decide whether this is applicable only to Senators and former 
Presidents charged with plunder and not to those accused of drug 
trafficking, multiple incestuous rape, serious illegal detention, and 
other crimes punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or life 
imprisonment. They will have to decide whether this is applicable only 
to those who are in special detention facilities and not to the aging or
 sick detainees in overcrowded detention facilities all over this 
country. </p>
              <p> Our trial courts and the Sandiganbayan will decide on 
the basis of personal discretion causing petitions for certiorari to be 
filed before this court. This will usher in an era of truly selective 
justice not based on clear legal provisions, but one that is 
unpredictable, partial, and solely grounded on the presence or absence 
of human compassion on the day that justices of this court deliberate 
and vote.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> Ergo, a reading of the ruling in <i>Enrile</i> shows that 
there is no discernible standard for the courts to decide cases 
involving discretionary bail on the basis of humanitarian 
considerations. The ineluctable conclusion, as opined by Justice Leonen,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> is that the grant of bail by the majority in <i>Enrile</i> was a special accommodation for petitioner therein. Thus, at the risk of being repetitious, the ruling in <i>Enrile</i> should be considered as a stray decision and, echoing Justice Bernabe,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> must likewise be considered as <i>pro hac vice</i>.
 It should not be used as the benchmark in deciding cases involving the 
question on whether bail may be allowed on the basis of humanitarian 
considerations. Notably, under the Rules of Court, humanitarian 
considerations such as age and health are only taken into account in 
fixing the bail amount after a determination that evidence of guilt 
against the accused is not strong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>
          </p><p> However, the petitioners are not left without any other recourse that is legally permissible. Despite the inapplicability of <i>Enrile</i>
 and in view of the novel nature of this case, the Court should not be 
precluded from affording the petitioners the appropriate reliefs within 
the bounds of law.
          </p><p> In this regard, a proper bail hearing before the trial
 court should first be conducted to determine whether the evidence of 
guilt against the petitioners is strong. This Court, not being a trier 
of facts, cannot receive and weigh the petitioners' evidence at the 
first instance. Factual and evidentiary matters must first be threshed 
out in a proper bail hearing, which may only be done in the lower 
courts. Trial courts are better equipped to assess the petitioners' 
entitlement to bail or recognizance based on the provisions of the 
Constitution, the relevant laws, and the Rules of Court.
          </p><p> Thus, instead of dismissing the petition outright, I 
agree with the Court's ruling to refer this petition to the concerned 
trial courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Exigency is 
better served if the trial courts where the criminal cases of the 
petitioners are respectively pending will hear their bail petitions and 
receive their evidence.

          </p><blockquote> SECTION 11. The State values the dignity of every human person and guarantees full respect for human rights.
              <p> x x x x 
              </p><p> SECTION 15. The State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. 
              </p><p>           
          </p></blockquote>
          The above core principles in our Constitution mirror those 
found in several international laws, prominent of which is the Universal
 Declaration of Human Rights<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (UDHR) stating that:
          <blockquote> Article 1. All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. x x x
              <p> x x x x
              </p><p> Article 3. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.
              </p><p> x x x x 
              </p><p> Article 25. (1) Everyone has the right to a 
standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and
 of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and 
necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of 
unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of 
livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.            
          </p></blockquote>
          <p> Meanwhile, the right to health is included in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>
 which obliges state parties to recognize the "right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The Philippines signed and ratified the ICESCR,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> which makes it a binding obligation on the part of the government.
          </p><p> These rights do not discriminate between offenders and
 non-offenders as it is the declared policy of the State under the 1987 
Constitution to value "every human person."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>
 Similarly, the UDHR recognizes that all persons are entitled to all the
 rights and freedoms set forth therein, "without distinction of any 
kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>
          </p><p> Thus, the notion that persons deprived of liberty 
(PDLs) are not entitled to the guarantee of basic human rights should be
 disabused. While they do not enjoy the same latitude of rights as 
certain restrictions on their liberty and property are imposed as a 
consequence of their detention or imprisonment, the foregoing 
international covenants and our own Constitution prove that PDLs do not 
shed their human rights once they are arrested, charged, placed under 
the custody of law, and subsequently convicted and incarcerated. The 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> in particular, to which the Philippines is likewise a party,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> positively requires the treatment of PDLs "with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup>
          </p><p> Our laws governing arrest and custodial investigation also do not deviate from the above principles. R.A. 7438,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>
 otherwise known as the "Custodial Investigation Law of 1992," was 
created pursuant to the State policy of valuing the "dignity of every 
human being"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> and guaranteeing "full respect for human rights."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>
 It defines the positive rights of all persons under custodial 
investigation, and outlines the concomitant duties of arresting, 
detaining or investigating officers to secure said rights, which include
 the detained person's right to be assisted by counsel. In addition, 
R.A. 9745,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> otherwise known
 as the "Anti-Torture Act of 2009" outlaws, foremost, any act that 
subjects people held in custody to any form of physical, psychological 
or mental harm, force, violence, threat or intimidation or any other act
 which degrades human dignity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>
 Finally, Article 32 of the New Civil Code enumerates the rights and 
liberties of all persons, several of which pertain to the rights of the 
accused, and includes the freedom from excessive fines or cruel and 
unusual punishment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Article 32 further provides that the impeding or impairment of these rights shall be under pains of damages.
          </p><p> When a person is detained or imprisoned, the person is
 afforded certain fundamental rights that affirmatively remain in effect
 throughout the entire period of incarceration. These rights spring from
 Section 19, Article III of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution, 
which proscribes the infliction of cruel, degrading or inhuman 
punishment and the employment of physical, psychological, or degrading 
punishment against any prisoner or detainee. It likewise affirms that 
the use of substandard or inadequate penal facilities under subhuman 
conditions shall be dealt with by law. Notably, both the UDHR<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and the ICCPR<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> have similar prohibitions against the employment of cruel, degrading, or inhuman punishment.
          </p><p> Associate Justice Edgardo L. Delos Santos, however, 
opines that the Constitutional proscription against cruel, degrading or 
inhuman punishment is limited in application and may only be invoked to 
invalidate a law that imposes such penalty, but "not to recognize a 
substantive right."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> 
Furthermore, he surmises from the deliberations that, as Section 19, 
Article III is currently worded, it is only the legislature that has the
 authority to deal with substandard or inadequate penal facilities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> I respectfully differ.
          </p><p> Preliminarily, while I agree with how Justice Delos 
Santos presented the evolution of Section 19, Article III, showing how 
the deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission manifested an 
original intention to only protect against "law[s] which [impose] a 
penalty that is cruel, degrading or inhuman,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> it is clear from the exchanges that this original intention was expanded. 
          </p><p> In particular, Commissioner Teodulo C. Natividad 
passionately argued that the provision should contemplate the abatement 
of inhuman conditions in prison facilities. The following exchanges, 
likewise quoted in Justice Delos Santos' opinion,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>
 demonstrate the accommodation of Commissioner Natividad's proposition 
that the gross inadequacy of the prison facilities constitutes an 
impairment of this constitutional right:  
          </p><blockquote> MR. NATIVIDAD. May I go on to Section 22 
which says: "Excessive fines shall not be imposed, nor cruel, degrading 
or inhuman punishment, or the death penalty inflicted." I will not deal 
with the death penalty because it has already been belabored in many 
remarks. In due time, perhaps I will be given a chance to say a few 
words on that, too. But I am referring to cruel, degrading and inhuman 
punishment. I am drawing upon my experience as the Chairman of the 
National Police Commission for many years. As Chairman of the National 
Police Commission, the same way that General de Castro here was, one of 
my duties was to effect the inspection of jails all over the country. We
 must admit that our jails are a shame to our race. Once we were invited
 by the United Nations' expert on penology — I do not remember his name,
 but he is a doctor friend of mine — and he reported back to us that our
 jails are penological monstrosities.
              <p> Here in the cities, 85 percent are detention prisoners
 and only 15 percent are convicted prisoners. But if we visit the jails,
 they are so crowded and the conditions are so subhuman that one-half of
 the inmates lie down on the cold cement floor which is usually wet, 
even in summer. One-half of them sleep while the other half sit up to 
wait, until the other half wake up, so that they can also sleep. In the 
toilets, right beside the bowl, there are people sleeping. I visited the
 prisons and that was the time I fought for the Adult Probation Law 
because I remember what Winston Churchill and the criminologist 
Dostoevski said: "If you want to know the level of civilization of a 
country, all you have to do is visit their jails." In jurisprudence, the
 interpretation of "cruel and unusual punishment" in the United States 
Constitution was made by the Supreme Court when it said, and I quote: 
"Interpretation of the Eight Amendment in the phrase 'cruel and unusual 
punishment,' must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of 
decency that mark the progress of a maturing society." Courts in the 
United States in 10 landmark cases — some of these I would like to 
mention in passing: <i>Halt v. Sarver, Jackson v. Bishop, Jackson v. Handrick, Jordan v. Fitzharris and Rockly v. Stanley</i> — stated that subhuman conditions in a prison is an unconstitutional imposition of cruel and unusual punishment. 
              </p><p> <b>I would just like to — even without an 
amendment — convince the Committee that if a prison is subhuman and it 
practices beatings and extended isolation of prisoners, and has sleeping
 cells which are extremely filthy and unsanitary, these conditions 
should be included in the concept of "cruel and inhuman punishment."</b>
 Even without amendment but with this concept, I would like to encourage
 the legislature to give higher priority to the upliftment of our jails 
and for the judiciary to act because the judiciary in <i>habeas corpus </i>proceedings
 freed some prisoners. So, by means of injunction, the courts stopped 
these practices which are inimical to the constitutional rights of 
inmates. On the part of the executive, it initiated reforms in order 
that the jails can be more humane and fair. <b>If this concept of "cruel
 and inhuman punishment" can be accepted, Mr. Presiding Officer, I may 
not even ask for an amendment so that in the future, the judiciary, the 
executive and the legislative can give more remedial measures to this 
festering problem of subhuman conditions in our jails and prisons.</b>
              </p><p> I submit, Mr. Presiding Officer. 
              </p><p> FR. BERNAS. Mr. Presiding Officer, although I 
would say that the description of the situation is something that is 
inhuman, I wonder if it fits into the purpose of Section 22. The purpose
 of Section 22 is to provide a norm for invalidating a penalty that is 
imposed by law. Let us say that thieves should be punished by 
imprisonment in a filthy prison, that would be "cruel and unusual 
punishment." But if the law simply say that thieves should be punished 
by imprisonment, that by itself does not say that it is cruel. So, it 
does not invalidate the penal law. So my own thinking is that what the 
Gentleman has in mind would be something more proper, even for ordinary 
legislation or, if at all, for Section 21. 
              </p><p> MR. NATIVIDAD. The Gentleman said that he is not 
going to sentence him in a filthy prison. Of course not. But this is 
brought out in the petition for <i>habeas corpus</i> or for injunction. This is revealed in a proper petition. 
              </p><p> FR. BERNAS. I agree with the Commissioner, but as I
 said, the purpose of Section 22 is to invalidate the law itself which 
imposes a penalty that is cruel, degrading or inhuman. That is the 
purpose of this law. The Commissioner's purpose is different. 
              </p><p> <b>MR. NATIVIDAD. My purpose is to abate the 
inhuman treatment, and thus give spirit and meaning to the banning of 
cruel and inhuman punishment. </b>In the United States, if the prison is
 declared unconstitutional, and what is enforced is an unconstitutional 
punishment, the courts, because of that interpretation of what is cruel 
and inhuman, may impose conditions to improve the prison; free the 
prisoners from jail; transfer all prisoners; close the prison; or may 
refuse to send prisoners to the jail.
              </p><p> FR. BERNAS. <b>We would await the formulation of the Commissioner's amendment.</b>
              </p><p> MR. NATIVIDAD. <b>So, in effect, it is abating the continuance of the imposition of a cruel and inhuman punishment.</b>
 I believe we have to start somewhere in giving hope to a big segment of
 our population who are helplessly caught in a trap. Even the detention 
prisoners, 85 percent of whom are jailed in the metropolitan area, are 
not convicted prisoners, and yet although not convicted in court, they 
are being made to suffer this cruel and inhuman punishment. I am saying 
this in their behalf, because as Chairman of the National Police 
Commission for so many years, it was my duty to send my investigators to
 chronicle the conditions in these jails day by day. I wrote letters to 
the President asking for his help, as well as to the Batasan, but there 
was no reply. 
              </p><p> Finally, I am now here in this Commission, and I 
am writing this letter through the Chairman of this Committee. I hope it
 will be answered. 
              </p><p> FR. BERNAS. <b>Mr. Presiding Officer, as I said, 
we have no quarrel whatsoever with the objective. We will await the 
formulation of the amendment.</b>
              </p><p> MR. NATIVIDAD. Thank you.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)           
          </p></blockquote>
          <p>When Commissioner Regalado E. Maambong posed the same 
concern as Commissioner Natividad, Fr. Joaquin G. Bernas again agreed 
that the formulation of the provision may be amended to integrate the 
protection being sought, <i>viz</i>.: </p>
          <blockquote> MR. MAAMBONG. Yes, so that I do not have to waste
 the time of the body and the Committee, considering that the Committee 
has understood our purpose, perhaps the Committee could help by giving 
us just one section to be inserted there or one sentence or one phrase 
which would satisfy the requirements that we have presented, <b>considering
 that in the United States, circumstances of this nature which happen 
inside the jail are considered under the provisions and jurisprudence of
 the United States as cruel and unusual punishment. Probably, we can 
have a parallel provision along that line and I hope the Committee will 
help.</b> Would that be all right?
              <p> FR. BERNAS. <b>Yes. And I thought the Gentleman already has the formula which we can discuss.</b>
              </p><p> THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bengzon). The Floor Leader is recognized.
              </p><p> MR. MAAMBONG. So, we reserve our right to insert something here in coordination with the Committee.
              </p><p> Thank you very much.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)            
          </p></blockquote>
          <p> During the period of amendments, several points were 
raised, including letting the legislature define the concept of 
substandard or inadequate facilities: 
          </p><blockquote>
            <p> FR. BERNAS. <b>This is more of a command to the State 
saying that beyond having recognized these things as prohibited, the 
State should do something to remedy whatever may be a violation.</b> </p>
            <p> x x x x</p>
            <p> FR. BERNAS. If we add the word "GROSSLY," we are almost saying that the legislature should act only if the situation is gross.</p>
            <p> MR. REGALADO. How do we determine what is substandard?</p>
            <p> FR. BERNAS. We leave that to the legislature. What I am 
saying is that the legislature could say: "Well, this is substandard but
 it is not grossly substandard; therefore, we need not do anything about
 it."</p>
            <p> MR. REGALADO. Could we have a happy compromise on how 
the substandard categorization could come in because it may be 
substandard from the standpoint of American models, but it may be 
sufficient for us?</p>
            <p> FR. BERNAS. I do not think we should go into great details on this. We are not legislating . . .</p>
            <p> MR. REGALADO. So, the sponsor's position is that we just
 leave it to the legislature to have a legislative standard of their own
 in the form of an ordinary legislation?</p>
            <p> FR. BERNAS. Yes. </p>
            <p> x x x x</p>
            <p> MR. RODRIGO. I would like to call attention to the fact 
that the word "DEGRADING" is already in the first sentence of this 
section: "Excessive fine shall not be imposed nor cruel, degrading or 
inhuman punishment inflicted." So, why repeat the word "DEGRADING"?</p>
            <p> FR. BERNAS. Precisely, Madam President, yesterday, we 
said that the provision we have in the present Constitution has 
reference to the punishment that is prescribed by the law itself; 
whereas what we are dealing with here is the punishment or condition 
which is actually being practised. In other words, we are, in the 
present Constitution, talking about punishment which, if imposed by the 
law, renders the law invalid.</p>
            <p> <b>In this paragraph, we are describing conditions of 
detainees who may be held under valid laws but are being treated in a 
manner that is subhuman or degrading. </b></p>
            <p> x x x x</p>
            <p> MR. FOZ. May I just ask one question of the proponent of
 the amendment. I get it that the law shall provide penalties for the 
conditions described by his amendment. </p>
            <p> MR. MAAMBONG. In line with the decisions of the Supreme 
Court on the interpretation of cruel and unusual punishments, there may 
be a law which punishes this violation precisely or there may not be a 
law. <b>What could happen is that the law could provide for some reliefs other than penalties.</b> </p>
            <p> <b>In the United States, there are what is known as 
injunctive or declaratory reliefs and that is not exactly in the form of
 a penalty. But I am not saying that the legislature is prevented from 
passing a law which will inflict punishment for violations of this 
section.</b> </p>
            <p> MR. FOZ. In case the law passed by the legislature would
 impose sanctions, not so much in the case of the first part of the 
amendment but in the case of the second part with regard to substandard 
or outmoded legal penal facilities characterized by degrading 
surroundings and insanitary or subhuman conditions, on whom should such 
sanctions be applied? </p>
            <p> MR. MAAMBONG. It would have to be applied on the 
administrators of that penal institution. In the United States, in my 
reading of the cases furnished to me by Commissioner Natividad, there 
are instances where the law or the courts themselves ordered the closure
 of a penal institution and, in extreme cases, in some states, they even
 set the prisoners free for violations of such a provision. </p>
            <p> MR. FOZ. I am concerned about the features described as 
substandard or outmoded penal facilities characterized by degrading 
surroundings, because we know very well the conditions in our jails, 
particularly in the local jails. It is not really the fault of those in 
charge of the jails but these conditions are the result of lack of funds
 and the support by local government, in the first instance, and by the 
national government. </p>
            <p> Does the Gentleman think we should penalize the jailers for outmoded penal facilities? </p>
            <p> MR. MAAMBONG. No, Madam President. <b>What we are trying
 to say is that lack of funds is a very convenient alibi for the State, 
and I think with these provisions, the State should do something about 
it.</b> </p>
            <p>MR. FOZ. Thank you, Madam President.</p>
            <p> FR. BERNAS. <b>Madam President, we are not telling the legislature what to do; we are just telling them that they should do something about it.</b></p>
            <p> MR. DE CASTRO. Madam President.</p>
            <p> THE PRESIDENT. Commissioner de Castro is recognized.</p>
            <p> MR. DE CASTRO. Thank you.</p>
            <p> The provision which says: "The employment of PHYSICAL, 
psychological OR DEGRADING PUNISHMENT against ANY PRISONER OR DETAINEE 
SHALL be dealt with BY LAW" is already provided for by our present laws.
 We already have laws against third-degree punishments or even 
psychological punishments. Do we still need this provision?</p>
            <p> Thank you. Madam President.</p>
            <p> MR. MAAMBONG. <b>As I was saying, Madam President, the law need not penalize; the law may only put in corrective measures as a remedy.</b></p>
            <p> MR. REGALADO. Madam President.</p>
            <p> THE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Regalado is recognized.</p>
            <p> MR. REGALADO. May I just rejoin the statement of 
Commissioner de Castro that we have laws already covering situations 
like this. The law we have on that in the Revised Penal Code is 
maltreatment of prisoners which comes from the original text <i>maltratos de los encarcerados</i>. That presupposes that the prisoner is incarcerated. </p>
            <p> The proposed legislation sought here will apply not only
 to incarcerated prisoners, but also to other detainees who, although 
not incarcerated, are nevertheless kept, their liberty of movement is 
controlled before incarceration. So, this is for the legislature to fill
 that void in the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) 
          </p></blockquote>
          
          <p> The foregoing exchanges, in my view, belie a restrictive 
interpretation that severely limits the application of Section 19, 
Article III. What is apparent instead is that the Framers reached a 
consensus on three important points: <i>first</i>, that the use of 
substandard or inadequate penal facilities under subhuman conditions 
constitutes cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment and shall be dealt 
with by legislation; <i>second</i>, that the said subhuman conditions during detention may be appreciated for <b>both</b> PDLs under preventive detention, and PDLs who are detained after conviction; and <i>third</i>, the State has the positive duty to undertake measures for the improvement of these conditions. 
          </p><p> Justice Delos Santos makes much of the fact that the 
second paragraph of Section 19, Article III contains the phrase "shall 
be dealt with by law," thus advancing the view that the Framers intended
 to leave to Congress the authority of determining the conditions for 
substandard or inhuman prison facilities and of providing penalties 
therefor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> It bears 
emphasis, however, that both Commissioners Natividad and Maambong 
referred to the United States (US) Supreme Court's interpretation of the
 Eighth Amendment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> in their Constitution, which similarly proscribes the infliction of cruel and inhuman punishment. 
          </p><p> Indeed, the US Supreme Court ruled in <em>Estelle v. Gamble</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (<i>Estelle</i>)
 that the Eighth Amendment, which traditionally proscribes physically 
barbarous punishments, should extend to the provision of adequate 
medical care to PDLs. The US Supreme Court, in effect, acknowledged the 
positive obligation of the State over PDLs in its custody, <i>to wit</i>: 
          </p><blockquote>
            <p>Our more recent cases, however, have held that the 
Amendment proscribes more than physically barbarous punishments. x x x 
The Amendment embodies "broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, 
civilized standards, humanity, and decency . . . ," x x x against which 
we must evaluate penal measures. Thus, we have held repugnant to the 
Eighth Amendment punishments which are incompatible with "the evolving 
standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society," x x 
x. </p>
            <p> <b>These elementary principles establish the 
government's obligation to provide medical care for those whom it is 
punishing by incarceration. An inmate must rely on prison authorities to
 treat his medical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those needs 
will not be met. In the worst cases, such a failure may actually produce
 physical "torture or a lingering death," x x x the evils of most 
immediate concern to the drafters of the Amendment. In less serious 
cases, denial of medical care may result in pain and suffering which no 
one suggests would serve any penological purpose. x x x The infliction 
of such unnecessary suffering is inconsistent with contemporary 
standards of decency as manifested in modern legislation codifying the 
common law view that "it is but just that the public be required to care
 for the prisoner, who cannot by reason of the deprivation of his 
liberty, care for himself."</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted)        
          </p></blockquote>
          <p> Thus, while torture is the ordinary and usual 
contemplation of cruel and inhuman punishment, the deliberations of the 
1986 Constitutional Commission reveal the explicit intention of the 
Framers to depart from or expand the understanding of this convention. 
For this reason, the Framers clearly agreed to extend the guarantee in 
Section 19, Article III for the protection against the employment of 
substandard prison facilities. That this "shall be dealt with by law" is
 an exhortation to the government — not only the legislature — to create
 or otherwise ensure humane conditions for PDLs during their 
incarceration. It is not a condition for Section 19 to operate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup>
          </p><p> In this regard, if the penal institutions are so 
grossly inadequate, there is a culpable omission on the part of the 
State to observe an affirmative obligation under the Constitution. 
Section 19, Article III may therefore be invoked to grant reliefs not 
only when, as suggested by some members, there is "flagrant or 
intentional infliction of pain or suffering,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> <b><u>but also when the conditions of incarceration are neglected to such a degree that the punishment becomes cruel and excessive</u></b>. 
          </p><p> It is also worth repeating, as cited by Justice Delos 
Santos, that as early as 1986, the Framers had wrestled with the means 
with which this deplorable situation of PDLs can be redressed. Over 
three decades ago, there was already an acute sense of failure of the 
detention system of the country, with one soberly recognizing that our 
detention facilities were "penological monstrosities"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> and another calling for an uplifting of the detention conditions to a "level of constitutional tolerability."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>
          </p><p> The above discussion only goes to show that the 
Framers neither intended to preclude individuals, such as the 
petitioners, from invoking the right under Section 19, Article III to 
obtain redress for their grievances, nor designed to foreclose any 
complementary action on the part of the Court or the Executive. In fact,
 a more circumspect consideration of the material deliberations draws a 
conceptualization of Section 19, Article III that is far from static, 
but is instead dynamic, and constantly attuned to the moral moorings and
 convictions of the times. In <i>Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup>
 which Justice Delos Santos likewise cites positively, the Court 
significantly held that "[w]hat is cruel and unusual 'is not fastened to
 the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes 
enlightened by a humane justice' and 'must draw its meaning from the 
evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing 
society.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup>
          </p><p> Against this backdrop, therefore, it is most difficult
 to surmise that during the Framers' deliberations, Section 19, Article 
III was conceived with the idea of minimizing its enforceability, or 
confining its remedial curative measures only to the Executive and the 
Legislative branches. If at all, it is perhaps even reasonably 
discernible that the appreciation of the severity of the condition in 
the detention facilities tilted the arc of the provision towards 
enabling <b><u>all three branches of the government</u></b> to be able to move within its powers to remedy the appalling conditions suffered by PDLs under custody. 
          </p><p> Of equal import, Commissioner Maambong remarked that 
"the law need not penalize; the law may only put in corrective measures 
as a remedy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> As I have 
already mentioned, there are laws already in place to protect the rights
 of PDLs against the employment of cruel, degrading, and inhuman 
punishment, from the moment of custodial investigation until the service
 of their sentence. R.A. 7438 and R.A. 9745 provide for penalties, while
 Article 32 of the Civil Code grants PDLs a recourse to collect damages 
in cases of violations of their rights. 
          </p><p> Verily, the Constitutional rights afforded to PDLs 
create corresponding duties on the part of the State to protect and 
promote them. In line with this, it is noteworthy that as early as 1955,
 the UN adopted the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of 
Prisoners (UNSMRTP), which constituted the universally acknowledged 
minimum standards for the management of prison facilities and the 
treatment of prisoners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> 
While these rules were merely recommendatory, they have been of 
tremendous value and influence in the development of prison laws, 
policies and practices in Member States all over the world.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> The UNSMRTP was subsequently revised in 2015 into what is now known as the <i>Nelson Mandela Rules</i>. The recent revision took into consideration the development of other international law instruments on human rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup>
          </p><p> The UNSMRTP and the <i>Nelson Mandela Rules </i>were 
concretized and situated within the sphere of the national experience 
mainly through the enabling laws of the two main agencies in charge of 
the country's prison system, namely the Bureau of Jail Management and 
Penology (BJMP) and the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor). These enabling 
laws contain the very corrective measures, as Commissioner Maambong 
adverted to during the deliberations, which seek to address the use of 
substandard or inadequate penal facilities under subhuman conditions. 
          </p><p> The BuCor's enabling statute, R.A. 10575,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup>
 explicitly declares as a policy the promotion of the general welfare 
and the safeguarding of prisoners' rights in the national penitentiary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup>
 For this purpose, R.A. 10575 vests the BuCor with the mandate of 
safekeeping national inmates, by ensuring the "decent provision of 
quarters, food, water and clothing <u>in compliance with established United Nations standards</u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup>
 Repeated references to the UNSMRTP are also made in its Revised 
Implementing Rules and Regulations (Revised IRR). Section 2 of said 
Revised IRR echoes the declaration of policy in the BuCor's enabling 
act, further stating that the basic rights of every prisoner should be 
safeguarded by, among other things, "creating an environment conducive 
to [the] rehabilitation [of prisoners] and compliant with the 
[UNSMRTP]." This section quotes the concept of imprisonment, in 
particular, as stated in Rule 57 of the UNSMRTP,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> <i>to wit</i>:
          </p><blockquote>
            <p>Imprisonment and other measures which result in cutting 
off an offender from the outside world are afflictive by the very fact 
of taking from the person the right of self-determination by depriving 
him of his liberty. Therefore <b>the prison system shall not, except as 
incidental to justifiable segregation or the maintenance of discipline, 
aggravate the suffering inherent in such a situation.</b> (Emphasis supplied) </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> The definition of safekeeping in the Revised IRR also 
expounded that the basic needs which PDLs must be provided with comprise
 of "<b>habitable quarters</b>, food, water, clothing, and <b>medical care</b>, <u>in compliance with the established UNSMRTP</u>, and consistent with restoring the dignity of every inmate and guaranteeing full respect for human rights."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup>
 It is likewise stated that the core objective of "according the dignity
 of man" to inmates while serving sentence is in accordance with the 
following provisions of the UNSMRTP:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup>
          </p><blockquote> 60. (1) <b>The regime of the institution 
should seek to minimize any differences between prison life and life at 
liberty which tend to lessen the responsibility of the prisoners or the 
respect due to their dignity as human beings. </b>
              <p> (2) Before the completion of the sentence, it is 
desirable that the necessary steps be taken to ensure for the prisoner a
 gradual return to life in society. This aim may be achieved, depending 
on the case, by a pre-release regime organized in the same institution 
or in another appropriate institution, or by release on trial under some
 kind of supervision which must not be entrusted to the police but 
should be combined with effective social aid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)          
          </p></blockquote>
          The enabling statute of the BJMP,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup>
 on the other hand, mandates a secure, clean, adequately equipped, and 
sanitary jail in every district, city and municipality, for the custody 
and safekeeping of detainees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> The mission of the BJMP is to enhance jail management by formulating policies and guidelines on <b>humane safekeeping</b> of inmates and ensuring their compliance in all district, city and municipal jails.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>
 One of its objectives is to ensure that the BJMP complies with the 
principles in the different international instruments relative to the 
humane treatment of inmates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> The BJMP likewise endeavors to improve the living conditions of offenders <u>in accordance with the accepted standards set by the United Nations</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup>
          <p> In the BJMP Operations Manual, what especially stands out 
are the provisions on the handling and safekeeping of inmates with 
special needs. Included herein are inmates who are pregnant,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> senior citizens,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> and infirm.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup>
 Section 43 also significantly provides that emergency plans for both 
natural and man-made calamities and other forms of jail disturbances 
shall be formulated to suit the physical structure and other factors 
peculiar to every jail. An epidemic is among the enumerated examples of a
 natural calamity. 
          </p><p> These laws affirm the State's duty of safekeeping 
PDLs, as carried out by the BuCor and BJMP, in relation to the 
constitutional proscription against cruel and inhumane punishment, and 
substandard conditions for penal facilities. At the same time, what may 
not be divorced from this proscription is the duty to protect the health
 of PDLs while incarcerated, and ultimately, realize their right to 
life,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> both fundamental rights — as I have stressed previously — which PDLs do not forfeit upon arrest and detention. 
          </p><p> As it stands, therefore, the right to health, as a "component to the right to life,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup>
 is inextricably linked with the guarantees under Section 19, Article 
III, of the Constitution, which are self-executing provisions and, as 
such, are judicially enforceable. 
          </p><p> Apart from the domestic laws earlier mentioned, the 
more relevant consideration is that the enabling statutes of the BuCor 
and the BJMP have expressly adopted the standards set by the UN for the 
safekeeping of PDLs. There is no question, therefore, that included 
herein are the universally accepted minimum standards set by the Nelson 
Mandela Rules. The BuCor's enabling law, in particular, has explicitly 
referred thereto. <b><u>Consequently, notwithstanding the non-binding and recommendatory nature of the <i>Nelson Mandela Rules</i>, they have effectively been transformed as part of the law of the land</u></b>.
          </p><p> Furthermore, flowing from the right to health 
guaranteed by ICESCR, PDLs cannot be discriminated upon when it comes to
 access to health facilities and services.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup>
 They are entitled to receive the same standard of care normally 
available to those not incarcerated. This is referred to as the 
principle of "equivalence of care,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup>
 initially adopted by the UN in General Assembly Resolution 37/194, 
which declared principles for the role of physicians in protecting PDLs 
against torture and cruel or degrading punishment:  
          </p><blockquote> Principle 1
              <p> Health personnel, particularly physicians, charged 
with the medical care of prisoners and detainees have a duty to provide 
them with protection of their physical and mental health and treatment 
of disease of <b>the same quality and standard as is afforded to those who are not imprisoned or detained.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)           
          </p></blockquote>
          <p> This was further echoed in Rule 24 of the <i>Nelson Mandela Rules</i>, which states that: 
          </p><blockquote>
            <p>1. The provision of health care for prisoners is a State responsibility. <b>Prisoners should enjoy the same standards of health care that are available in the community</b>,
 and should have access to necessary health-care services free of charge
 without discrimination on the grounds of their legal status. </p>
            <p>2. Health-care services should be organized in close 
relationship to the general public health administration and in a way 
that ensures continuity of treatment and care, including for HIV, 
tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, as well as for drug 
dependence. (Emphasis supplied) </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> It is interesting to note that under the BuCor Operating 
Manual, there is an evident adherence to the principle of equivalence 
and non-discrimination, which is apparent in the following provision:  
          </p><center>

qualified medical doctor and a dentist. (Emphasis supplied)         
          </p></blockquote>
          <p> Guided by the principle of equivalence of care, the 
petitioners and all other PDLs are entitled to the same safeguards 
against illnesses that are available to those not incarcerated. But 
considering the present state of our penal facilities, and in light of 
the gravity of the present pandemic, the fulfillment of the minimum 
standards for the safekeeping and health of PDLs has taken on a new 
sense of urgency. 
          </p><p> The problem with congestion within our penal 
facilities is no longer a disputable matter. The New Bilibid Prison 
alone reportedly has a 353% congestion rate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup>
 The acuteness of the consequences of overcrowded jails and prisons, 
however, has been sharpened by the highly infectious nature of COVID-19.
 The Court can take judicial notice of the precautions published by the 
World Health Organization on the import of social distancing and 
self-isolation as effective measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup>
 But given the notorious conditions within prison walls, these 
recommended measures intended for the protection of the health and 
safety of PDLs may well be unattainable. The respondents themselves, in 
their Comment, admitted to the near impossibility of adhering to these 
measures.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> In the context 
of the present global pandemic, therefore, the interwoven rights of PDLs
 run the risk of being impaired. And, while it might be true that 
respondents have taken steps to address and contain the spread of 
COVID-19 among the inmates, these measures may be easily negated by the 
congestion of prison facilities, which render PDLs vulnerable to the 
risk of contracting the virus. 
          </p><p> If the causal link between PDLs' poor health and 
exclusion from standards of care available to free individuals, on the 
one hand, and the fact of facility congestion on the other, are both 
sufficiently established, such may give rise to an actionable claim 
based on the violation of the proscription against cruel and inhuman 
punishment, and the State's commitment to various international law 
instruments. Such a claim may be demonstrably supported by a showing 
that within the present configuration of the prison systems, PDLs are 
deprived of the means to practice standard protocols to ensure their 
health, including even the simplest ones such as physical distancing and
 self-isolation. 
          </p><p> In the case of <i>Helling v. McKinney</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> (<i>Helling</i>),
 the US Supreme Court was confronted with the question of whether a 
prison inmate's health risk as a result of involuntary exposure to 
environmental tobacco smoke in the Nevada State prison was a proper 
basis for a claim under the Eighth Amendment. The US Supreme Court held 
that denial of a remedy for such health risk exposure was tantamount to 
deliberate indifference in the contemplation of<i> Estelle</i> and further rejected the proposition that only deliberate indifference to serious health problems was actionable, <i>viz</i>.: 
          </p><blockquote>
            <p>We have great difficulty agreeing that prison authorities
 may not be deliberately indifferent to an inmate's current health 
problems but may ignore a condition of confinement <b>that is sure <u>or very likely</u> to cause serious illness and needless suffering the next week or month or year</b>. In <i>Hutto v. Finney</i>,
 437 U. S. 678, 682 (1978), we noted that inmates in punitive isolation 
were crowded into cells and that some of them had infectious maladies 
such as hepatitis and venereal disease. This was one of the prison 
conditions for which the Eighth Amendment required a remedy, even though
 it was not alleged that the likely harm would occur immediately and 
even though the possible infection might not affect all of those 
exposed. We would think that a prison inmate also could successfully 
complain about demonstrably unsafe drinking water without waiting for an
 attack of dysentery. Nor can we hold that prison officials may be 
deliberately indifferent to the exposure of inmates to a serious, 
communicable disease on the ground that the complaining inmate shows no 
serious current symptoms. </p>
            <p><b>That the Eighth Amendment protects against future harm
 to inmates is not a novel proposition. The Amendment, as we have said, 
requires that inmates be furnished with the basic human needs, one of 
which is "<u>reasonable safety</u>.</b>" <i>DeShaney, supra</i>, at 200. <b>It is "cruel and unusual punishment to hold convicted criminals in unsafe conditions."</b> <i>Youngberg v. Romeo</i>,
 457 U. S. 307, 315-316 (1982). It would be odd to deny an injunction to
 inmates who plainly proved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in 
their prison on the ground that nothing yet had happened to them. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> Again, quite notably, the US Supreme Court proclaimed in <i>Helling</i>
 that there need not be an actual infection or affliction on the part of
 the inmate before the protection of the Eighth Amendment can apply. As 
applied to petitioners' situation, it is unnecessary to require them to 
submit to a physical examination, or to first show symptoms of COVID-19 
before recognizing a violation or threatened violation of their rights. 
Such a proposition may be evidence of indifference to the toll that 
substandard living conditions in our prison systems exact until it may 
be too late. Perhaps that premise has been rejected not in the least 
because it may well result in an exercise in futility, where the grave 
and possibly irreversible consequences on the right to health of PDLs 
must precede a proper recognition of such a right to begin with. I thus 
respectfully express my reservations to the proposition of some of my 
colleagues that absent a clear showing of the petitioners' health 
status, or that they are "actually suffering from a medical condition 
[requiring] immediate and specialized attention,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> the actual risk for the petitioners to contract COVID-19 in their respective penal facilities is speculative.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup>
          </p><p> In the later case of <i>Brown, et al. v. Plata, et al</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup>
 involving a protracted violation of inmates' rights in a California 
prison through substandard and unsafe conditions of detainment, the US 
Supreme Court held that a court-mandated decongestion of the prison 
facilities, as authorized by the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, 
was crucial in providing a remedy to these violations, and steps taken 
to that end should only be affirmed, <i>to wit</i>:  
          </p><blockquote> Yet so too is the continuing injury and harm 
resulting from these serious constitutional violations. For years the 
medical and mental health care provided by California's prisons has 
fallen short of minimum constitutional requirements and has failed to 
meet prisoners' basic health needs. Needless suffering and death have 
been the well-documented result. Over the whole course of years during 
which this litigation has been pending, no other remedies have been 
found to be sufficient. <b>Efforts to remedy the violation have been frustrated by severe overcrowding in California's prison system. </b>Short term gains in the provision of care have been eroded by the long-term effects of severe and pervasive overcrowding.
              <p> <b>Overcrowding has overtaken the limited resources of
 prison staff; imposed demands well beyond the capacity of medical and 
mental health facilities; and created unsanitary and unsafe conditions 
that make progress in the provision of care difficult or impossible to 
achieve. </b>The overcrowding is the "primary cause of the violation of a
 Federal right," 18 U. S. C. §3626(a)(3)(E)(i), specifically the severe 
and unlawful mistreatment of prisoners through grossly inadequate 
provision of medical and mental health care.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)           
          </p></blockquote>
          <p> Further echoing the ruling in <i>Estelle</i>, the US 
Supreme Court brought to the fore the positive duty on the part of the 
State to ensure the basic dignity of the human lives that it detains, 
premised on the fact that the detainees, by virtue of their detention, 
are severely limited in their capacity to ensure such dignity 
themselves, <i>viz</i>.:  
          </p><blockquote> As a consequence of their own actions, 
prisoners may be deprived of rights that are fundamental to liberty. Yet
 the law and the Constitution demand recognition of certain other 
rights. <b>Prisoners retain the essence of human dignity inherent in all
 persons. Respect for that dignity animates the Eighth Amendment 
prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. " 'The basic concept 
underlying the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of 
man.' "</b> <i>Atkins v. Virginia</i>, 536 U. S. 304, 311 (2002) (quoting <i>Trop v. Dulles</i>, 356 U. S. 86, 100 (1958) (plurality opinion)).
              <p> To incarcerate, society takes from prisoners the means
 to provide for their own needs. Prisoners are dependent on the State 
for food, clothing, and necessary medical care. <b>A prison's failure to provide sustenance for inmates "may actually produce physical 'torture or a lingering death.' "</b> <i>Estelle v. Gamble,</i> 429 U. S. 97, 103 (1976) (quoting <i>In re Kemmler</i>,
 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890)); see generally A. Elsner, Gates of 
Injustice: The Crisis in America's Prisons (2004). Just as a prisoner 
may starve if not fed, he or she may suffer or die if not provided 
adequate medical care<b>. A prison that deprives prisoners of basic 
sustenance, including adequate medical care, is incompatible with the 
concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)           
          </p></blockquote>
          <p> It bears emphasis, however, that in these cases, the US 
Supreme Court only ruled on the existence of causes of actions or 
possible claims under the Eighth Amendment, <b>but left it to the trial courts to try and hear said claims</b>,
 aided by the subjective and objective elements that plaintiffs would 
need to prove to establish an Eighth Amendment violation. 
          </p><p> There is no valid reason to depart from this practice 
of the US Supreme Court, considering that claims for violations of a 
PDL's fundamental rights are replete with factual matters best threshed 
out in the trial courts. Justice Bernabe is of the same view, 
recommending that the petition be referred to the appropriate trial 
court for a full-blown hearing on the petitioners' respective 
situations, which should be examined using the "deliberate indifference"
 test.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> <b><u>As such, in 
the same manner that the prayer of the petitioners for themselves and 
for other, similarly situated PDLs to be granted bail or recognizance 
must be brought before the proper trial court for hearings, so should 
any claim for violation under the proscription against cruel and inhuman
 punishment and substandard living conditions</u>.</b>
          </p><p> The Court, on a previous occasion, has affirmed its 
power to review alleged violations of the constitutional rights of PDLs.
 In <i>In the Matter of Petition for Habeas Corpus of Alejano v. Caubay</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> it held: 
          </p><blockquote> x x x Regulations and conditions in detention
 and prison facilities that violate the Constitutional rights of the 
detainees and prisoners will be reviewed by the courts on a case-by-case
 basis. The courts could afford injunctive relief or damages to the 
detainees and prisoners subjected to arbitrary and inhumane conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> </blockquote>
          <p> At this juncture, I return to the elephant in the room: 
the causal link between the congestion within prison walls and the 
exclusion of PDLs from the standard of care that should be made 
available to them. 
          </p><p> The Court should be mindful of the fact that the 
remedies of bail and recognizance are not available for every PDL. To be
 more precise, these remedies are not extended to PDLs who have already 
started serving their sentence. There should be no reason, however, to 
ignore their plight in the midst of this global pandemic, lest there 
arise a cause of action under the Constitution. It is important to note 
that the US cases referred to earlier were decided outside the 
circumstances of a global pandemic. It is with more reason that, in 
light of the current situation, the State should recognize and 
acknowledge the possible impairment of every PDL's basic right to life 
and human dignity. 
          </p><p> In a proper action initiated at a more opportune time,
 courts may be taken to task to provide relief against the employment of
 physical, psychological, or degrading punishment or against the use of 
substandard or inadequate penal facilities with subhuman conditions. The
 Court, unfortunately, must move only within the bounds of its 
jurisdiction; nonetheless, it has taken the necessary measures within 
its power, in order to guarantee the rights of PDLs in the face of this 
global pandemic. Ultimately, however, the task of providing farsighted 
and enduring solutions to the problem of overcrowding in penal 
facilities is a policy question and formulation that is best within the 
powers of the Legislative and Executive branches. 
          </p><p> All told, pursuant to the significant body of laws 
both within and outside our borders that affirms the positive rights of 
PDLs, I submit that it remains incumbent upon the State to organize and 
utilize its whole apparatus so that these human rights are safeguarded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup>
 In other words, any attendant limitation may not excuse a slackening of
 efforts, but on the contrary serve as compulsion for the State to 
exhaust all measures available to it to ensure that these fundamental 
rights of PDLs are appreciated as such. 
          </p><p>
            </p><center>
              <b> III. </b>

          <p> For its part, in the exercise of its mandate to promulgate
 rules concerning the protection and enforcement of constitutional 
rights<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> and its power of supervision over all persons in custody for purposes of eliminating unnecessary detention,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> the Court has been implementing systems in promoting rehabilitative and restorative criminal justice.

supplemented by various Court issuances aimed at ensuring easy access to
 PDLs of the different modes of securing provisional liberty. Taken

 which will cover all PDLs and may apply to all stages of newly-filed 
and pending criminal cases including, but not limited to, arraignment, 
pre-trial, bail hearings, trial proper, and promulgation. 
          </p><p> It is hoped that these measures are sufficient to 
address the exigencies brought about by the current pandemic for the 
benefit of PDLs, including the petitioners herein. 
          </p><p>
            </p><center>
              <b> IV. </b>
            </center>
          <p> In sum, the Court acknowledges the petitioners' and all 
other PDLs' current predicament in the face of this pandemic. Thus, 
prudence and exigency dictate that instead of denying the petition 
outright, the better course of action is to refer the petition to the 
respective trial courts for the conduct of bail proceedings. In the 
process, it is my view that the respective trial courts should also look
 into the petitioners' claims for violations of their rights under 
domestic and international laws to ensure that they are not subjected to
 arbitrary and inhumane conditions in their confinement. 
          </p><p> Indeed, the Court is not unmindful of the current 
situation faced by PDLs. The COVID-19 pandemic has become an 
unprecedented public health crisis, and the sickness and death it leaves
 in its wake have forced all of us to a reckoning. The incredible scale 
of the present problem has perhaps even begun to tug at the seams of the
 familiar limits of institutional jurisdictions. In the clamor to quell 
the spread of the virus on the one hand and address competing public 
concerns on the other, government institutions are hard-pressed at 
confronting issues that fall within the respective provinces of their 
agencies. 
          </p><p> It is also pivotal that all material institutions 
acknowledge that the issue of congestion in our prison systems, along 
with the manner by which it has been brought before the unforgiving 
light of this global pandemic, finds its root in an interplay of system 
failures, over which the penal system is not the sole author. <b>The sheer expanse of this crisis requires the synergized response that must outlive the present emergency, <u>from all three branches of government</u> and all relevant stakeholders.</b>
 Any measure that is less than farsighted and all-inclusive is a mere 
stop-gap that is myopic and wasteful at a time such as this. 
          </p><p> For its part, the Court, as the ultimate dispenser of 
justice, has taken concrete steps to address the matter at hand in ways 
allowed by law, as seen from the previous enumeration of issuances. To 
my mind, these circulars afford the petitioners sufficient reliefs for 
the protection of their rights. 
          </p><p> Verily, the Court has the unenviable role of balancing
 the scales of justice. In this exceptional time, justice compels the 
Court to exercise compassion and humanity but only within the parameters
 granted to it by law. The same spirit that moves the Court to address 
the concerns of PDLs also constrains it not to overstep its bounds. 
          </p><p> It is in this light that I <b>CONCUR</b> in the Court's disposition to <b>refer</b>
 the present bail and recognizance applications to the respective trial 
courts where the petitioners' criminal cases are pending, without 
prejudice to any relief available to the parties under the 
circumstances, and to <b>direct</b> the aforesaid trial courts to act on the petitioners' cases with<i> utmost dispatch</i>.

according to the OSG eliminate the need to grant temporary liberty to 
petitioners on bail for a specified amount or under recognizance.

            </p><p> The history of the court, of common law and the court of equity began with the legal reforms of King Henry II after 1154.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Administration of local courts became more centralized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Thus: 
            </p><blockquote> Henry II created a unified system of law 
"common" to the country as whole. This was in part the result of his 
practice of sending judges from his own central court to hear disputes 
throughout the country. Disputes were resolved on an ad hoc basis 
according to what the customs were interpreted to be. The king's judges 
then returned to the court, discussed their cases with other judges in a
 manner that permitted and required them to be used for the 
interpretation and application of the law in future cases. <b>In this 
way, the laws of England developed as "common-law" – the collection of 
judge-made decisions based on tradition, custom and precedent, as 
opposed to laws derived from statutes, a civil code or equity.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </blockquote>
            <p> By 1215, a court system was created: 
            </p><blockquote> The Court of Exchequer was developed to 
hear disputes where the Crown sought money it claimed it was owed and 
answered claims for money said to be owed by the Crown. The Court of 
Common Plea developed as a local court for civil trials between 
individuals. The Court of King's Bench developed as a court for more 
serious disputes and for the hearing of criminal cases....<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </blockquote>
            <p> Over time, procedure in the courts of common-law became <b>convoluted</b> and <b>ossified</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Litigants who felt they had been <b>cheated</b> or <b>had not been given justice</b> by courts of common-law petitioned the King in person.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <b>From this developed a system of equity</b>, administered by the Lord Chancellor, in the Court of Chancery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
            </p><p> It was observed that: 
            </p><blockquote> [51] The <b>basis for decision-making</b> in the Court of Chancery was <b>equity.</b> It was a <b>court of conscience</b> and<b> not a court of rules or laws</b>.
 An important distinction between court of equity (Chancery) and courts 
of law was that a jury had no role in interpreting the law or in matters
 of conscience. Only a judge could dispense equity."
                <p> [52] In courts of law, the opposite was the case. 
The jury answered questions of fact, originally by its own investigation
 and later solely from the evidence produced during a trial. <b>Equity and law were frequently in conflict</b>, and <b>litigation could continue for years as courts of law countermanded courts of equity</b> and<b> vice versa</b>. This was so even though, by the 17th century, it was established that equity should prevail over the common law.
                </p><p> [53] By the mid-19th century, <b>disputes between</b>, and <b>conflicting orders issued by, the courts of law</b> and <b>the courts of equity</b> had<b> led to</b> a <b>breakdown of the English legal system</b> - as reflected in Charles Dickens' Bleak House - and the <b>merger of the courts of law</b> and <b>the courts of equity by legislation</b> in 1873 and 1875. While the <b>principles of law and of equity remained distinct</b> for a time after merger, <b>legislation created</b> a <b>unified court system</b>. 
                </p><p> [54] Various statutes, both in England and in those common-law countries which derive their legal system from England, have <b>modified the practices and procedures by which courts determine matters of law and of equity</b>. For the most part they are based on the practices that pre-existed the English Judicature Act of 1873.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>             
            </p></blockquote>
            The legislation that merged courts of law and court of equity c<b>onferred no new rights</b> but they <b>confirmed the rights</b> that previously existed in these courts. The law <b>merely gave</b> to the courts the <b>jurisdiction</b> previously exercised by both the courts of common law and the Court of Chancery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Thereafter, there was the <b>complete consolidation</b> of <i>equitable </i>and <i>legal</i> <b>jurisdiction</b> and <b>practice and procedure</b> for both <i>equitable</i> and <i>legal</i> remedies in the courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
            <p> <b>Equitable</b> and <b>legal remedies differ from each other.</b> Successful litigants are <b>entitled</b> to<b> legal remedies</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The principal legal remedy is damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> There is however <b>no entitlement</b> to <b>equitable remedies</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> By the <b>very nature of equity</b>, they are <b>granted by</b> the <b>discretion</b> of the court and are <b>unlimited</b>.
            </p><p> <b>Equitable remedies</b> are called <b><i>such </i></b>because they <i><b>originated</b> from</i> the <b>court of equity</b>. However, through time, these once flexible <b>equitable remedies have</b> <i>themselves</i> <b>ossified into distinct rules</b> <i>like the common law remedies </i>they
 had meant to correct for being inflexible. Among the principal 
equitable remedies are declaratory judgments, injunctions, specific 
performance or contract modification, accounting, rescission, estoppel, 
proprietary remedies such as constructive trusts and tracing, 
subrogation, and equitable liens.
            </p><p> In the Philippines, it <b>does not make sense</b> to
 distinguish between common law and equitable jurisdictions and remedies
 except for historical purposes. This is because our jurisprudence has 
evolved and developed remedies fairly independently of their historical 
roots and has treated remedies <b>without</b> such distinctions. Thus, the Court does <b>not</b>
 have to refer to its supposed equity jurisdiction when it provides 
purportedly equitable remedies, and neither does the Court dispense 
supposed equitable remedies only through its purported equity 
jurisdiction.
            </p><p> The <b>evolution</b> of equitable remedies into <b>distinct rules</b> themselves demonstrates that <b>equity</b> is <b>far from</b> being a <b>willy-nilly</b> justice system. <b>Flexible principles</b> arising from the <b>exercise of equitable jurisdiction</b> and <b>their constant application</b> have developed a <b>juridical experience</b> that <b>crystallized</b> these <b>principles</b> into <b>defined rules</b>. In the words of a North American judge: 
            </p><blockquote> In recent years, there has been a <b>marked trend away from strict rules and towards flexibility</b> and <b>importing into the law</b> what can be described as <b>broad moral principles of reasonableness, fair dealing</b> and <b>good conscience</b>. These <b>principles point the judge deciding a case in a certain way, but they lack the precision</b> and <b>certainty of black letter rules</b> of law. Most of these doctrines <b>spring from</b> the tradition of <b>equity</b>. Historically, the <b>common law</b> was c<b>haracterized by its relatively rigid rule-based approach</b>, while <b>equity</b>, <b>the "court of conscience"</b>, came along to<b> relieve against the rigours</b> of the common law. But it was <b>never quite as simple</b> as that because the <b>common law method of developing rules in a case by case fashion has an inherent flexibility</b>. The <b>common law has gone through periods</b> characterized by <b>strict adherence to black letter doctrine and rigid application of rules</b>, while <b>at other times</b>, it has <b>emphasized</b> the need for <b>flexibility, growth</b> and renewal. <b>Equity</b> as well has <b>moved back and forth along the continuum</b>. In its <b>origins</b>, <b>equity</b> was based on <b>broad principles of morality and good conscience, but as experience was gained with the application</b> of those principles, <b>they tended to crystallize into rules </b>and <b>equity</b> itself <b>became rigid</b>.
 By the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, both the 
common law and equity appear to have reached this point. . . In the 
latter part of the twentieth century, there has been something of a 
resurgence of the spirit of equity. . . . <b>Reliance on broad statements of principle</b> rather than strict rules arises not only from the desire for <b>flexibility</b> and the <b>need to ensure justice</b> in the particular case. It is <b>also characteristic of the first step in a fundamental change in the law</b>. When a <b>new doctrine</b> emerges, it may only be possible to sketch out in <b>general terms</b>. <b>Over time, cases are decided, gaps are filled and there develops a body of doctrine.</b>
 The good neighbour duty of care principle in negligence law pronounced 
by Lord Atkin in Donohue v. Stephenson provides an example of common law
 rule which began as a broad statement of principle . . . I would 
suggest that the modern principles relating to fiduciary, unjust 
enrichment and constructive trust fall into a similar category.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </blockquote>
            In this sense, it may be said that petitioners <b>have loosely used</b> the <b>concept of equity</b> to found their plea to be released on bail or recognizance when <b>allegedly</b> they are otherwise not allowed to. As we have said, we <b>never had that division</b> between a court of common law and a court of equity, and in reality, our legal system is a <b>hybrid</b> or <b>a cross</b> between the common and the civil law jurisdictions. As well, our jurisprudence <b>does not allow</b> equity to supplant and contravene the provision of law clearly applicable to a case, and conversely, <b>cannot give</b> validity to an act that is prohibited by law or one that is against public policy.
            <p> In this light, <b>respondents' objection</b> to the use of the word <b>"humanitarian"</b> in their Comment's prefatory may <b>appear to be justified</b> since petitioners <b>could have grounded</b> their prayer upon <b>established law</b> or <b>jurisprudence</b> without having to summon the <b>amorphou</b>s and <b>value-laden adjectives</b> <i>humanitarian</i> or <i>equitable</i>.
            </p><p> Verily, it is <b>not necessary</b> to invoke <b>equity</b> or<b> humanitarianism</b> so courts could have the <b>needed flexibility to do justice</b>
 in a particular case under specifically unique circumstances, or to be

 and good conscience in resolving issues. <b>Articles 9</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and <b>10</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of our <b><i>Civil Code</i></b> already provide the <b>legal bases </b>for doing so.

            <p>The <b>availability of bail</b> to an accused charged with crimes punishable by death, life imprisonment or <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, however, has been <b>modified</b> to significant extents by our ruling in <b><i>Enrile v. Sandiganbayan</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></p>
            <p> In <b><i>Enrile</i></b>, despite the absence of a bail 
hearing where the prosecution could have proved that the evidence of 
guilt is strong, the Court allowed Senator Enrile to post bail on 
account of his <b>exceptional circumstances</b> (<i>i.e.</i>, advanced age and ill health requiring special medical attention) and the bottom line that <b>he was not a flight risk</b>. Despite the vigorous and well-reasoned <b>Opinion</b> of Justice Leonen, the Court made room for <b>flexibility</b> and <b>broad moral principles</b>, as we <b>re-stated</b> the rule from <b><i>Dela Rama v. The People's Court</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> as follows: 
            </p><blockquote>
              <p> Bail for the provisional liberty of the accused, 
regardless of the crime charged, should be allowed independently of the 
merits of the charge, <b>provided his continued incarceration is clearly shown to be injurious to his health or to endanger his life</b>. Indeed, <b>denying him bail despite imperiling his health and life would not serve the true objective of preventive incarceration</b> during the trial. . . . It is relevant to observe that granting provisional liberty to Enrile will then <b>enable
 him to have his medical condition be properly addressed and better 
attended to by competent physicians in the hospitals of his choice</b>. This will not only aid in his adequate preparation of his defense but, more importantly, will <b>guarantee his appearance in court for the trial</b>.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> <b><i>Enrile</i></b> has ingrained in jurisprudence a <b>two-step test</b> to authorize the grant of bail when it is <b>discretionary</b> to do so: <b>(a)</b> the detainee will not be a flight risk or a danger to the community; and <b>(b)</b> there exist special, humanitarian and compelling circumstances. This <b>test</b> involves the <b>balancing of factual and legal factors</b> before resolving to grant or deny the application for bail. 
            </p><p> Through <b><i>Enrile</i></b>, our jurisprudence <b>has thus incorporated</b> the <b>degree of flexibility</b> and the <b>broad moral principles</b> to the <b>black-letter law on bail as a matter of discretion</b> to the <b>extent necessary</b> to serve complete justice in particular situations, first, in <b><i>Dela Rama</i></b>, and later, in <b><i>Enrile</i></b>.
            </p><p> <b>Rather than an exercise of equitable jurisdiction in its strict historical sense</b>, the <b>reasoning</b> and <b>disposition</b> in <i>Enrile</i> is an <b>illustration</b> of the <i>Civil Code</i> provisions that "<i>[n]o judge or court shall decline to render judgment by reason of the silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the laws</i>," and "<i>[i]n
 case of doubt in the interpretation or application of laws, it is 
presumed that the lawmaking body intended right and justice to prevail.</i>"
            </p><p> In <b><i>Enrile</i></b>, the Court <b>did not reference</b> equitable principles in the <b>strict historical sense</b> of a body of rules as a counterpoint to those established among courts of common law. Perhaps in the <b>loose sense</b> of equity being the equivalent of flexibility and broad moral principles, <b><i>Enrile</i></b> stands for this proposition <b>and more</b>. 
            </p><p> <b><i>Enrile</i></b> was <b>expressly conscious to build on earlier case law</b> to serve complete justice to Senator Enrile's circumstances. It is <b>not</b> a <b>random</b> or a <b>cowboy sense of justice</b> that it was serving, but one <b>anchored on rules founded a long time ago</b>. 
            </p><p> <b><i>Enrile</i></b> thus represents what has been said about<b> common law being itself flexible</b> and <b>accommodating of broad moral principles</b> without having to distinguish it from and summoning <b>equity</b>. We were able to <b>navigate through the established rules</b> on bail as a matter of discretion to <b>arrive at</b> a conclusion that we thought would <b>not</b> have been possible under established rules <b>but nonetheless consistent</b> with the <b>stability </b>and <b>predictability</b> valued in every legal system. 
            </p><p> The learned Justice Leonen reiterates his <b>principled stand</b> to dissent from the doctrine set forth in <b><i>Enrile</i></b>
 and therefore to refuse applying its ruling in subsequent cases. I 
deeply admire his consistency in this regard. But we have to ask 
ourselves, what are we to do with this En Banc <i>Decision</i>?
            </p><p> Article 8 of the <i>Civil Code</i> states that 
"[j]udicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the 
Constitution shall form a part of the legal system of the Philippines."
            </p><p> <b><i>Enrile</i></b> is a clear and categorical statement of <b>positive law</b>
 pursuant to the Court's constitutional and inherent power to "settle 
actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and

abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the 
part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
 and "to promulgate rules and procedures for the protection and 
enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure 
in all courts."
            </p><p> For better or for worse, until overturned, our jurisprudence has to reckon with <b><i>Enrile</i></b> as a rule that may be invoked and should be applied whenever the circumstances of a case call for it. 
            </p><p>As judges, we are "the visible representation of the 
law, and more importantly, of justice. It is from [the judge] that the 
people draw their will and awareness to obey the law. For the judge to

himself."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
            </p><p> On the other hand, my learned senior brethren, Justice Caguioa, specifically referred to my opinion on <b><i>Enrile</i></b> as follows: 
            </p><blockquote>
              <p>xxx. For the same reason above, I disagree with the position that <i>Enrile</i>
 has ingrained in jurisprudence a two-step test to authorize the grant 
of bail when it is discretionary to do so: (a) the detainee will not be a
 flight risk or a danger to the community; and (b) there exist special, 
humanitarian and compelling circumstances. <b>The ruling in <i>Enrile</i> deviates from entrenched legal principles concerning bail and it cannot be used to create doctrine for subsequent cases.</b> To reiterate, petitioner therein was allowed to post bail even though he was charged with an offense punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, without any showing through a hearing that the evidence of his guilt is not strong. <b>Having skirted the minimum requirements under the Constitution regarding bail, the ruling in <i>Enrile</i> should not be used to set precedent for cases involving discretionary bail.</b> </p>
              <p>Moreover, <b>the grant of bail in <i>Enrile</i> on the basis of petitioner's age and health rests on shaky ground</b> as the circumstances therein were quite peculiar. As illustrated in Justice Leonen's Dissenting Opinion therein: </p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <blockquote> Neither was there grave abuse of discretion 
by the Sandiganbayan when it failed to release accused on bail for 
medical or humanitarian reasons. His release for medical and 
humanitarian reasons was not the basis for his prayer in his Motion to 
Fix Bail filed before the Sandiganbayan. Neither did he base his prayer 
for the grant of bail in this Petition on his medical condition.
                  <p> <b>The grant of bail, therefore, by the majority is a special accommodation for petitioner.</b> It is <b>based on a ground never raised before the Sandiganbayan or in the pleadings filed before this court.</b> The Sandiganbayan should not be faulted for not shedding their neutrality and impartiality. It is <b>not
 the duty of an impartial court to find what it deems a better argument 
for the accused at the expense of the prosecution and the people</b> they represent. 
                  </p><p> The allegation that petitioner suffers from 
medical conditions that require very special treatment is a question of 
fact. We cannot take judicial notice of the truth contained in a 
certification coming from one doctor. This doctor has to be presented as
 an expert witness who will be subjected to both direct and cross 
examination so that he can properly manifest to the court the physical 
basis for his inferences as well as the nature of the medical condition 
of petitioner. Rebutting evidence that may be presented by the 
prosecution should also be considered. All this would be proper before 
the Sandiganbayan. Again, none of this was considered by the 
Sandiganbayan because petitioner insisted that he was entitled to bail 
as a matter of right on grounds other than his medical condition. 
                  </p><p> Furthermore, <b>the majority's opinion</b> -- other than the invocation of a general human rights principle -- <b>does not provide clear legal basis for the grant of bail on humanitarian grounds.</b>
 Bail for humanitarian considerations is neither presently provided in 
our Rules of Court nor found in any statute or provision of the 
Constitution. 
                  </p><p> This case <b>leaves this court open</b> to a <b>justifiable criticism</b> of granting a <b>privilege ad hoc: only for one person</b> -- petitioner in this case. 
                  </p><p> <b>Worse, it puts pressure on all trial courts
 and the Sandiganbayan that will predictably be deluged with motions to 
fix bail on the basis of humanitarian considerations. The lower courts 
will have to decide, without guidance, whether bail should be granted

 will have to decide whether this is applicable only to Senators and 
former Presidents charged with plunder and not to those accused of drug 
trafficking, multiple incestuous rape, serious illegal detention, and 
other crimes punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua </i>or life 
imprisonment. They will have to decide whether this is applicable only 
to those who are in special detention facilities and not to the aging or
 sick detainees in overcrowded detention facilities all over this 
country. 
                  </p><p> <b>Our trial courts and the Sandiganbayan will decide on the basis of personal discretion </b>causing petitions for <i>certiorari</i> to be filed before this court. This will usher in <b>an
 era of truly selective justice not based on clear legal provisions, but
 one that is unpredictable, partial, and solely grounded on</b> the presence or absence of <b>human compassion on the day</b> that justices of this court deliberate and vote.              
              </p></blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote> Ergo, a <b>reading of the ruling in <i>Enrile</i> shows that there is no discernible standard</b>
 for the courts to decide cases involving discretionary bail on the 
basis of humanitarian considerations. The ineluctable conclusion, as 
opined by Justice Leonen, is that <b>the grant of bail by the majority in <i>Enrile</i> was a special accommodation for petitioner therein</b>. Thus, at the risk of being repetitious, <b>the ruling in <i>Enrile</i> should be considered as a stray decision</b> and, echoing Justice Bernabe, must likewise be <b>considered as <i>pro hac vice</i>.</b> It<b>
 should not be used as the benchmark in deciding cases involving the 
question on whether bail may be allowed on the basis of humanitarian 
considerations. </b>Notably,<b> under the Rules of Court, humanitarian considerations</b> such as age and health <b>are only taken into account in fixing the bail amount</b> after a determination that evidence of guilt against the accused is not strong.
                <p> However, petitioners are not left without any other recourse that is legally permissible. Despite the inapplicability of<i> Enrile</i>
 and in view of the novel nature of this case, the Court should not be 
precluded from affording petitioners the appropriate reliefs within the 
bounds of law. 
                </p><p> In this regard, a proper bail hearing before the
 trial court should first be conducted to determine whether the evidence
 of guilt against the petitioners is strong. This Court, not being a 
trier of facts, cannot receive and weigh petitioners' evidence at the 
first instance. Factual and evidentiary matters must first be threshed 
out in a proper bail hearing, which may only be done in the lower 
courts. Trial courts are better equipped to assess petitioners' 
entitlement to bail or recognizance based on the provisions of the 
Constitution, the relevant laws, and the Rules of Court. 
                </p><p> Thus, instead of dismissing the petition outright, I join Justice Bernabe's recommendation <b>to refer or remand this petition to the concerned trial courts.</b>
                </p><p> Exigency is better served if the trial courts <b>where the criminal cases of petitioners are respectively pending will hear their bail petitions and receive their evidence.</b>             
            </p></blockquote>
            With all due respect, I truly cannot read <b><i>Enrile</i></b> through Justice Leonen's eagle eyes because his reading is simply <b>not </b>the
 Supreme Court's decision. Justice Leonen was very emphatic about the 
Court's favorable treatment of Senator Enrile, but the Majority chose <b>not</b> to side with him and to believe otherwise.
            <p> The Majority did <b>not</b> describe <b><i>Enrile</i></b> as a ruling for the <b>sole</b> and <b>exclusive benefit </b>of Senator Enrile. The Majority <b>could not </b>have said that <b><i>Enrile</i></b> was <i><b>pro hac vice</b></i> because that would have <b>only validated</b> what Justice Leonen has long been articulating about the decision – <b>that we have a justice system for the powerful and another justice system for the powerless.</b> Any reading of <b><i>Enrile</i></b> will <b><i>never</i></b> elicit that admission. 
            </p><p> The Majority, I am sure, especially then Chief Justice Lucas P. Bersamin, will <b>never</b> admit enunciating a<b> ground-breaking doctrine</b>
 only to favor and pander to "Senators and former Presidents charged 
with plunder and not to those accused of drug trafficking, multiple 
incestuous rape, serious illegal detention, and other crimes punishable 
by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or life imprisonment. . . . those who are

 down doctrines to pamper the powerful, to grant a "privilege ad hoc: 
only for one person," that <b><i>Enrile</i></b> applies only to Senator Enrile because of who and what he is. 
            </p><p> Another <b>unfortunate</b> consequence of characterizing Senator Enrile's eponymous hit ruling as <b><i>pro hac vice</i></b> is <b>to apply</b> the <b>rejection</b> of the <b><i>Enrile</i></b> doctrine <b><i>retroactively</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <b>During this pandemic</b>, an <b>exceptional</b> circumstance, it <b>at once</b> denies petitioners at least their <b>right to invoke</b> the <b><i>Enrile</i></b> doctrine to their cause, for the simple reason that it was crafted and <b>especially tailored-fit solely</b> for Senator Enrile's benefit.

            <p>A true scholar, Justice Leonen carefully dissects the 
international and local laws to determine the rights of PDLs as PDLs, 
and the problematic implementation of these rights. He then narrows down
 the problem areas among the plethora of these rights to that specific 
matter which is of public knowledge, or is capable of unquestionable 
demonstration, or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial 
functions – the problem, of congestion in our holding centers. Thus: </p>
            <blockquote>The Court may take judicial notice of the nature
 of COVID-19 and the long standing jail congestion which has plagued the
 Philippine jails and how this unresolved crisis is a significant threat
 to the right to life, health, and security of persons detained in such 
conditions. </blockquote>
            I agree with Justice Leonen that the Court may take judicial
 notice of jail congestion. This problem has long hounded our holding 
centers that the Court has once mandated judges to conduct jail 
visitations in an effort to decrease inmate population and proffer 
suggestions for better management of these facilities.
            <p> I also agree with Justice Leonen that the Philippines 
has incorporated the minimum standards on the treatment of PDLs in 
international law into our local laws, and as a result, the minimum 
standards may be judicially enforced. 
            </p><p> I respectfully disagree, however, with the argument 
that an infringement of these minimum standards, such as the 
overcrowding in jails, is tantamount to cruel and inhuman punishment, 
because these minimum standards "operationalize the right against cruel 
and inhuman punishment."
            </p><p> Our jurisprudence has taken a conservative approach to the constitutional proscription against cruel and inhuman punishment. 
            </p><p> <b><i>Maturan v. Commission on Elections</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> reiterated its conceptualization as extending only to situations of <b>extreme</b> corporal or psychological <b>form</b> or <b>character</b> of the <b>punishment</b> rather than its <b>severity</b> in respect of its <i>duration</i> or <i>amount</i>, and –
            </p><blockquote> ... applies to punishments which never 
existed in America or which public sentiment regards as cruel or 
obsolete. This refers, for instance, to those inflicted at the whipping 
post or in the pillory, to burning at the stake, breaking on the wheel, 
disemboweling and the like. The fact that the penalty is severe provides
 insufficient basis to declare a law unconstitutional and does not, by 
that circumstance alone, make it cruel and inhuman. </blockquote>
            <b><i>Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> excluded from the meaning of cruel and inhuman punishment the infliction of pain or distress that is <b>merely incidental</b> in <b>carrying out</b> the punishment. It <i>rejected</i> cruelty as the mere infliction of pain or suffering, because if it were, no one would ever be punished at all. <b><i>Echegaray</i></b> held that "[t]he cruelty against which the Constitution protects a convicted man is <b>cruelty inherent in the method</b> of punishment, <b>not the necessary suffering involved in any method</b> employed to extinguish life humanely."
            <p> While the <b>minimum standards on the treatment of PDLs</b> are no doubt part and parcel of protecting, defending and promoting the dignity of PDLs, <b>their infringement</b> does <b>not</b> rise to the level of <b>what we have conceived</b> to be <b>cruel and inhuman punishment</b>. The minimum standards have <b>nothing to do</b> with the <b>form, character,</b> or <b>method</b> of punishment, and though subpar PDL conditions may affect the <b>severity</b> of the punishment meted out, this is just <b>incidental </b>to the implementation of the punishment. 
            </p><p> It is true that <b>jail congestion</b> impacts more on the PDLs' right to life and its cognate rights under Section 1, Article III of the <i>Constitution</i> <b>amidst the pandemic</b> than during ordinary times. 
            </p><p> It is <b>equally true</b>, however, that if the right to life contemplates the existence only of <b>negative rights </b>or<b> rights of non-interference</b>, in order <b>to establish a breach of the right to life</b>, a claimant <b>must first show</b> that he or she <b>was deprived</b> of his or her right to life and its cognate rights, and <b>then must establish</b> that <b>the State caused such deprivation</b> without due process of law. <b>Active State interference</b> with one's life, security or health by way of some <b>affirmative</b>, <b>positive</b>, or <b>definitive</b> act will be <b>necessary</b> in order to engage the protection of this right. There will <b>also</b> be a <b>need to establish a causal link</b> between State action and harm alleged to have been suffered. This<b> requires </b>searching for a <b>causal nexus</b> tying the State to petitioners' inability to exercise their right to life. Such a <b>nexus</b> could only ever be established by pointing to a <b>positive state action giving rise to the aggrieved condition.</b>
            </p><p> The Court has thus held:  
            </p><blockquote> The legitimacy of a government is 
established and its functions delineated in the Constitution. From the 
Constitution flows all the powers of government in the same manner that 
it sets the limits for their proper exercise. In particular, <b>the Bill
 of Rights functions primarily as a deterrent to any display of 
arbitrariness on the part of the government or any of its 
instrumentalities.</b> It serves as the general safeguard, as is 
apparent in its first section which states, "No person shall be deprived
 of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall any 
person be denied the equal protection of the laws." Specifically, <b>due process is a requirement for the validity of any governmental action amounting to deprivation</b> of liberty or property. It is a <b>restraint on state action</b>
 not only in terms of what it amounts to but how it is accomplished. Its
 range thus covers both the ends sought to be achieved by officialdom as
 well as the means for their realization.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </blockquote>
            Here, we <b>cannot fault respondents</b> for the <b>increased risks</b> to life, security and health brought about by COVID-19 <b>even among the inmates</b>, including petitioners, of our <b>overcrowded</b> jail facilities. In a manner of speaking, paraphrasing one classic song, respondents <i>did not light the fire</i> as it seemed <i>to have always been burning since the world has been turning</i>. They <b>have not engaged </b>in any <b>definitive, affirmative</b> or <b>positive State action</b> to cause such increased risks of deprivation.
            <p> Nevertheless,<b> even if</b> the right to life does <b>not</b> contemplate the existence <b>only</b> of<b> negative rights</b> (<i>i.e</i>., to identify some <b>definitive, affirmative</b> or <b>positive</b> act, <b>in contrast</b> to<b> mere inaction</b>,
 on the part of the State which could be said to constitute an 
interference with this right and consequently ground the claim of a 
violation) and has <b>positive rights dimension</b> (<i>i.e</i>., whether the right to life i<b>mposes on the State a duty to act</b> where it has not done so), I would have <strong>reached the same conclusion</strong> that respondents <strong>did not breach </strong>petitioners' or any other PDL's right to life <strong>amidst the increased dangers</strong> to life, security and health<strong> caused by</strong> the <strong>pandemic</strong>.
      
        </p><p> If the right to life includes a <strong>positive dimension</strong>, such that it is <strong>not merely</strong> a <strong>right of non-interference but also a right of performance</strong>, then it is <strong>violable</strong> even by <strong>mere inaction</strong> or <strong>failure</strong> by the State <strong>to actively provide the conditions necessary</strong> for its fulfilment, or to<strong> alleviate petitioners' condition</strong>, and <strong>not</strong> on whether the State can be held causally responsible for the aggrieved's condition in the first place.
          </p><p> Here, respondents <strong>have taken positive measures</strong>
 to minimize the spread of COVID-19 within holding centers and the 
infection of petitioners and other PDLs of this disease. They have <strong>not</strong> remained idle and inactive to simply let the PDLs be afflicted. They have <strong>actively endeavoured to block</strong> the conditions necessary for the virus' contagion and to<strong> alleviate petitioners' increased risks</strong> to this viral infection.
          </p><p> While these measures may <strong>not</strong> be enough, their <strong>inadequacy</strong> is<strong> attributable</strong> to so <strong>many varied factors</strong>. These <strong>factors</strong> are <strong>beyond respondents' control</strong> and <strong>levels of authority and responsibility</strong>, and include the <strong>unpredictable</strong> nature of the pandemic and, should there be finger-pointing at this time, the <strong>collective and systemic inadequacies not only</strong> of <strong>all </strong>the institutions and stakeholders in our criminal justice system, <strong>but also</strong> of the entire State machinery responsible for the allocation of limited resources.
          </p><p> We may take<strong> judicial notice</strong> of the<strong> pitfalls</strong> in complying with the minimum standards of the treatment of PDLs. It is<strong> factual </strong>and <strong>accurate</strong> that there is <strong>overcrowding</strong> in most of our jails.
          </p><p> However, <strong>attributing</strong> this setback <strong>solely</strong> to respondents is both unfair and inaccurate. We may take<strong> judicial notice</strong> of the publicly known fact that respondents <strong>do not also want</strong> this dire situation happening in their facilities. But what can they do? The <strong>population</strong> and<strong> facilities </strong>in their holding centers are the <strong>outcomes of so many variables</strong> outside their control and competence.
          </p><p> <strong>Neither</strong> will it be<strong> correct </strong>to<strong> remediate</strong> this concern by directing the<strong> release of such number of PDLs</strong> as would match the holding centers' respective capacities.
          </p><p> To begin with, there is <strong>no law</strong> which <strong>requires</strong> this type of relief or remedy for an<strong> innocent slip-up </strong>or <strong>non-compliance</strong> with the minimum standards.<strong> Neither</strong> is it <strong>beneficial</strong>, <strong>desirable</strong> nor <strong>practicable</strong>. In fact, granting <strong>this type</strong> of relief or remedy will put the Court on the spot and in a<strong> compromising slippery slope position</strong> where <strong>we would have to order the release </strong>of a PDL each time a minimum standard is <strong>not</strong>
 met, simply because of the theory that these minimum standards as to 
safety, sanitary, and sufficient provisions and facilities <em>operationalize the right against cruel and inhuman punishment.</em>
          </p><p> More, the present case is <strong>not about </strong>vindicating the rights of <strong>all PDLs</strong> to the minimum standards of treatment. The petition is about petitioners' concerns, and while petitioners and some of us may <strong>want to extend</strong> its beneficial effects <strong>to other PDLs</strong>, this <strong>only rests on</strong> and is <strong>only due</strong> <strong>to</strong> the <strong>impact of the pandemic</strong>.
          </p><p> In any event, since the case here is<strong> not per se</strong> about the enforcement of the minimum standards, it would <b>not</b> be fair and wise <strong>to deal with</strong> the forms of <strong>relief </strong>or <strong>remedy</strong> for the alleged infringement thereof <strong>without</strong> hearing from respondents. <strong>Before crafting the relief or remedy</strong>, respondents <strong>must first be heard to shed light</strong> on the infringement, if any, and its nature and impact, and their justifications for such state of affairs.

            <p>Petitioners are <b>not</b> the only ones seeking urgent ameliorative measures at detention facilities.</p>
            <p> As the petition has poignantly stressed, which the Court can take judicial notice of, <strong>several other countries</strong> have reacted <strong>swiftly</strong> to beat, or at least so their leaders thought, COVID-19 to the draw. We rely on <strong>online news feeds</strong> to validate petitioners' claims that detainees or prisoners <strong>have indeed been released</strong> in other countries as one of the countermeasures against the virus and its disease. We <strong>cannot vouch</strong> however for the <strong>circumstances</strong> of their detainees' or prisoners' release and the<strong> issues </strong>and the <strong>decision-making process</strong> that went with this <strong>countermeasure</strong>, if it were the result of a <strong>political,</strong> <strong>administrative,</strong> or<strong> judicial</strong> decision.
            </p><p> The <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong>
 has published an interim guidance on how to deal with the virus and its
 disease in prisons and other places of detention, entitled 
"Preparedness, prevention and control of COVID-19 in prisons and other 
places of detention." <strong>WHO</strong> describes the material and its rationale, as follows:
            </p><blockquote>
              <p> The guidance <strong>provides useful information</strong> to staff and health care providers working in prisons, and to prison authorities. It <strong>explains how to prevent and address a potential disease outbreak</strong>
 and stresses important human rights elements that must be respected in 
the response to COVID-19 in prisons and other places of detention. 
Access to information and adequate health care provision, including for 
mental disorders, are essential aspects in preserving human rights in 
such places.</p>
              <p> <strong>Controlling the spread of infection in these settings is essential for preventing large outbreaks</strong> of COVID-19. The guidance aims<strong>
 to protect the health and well-being of all those who live, work in and
 visit these settings</strong> and<strong> the general population at large</strong>. 
People deprived of their liberty, and those living or working in 
enclosed environments in their close proximity, are likely to be more 
vulnerable to the COVID-19 disease than the general population. 
Moreover,<strong> correctional facilities may amplify and enhance COVID-19 transmission beyond their walls.</strong>
 According to the newly published WHO guidance, the global effort to 
tackle the spread of disease may fail without proper attention to 
infection control measures within prisons.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p>

            <p> <strong>Indonesia</strong> has released nearly 23,000 
prisoners out of the projected release of 30,000 prisoners who have 
served two-thirds of their respective sentences.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> This is meant to reduce inmate population and prevent the rapid spread of the virus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>

            </p><blockquote>
              <p> In response, officials have begun to take action. On 
the federal level, Attorney General William Barr released a memo last 
week that ordered the Federal Bureau of Prisons to identify "at-risk 
inmates who -are non-violent and pose minimal likelihood of recidivism 
and who might be safer serving their sentences in home confinement." His
 plan, however, has been criticized because these inmates will be 
identified by an algorithm that the Marshall Project reports is biased 
toward white people.</p>
              <p> And realistically, it's state officials that need to 
take bolder action: There are only about 226,000 people locked up in 
federal facilities compared to the nearly 1.3 million in state prisons, 
according to the Prison Policy Institute. Some have begun to release the
 incarcerated. Most recently, California announced that it would let out
 3,500 nonviolent inmates in the next 60 days — the most drastic measure
 taken by states so far. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also

            <p> Here, I take petitioners' assertions <b>very seriously</b>. Not only for their sakes, but for the sake of the general population, including us. This is because as <b>WHO</b> has confirmed, "correctional facilities may amplify and enhance COVID-19 transmission beyond their walls."
            </p><p> We <strong>can take judicial notice</strong> of <strong>materials suggesting</strong> that the COVID-19 situation is <strong>under control in our jails</strong>, and that <strong>prison officials have established isolation facilities</strong> for PDLs who may exhibit even the mildest symptoms of the virus<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> infection as well as <strong>procedures restricting family visits and strict querying protocols</strong> upon admission for signs of this virus.
            </p><p> We may <strong>accept as evidence</strong> the 
laudable efforts of our jail wardens to curtail or even withdraw 
altogether the few niceties that pre-judgment PDLs had available to them
 previously, such as religious services. Viewed strictly in the context 
of COVID-19, that is welcome news.
            </p><p> We may even <strong>take judicial notice</strong> of respondents' <strong>concrete earnest efforts </strong>to<strong> prevent</strong> the <strong>transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus</strong> and the<strong> infection of PDLs</strong>, including petitioners, <strong>with COVID-19</strong>, as painstakingly specified in their Comment. We may further<strong> accept</strong>
 as evidence respondents' claim that MMDJ-4 at Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig 
City, the Taguig City Jail-Female Dormitory, Manila City Jail-Female 
Dorm, and the Manila City Jail-Male Dormitory have <strong>no confirmed cases</strong> of COVID-19.
            </p><p> But we do <strong>not</strong> live in a bubble. We, too, may<strong> take judicial notice</strong> of the fact that this virus is<strong> contagious</strong> even before a person demonstrates signs of infection. Persons can be asymptomatic yet be highly contagious. These <strong>facts are well known in the community</strong> given the proliferation of formal and informal media coverage on COVID-19. We note <strong>how rapidly events have changed</strong>
 from day to day, with a corresponding rise in the numbers of 
individuals who are infected, who die, and fortunately, who are cured of
 this abominable menace.
            </p><p> We may likewise<strong> take judicial notice</strong> of the fact that <strong>recommended physical distancing</strong> and <strong>frequent hand washing</strong> which are required as protection against COVID-19 are <strong>not readily available</strong> while a person is in custody at our facilities. This is <strong>not a criticism </strong>of our facilities much less their administrators. It is<strong> merely a statement of the fact</strong> that our pre-judgment PDLs <strong>cannot adequately physically isolate </strong>or<strong> wash their hands </strong>with frequency in the facilities.
            </p><p> Just <strong>because petitioners have been deprived of their liberty</strong> and <strong>are stuck in jails</strong> in Luzon, they are <strong>already vulnerable</strong> to an <strong>increased risk</strong> of contracting the disease brought about by the virus. We need<strong> not require</strong> petitioners to satisfy the Court that they have<strong> some subjective personal characteristics</strong> for us to accept that each of them is at an<strong> increased</strong> risk of infection. We <strong>do not need evidence</strong> to accept this proposition.
            </p><p> At most, petitioners' alleged <strong>pre-existing medical conditions</strong> render each of them just <strong>even more prone</strong> to infection by this virus and contracting its disease. Their pre-existing medical conditions <strong>make the risk of infection riskier</strong>. <em>But the absence of these conditions does not remove altogether the risk</em> that have been heightened as a result of their being in jails. At any rate, from my end, I can <strong>accept as fact</strong> that they each have <strong>pre-existing medical conditions </strong>that put each of them at a<strong> higher than normal risk of infections</strong> generally. I have <strong>no evidence to contradict</strong> their assertions on this point, and I <strong>accept</strong> them.
            </p><p> In view of the <strong>life-changing impact </strong>of
 COVID-19 upon the totality of our social and economic well-being, the 
administration of our government, the dispensation of justice, and our 
individual lifestyles, I am of the view that this<strong> pandemic </strong>constitutes<strong> exceptional and material change of circumstances</strong> that permits us <strong>to look closely </strong>and<strong> with urgency</strong> into petitioners' plea.
            </p><p> The reasoning in <em><strong>Enrile</strong></em> will <b>help us resolve</b> this case.
            </p><p> In <em><strong>Enrile</strong></em>, the Court found that the <strong>greatly elevated health risk</strong> posed to Senator Enrile as a PDL than when he is on bail or under another form of custodial arrangement, is <strong>a factor that must be considered</strong> in evaluating whether to grant discretionary bail. <em><strong><i><strong>Enrile</strong></i></strong></em> posed a<strong> two-step test</strong>: (a) that the detainee will <strong>not be a flight risk </strong>or<strong> a danger</strong> to the community; and (b) that <strong>there exist special, humanitarian</strong> and <strong>compelling circumstances.</strong>
            </p><p> Here, in the same manner, the<strong> threat</strong> that the <strong>virus</strong> poses to every PDL is <strong>one factor</strong> to be considered in the <strong>balancing of the interests</strong> attending the pre-judgment detention of an accused. It is a <strong>special</strong>, <strong>humanitarian</strong> and <strong>compelling</strong> circumstance that fulfils the <strong>second step</strong> of the test.
            </p><p> It <strong>bears emphasis though</strong> that the existence <strong>and</strong> contagious nature of COVID-19 while <strong>highly relevant</strong> is <strong>not solely determinative</strong>. It is <strong>just one of the factors</strong> that the Court must assess. There are <strong>other concerns</strong>, which specifically deal with <strong>first step</strong>.
            </p><p> As in <i><strong>Enrile</strong></i>, a <strong>factor</strong> in the <strong>first step</strong> is the<strong> flight risk of </strong> the pre-judgment PDL, or in this case, the <strong>PDLs</strong> – <em>will he or she or they attend court hearings?</em> Note that there are <strong>so many of them directly seeking the Court's intervention</strong>, which<strong> makes a whole lot of a difference</strong> than when the Court is <strong>dealing with only a single individual</strong> whose court attendance must be secured.
            </p><p> I also articulate<strong> some of the other factors</strong> we must consider:

            <p>As respondents have clarified, <strong>petitioners' respective offenses</strong> are<strong> serious</strong> and <strong>violent</strong>. Respondents also emphasized that a number of them <strong>failed to report</strong> to their respective courts <strong>after their safe conduct passes</strong> to attend the peace talks abroad were revoked by the Philippine Government. Petitioners were <strong>subsequently arrested</strong> on the basis of warrants of arrest issued against each of them. Respondents also <strong>detailed</strong> each of the detention center's <strong>efforts to combat</strong> the spread and transmission of COVID-19 not only among petitioners but the other PDLs as well.</p>
            <p> Beyond the factors which the Court are competent to weigh in, we must consider as well that COVID-19 is <em>also</em> a <strong>national health concern</strong>, the <strong>response</strong> to which<strong> impacts</strong> on the <strong>whole fabric</strong> and <strong>every strand</strong> of our polity. Ultimately, it was for this reason that Congress passed RA 11469 (2020), <em>BayanihanTo Heal As One Act</em>, so that there will be a <strong>united front </strong>against this<strong> common invisible enemy</strong>.
            </p><p> In this context, there will be <strong>consequences to the plans</strong> already laid down by the IATF if we are to release petitioners, and later, others similarly situated, on bail. <strong>Resources</strong> of the <strong>Executive Branch</strong> will be <strong>diverted</strong> and <strong>used</strong> simply <strong>to monitor</strong>
 petitioners' whereabouts and activities during the period of national 
health emergency. If granted, their release could become an <strong>unnecessary distraction</strong> to the current efforts to fight the virus and its disease. As respondents seem to assert in their Comment, petitioners are <strong>better quarantined</strong> at their present detention centers.
            </p><p> The doctrine of political question states:
            </p><blockquote>
              <p> Baker v. Cart remains the starting point for analysis 
under the political question doctrine. There the US Supreme Court 
explained that:</p>
              <p> . . . Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found <strong>a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department </strong>or a <strong>lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it</strong>, or the <strong>impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-judicial discretion</strong>; or the <strong>impossibility
 of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack
 of the respect due coordinate branches of government</strong>; or an <strong>unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made</strong>; or the <strong>potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on question.</strong></p>
              <p> In Tañada v. Cuenco, we held that <strong>political questions refer</strong> "to <strong>those questions which, under the Constitution, are to be decided by the people in their sovereign capacity</strong>, or in regard to which <strong>full discretionary authority has been delegated to the legislative or executive branch of the government</strong>. It is concerned with <strong>issues dependent upon the wisdom, not legality of a particular measure.</strong>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> I am of the view that RA 11469 has <strong>exclusively committed</strong> to the Executive Branch <strong>actions</strong> and <strong>decisions </strong>pertaining to the <strong>courses of action</strong> to meet the perils brought by COVID-19.
            </p><p> The <strong>release on bail</strong> of pre-judgment PDLs not otherwise qualified for release <strong>but for the perils</strong> of the virus and the disease,<strong> involves an act of discretion</strong> falling under RA 11469. The country is in <strong>actual standstill </strong>because of COVID-19. Necessarily,<strong> if the Court is to act because of the virus and its disease</strong>, the Court <strong>has to defer</strong> to the <strong>wisdom of the Executive Branch</strong>, because our legal order<strong> has exclusively tasked it </strong>to combat the <strong>very cause of and reason</strong> <strong>for </strong>the action prayed for by petitioners.
            </p><p> In the ultimate analysis, even the<strong> issues that we can decide on our own</strong> as an institution,<em> i.e.,</em>
 whether petitioners would again commit a crime or would be available 
for the next court date or their release would bring our administration 
of justice into disrepute, are also <strong>intricately connected to</strong> the over-all response to the pandemic.
            </p><p> This is <strong>because</strong> once petitioners are released, the courts <strong>will have to rely on the Executive Branch and its officers</strong> to monitor and enforce compliance with the bail plan. This will be <strong>especially complicated</strong>
 during this period of national health emergency when everyone in the 
Executive Branch is focused on fighting the virus and the disease it 
brings. Further, it is the <strong>Executive Branch</strong> that <strong>has the resources</strong> to commit and spend for <strong>alternative custodial arrangements</strong> to keep petitioners safe from COVID-19.
            </p><p> The<strong> doctrine of primary jurisdiction</strong> articulates that "courts will <strong>hold off from determining</strong> a controversy involving a<strong> question</strong> within the jurisdiction of an administrative agency, particularly when<strong> its resolution demands the special knowledge, experience, and services</strong> of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The country's law has <strong>now entrusted to the Executive Branch, especially the IATF</strong>, the authority to decide upon how to go about <strong>combatting</strong> the spread of the virus and its disease <strong>everywhere, <em>including our courts, penitentiaries and detention or holding facilities</em>. Full discretionary authority</strong> has been <strong>delegated</strong> to this administrative office as regards this broad matter, by virtue of its <strong>expertise</strong> and <strong>specialized knowledge</strong>.
            </p><p> I say with a great deal of confidence that there would <strong>potentially</strong> be a<strong> great deal of embarrassment and confusion</strong> should there be <strong>multifarious pronouncements</strong> by various departments on this pressing concern. More, these pronouncements could be <strong>deadly</strong> and <strong>costly</strong> if made <strong>unilaterally without coordination</strong> or <strong>consultation with</strong> the Executive Branch.

            </tbody></table>
            <p>For the most part, I concur in the <b><i>Separate Opinion</i></b>
 of my esteemed colleague, Justice Delos Santos. May I however 
respectfully forward some of my thoughts on a very few items that in my 
humble opinion could be subject to unintended interpretations.
            </p><p> <b><i>One.</i></b> I disagree with the reasoning that:
            </p><blockquote>
              <p> First, the general import of the terms in Section 4 
(a) of the Bureau of Corrections Act in relation to the Nelson Mandela 
Rules clearly show that such provision is not judicially-enforceable.<br>
      . . . .<br>
      The phrase "in compliance with established United Nations standards" in Section 4 (a) of the Bureau of Corrections Act is <strong>so</strong> <b>generic</b> that it clearly appears to be <b>silent regarding the manner of its implementation</b>. . . .<br>
      . . . .<br>
      As to the issue of specific implementation, the following phrases 
of the afore-cited Nelson Mandela Rules stand out: (a) "reasonable 
accommodation and adjustments;" (b) "full and effective access to prison
 life on an equitable basis;" (c) "shall meet all requirements of 
health;" (d) "cubic content of air, minimum floor space, lighting, 
heating and ventilation;" (e) "special accommodation;" and (f) 
"[a]rrangements shall be made." All of these phrases do not provide 
specific details as to the manner of implementation...</p>
              <p> Second, the implementation of the Bureau of 
Corrections Act is dependent on the available funds of the Bureau, 
(emphases supplied)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> To begin with, primary and subordinate legislations 
would almost always be couched in general terms that understandably 
would lack details. Such terms as "reasonable," "equitable," 
"circumstances" and others are so common among public and private legal 
instruments, <strong>but it does not mean</strong> that these otherwise binding documents would <strong>not be judicially enforceable</strong>.
            </p><p> To illustrate, the definitions of "probable cause" 
and the various other standards of proof (e.g., beyond a reasonable 
doubt, preponderant evidence, substantial evidence) use the same words 
as "reasonable," "circumstances," etc., <strong>yet we never ever complained</strong> that we cannot enforce them.
            </p><p> Indeed, such ambiguous terms are meant to be <strong>questions of fact</strong> whose <strong>resolution</strong> must be grounded in the specific facts and circumstances established by evidence or supporting allegations. Their ambiguity is <strong>clarified</strong>
 by the process of receiving evidence or submissions, and in the end, a 
court is able to define what "reasonable" and "equitable" concretely 
signify.
            </p><p> Hence, in one case, this Court was confronted with 
the issue of "whether there is a 'counteraction' of forces between the 
union and the company and whether each of the parties exerted 
'reasonable effort at good faith bargaining'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43] </sup><strong>but we did not decline to rule on this issue because of the ambiguity of the standard</strong>.
 Instead, we said "whether there was already deadlock between the union 
and the company is likewise a question of fact. It requires the 
determination of evidence to find..."
            </p><p> I also <b>disagree</b> with the thought that <b>budgetary restrictions and considerations</b> are factors in determining the <b>existence</b> of a right and its <strong>enforceability</strong>. I will of course be the first to <strong>concede</strong> that in the <strong>"implementation"</strong> of a statutory program, <strong>budget becomes a critical factor</strong>. But this weighing does <strong>not</strong> happen at the <strong>initial stage</strong> where the <strong>existence</strong> of a right and its <strong>enforceability</strong> are being determined.<strong> Budget</strong> could be a <strong>factor</strong> in <strong>fashioning</strong> the <strong>appropriate remedy</strong> or <strong>relief</strong>, and <strong>assessing</strong> the<strong> reasonableness</strong> of the <strong>compliance</strong> with the<strong> remedy</strong> or <strong>relief</strong>, but this occurs only<em> after</em> a<strong> right</strong> has been determined to <strong>exist</strong> and to be <strong>enforceable</strong>.
            </p><p> In any event, please<strong> recall</strong> that in one of the Court's more celebrated decisions, we decreed:

development, and proper use of the country's environment and natural 
resources, and Sec. 19 of RA 9275, designating the DENR as the primary 
government agency responsible for its enforcement and implementation, 
the DENR is directed to fully implement its Operational Plan for the 
Manila Bay Coastal Strategy for the rehabilitation, restoration, and 
conservation of the Manila Bay at the earliest possible time. It is 
ordered to call regular coordination meetings with concerned government 
departments and agencies to ensure the successful implementation of the

1991, 42 the DILG, in exercising the President's power of general 
supervision and its duty to promulgate guidelines in establishing waste 
management programs under Sec. 43 of the Philippine Environment Code (PD

septic tanks as prescribed by existing laws, ordinances, and rules and 
regulations. If none be found, these LGUs shall be ordered to require 
non-complying establishments and homes to set up said facilities or 
septic tanks within a reasonable time to prevent industrial wastes, 
sewage water, and human wastes from flowing into these rivers, 
waterways, esteros, and the Manila Bay, under pain of closure or 
imposition of fines and other sanctions.</p>
              <p> (3) As mandated by Sec. 8 of RA 9275,43 the MWSS is 
directed to provide, install, operate, and maintain the necessary 
adequate waste water treatment facilities in Metro Manila, Rizal, and 
Cavite where needed at the earliest possible time.</p>

 the BFAR, is ordered to improve and restore the marine life of the 
Manila Bay. It is also directed to assist the LGUs in Metro Manila, 
Rizal, Cavite, Laguna, Bulacan, Pampanga, and Bataan in developing, 
using recognized methods, the fisheries and aquatic resources in the 
Manila Bay.</p>
              <p> (6) The PCG, pursuant to Secs. 4 and 6 of PD 979, and 
the PNP Maritime Group, in accordance with Sec. 124 of RA 8550, in 
coordination with each other, shall apprehend violators of PD 979, RA 
8550, and other existing laws and regulations designed to prevent marine
 pollution in the Manila Bay.</p>
              <p> (7) Pursuant to Secs. 2 and 6-c of EO 513 and the 
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, the
 PPA is ordered to immediately adopt such measures to prevent the 
discharge and dumping of solid and liquid wastes and other 
ship-generated wastes into the Manila Bay waters from vessels docked at 
ports and apprehend the violators.</p>
              <p> (8) The MMDA, as the lead agency and implementor of 
programs and projects for flood control projects and drainage services 
in Metro Manila, in coordination with the DPWH, DILG, affected LGUs, PNP
 Maritime Group, Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council 
(HUDCC), and other agencies, shall dismantle and remove all structures, 
constructions, and other encroachments established or built in violation

 Rivers, the NCR (Parañaque-Zapote, Las Piñas) Rivers, the Navotas- 
Malabon-Tullahan-Tenejeros Rivers, and connecting waterways and esteros 
in Metro Manila. The DPWH, as the principal implementor of programs and 
projects for flood control services in the rest of the country more 
particularly in Bulacan, Bataan, Pampanga, Cavite, and Laguna, in 
coordination with the DILG, affected LGUs, PNP Maritime Group, HUDCC, 
and other concerned government agencies, shall remove and demolish all 
structures, constructions, and other encroachments built in breach of RA
 7279 and other applicable laws along the Meycauayan-Marilao-Obando 
(Bulacan) Rivers, the Talisay (Bataan) River, the Imus (Cavite) River, 
the Laguna De Bay, and other rivers, connecting waterways, and esteros 
that discharge wastewater into the Manila Bay.</p>
              <p> In addition, the MMDA is ordered to establish, 
operate, and maintain a sanitary landfill, as prescribed by RA 9003, 
within a period of one (1) year from finality of this Decision. On 
matters within its territorial jurisdiction and in connection with the 
discharge of its duties on the maintenance of sanitary landfills and 
like undertakings, it is also ordered to cause the apprehension and 
filing of the appropriate criminal cases against violators of the 
respective penal provisions of RA 9003, Sec. 27 of RA 9275 (the Clean 
Water Act), and other existing laws on pollution.</p>
              <p> (9) The DOH shall, as directed by Art. 76 of PD 1067 
and Sec. 8 of RA 9275, within one (1) year from finality of this 
Decision, determine if all licensed septic and sludge companies have the
 proper facilities for the treatment and disposal of fecal sludge and 
sewage coming from septic tanks. The DOH shall give the companies, if 
found to be non-complying, a reasonable time within which to set up the 
necessary facilities under pain of cancellation of its environmental 
sanitation clearance.</p>
              <p> (10) Pursuant to Sec. 53 of PD 1152, 48 Sec. 118 of RA
 8550, and Sec. 56 of RA 9003, 49 the DepEd shall integrate lessons on 
pollution prevention, waste management, environmental protection, and 
like subjects in the school curricula of all levels to inculcate in the

            </blockquote>
            <p> The kilometric dispositive portion <strong>will at once tell us</strong> that the concerned entities will <strong>have to spend some money</strong>, which calls for a budget, to be able to comply with what the Court has ruled to be the<strong> rightful entitlements</strong> of the claimants therein. It was<strong> never an issue to the Court</strong>
 that in determining the existence of a right and in enforcing it, we 
may be requiring some government agencies to spend some resources to 
promote, protect and defend the right.
            </p><p> In truth, nothing ought to<strong> restrict</strong> the Court from<strong> adjudicating</strong> the <strong>existence</strong> of a right and its <strong>enforceability</strong> on the <strong>basis</strong> of the <strong>availability</strong> of <strong>budget</strong> for the<strong> implementation</strong> of a right. We should be able to <strong>distinguish</strong> one from the other and to <strong>keep sacred</strong> this <b>dichotomy</b>.
            </p><p> <b><i>Second.</i></b> I disagree with the rationale that:
            </p><blockquote>
              <p> Presently, there is <em><strong>no</strong></em> constitutional provision or law which<em><strong> automatically</strong></em>
 grants bail, releases on recognizance or allows other modes of 
temporary liberty to all accused or inmates who are 
clinically-vulnerable (i.e. sickly, elderly or pregnant). As it stands, 
courts concerned will still have to consider the following guidelines 
for bail in Sections 5 and 9, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Criminal 
Procedure....</p>
              <p> The above-mentioned enumeration clearly pertain to <strong>purely factual questions</strong>
 that trial courts are equipped to pass upon. Moreover, the 
consideration of these factors which includes others not mentioned but 
are analogous to the ones provided means that such guidelines <strong>do not work in isolation</strong>. (emphases supplied)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> The cited rule pertains to the <strong>determination</strong> of the<strong> amount of bail</strong> where bail is a <strong>matter of right</strong>. It has no application where <strong>bail is a matter of discretion</strong> as a result of the imposable penalties upon the crime charged where evidence of guilt is strong.
            </p><p> I<strong> do not wish to impart </strong>the idea that Section 9, Rule 114 <strong>per se</strong> is a<strong> list of factors</strong> to be weighed <strong>every time</strong> a <strong>petition for bail</strong> is filed. Section 9 becomes relevant <strong>only when</strong> the ruling in <i><strong>Enrile</strong></i> is<strong> applicable</strong><em> in the sense</em> of being<strong> the standard for resolving the case</strong>, particularly, in determining whether the <i><strong>Enrile</strong></i> <strong>two-step test</strong>
 is complied with: (a) that the detainee will not be a flight risk or a 
danger to the community; and (b) that there exist special, humanitarian 
and compelling circumstances. The <strong>Section 9 factors</strong> are good indicators, among others, of the existence of these elements in the <i><strong>Enrile</strong></i><strong> test</strong>.
            </p><p> <strong>In this connection</strong>, I disagree with the statement that:
            </p><blockquote>
              <p> <em><strong>Fourth</strong></em>, the Court's ruling in <i><strong>Enrile</strong></i> <em><strong>v. Sandiganbayan, et al.</strong></em> is inapplicable in the instant case.<br>
      . . . .<br>
      In <i><strong>Enrile</strong></i>, the Court emphasized that while
 the Philippines honors its "commitment to uphold the fundamental human 
rights as well as value the worth and dignity of every person," the 
grant of bail to those charged in criminal proceedings as well as 
extraditees must be based upon a clear and convincing showing: <u>(a) that the detainee will <b><i>not</i></b> be a <b>flight risk</b> or a <b>danger</b> to the <b>community</b></u>; <b><i>and</i></b> (b) <u>that there exist special, humanitarian and compelling circumstances....</u></p>
              <p> Here, the petitioners do not deny the allegations of 
the OSG that they are indeed charged with heinous crimes related to 
national security and are also valuable members of the CPP-NPA-NDF and 
its affiliates. Even if the alleged facts underlying humanitarian 
reasons were to be accepted without question, they still have to be 
weighed against the fact that the charges against the petitioners 
involve serious matters of national security and public safety.... As a 
consequence, the petitioners' reliance on this ruling is patently 
misguided....</p>
              <p> Even assuming for the sake of argument that the 
petitioners had managed to attach documents proving the foregoing pieces
 of information, the determination of whether or not guilt is strong 
should still be lodged with the trial courts who are well-equipped to 
handle them.... (emphases and underscoring supplied)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> <b><i>As submitted earlier, <i><strong>Enrile</strong></i></i></b> applies here, <strong>not in the sense</strong> that herein petitioners would also be entitled to be released on a bail plan, <strong>but in the sense</strong> that <i><strong>Enrile</strong></i> is a legally binding decision, a law, that must<strong> apply equally to all</strong> who are able to meet the standards that <i><strong>Enrile</strong></i> espouses. To conclude <em>otherwise</em> is to <strong>institutionalize</strong> the <strong>forbidden thought</strong> that <em><strong>some people are better treated in and under the law than others upon dubious grounds</strong></em>.
            </p><p> Thus, herein petitioners are <strong>correct in invoking</strong> <i><strong>Enrile</strong></i> but <strong>may still be not released</strong> on bail for a specified amount or on recognizance <strong>unless they are able to muster</strong> the<strong> two-step test</strong> in <i><strong>Enrile</strong></i>: (a) the detainee will <strong>not be a flight risk</strong> or <b>a</b> <strong>danger</strong> to the community; and (b)<strong> there exist special, humanitarian and compelling circumstances.</strong> The<strong> test</strong> in <i><strong>Enrile</strong></i> has <strong>nothing</strong> to do with<strong> assessing</strong> whether or not the <strong>evidence </strong>of <strong>petitioners' guilt</strong> is <strong>strong</strong>, but on <strong>other factors </strong>as mentioned above.
            </p><p> <b><i>Third.</i></b> I disagree with the rationale that:
            </p><blockquote>
              <p> In the case of the petitioners' continued confinement in their respective detention facilities, <strong>the
 Court cannot issue an order for the creation of a "Prisoner Release 
Committee" in the absence of any law and in the absence of any concluded
 bail hearing which resulted in the grant of provisional liberty</strong>. As it stands, <strong>only
 the political branches of government (Executive and Legislative) have 
the power to determine for themselves if such recourse is warranted.</strong>
 The only act that the Court may do under the circumstances is to order 
the conduct bail hearings before the trial courts with dispatch....</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> I have my <strong>misgivings</strong> if the<strong> political</strong> branches of government have the<strong> authority to order the release of PDLs</strong>, or for that matter, <strong>their continued detention</strong>, if, <strong>in the former</strong>, the evidence of guilt is strong for a crime punishable by death, <em>reclusion perpetua</em> or life imprisonment or there has been <strong>yet no determination</strong> thereof in a hearing, or if,<strong> in the latter</strong>, it has been <strong>decided after a hearing</strong> that the evidence of guilt is <strong>not </strong>strong for a crime punishable by death,<em> reclusion perpetua</em> or life imprisonment. <strong>The determination in this regard exclusively belongs to the courts.</strong>
            </p><p> <b><i>Fourth.</i></b> I also disagree with this statement:
            </p><blockquote>
              <p> Besides, whenever a conundrum arises <b>in times of emergency</b>
 when police power collides with constitutionally-protected freedoms or 
fundamental rights, the political questions doctrine will often tip the 
balance in favor of general welfare acts or policies in view of the 
State's duty to primarily protect general interests...<em> However</em>,
 while public safety is the paramount and overriding concern of the 
State and while it is also true that laws should be interpreted in favor
 of the greatest good of the greatest number during emergencies, <em>individual freedoms also have to be respected</em>... (Emphases supplied)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> I<strong> do not want </strong>to give the <strong>misimpression</strong> that<strong> petitioners will remain in detention</strong> because "<em>whenever
 a conundrum arises in times of emergency when police power collides 
with constitutionally-protected freedoms or fundamental rights, the 
political questions doctrine </em><strong>will often tip the balance</strong> <em>in favor of general welfare acts or policies in view of the State's duty to primarily protect general interests</em>." This is farthest from the truth. They will <strong>stay under detention</strong> because they <strong>failed to satisfy the requirements</strong> that would have otherwise qualified them to be released.
            </p><p> More, I am not comfortable with the idea that <strong>during emergencies</strong>, the Court will already desist from acting in favour of individual rights since<em> the political question doctrine</em> <strong>will often tip the balance</strong>. This is a recipe for authoritarianism which I am sure even respondents and the OSG are not advocating at present.
            </p><p> <b><i>Fifth.</i></b> I disagree with the references 
to the following conclusions which may have an impact on the trial of 
petitioners' criminal cases below:
            </p><blockquote>
              <p> Here, the petitioners do not deny the allegations of the OSG that they are indeed charged with heinous crimes related to <b>national security</b> and are also valuable members of the CPP-NPA-NDF and its affiliates...<br>
      ....<br>
      ...As earlier discussed, the government cannot afford to gamble 
its chances and resources by allowing the petitioners who are allegedly 
key members of the CPP-NPA-NDF to roam free while the COVID-19 pandemic 
remains an imminent and grave threat...</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> I would <b>not</b> have wanted us to give so much 
thought and weight to petitioners' status as rebels when as the Separate
 Opinion itself states this matter as being <b>merely an allegation</b> 
(i.e., the Separate Opinion uses the descriptor "alleged") and more 
importantly when this is an issue being litigated at the trial courts 
below. It would have <b>sufficed to focus</b> on <b>petitioners' collective inability to provide concrete circumstances and bail plan</b> to prove the first-prong of the <b><i>Enrile</i></b> test.

            <p>We are <strong>not in ordinary times</strong>. Also, <strong>time</strong> is<strong> not on anyone's side</strong>. The reason lies in the <strong>nature of the enemy</strong> we are all facing. The spread or transmission rate of COVID-19, to use lay language, is "<strong>less than a week</strong> and that <strong>more than 10 percent of patients are infected by somebody</strong> who has the virus but <strong>does not yet have symptoms</strong>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> As further explained by <strong>WHO</strong>:
            </p><blockquote>
              <p> Q. How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?</p>
              <p> The speed of transmission is an important point of 
difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median 
incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) 
and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than 
COVID-19 virus. <strong>The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days</strong>, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that<strong> influenza can spread faster than COVID19</strong>.
 Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially 
pre-symptomatic transmission -transmission of the virus before the 
appearance of symptoms - is a major driver of transmission for 
influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that<strong> there are 
people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, 
at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission. 
The reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated 
from one infected individual – is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for
 COVID-19 virus</strong>, higher than for influenza.... <strong>Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community.</strong> For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that<strong>
 children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates 
in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household 
transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from 
adults, rather than vice versa....</strong> For COVID-19, data to date 
suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe 
infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring 
ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be 
higher than what is observed for influenza infection. Those most at risk
 for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, 
those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are 
immunosuppressed. <strong>For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.</strong><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> The <b>ubiquitous advice</b> about this pandemic is that, <em>unlike in other situations where time heals</em>,<strong> time</strong> is <strong>not</strong> our <strong>best ally</strong>. <strong>Transmission</strong> is<strong> rapid</strong> and <strong>easy</strong>. The<strong> host and carrier</strong> does <strong>not</strong> carry a badge for easy identification. Those who<strong> look healthy</strong> can be just that, mere appearance of health.
            </p><p> I therefore <b>do not criticize </b>petitioners for resorting directly to this Court. As correctly held by the <em>ponencia</em>, the <strong>doctrine of the hierarchy of courts</strong> does <strong>not apply</strong> to the present circumstances.
            </p><p> <b>Fortunately</b>, respondents have responded well to the call for<strong> preventive measures</strong> against COVID-19 at our detention centers. From all indications, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, respondents <strong>have acquitted</strong> themselves well in this regard. It is my hope that they <strong>remain aggressive against </strong>the virus and <strong>continue keeping</strong> the PDLs safe from the disease. Their <strong>timely response answers petitioners' rightful concerns </strong>against this invisible enemy.
            </p><p> It is my understanding from the petition that at the time of filing, <strong>petitioner Reina Mae Nasino</strong> was <strong>five-months pregnant</strong>. She must have given birth by now. I do not know if her baby now stays with her. But if the baby does, it is <strong>entitled to separate protection</strong> apart from its mother, petitioner Nasino, would be entitled to.
            </p><p> <strong>Hence</strong>, while I <strong>recognize</strong> and<strong> adhere to</strong> the <strong>primordial if not exclusive</strong> role of the Executive Branch in the fight against COVID-19, I believe that we have <strong>a role to play in protecting the baby</strong> from adverse consequences that are <strong>not of the baby's own doing</strong>. After all, <strong>her mother</strong> is in this state of panic <strong>because</strong> the <strong>lower court</strong> has <strong>issued processes</strong> for her preventive detention; further, she and her <strong>co-petitioners</strong> are invoking their entitlement to <strong>bail under the circumstances</strong>; and, lastly, the <strong>health</strong> of the<strong> baby </strong>is exposed to a <strong>greater</strong> risk of infection than those who are staying with their mothers outside the detention facilities. To use the hyperbole of <strong>Human Rights Watch</strong>, the baby's situation is <strong>akin to</strong> having a <strong>death sentence</strong> imposed upon it <strong>by mere accident</strong> or <strong>as an innocent by-stander</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>
            </p><p> In <b><i>Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the Court <b>affirmed</b> that the <b>power to save the life of a human being</b> is <b>not exclusive</b> to any of the three branches of government. The Court said poignantly: "<i>The
 powers of the Executive, the Legislative and the Judiciary to save the 
life of a death convict do not exclude each other for the simple reason 
that there is no higher right than the right to life</i>."
            </p><p> Our jurisprudence has also <b>confirmed</b> that 
"the Court is, under the Constitution, empowered to promulgate rules for
 the protection and enforcement of constitutional rights,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the most prominent being the<strong> right to life</strong>. With the Court's authority to promulgate formal rules for this purpose, with more reason<strong> the Court can exercise</strong> <em>and not resile from</em> the<strong> jurisdiction</strong> to put its two cents' worth whenever a <strong>person's life</strong> or <strong>health</strong> – in this case, that of the <b>baby</b> of a pre-judgment PDL – is <strong>also at stake</strong> from <strong>circumstances not of her own making</strong>.
            </p><p> The <strong>greater risks</strong> that the present pandemic have caused are the <strong>actual facts</strong> that<strong> fuel</strong> the <strong>present controversy</strong> which makes it <strong>justiciable</strong>. Let me stress. There is <strong>nothing advisory, nothing philosophical, nothing dreamy</strong>
 about the COVID-19. We have been quarantined for almost half of this 
year already, our courts and others have lost the equivalent of about 
six-months of man-hours, <strong>all because of the REAL dangers </strong>to
 life, health and overall well-being of the entire population of the 
Philippines and the entire world. I would like the Court to give relief 
to petitioner Nasino's baby <strong>not because</strong> of the ineptitude of respondents, but as a result of the <strong>reality</strong> of the <strong>greater risks</strong> facing <strong>petitioner Nasino's baby</strong> coming from<strong> facts</strong> about this <strong>pandemic</strong>.
            </p><p> <b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>TREAT</b> the 
present petition as petitioners' applications for bail or recognizance 
as well as their motions for other confinement arrangements, and <b>REFER</b> the same to the respective trial courts where their criminal cases are pending, which courts should be <b>DIRECTED</b> to conduct the necessary proceedings and consequently, resolve these incidents with utmost dispatch.

            </p><blockquote>
              <p> Constitution, Article III, Section 13. All persons,<b> except those charged with offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua when evidence of guilt is strong</b>, shall, before conviction, be bailable by sufficient sureties, or be released on recognizance as may be provided by law....</p>
              <p> Rules of Court, Rule 114, Section 7. Capital offense 
or an offense punishable by reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, not
 bailable. — <b>No person</b> charged with a capital offense, or an offense punishable by reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, <b>shall be admitted to bail when evidence of guilt is strong</b>, regardless of the stage of the criminal prosecution. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p> The texts say that bail is to be denied when the 
evidence of guilt is strong. There is a precursor to the denial of bail.
 More, the burden is on the prosecution to establish that precursor. The
 burden signifies that a court is not to presume that the evidence of 
guilt is strong. The prosecution has to actually discharge its burden by
 proving that the evidence of guilt is strong. Prior to satisfying this 
standard of proof, it cannot be the case that bail is already denied, 
because bail can be denied only after the prosecution has already 
discharged its burden by proving that the evidence of guilt is strong. 
Prior to satisfying this standard of proof, the default is the 
availability of bail as a matter of right. This, however, is just my 
irreverent opinion about this aside.</p>

released on humanitarian considerations in the context of COVID-19.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Meanwhile, this Court formulated the following issues during deliberations:</p>
            <ol start="" type="A"><li> Whether the instant Petition filed directly before this Court may be given due course.<br><br></li><li>Whether the Nelson Mandela Rules are enforceable in Philippine courts.<br><br></li><li>Whether the petitioners may be given provisional liberty on the ground of equity.<br><br></li><li>Whether the Court has the power to pass upon the 
State's prerogative of selecting appropriate police power measures in 
times of emergency.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </li></ol>
            <p>I vote to DENY the Petition.

            </tbody></table>
            <p>The determination on the propriety of the instant 
Petition for provisional liberty may be given due course on the ground 
of equity, upon an inquiry on the following: 1) jurisdiction of the 
Court over applications for bail or recognizance; 2) compliance by 
petitioners with the procedures for applications for bail or 
recognizance; and 3) exemption of petitioners from complying with the 
procedures for such applications.
            </p><p> <b>This Court is clearly not among those vested with
 jurisdiction over applications for bail or recognizance under the Rules
 and the law.</b> The jurisdiction over both applications for bail and recognizance lies with the trial courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 To be sure, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure governs
 applications for bail, while Republic Act (RA) No. 10389 governs 
applications for recognizance.
            </p><p> Also, the issues raised by petitioners, particularly
 those that entail the determination of the due execution and 
authenticity of their submitted documents, involve a determination of 
facts best addressed to the sound discretion of the trial courts. <b>Indeed,
 petitioners ought to have submitted their applications for temporary 
release before the respective courts where their cases are pending.</b> 
And even if We are to take cognizance of the Petition, petitioners 
failed to substantiate their right to be released on bail or 
recognizance.
            </p><p> In determining the amount of bail, the trial courts 
consider the following factors: financial ability of the accused to give
 bail; nature and circumstances of the offense; penalty for the offense 
charged; character and reputation of the accused; age and health of the 
accused; weight of the evidence against the accused; probability of the 
accused appearing at the trial; forfeiture of other bail; if the accused
 was a fugitive from justice when arrested; and pendency of other cases 
where the accused is on bail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
            </p><p> On the other hand, RA 10389 lists the following 
requirements for an application for recognizance and the 
disqualifications for such application:

              <p>SEC. 6. <i>Requirements</i>. - The competent court

            <p>Petitioners do not seek to invalidate the established 
requirements for bail or recognizance, but instead claim exception 
therefrom due to their peculiar circumstances. <b>Evident, however, is petitioner's failure to comply with these clear and comprehensive requirements.</b>
 Petitioners also significantly failed to present this Court with 
information if the crimes for which they had been detained are bailable,
 or their financial status qualifies them for recognizance, and/or they 
have a definite plan for their temporary release. </p>
            <p> It was only after respondents narrated the circumstances
 relating to the charges against petitioners that the latter were 
compelled to provide the Court with a more detailed, but still 
incomplete, information. Petitioners still failed to indicate vital 
information, such as the actual case numbers, motions filed in relation 
to their age and health condition, and court orders corresponding to 
such motions. They did not even assert any pending applications for bail
 or recognizance before the trial courts, as well as other applications 
or custodial arrangements, or if such had been denied. 
            </p><p> The initial lack of candor about the nature of the 
crimes charged, and the context for the filing thereof, invite questions
 as to the legitimacy of using the threat of contracting COVID-19 in 
petitioners' bid to gain liberty, temporary or otherwise. 
            </p><p> As petitioners invoke this Court's exercise of 
equity jurisdiction, praying for exemption from the procedures of 
applications for bail or recognizance on humanitarian grounds, they 
present their respective ages and health statuses, as well as the 
existing conditions of their detention facilities to show that they are 
especially exposed and vulnerable to contract COVID-19. However, this 
prayer for exemption rests on flimsy grounds.
            </p><p> Out of the 22 petitioners, 17 are senior citizens, 
or are 60 years of age and older. There are 12 male senior citizens with
 health issues,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> one male senior citizen without health issues,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and three male non-senior citizens with health issues.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> There are two female senior citizens with health issues,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> two female senior citizens without health issues,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 and two female non-senior citizens with health issues. One of the two 
female non-senior citizens is five months pregnant at the time of the 
filing of the Petition but has since given birth,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> while the other has leprosy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The health issues of petitioners include diabetes and hypertension.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <b>However,
 only 17 petitioners provided copies of their medical certificates, and 
only six medical certificates out of the 17 were issued in 2020. None of
 the petitioners have been tested for, or are alleged to have, COVID-19.</b>
            </p><p> The Petition described the physical situations in 
the Quezon City Jail, the Cebu City Jail, the Mandaue City Jail, and the
 New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in Muntinlupa, to support their claim of 
exposure and vulnerability to contract COVID-19. Yet, none of the 
petitioners are confined in any of the said institutions. Petitioners 
are actually detained in four other different sites: MMDJ 4 in Camp 
Bagong Diwa, Taguig City Jail; Female Dorm, which is also in Camp Bagong
 Diwa, Taguig City Jail; Manila City Jail, and the CIW, in Mandaluyong 
City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
            </p><p> Petitioners emphasize that their collective actual 
health situation and congested detention facilities put them at greater 
risk of contracting COVID-19. They harp upon these facts, but 
conveniently ignore the reality of the absence of any incident of 
COVID-19 infection in their actual detention facilities. While it is 
true that after the filing of the Petition, and during its pendency, 20 
PDLs and 1 staff tested positive for COVID-19 at the CIW where one of 
the petitioners is imprisoned, those who tested positive have since been
 transferred to the isolation facilities at the NBP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Thus, the actual risk of petitioners contracting COVID-19 is more speculative than real.
            </p><p> <b>In seeking for their temporary release through 
bail or recognizance, petitioners are primarily asking this Court to 
turn a blind eye to the established requirements which take into account
 the nature and gravity of the crimes charged.</b> Petitioners 
ultimately want the Court to controvert Art. III, Section 13 of the 1987
 Constitution, which provides that "[a]ll persons, except those charged 
with offenses punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> when evidence of 
guilt is strong, shall, before conviction, be bailable by sufficient 
sureties, or be released on recognizance as may be provided by law. x x 
x" Most of the petitioners are incarcerated for non-bailable crimes and 
offenses. Even conceding the extraordinary backdrop of this case, 
humanitarian reasons alone cannot justify the utter disregard of the 
Constitution, the law, and the rules of procedures.
            </p><p> If only to belabor the point, judicial policy 
dictates that this Court will not entertain direct resort to it unless 
the redress desired cannot be obtained in the appropriate courts or 
where exceptional and compelling circumstances justify availment of a 
remedy within and calling for the exercise of our primary jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> And since petitioners failed to show that they have exhausted the appropriate remedies before the lower courts, <em>i.e.</em>,
 by filing applications for bail and recognizance therein, or compelling
 circumstances have exempted them from disregarding the hierarchy of 
courts, the Petition must be denied.

            </p><p> The Mandela Rules, however, must be read in their

 Mandela Rules articulated the standard of adequate systems in penal 
institutions. It also recognized that the said Rules are not capable of 
wholesale application in all places because of the difference in the 
legal, social, economic, and geographical situations in each country. 
The preliminary observations which preface the Nelson Mandela Rules bear
 witness to this recognition: 
            </p><blockquote> Preliminary observation 1
                <p> The following rules are not intended to describe in 
detail a model system of penal institutions. They seek only, on the 
basis of the general consensus of contemporary thought and the essential
 elements of the most adequate systems of today, to set out what is 
generally accepted as being good principles and practice in the 
treatment of prisoners and prison management. 
                </p><p> Preliminary observation 2
                </p><p> 1. <b>In view of the great variety of legal, 
social, economic and geographical conditions in the world, it is evident
 that not all of the rules are capable of application in all places and 
at all times.</b> They should, however, serve to stimulate a constant 
endeavor to overcome practical difficulties in the way of their 
application, in the knowledge that they represent, as a whole, the 
minimum conditions which are accepted as suitable by the United Nations.
 
                </p><p> 2. On the other hand, the rules cover a field in
 which thought is constantly developing. They are not intended to 
preclude experiment and practices, provided these are in harmony with 
the principles and seek to further the purposes which derive from the 
text of these rules as a whole. <b>It will always be justifiable for the central prison administration to authorize departures from the rules in this spirit.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>

            These preliminary observations allow us to characterize the

 the BJMP, under the Department of the Interior and Local Government 
(DILG), and the BuCor, under the DOJ,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>

released PDLs because of the fear of the spread of COVID-19 infections. 
We would like to point out that the release of PDLs who are similarly 
situated to petitioners in terms of age and health should be done with 
extreme caution. Utmost prudence in releasing PDLs with health issues 
and senior citizens is justified as their release may further endanger 
their health.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Petitioners,
 however, did not show whether they will be in a better physical 
environment, or be better protected, upon gaining their temporary 
freedom. Petitioners did not even inform this Court of the COVID-19 
situation in the areas they propose to stay during their temporary 
release. 
            </p><p> Moreover, the countries<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup>
 that released PDLs followed a stringent set of criteria in determining 
who may be released, such as the kind of cases filed, the length of the 
sentence served, and a plan for release. Only a few of these countries 
have released their political prisoners. Iran granted leave to thousands
 of PDLs, including political prisoners, sometime in March and extended 
this leave until 20 May 2020.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup>
 The grant was based allegedly on dubious terms of good behavior and 
payment of exorbitant bail. As a result, several prisoners have since 
returned to prison despite the extension.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup>
 Egypt released four women who were accused of "inciting a protest," 
"disseminating false information," and "possession of material 
disseminating false information" after payment of bail. Egypt also 
released 15 politicians and activists who had been "arbitrarily 
detained" for months.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Some of Egypt's political prisoners who remain in detention have been tested for COVID-19.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup>
 However, tens of thousands remain in prison for peacefully exercising 
their rights to freedom of expression, protest, and assembly.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The crimes for which Egypt's political prisoners are indicted sharply contrast with those of petitioners. 
            </p><p> <i>A Final Word</i>
            </p><p> The situation that the world faces is unprecedented.
 These are challenging times, but the Judiciary has been equal to the 
task, albeit with the recognition that there is still much to be done. 
While the health crisis persists, the Judiciary, along with the 
Executive and the Legislative branches, need to re-visit their policies,
 re-calibrate their actions, and promptly react to the emerging needs of
 the times. 
            </p><p> Still, the Court cannot act contrary to, or in 
excess of, its own authority, no matter how noble the intention. To 
insist on equity and liberality while forsaking laws, rules, and 
established procedures is self-defeating. Justice must always be served 
"according to the mandate of the law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> No one benefits from undermining the whole system.
            </p><p> The Judiciary and the Executive have made, and continue to take, the necessary action for both<b> temporary and permanent release of qualified PDLs</b>.
 The pleas of petitioners and of various organizations to decongest and 
improve the conditions of Philippine jails did not fall on deaf ears. 
The actions of this Court, the BPP, the BJMP, and the BuCor are 
testament to the collective recognition that decongestion is a problem 
needing to be addressed regardless of the existence of a public health 
emergency. Moreover, the ideals expressed in international instruments 
on the treatment of prisoners, like the Nelson Mandela Rules, should 
constantly be taken into account in crafting laws and in the formulation
 of policies.

              <p>On April 6, 2020, several Persons Deprived of Liberty<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> (PDLs) filed a petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> before this Court seeking their provisional freedom for the duration of the Covid-19<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> pandemic through recognizance or bail. The PDLs alleged that they belong to the "<i>vulnerable or at-risk groups</i>" because of their medical and/or physical conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Also, the PDLs asked for<i> ipso facto </i>release
 from detention on humanitarian and equitable grounds considering the 
threats of the present public health emergency. Essentially, they prayed
 for the following reliefs:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p> 1) DIRECTING the temporary RELEASE ON RECOGNIZANCE 
of petitioners, including those similarly situated who are listed herein
 but were not able to subscribe on this Petition due to the lockdown, 
for humanitarian consideration, for the duration of the state of public 
health emergency, national calamity, lockdown and community quarantine 
due to the threats of the COVID 19; </p>
                <p>2) In the alternative, DIRECTING the RELEASE ON BAIL 
of herein petitioners, including those similarly situated who are listed
 and referred to in this Petition, the amounts of which shall be set at 
the discretion of this Honorable Court; </p>
                <p>3) MANDATING the creation of a Prisoner Release 
Committee, similar to those set up in other countries, to urgently study
 and implement the release of all other prisoners in various congested 
prisons throughout the country who are similarly vulnerable but cannot 
be included in this Petition due to the difficult circumstances; and </p>
                <p>4) DECLARING the issuance of ground rules relevant to the release of eligible prisoners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> However, it is settled that equity may be availed only in the absence of and never against statutory law or rules of procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In our jurisdiction, there are existing positive rules relevant to the rights of PDLs which remain in force.

              <p>The right to bail is enshrined in the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Section 1, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court defined bail as "<i>the
 security given for the release of a person in custody of the law, 
furnished by him or a bondsman, to guarantee his appearance before any 
court x x x.</i>" Also, bail is either a matter of right or discretion depending on the penalty, thus:
      
          </p><p align="center"> <b>RULE 114</b>

                <p> <b>SEC. 4.</b> <em>B</em><i>ail, a matter of right; exception.</i> — All persons in custody shall be admitted to bail <b>as a matter of right</b>,

law or this Rule (a) before or after conviction by the Metropolitan 
Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, or 
Municipal Circuit Trial Court, and (b) before conviction by the Regional
 Trial Court of an offense not punishable by death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, or life imprisonment.</p>
                <p> <b>SEC. 5. </b><i>Bail, when discretionary.</i> — Upon conviction by the Regional Trial Court of an offense not punishable by death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, or life imprisonment, <b>admission to bail is discretionary. </b>The
 application for bail may be filed and acted upon by the trial court 
despite the filing of a notice of appeal, provided it has not 
transmitted the original record to the appellate court. However, if the 
decision of the trial court convicting the accused changed the nature of
 the offense from non-bailable to bailable, the application for bail can
 only be filed with and resolved by the appellate court.</p>

is strong, regardless of the stage of the criminal prosecution.

              </blockquote>
              <p> In this case, the PDLs failed to indicate whether the 
charges against them are bailable or not. The Solicitor General's 
comment later disclosed that except for one who is serving sentence, all
 the PDLs were charged with non-bailable offenses and their cases are 
pending trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The PDLs admitted these facts in their reply.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> It is basic that bail cannot be allowed without a prior hearing to a person charged with an offense punishable with <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or life imprisonment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 As such, bail is a matter of discretion and its grant or denial hinges

strong. The determination of the requisite evidence can only be reached 
after due hearing. Thus, a judge must first evaluate the prosecution's 
evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> A hearing is likewise required for the trial court to consider the factors in fixing the amount of bail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Notably, this Court outlined the duties of a judge in resolving bail applications,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to wit:
              </p><blockquote>
                <p> 1. In all cases, whether bail is a matter of right 
or of discretion, notify the prosecutor of the hearing of the 
application for bail or require him to submit his recommendation; </p>
                <p>2. Where bail is a matter of discretion, conduct a 
hearing of the application for bail regardless of whether or not the 
prosecution refuses to present evidence to show that the guilt of the 
accused is strong for the purpose of enabling the court to exercise its 
sound discretion; </p>
                <p>3. Decide whether the guilt of the accused is strong based on the summary of evidence of the prosecution; </p>
                <p>4. If the guilt of the accused is not strong, 
discharge the accused upon the approval of the bail bond; otherwise 
petition should be denied.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> Here, the PDLs raised factual issues about their 
health conditions which allegedly made them vulnerable to the pandemic. 
This requires a balancing of interests between the PDLs' presumption of 
innocence and the duty of the State to ensure that they will be ready to
 serve the penalty if eventually found guilty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Yet, what the PDLs submitted are unauthenticated medical certificates which cannot be subject of judicial notice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 Likewise, it must be ascertained whether the PDLs are flight risk, or 
capable of committing another crime during their temporary liberty which
 may affect public order and safety. On this point, it must be 
emphasized that this Court is not a trier of facts. Thus, the petition 
should have been filed before the Regional Trial Courts where the PDLs' 
criminal cases are pending. This is consistent with the rule that the 
decision on whether to detain or release an accused before and during 
trial is ultimately an incident of the judicial power to hear and 
determine the criminal case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>

 this Court allowed bail for humanitarian reasons based on the following
 factors: (1) the principal purpose of bail, which is to guarantee the 
appearance of the accused at the trial or whenever so required by the 
court; (2) the Philippines' responsibility in the international 
community arising from the national commitment under the <i>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</i>,
 specifically, to uphold the fundamental human rights as well as value 
the worth and dignity of every person; (3) the petitioner's social and 
political standing and his having immediately surrendered to the 
authorities upon his being charged in court indicate that the risk of 
his flight or escape from this jurisdiction is highly unlikely; and (4) 
the fragile state of petitioner's health, as proven by the testimony of a
 physician presents another compelling justification for his admission 
to bail.
              </p><p> The PDLs failed to present similar circumstances. 
The filing of petitions for bail before the trial courts where the 
criminal cases are pending is a remedy that has always been available. 
However, the PDLs opted not to avail of such process insisting that this
 will not provide an adequate and speedy relief to escape the ravaging 
effects of the pandemic. I see no reason for this apprehension. 
Foremost, the trial courts conduct only a summary hearing in bail 
applications.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Also, there are ample safeguards under the <i>Revised Guidelines for Continuous Trial of Criminal Cases</i>

              <p>It is true that several countries have implemented 
release programs for prisoners to prevent the spread of Covid-19 virus 
but these initiatives were subject to exceptions. In Afghanistan, the 
members of Islamist Militant Group are not included. In Indonesia, those
 released were mostly juvenile offenders and those who already served at
 least two-thirds of their sentences. In Iran, only low-risk and 
non-violent offenders serving short sentences are released. In Morocco, 
the prisoners were selected based on their health, age, conduct, and 
length of detention and were granted pardon. In United Kingdom, 
high-risk inmates convicted of violent or sexual offenses, or of 
national security concern or a danger to children were excluded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It must be stressed that the release of prisoners in other jurisdictions was made upon the orders of their Chief Executives.
              </p><p> Corollarily, the matter of unilaterally ordering 
the temporary release of the PDLs solely on equitable grounds is, 
strictly speaking, not purely judicial in character. This Court must 
abstain from exercising such power lest it encroach on the prerogatives 
of the President and the Congress. The separation of powers is a 
fundamental principle in our system of government. It obtains not 
through express provision but by actual division in the framing of our 
Constitution. Each department has exclusive cognizance of matters placed
 within its jurisdiction and is supreme within its own sphere.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 It is not within the province of the judiciary to express an opinion, 
or express a suggestion, that would reflect on the wisdom or propriety 
of the action of the Chief Executive or the Congress on matters purely 
political in nature. Otherwise, it may be considered as an interference 
or an attempt to influence the exercise of their powers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 Hence, the temporary release of PDLs outside of bail, recognizance and 
other court processes is best left to the Chief Executive and Congress, 
especially since matters related to public health and safety are 
political questions.

that regardless of age or whether they have pre-existing medical

of the congestion, along with inadequate nutrition and scarcity in 
health care. These are problems that need to be sufficiently addressed, 
not only on account of the pandemic, but more so because these rights

 The Philippines has the responsibility of protecting and promoting the

detained or arrested can participate in the proceedings before a court, 
to enable it to decide without delay on the legality of the detention 
and order their release if justified. The Philippine authorities are 
under obligation to make available to every person under detention such 
remedies which safeguard their fundamental right to liberty. These 
remedies include the right to be admitted to bail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Accordingly, this Court extended the application of bail to deportation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and extradition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> proceedings.

                  </p><p><b><i>On giving due course to the present petition:</i></b>
                  </p><p> Petitions filed before this Court are 
essentially divided into two (2) main categories: (a) those that invoke 
appellate jurisdiction; and (b) those that invoke original jurisdiction.
 Those falling within the first category are petitions for review under 
Rule 45 of the Rules of Court where the Court's main function is 
resolving pure questions of law much like the courts of cassation in 
other jurisdictions. Those falling under the second category are 
petitions that either: (a) seek for the issuance of extraordinary or 
prerogative-writs (<i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, <i>mandamus</i>, continuing <i>mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus, amparo, habeas data</i>, and <i>kalikasan</i>);
 or (b) seek for the invocation of the Court's inherent powers such as 
those pertaining to the maintenance of orderly proceedings (contempt) or
 those pertaining to administrative disciplinary proceedings against 
members of both the Bench and the Bar. While the procedural requirements
 to be evaluated by this Court in deciding whether or not to give due 
course for petitions under the first category are relatively 
straightforward, the procedural requirements for petitions under the 
second category involving extraordinary <i>writs</i> are a tad 
complicated. The requirements as well as the corresponding exceptions in
 this specific subcategory of petitions differ depending on the <i>writ</i> or type of remedy sought.
                  </p><p> As to the procedural requirements for the issuance of extraordinary <i>writs</i>—when
 directly invoking this Court's jurisdiction—are concerned, there have 
been several instances where technicalities have been brushed aside in 
order to resolve cases with utmost constitutional significance and 
far-reaching consequences. Accordingly, due to the practical importance 
of keeping the dockets down to a controllable level or load so that only
 petitions with significant import will be entertained, the doctrine of 
hierarchy of courts was devised and developed in order to manage 
petitions falling under the concurrent jurisdiction of the second, third
 and final level courts. Hence, the issuance of extraordinary writs will
 essentially depend on the guidelines laid down in the recent landmark 
case of <b><i>GIOS-SAMAR, Inc. v. Department of Transportation and Communications, et al.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> which are condensed as follows:

                  <p> Considering the aforementioned guidelines in <b><i>GIOS-SAMAR</i></b>,
 the undersigned now proceeds to evaluate the present unsanctioned 
"Petition for the Release of Prisoners on Humanitarian Grounds in the 
Midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic" seeking for the issuance of an 
extraordinary <i>writ</i>: (a) directing the release of the petitioners 
from their detention either on bail or on recognizance; (b) mandating 
the creation of a "Prisoner Release Committee" for the purpose of 
"urgently study[ing] and implement[ing] the release of all other 
prisoners in various congested prisons throughout the country who are 
similarly vulnerable but cannot be included in [their petition] due to 
the difficult circumstances;" and (c) declaring "the issuance of ground 
rules relevant to the release of eligible prisoners."</p>
                  <p> Accordingly, the undersigned deems it imperative to clarify that <b>litigants
 may only file petitions and other pleadings sanctioned by the 
Constitution, law, or procedural rules promulgated by this Court</b>. In
 other words, this Court is generally not bound to entertain or to give 
due course to unsanctioned petitions. Nonetheless, the arguments put 
forth in the pleadings of both parties involve: (a) significant and 
far-reaching implications on disputes involving a collision of general 
welfare and individual rights; and (b) unprecedented and pressing 
concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic currently affecting the whole 
nation. Considering the magnitude of the pandemic which affects all 
sectors of society, there is now a pressing need and compelling 
justification to suspend the application of the doctrine of hierarchy of
 courts and to take on its constitutional duty to settle controversies. 
However, such statement should not be interpreted to mean that litigants
 shall have an unbridled freedom to file unsanctioned pleadings directly
 before this Court. Hence, it should be emphasized that the<i> rarity</i>
 of the present occurrence (which is the present COVID-19 pandemic) is 
more than enough to indicate to the public that this act of giving due 
course to the present petition shall not be abused as it is primarily 
based on observations regarding compelling matters raised by both 
parties as earlier mentioned.

                  <p>The aforementioned sources of international law 
have been traditionally categorized into peremptory and non-peremptory 
norms. On one hand, <b>peremptory norms</b> or <i>jus cogens</i> refers to those mandatory and non-derogable norms or principles which give rise to <i>erga omnes</i> obligations (even if no consensus exists on their substance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup>) and which are modifiable only by general international norms of equivalent authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> On the other hand, <b>non-peremptory norms</b>, are those international principles or rules which do not have compelling or binding effect against a state.</p>
                  <p> Concomitantly, the 1987 Philippine Constitution 
contains some provisions alluding to the practice of considering 
international norms and principles as part of domestic laws. However, it
 is settled that the Constitution is the basic and paramount law to 
which all other laws must conform and to which all persons, including 
the highest officials of the land, must defer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup>
 This long-standing doctrinal pronouncement, in relation to 
international law, is consistent with Articles 1 (2) and 55 of the UN 
Charter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> which espouses "the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup>
 From a Philippine legal standpoint, international norms which are 
considered forming part of domestic laws must still yield to the 
supremacy of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup>
 Consequently, both peremptory and non-peremptory norms may become part 
of the sphere of domestic law as provided under the present Constitution
 either by: (a) <b>transformation</b>—a method which requires an international law or principle to be converted to domestic law thru a constitutional <i>mechanism</i> such as enactment of an enabling legislation or ratification of a treaty; and (b) <b>incorporation</b>—a method where an international law or principle is deemed to have the force of domestic law thru a constitutional<i> declaration</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup>
 Of these methods, it is understood that international norms are either 
transformed or incorporated into domestic laws depending on which 
category they belong.
                  </p><p> Article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105] </sup>(Vienna Convention) states that "a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm <u><b>accepted</b> and <b>recognized</b> by the international community of States</u>
 as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which 
can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law 
having the same character." Since Section 2, Article II of the 
Constitution expressly states that the Philippines "adopts the <b>generally accepted</b> principles of international law as part of the law of the land," it is beyond question that only norms which have attained a <b>peremptory</b> status by general acceptance or recognition by the community of states can be considered as part of the law of the land by <b>incorporation</b>. Resultantly, all other norms <b><i>not</i> contemplated</b> or <b>covered</b> in the <b>definition</b> of <b>"peremptory norm"</b> in Article 53 of the Vienna Convention have to undergo the method of <b>transformation</b>
 in order to have a binding effect as other domestic laws. Furthermore, 
transformation may be undertaken either of the following methods: (a) 
thru ratification of a treaty under Section 21,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Article VII of the Constitution; or (b) thru enactment of an enabling law adopting a non-peremptory norm of international law.

                  <p>The aforementioned provisions clearly show that the UN Charter merely grants <b>recommendatory</b> powers to the UN General Assembly (composed of all member states <i>per</i>
 Article 9 of the same Charter) in terms of policy-making. As observed 
by Associate Justice Marvic Mario Victor F. Leonen (Justice Leonen), UN 
General Assembly Resolutions such as the Nelson Mandela Rules may 
constitute "soft law" or <b>non-binding</b> norms, principles and practices that influence state behavior.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup>
 Consequently, any resolution issued by the UN General Assembly does not
 carry with it the status of being a peremptory norm. Simply put, it has
 no binding effect on UN member states. Since the Nelson Mandela Rules 
gained an official international status <u>thru the UN General Assembly's adoption of a Resolution on December 17, 2015</u>,
 it stands to reason that the same Rules cannot be considered as a 
binding peremptory norm of international law for being merely 
recommendatory. A <b>contrary rule of interpretation</b> which will make
 every resolution of the UN General Assembly, like the Nelson Mandela 
Rules, automatically binding and part of the law of the land <b>would undermine and unduly restrict the sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines</b>.
 It stifles the Republic's prerogative to interpret international laws 
thru the lenses of its own legal system or tradition. Therefore, <u>the 
Nelson Mandela Rules needs to be transformed into a domestic law thru an
 enabling act of Congress in a clear and unequivocal manner</u> to have a legally binding force.</p>

                  <p>At this juncture, there now arises a need to determine whether this Court or the entire Judicial branch is <i>constitutionally-empowered</i> to <i>issue writs or other orders</i> to <i>compel</i> the Bureau of Corrections and all the other public respondents to<i> implement </i>Section 4 of the Bureau of Corrections Act in some <i>particular manner</i>.</p>
                  <p> The answer strongly points to the negative for the following reasons:
                  </p><p> <b><i>First</i></b>, the general import of the
 terms in Section 4 (a) of the Bureau of Corrections Act in relation to 
the Nelson Mandela Rules clearly shows that such provision (Section 4) 
is not judicially-enforceable.
                  </p><p> In constitutional interpretation, it is 
settled that a provision is self-executing if the nature and extent of 
the right conferred and the liability imposed are fixed by the 
Constitution itself, so that they can be determined by an examination 
and construction of its terms, and there is no language indicating that 
the subject is referred to the legislature for action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup>
 The same can be said of statutory interpretation if the law itself 
clearly defines a right in terms of its nature and extent as well as the
 liability or duty imposed pursuant to such right. In effect, statutory 
provisions which are not self-executing do not confer rights which can 
be judicially enforced—they only provide guidelines for executive 
action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup>                  
                  </p><p> The phrase "in compliance with established United Nations standards" in Section 4 (a) of the Bureau of Corrections Act is <b>so generic</b> that it clearly appears to be <b>silent regarding the manner of its implementation</b>.
 A thorough reading of the law will reveal that Section 23 of the same 
law merely delegates the task of jointly promulgating the necessary 
implementing rules and regulations to the Department of Justice (DOJ) in
 coordination with the Bureau of Corrections, the Civil Service 
Commission (CSC), the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), and the
 Department of Finance (DOF)."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> The law is also silent as to the degree (moderate or strict).
                  </p><p> For purposes of demonstration, the undersigned
 reproduces some provisions in the Nelson Mandela Rules pertaining to 
the accommodation of prisoners as follows:
                  </p><blockquote>

 wherever practicable for children to be born in a hospital outside the

in the birth certificate. (Underscoring supplied)</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p> As to the issue of specific implementation, the 
following phrases of the afore-cited Nelson Mandela Rules stand out: (a)
 "reasonable accommodation and adjustments;" (b) "full and effective 
access to prison life on an equitable basis;" (c) "shall meet all 
requirements of health;" (d) "cubic content of air, minimum floor space,
 lighting, heating and ventilation;" (e) "special accommodation;" and 
(f) "[a]rrangements shall be made." All of these phrases do not provide 
specific details as to the manner of implementation. They all appear to 
constitute or operate as primary guidelines for the proper handling of 
inmates in terms of accommodation. For instance, the words "reasonable,"
 "access," "special," and "arrangements" are so vague that the 
ministerial duty of an executive or administrative agency cannot be 
pinpointed in terms of the effectivity of a mandatory injunctive <i>writ</i>. Bluntly speaking, how will the Bureau of Corrections determine what is "special" or what is "reasonable" in executing a <i>writ</i>? <b>A
 court cannot simply define these terms and invent parameters akin to 
administrative issuances resembling subordinate legislation.</b> Other 
details lacking in the general import of the Nelson Mandela Rules are 
the dimensions associated with "cubic content of air, minimum floor 
space, lighting, heating and ventilation." The dimensions regarding the 
living quarters and amenities provided in Implementing Rules and 
Regulations<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> (IRR) of the 
Bureau of Corrections Act cannot possibly be altered by virtue of a 
court order without violating the principle of separation of powers. As 
pointed out earlier, Section 23 of the Bureau of Corrections Act places 
the task of promulgating the IRR on the DOJ (in coordination with the 
Bureau of Corrections), the CSC, the DBM and the DOF. There is nothing 
in the same Section which permits the courts to adjust these rules based
 on "equitable" considerations. Under the circumstances contemplated in 
the aforementioned provisions in the Nelson Mandela Rules, only the 
Executive department can reasonably determine the parameters of its 
compliance. Besides, the Judiciary's interference with the Executive 
department in the enforcement of a plain provision of the statute would,
 in effect, destroy the independence of the latter department and 
subject it under the former's ultimate control.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup>
                  </p><p> As keenly observed by Chief Justice Diosdado 
M. Peralta (Chief Justice Peralta), the Nelson Mandela Rules espouse the
 generally vicarious idea that it is the responsibility of every state 
to make accommodations in prisons well suited for proper hygiene, 
nutrition and hydration, especially to prisoners with particular health 
care needs. These rules, instead, highlight the obligation of 
transferring prisoners, whether convicts or detainees, with urgent 
medical conditions to specialized institutions and in specialized 
facilities where they can have prompt access to medical attention. The 
main premises for the application of international law principles are 
lacking in the case of the petitioners, especially in the absence of an 
emerging and/or immediate need to receive specialized medical attention 
which the prison facilities cannot cater to and address at the moment.
                  </p><p> <b><i>Second</i></b>, the implementation of the Bureau of Corrections Act is dependent on the available funds of the Bureau.
                  </p><p> Section 22 of the same law provides:
                  </p><blockquote>
                    <p> Section 22. Implementation. - The<b> implementation </b>of this Act shall be undertaken in staggered phases, but not to exceed five (5) years, <u>taking into consideration the <b>financial position</b> of the <b>national government</b></u>: Provided, That any partial implementation shall be uniform and proportionate for all ranks. (Emphasis supplied)</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p> Yearly financial positions of the national 
government are mostly dependent on factors beyond its control. For 
instance, revenues thru tax and regulatory fee collections cannot be 
reasonably predicted. Various factors—such as the number of taxpayers, 
the net taxable income of taxpayers, the volume of activities involving 
excise and value-added taxes, the number of applicants of any sanctioned
 permit or franchise—all fluctuates depending on results on the dynamics
 of the nation's collective economic activities. This translates to 
uncertain internal revenue streams which accounts for almost all of the 
sources of the nation's resources available for budget. To add to the 
Bureau of Corrections' financial woes, the national government has also 
to contend with budgetary concerns coming from other sectors (or 
problems) of society which, frankly, are within the absolute prerogative
 of Congress to prioritize; sadly, even over the needs of correctional 
facilities. Unsurprisingly, this is beyond the control of the Bureau of 
Corrections and, sometimes, even beyond the control of Congress if it 
has to respond to exigencies.
                  </p><p> Another factor is the unpredictability of the 
influx of inmates in correctional or detention facilities. Even with the
 most sophisticated data-gathering methods and analytical tools assisted
 by the current capabilities of modern technology, both the Executive 
and the Legislative cannot reasonably estimate or anticipate how many 
persons will commit crimes in a stated interval of time. In order to 
demonstrate this problem, the undersigned reproduces Section 12 of the 
Nelson Mandela Rules as follows:
                  </p><p align="center"> <b>Rule 12</b>

                  </blockquote>
                  <p>A <b><i>realistic</i> assessment</b> of the 
Philippine correctional system will show that the national government's 
financial position cannot possibly cope up with the standards of the 
Nelson Mandela Rules which even contemplates prisoners detained in 
"individual cells or rooms" for "each prisoner" to occupy "by himself or
 herself." To add to the Bureau of Corrections' burdens, the first 
paragraph of the afore-cited rule even goes as far as to imply that 
"temporary overcrowding" is or should be the norm in correctional 
facilities. For some countries with seemingly unlimited resources and 
relatively low crime rates, compliance is considerably possible. 
However, for the Philippines which has been reportedly afflicted with 
persisting issues of overcrowding, the instance of "temporary 
overcrowding" is colloquially "<i>pangarap ng gising</i>" (the stuff of 
dreams). Admittedly, the Bureau of Corrections has limited land area or 
real estate. Any adaptive measure as to the influx of inmates will have 
to be "vertical"—correctional buildings will have to be remodelled in 
order to add more stories or floors to house more cells. Any budget 
allotted by the national government to the Bureau of Corrections will 
have to be stretched to meet such accommodational needs.</p>
                  <p> As regards the provisions of the IRR on 
accommodation and facilities (which appears to provide details in 
relation to the Nelson Mandela Rules), the implementation of a mandatory
 injunctive<i> writ</i> will be inherently limited by the availability of funds. <i>First</i>, the provisions in the IRR containing matters relating to the standards under the Nelson Mandela Rules (<i>i.e</i>. ventilation, floor area, lighting, <i>etc.</i>) all <b><i>require funds </i></b>to be realized. <i>Second</i>, the IRR is a subordinate legislation—it <b><i>merely implements</i></b>
 the provisions in the Bureau of Corrections Act with the aid of 
congressionally-provided funds. Stated differently, the IRR is: (a) not a
 source of substantive rights and substantive obligations which, under 
the Constitution, are properly created or recognized by substantive 
laws; and (b) dependent upon available funds as appropriated by 
Congress. Hence, in terms of accommodation, any judicial relief asserting
 to enjoin some form of compliance with the provisions of the IRR will 
merely amount to a "paper relief" when funds are inadequate to execute a
 <i>writ</i>.
                  </p><p> To be clear, the undersigned is <i>not</i> 
saying that, just because the Executive branch is currently limited in 
its resources to comply with the mandate in Section 4 of the Bureau of 
Corrections Act, any solution to address the poor and substandard state 
of existing correctional and other detention facilities is, and will 
remain to be impossible to achieve. It is not impossible for the 
government to improve its financial status and adequately provide for 
the sectors that currently lack the needed funding. All that the 
undersigned is saying is that the proper branches of government 
constitutionally-empowered to raise the needed funding and to remedy the
 situation regarding the accommodation and sanitation problems affecting
 correctional and other detention facilities are the political 
branches—the Legislative and the Executive—not the Judiciary. In sum, 
the very reason for denying the instant petition is to avoid violating 
the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution—not because this 
Court is or should be insensitive to the plight of the petitioners.
                  </p><p> <b><i>Third</i></b>, the respondents' present <i>inability</i>
 to comply with the Nelson Mandela Rules or Section 4 of the Bureau of 
Corrections Act regarding the accommodation of all prisoners cannot be 
considered as a ground to release the petitioners pursuant to the 
constitutional prohibition against cruel, degrading or inhuman 
punishment.
                  </p><p> To begin with, the petitioners' (except for 
Lilia Bucatcat who is presently serving her sentence) previous arrest 
and present temporary detention are not considered as penalties or 
punishments as contemplated in Article 24 (1) of the Revised Penal Code 
because the service of a sentence of one in prison begins only on the 
day the judgment of conviction becomes final.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> However, since Article 29<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup>
 of the Revised Penal code provides that convicted "[o]ffenders or 
accused who have undergone preventive imprisonment shall be credited in 
the service of their sentence consisting of deprivation of liberty, with
 the full time during which they have undergone preventive 
imprisonment,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> the undersigned deems it necessary to elucidate further on the matter of cruel, degrading and inhuman punishments.
                  </p><p> The prohibition against the infliction of cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment in Section 19,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> Article III of the present Constitution was derived from the Eighth Amendment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup>
 of the US Constitution which likewise proscribes the infliction of 
"cruel and unusual" punishments. However, what constitutes cruel and 
unusual punishment has not been exactly defined.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> Instead, the Court in <b><i>Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice, et al.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> provides several insights on what cruel, degrading and inhuman punishment includes, <i>viz</i>: (a) "death penalty <i>per se</i>
 is not a cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment;" (b) "[p]unishments 
are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death" as they 
"impl[y] [that] there something inhuman and barbarous, something more 
than the mere extinguishment of life;" (c) "[i]n a limited sense, 
anything is cruel which is calculated to give pain or distress, and 
since punishment imports pain or suffering to the convict;" (d) the 
cruelty proscribed by the Constitution is that which is "inherent in the
 method of punishment, not the necessary suffering involved in any 
method employed to extinguish life humanely;" (e) what is cruel and 
unusual ""is not fastened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as 
public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice" and "must draw 
its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the 
progress of a maturing society;" and (f) "the primary indicator of 
society's standard of decency with regard to capital punishment is the 
response of the country's legislatures to the sanction."
                  </p><p> In relation to deprivation of liberty, whether
 imposed as a punishment or preventive measure, the Court should turn to
 the deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission (Constitutional
 Commission) for guidance regarding the accommodation of inmates, the 
portions of which are hereunder reproduced as follows:

 I will not deal with the death penalty because it has already been

 to say a few words on that, too. But I am referring to cruel, degrading
 and inhuman punishment. I am drawing upon my experience as the Chairman
 of the National Police Commission for many years. As Chairman of the 
National Police Commission, the same way that General de Castro here 
was, one of my duties was to effect the inspection of jails all over the
 country. We must admit that our jails are a shame to our race. Once we 
were invited by the United Nations' expert on penology — I do not 
remember his name, but he is a doctor friend of mine — and he reported 
back to us that our jails are penological monstrosities.</div></td>

 sleep while the other half sit up to wait, until the other half wake

 fought for the Adult Probation Law because I remember what Winston 
Churchill and the criminologist Dostoevski said: "If you want to know 
the level of civilization of a country, all you have to do is visit 
their jails." In jurisprudence, the interpretation of "cruel and unusual
 punishment" in the United States Constitution was made by the Supreme 
Court when it said, and I quote: "Interpretation of the Eight[h] 
Amendment in the phrase 'cruel and unusual punishment,' must draw its 
meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of
 a maturing society." Courts in the United States in 10 landmark cases —
 some of these I would like to mention in passing: Halt v. Sarver, 
Jackson v. Bishop, Jackson v. Handrick, Jordan v. Fitzharris and Roddy

                  <p>As shown in the aforementioned exchanges, 
Commissioner Teodulo C. Natividad (Commissioner Natividad) initially 
proposed that the prohibition on cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment 
be made to cover subhuman accommodations of inmates in correctional and 
other detention facilities. Contrastingly, Commissioner Joaquin G. 
Bernas (Commissioner Bernas) opposed Commissioner Natividad's proposal 
by enunciating that <u>the <b>purpose </b>of such <b>prohibition</b> is "to provide a <b><i>norm</i></b> for<b> invalidating</b> a <b>penalty</b> that is <b>imposed</b> by law" or "to <b>invalidate</b> the <b>law <i>itself</i></b> which imposes a penalty that is cruel, degrading or inhuman"— not to recognize a substantive right</u>.
 However, Commissioner Natividad's proposal gained traction as 
Commissioner Regalado E. Maambong (Commissioner Maambong) supported the 
idea that the prohibition on cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment be 
made to encompass subhuman jail conditions as follows:</p>

constitutional provision against cruel or unusual punishment. I do not 
wish to be expansive about it. I will try to stick to my time limit, but

 would like to call the attention of the Committee to certain things

modern nations that the concept of cruel or unusual punishment is not 
limited to instances in which a particular inmate or pretrial prisoner 
is subjected to a punishment directed to him as an individual, such as 
corporal punishment or torture, confinement in isolation or in large

 itself within a given institution may amount to cruel or unusual 
punishment prohibited by the Constitution where the confinement is 
characterized by conditions and practices that are so bad as to be

be understood that the life, safety and health of human beings, to say 
nothing of their dignity, are at stake. Although inmates are not 
entitled to a country club existence, they should be treated in a fair 
manner. Certainly, they do not deserve degrading surroundings and unsanitary

 in order to address the observation that it is inconceivable for 
Congress to enact a statute prescribing on its face for a cruel, 
degrading or inhuman punishment. After a stimulating exchange of ideas, 
the framers eventually arrived at a compromise as shown by the following

best be left to the Legislature. This translated into an <b><i>unopposed approval</i></b>

                  <p>Clearly, only Congress has the constitutional power to address subhuman conditions that plague our penal institutions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> The Court <b>cannot isolate</b> Section 19 (1) and<b> ignore </b>Section 19 (2) if it is expected to uphold the Constitution. The fact that Section 19 <b>(2)</b>, Article III of the Philippine Constitution <b>has no counterpart</b> in the <b>US Constitution</b>,
 patently shows that the framers of the Constitution had understood and 
realized the inherent and realistic financial limitation of 
congressional appropriation.</p>
                  <p> Accordingly, the undersigned respectfully reiterates the <b>basic</b> principle that the Constitution is to be <b>interpreted as a whole</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> A constitutional provision <b>should function to the full extent</b> of its substance and its terms, not by itself alone, but in conjunction with all other provisions of that great document.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup>
 No one provision of the Constitution is to be separated from all the 
others, to be considered alone, but that all the provisions bearing upon
 a particular subject are to be brought into view and to be so 
interpreted as to effectuate the great purposes of the instrument— 
sections bearing on a particular subject should be considered and 
interpreted together as to effectuate the whole purpose of the 
Constitution and <b>one section is not to be allowed to defeat another</b>, if by any reasonable construction, the two can be made to stand together.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup>
 In other words, a provision of the Constitution does not operate in 
isolation without regard to others. This is because the law must not be 
read in truncated parts, its provisions must be read in relation to the 
whole law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> As such, <b>cherry-picking
 principles in order to uphold a desired and pre-determined result not 
only betrays the solemn and constitutional duty of magistrates to be 
impartial but is also a fundamentally-proscribed indirect method of 
altering or repealing provisions of the Constitution</b>.
                  </p><p> Furthermore, the scope of the term "law" has 
always been understood to be limited to congressionally-enacted 
statutes. It cannot be reasonably interpreted to mean or encompass 
either judicial decisions (including procedural rules promulgated by the
 Court in the exercise of its rule-making power) or administrative rules
 promulgated by the Executive Department <i>without violating the basic principle of separation of powers</i>.
 It is a well-settled principle of constitutional construction that the 
language employed in the Constitution must be given their ordinary 
meaning except where technical terms are employed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup>                  
                  </p><p> In the case of Section 19 (2), Article III of 
the Constitution, there is nothing in the same provision which 
reasonably points to the possibility that the term "law" carries with it
 a technical meaning encompassing the common law practice of referring 
to judicial decisions as "laws." As pointed out earlier in the 
deliberations of the Constitutional Commission, the phrase <b>"dealt with by law"</b> has been clarified when Commissioner Florenz D. Regalado propounded the question: <b>"How do we determine what is substandard?"</b> to which Commissioner Bernas succinctly responded: <b>"We leave that to the <i>legislature</i>."</b>
 This exchange leaves no doubt as to the meaning of the term "law" as 
used in Section 19 (2), Article III of the Constitution—it clearly 
refers to statutes enacted by Congress. Besides, jurisprudence is 
already settled that: (a) <b>judicial decisions</b> which apply and/or interpret the law <b>are not laws</b> although they are considered as "part of the law of the land;"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> and (b) <b>administrative rules and regulations</b>, even if they "have the force and effect of law," <b>are <i>not </i>laws</b> as they do not establish demandable rights and enforceable obligations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup>
 For purposes of interpreting the term "law" in the context of Section 
19 (2), Article III of the Constitution, it is not difficult to fathom 
that there is a clear line demarcating between what is legislative and 
what is not. Accordingly, Congress has to act first by enacting a 
remedial statute before the Executive and the Judiciary can validly 
proceed to promulgate any measure if subhuman conditions of detention 
facilities are to be addressed in accordance with what the Constitution 
prescribes.
                  </p><p> As such, it is unfair to insinuate that this 
Court is being "deliberately indifferent" to the petitioners' plight if 
it refuses to grant the instant petition when <b>no less than the Constitution itself</b>
 lodges the power of addressing "the use of substandard or inadequate 
penal facilities under subhuman conditions" on Congress. Those who feel 
that the duty (of addressing the subhuman conditions of detention 
facilities) should be shared by <i>all </i>branches of the government 
even without any enabling law should also be mindful that the only 
remedy at this point is a constitutional amendment— not an expanded but 
contrived interpretation of the Constitution— lest this Court do 
violence to the basic principle of separation of powers.
                  </p><p> Moreover, Section 19 (2), Article III of the Constitution effectively preserved the doctrine in <b><i>People v. Dionisio</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> (promulgated during the time when the 1935 Constitution was still in effect) which espoused that "<b><i>[w]hat</i></b> evils should be corrected as pernicious to the body politic, and <b><i>how</i></b>
 correction should be done, is a matter primarily addressed to the 
discretion of the legislative department, not of the courts." As to "<b><i>how</i></b> correction should be done," the Court had already clarified in <b><i>Lim, et al. v. People et al.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> thusly:
                  </p><blockquote>
                    <p> Settled is the rule that a punishment authorized
 by statute is not cruel, degrading or disproportionate to the nature of
 the offense unless it is <u><b>flagrantly <i>and</i> plainly oppressive <i>and</i> wholly disproportionate</b>
 to the nature of the offense as to shock the moral sense of the 
community. It takes more than merely being harsh, excessive, out of 
proportion or severe for a penalty to be obnoxious to the Constitution</u>.
 Based on this principle, the Court has consistently overruled 
contentions of the defense that the penalty of fine or imprisonment 
authorized by the statute involved is cruel and degrading. (Emphasis 
supplied)</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p> To be considered as constitutionally repulsive under the afore-cited pronouncement in <b><i>Lim</i></b>, a punishment prescribed by the statute <i>itself</i> must be flagrant and plainly oppressive <i>as well</i>
 as disproportionate. Consistent with the Constitutional Commission's 
deliberations on Section 19 (2), Article III of the Constitution, this 
pronouncement refers to the statute <i>itself</i> and <i>not</i> to the <i>implementation</i> of such statute. As such, the pronouncement in <b><i>David, et al. v. Macapagal-Arroyo, et al.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133] </sup>makes
 it straightforward and clear that "[t]he criterion by which the 
validity of the statute or ordinance is to be measured is the <b>essential basis</b> for the exercise of power, and <b>not</b> a <b>mere incidental <i>result</i></b> arising <b>from</b> its <b>exertion</b>." This means that a punishment <i>per se</i> as provided by law does not become cruel, degrading or inhuman due to the results of its implementation but due to the <i>basis</i>
 or legislative intention of its enactment. Besides, a cruel, degrading 
or inhuman manner of implementing an otherwise 
constitutionally-permissive punishment exposes the responsible public 
officer or employee to corresponding criminal, civil and administrative 
liabilities. Accordingly, the undersigned nevertheless finds it 
imperative and appropriate to point out that <i>incidents </i>in the <i>implementation</i> of a punishment have proper recourses and do not affect the validity of the statute or ordinance providing for such sanction.
                  </p><p> Anent the <b>flagrance</b> (as contemplated in <b><i>Lim</i></b>)
 of an oppressive or wholly disproportionate nature as one of the 
indicators that a punishment may be cruel, degrading or inhuman, the 
undersigned points out that detention <i>per se</i> which incidentally 
results in the deprivation of the prisoners' sanitation needs can hardly
 be equated to "torture" under R.A. No. 9745.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> Section 3 (a) of the same law states:
                  </p><blockquote>
                    <p> (a) "Torture" refers to an act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is <b><i>intentionally</i> inflicted</b> on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him/her or a third person information or a confession; <b>punishing</b> him/her for an act he/she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed; or <b>intimidating</b> or <b>coercing</b> him/her or a third person; or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is <b>inflicted</b> by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a person in authority or agent of a person in authority. <u>It does <b><i>not</i> include</b> pain or suffering arising only from, <b>inherent</b> in or <b><i>incidental</i></b> to lawful sanctions</u>.

                  <p> The terms of the aforementioned provision clearly contemplate unlawful instances of <b>flagrant</b> or <b>intentional</b> infliction of pain or suffering on the part of the perpetrator. Any pain or suffering <b>inherent</b> in or <b>incidental</b> to lawful sanctions are <b><i>excluded</i></b>
 from the definition of "torture." This only means that, if any pain or 
suffering arises incidental to or due to the inherent nature of a 
punishment or sanction imposed by legislature, the same may not be 
deemed as "torture" to invoke the constitutional prohibition against 
cruel, degrading or inhuman punishment for being flagrant. Although not 
committed to the idea that only torture constitutes cruel, degrading and
 inhuman punishment, the undersigned still maintains its prudent stand 
that Legislature is the <b>only</b> branch of government tasked under 
Section 19 (2), Article III of the Constitution to address subhuman 
conditions in jails and other detention facilities. Such task—of either <b>enacting</b> a special appropriations law or <b>including</b> in its yearly general appropriations law funds and measures for the upliftment of jail conditions—<b>cannot be forced upon Congress by any judicial <i>writ</i></b>.
 Regrettably, the basic principle of checks-and-balances do not allow 
this Court to consider the petitioners as continually being subjected to
 torture in their present detention conditions absent any indication of 
flagrance on the respondents' part as it will unduly expand the 
statutory definition of torture. Besides, judicial review may only be 
resorted to when there is grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or
 excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of 
the government—not work as a peremptory <i>writ</i> of <i>mandamus</i> improperly applied to compel the performance of an inherently discretionary act such as legislation.
                  </p><p> In conclusion, the undersigned reiterates that the <i>extent</i>
 of judicial remedies should only be those which are circumscribed by 
substantive law if the fundamental constitutional doctrine of separation
 of powers is to be respected. The Judiciary must function within its 
sphere of its power—which does not include the power to order either the
 Legislative to enact a law or the Executive to issue a particular 
implementing rule not mandated by any statute.
                  </p><p> <b><i>Last</i></b>, courts are not 
constitutionally empowered, to issue advisory opinions or promulgate 
rules, even thru adjudication, which amount to giving details as to the 
implementation of statutory provisions.

 A petition must show "an active antagonistic assertion of a legal right
 on one side and a denial thereof on the other concerning a real, and 
not a mere theoretical question or issue."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup>
 In other words, courts have no authority to: (a) pass upon issues 
through advisory opinions; (b) resolve hypothetical or feigned problems 
as well as friendly suits collusively arranged between parties without 
real adverse interests; and (c) adjudicate mere academic questions to 
satisfy scholarly interests, however intellectually challenging.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup>
                    </p><p> Concomitantly, this Court has the

 Comparatively, administrative agencies have the power to make rules and
 regulations which results in delegated legislation that is within the 
confines of the granting statute and the doctrine of non-delegability 
and separability of powers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup>
                    </p><p> As regards the broad standards set by the 
Nelson Mandela Rules as well as the generic terms used in Section 4 (a) 
of the Bureau of Corrections Act, the Court has no power to promulgate 
rules or even order thru adjudication the <i>specific manner</i> on <i>how</i> to implement <i>specific protective measures</i>
 which the inmates are entitled. Such power of "subordinate legislation"
 belongs to administrative agencies to "fill in the gaps of a statute 
for its proper and effective implementation" by virtue of their 
expertise in their fields of specialization.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> In other words, providing for details as to <i>how</i> a provision of law will be <i>carried out</i> or <i>implemented</i>
 is part of executive—not judicial—functions. Moreover, it also goes 
without saying that the Bureau of Corrections is duty-bound under 
Sections 3 and 4 of the Bureau of Corrections Act to look after the 
welfare of the inmates even "including families of inmates and their 
victims." Consequently, <u>this Court would be engaging in subordinate 
legislation if it supplies the details on how to implement the Bureau of
 Corrections Act</u> instead of providing for rules on either pleading 
and practice or protection and enforcement of constitutional rights. 
However, this realization that judicial functions do not include the 
duty to "fill in the gaps of the statute" should be distinguished from 
the courts' power to strike down laws or administrative issuances for 
being unconstitutional or invalid. In this case, striking down portions 
of administrative issuances does not result in the creation of new rules
 or new entitlements— it merely renders such stricken portions 
ineffectual.
                    </p><p> As pointed out by Chief Justice Peralta, 
unless there is clear showing that the petitioners are actually 
suffering from a medical condition that requires immediate and 
specialized attention outside of their confinement—as, for instance, an 
actual and proven exposure to or infection with the SARS-CoV-2—they must
 remain in custody and isolation incidental to the crimes with which 
they were charged, or for which they are being tried or serving 
sentence. Only then can there be an actual controversy and a proper 
invocation of humanitarian and equity considerations that is ripe for 
this Court to determine.
                    </p><p> Associate Justice Rodil V. Zalameda (Justice
 Zalameda) also shares a complementary view that contracting COVID-19 
has become more speculative than real because there is no such case in 
petitioners' actual detention facility due to isolation from the public.
 This negates the actual risk of contracting COVID-19 despite congestion
 and despite their health condition. And although congested facilities 
may hasten the spread of COVID-19, such disease is not borne solely out 
of congested facilities. Furthermore, Justice Zalameda points out that 
the petitioners: (a) did not inform this Court of the COVID-19 situation
 in the areas where they propose to stay for their temporary release; 
and (b) did not show whether they will actually be in a better physical 
environment during their temporary release—as their possible temporary 
release during the duration of the ECQ should also be subject to 
monitoring by the State.
                    </p><p> Take for example the case of petitioner 
Reina Mae A. Nasino who was then pregnant while being detained and is 
currently facing charges for violations of R.A. No. 10591 and R.A. No. 
9165. This Court cannot automatically and unfairly assume that the 
Bureau of Corrections is ill-equipped and inept in handling cases of 
pregnant inmates whether regarding their safekeeping or assisting during
 childbirth and rearing. To order the Bureau of Corrections to 
"undertake measures to protect pregnant inmates and their unborn 
children" would be an empty and redundant display of judicial 
power—amounting to a mere advisory opinion. Besides, it is premature to 
order any protective measure for safe delivery of pregnant inmates who 
have yet to give birth to their children. It is only when there is a 
lapse or deliberate neglect on the Bureau of Correction's performance of
 its duty resulting in injury to both mother and child or a violation of
 the pregnant inmate's right to be taken care of during childbirth can a
 cause (or even a right) of action arise. To recover at all, there must 
be some cause of action at the commencement of the suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> Ultimately, <u>this
 is up to the DOJ (in coordination with the Bureau of Corrections), CSC,
 DBM and DOF to determine the specific measures in which to protect the 
inmates in the custody of all detention facilities in the country</u>.

                    <p>In order to determine whether or not the 
petitioners (who pray for their temporary release on bail or 
recognizance for health and age reasons as well as for the creation of a
 "Prisoner Release Committee" with the accompanying issuance of ground 
rules for such release) may successfully invoke "equity" or "equity 
jurisdiction," it is necessary for the undersigned to explain the legal 
system of the Philippines and its ramifications in terms of 
adjudication.
                    </p><p> At the outset, there are two (2) main 
categories of legal systems or traditions that originally came out of 
Europe: (a) the civil law system; and (b) the common law system. 
Countries like Spain, France, Germany, Portugal, Italy and Switzerland 
have been traditionally labelled as civil law jurisdictions;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup>
 while countries such as the United Kingdom (except Scotland which 
partly adopts the civil law system), the United States of America (US), 
Canada, Australia, New Zealand and other countries of the British 
Commonwealth have been known as common law jurisdictions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup>
                    </p><p> The civil law system (sometimes referred to 
as "statute law" or "statutory law" system by some legal scholars) 
pertains to the practice of deciding cases based on explicit provisions 
of law enacted by an authority like the legislature in the case of 
statutes or the people themselves in the case of constitutions. Here, 
courts ought to recognize "the generative capacity of legislation" for, 
according to orthodox civil law theory, a statute is conceived of as 
"being the most satisfactory and perfect method of realizing justice," 
and as the "unique source of judicial decisions."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup>
 In other words, Congress (or the people in the case of the 
Constitution) has the plenary power to enact laws pertaining to persons 
or things within its territorial jurisdiction; either to introduce new 
laws or repeal the old, unless prohibited expressly or by implication by
 the Constitution or limited or restrained by its own.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> Concomitantly, case laws of civil law jurisdictions are governed by the doctrine of <i>jurisprudence constante</i>.
 Under the latter doctrine, a single decision is not binding on courts 
but, when a series of decisions form a "constant stream of uniform and 
homogenous rulings having the same reasoning," <i>jurisprudence constante</i> applies and operates with "considerable persuasive authority."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup>
                    </p><p> Contrastingly, the common law system 
(sometimes refer to as "judge-made law" or "customary law" by some legal
 scholars) pertains to the practice of settling disputes based on 
customs supplemented with the general principles of justice, fairness 
and equity. In this legal system, parties to the dispute anchor their 
claims or defenses on common practices which they need to substantiate 
with evidence before the courts. Relatedly, case laws in common law 
jurisdictions are governed by the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup>
 where principles which have been laid out in prior decisions create a 
binding precedents as regards future decisions dealing with essentially 
the same factual and/or legal questions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> This has the effect of rendering such prior judicial decisions as "customs" which essentially operate to bind future rulings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup>
 Adherents to the common law system claim that their courts "find" 
rather than "make" the law and, "in doing so are fashioning and refining
 the law as it then existed in light of reason and experience;" thereby 
bringing "the law into conformity with reason and common sense."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup>
 They also claim that "those acts of Parliament, which have from time to
 time been made to enforce this universal law, or to facilitate the 
execution of [its] decisions, are not to be considered as introductive 
of any new rule, but merely as declaratory of the old fundamental 
constitutions of the Kingdom; without which it must cease to be a part 
of the civilized world."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> 
In other words, common law consider statutes as merely re-affirmations 
of universal principles "discovered" thru logical reasoning and 
presumably used by judges in settling a particular dispute. Moreover, 
the practice where "justice must satisfy the appearance of justice"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152] </sup>is the legal norm.
                    </p><p> The Philippines practices the mixed legal 
system due to its Spanish and American influence during the colonial 
periods. Its legal system which comprises <i>primarily</i> (and predominantly) of the civil law system inherited from Spain <i>supplemented</i> by common law principles inherited from the US.
                    </p><p> The civil law aspect of the Philippine legal system derives its foundations from: (a) the presently defunct Act No. 2127<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> which mandates that the language of the text of the law shall prevail in the interpretation of laws;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> (b) the judicially-institutionalized maxims of <i>verba legis non est recedendum</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[155] </sup>(from the words of a statute there should be no departure) and <i>noscitur a sociis</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156] </sup>(where
 a particular word or phrase is ambiguous in itself or is equally 
susceptible of various meanings, its correct construction may be made 
clear and specific by considering the company of words in which it is 
founded or with which it is associated); (c) Articles 7 and 10 of the 
Civil Code where "[l]aws are repealed only by subsequent ones, and their
 violation or non-observance shall not be excused by disuse, or custom 
or practice to the contrary" and "[i]n case of doubt in the 
interpretation or application of laws, it is presumed that the lawmaking
 body intended right and justice to prevail;"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup>
 and (d) the constitutional power of this Court "to determine whether or
 not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or 
excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of 
the Government"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> and assess whether or not there is failure to act in contemplation of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup>
                    </p><p> Concomitantly, the common law aspect of the 
Philippine legal system traces its roots from: (a) Articles 8 and 9 of 
the Civil Code where "[j]udicial decisions applying or interpreting the 
laws or the Constitution shall form a part of the legal system of the 
Philippines" and "[n]o judge or court shall decline to render judgment 
by reason of the silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the laws;" and 
(b) the long-standing judicial adage that "equity follows the law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup>
                    </p><p> As to the legal effect of case laws, the Philippines exercises a unique brand of the common law doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i>.
 Up to a certain degree, this Court will uphold an established precedent
 and, if need be, evaluate such prior ruling by: (a) determining whether
 the rule has proved to be intolerable simply in defying practical 
workability; (b) considering whether the rule is subject to a kind of 
reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequences of 
overruling and add inequity to the cost of repudiation; (c) determining 
whether related principles of law have so far developed as to have the 
old rule no more than a remnant of an abandoned doctrine; and, (d) 
finding out whether facts have so changed or come to be seen 
differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application 
or justification.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> It does
 not strictly and rigidly adhere to precedents akin to those of common 
law jurisdictions like the United Kingdom where judges make law as 
binding as an Act of Parliament.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup>
                    </p><p> In line with the aforementioned backdrop of 
the Philippine legal system, the undersigned will now proceed with the 
merits of the case.
                    </p><p> Here, the petitioners ask this Court to 
exercise its "equity jurisdiction" and to: (a) order their release on 
bail or on recognizance on humanitarian reasons; (b) order the creation 
of a "Prisoner Release Committee" to facilitate the release of all other
 clinically-vulnerable inmates all throughout the country; and (c) 
promulgate ground rules relevant to the release of eligible 
prisoners—all on the ground of "equity"
                    </p><p> The undersigned maintains that this Court cannot grant their prayers due to the following reasons:
                    </p><p> <b><i>First</i></b>, this Court cannot allow the release of the petitioners on the ground of equity without violating the Constitution.
                    </p><p> Adoption by the Philippines of the civil law
 tradition as its predominant or primary attribute of its legal system 
finds its support in the principle of checks-and-balances or separation 
of powers. By the well-known distribution of the powers of government 
among the executive, legislative, and judicial departments by the 
Constitution, there was provided that marvelous scheme of check and 
balances which has been the wonder and admiration of the statesmen, 
diplomats, and jurists in every part of the civilized world.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup>
 In this system, the Legislative makes the law, the Executive implements
 the law, and the Judiciary applies and/or interprets the law. This 
tripartite distribution of powers is inherent in democratic governments 
where no single branch may dominate another. Stated differently, the 
principle of checks-and-balances is inherently woven into the fabric of 
democracy.
                    </p><p> Under the Philippine civil law tradition, courts are principally bound to apply the law<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> and in such a way that it does not usurp legislative powers by judicial legislation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> It is only when the law is ambiguous or of doubtful meaning may the court interpret or construe its true intent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup>
 It ensures that laws are given full effect and that judicial doctrines 
are stable and consistent so that those who are bound may reasonably 
rely upon them in planning their affairs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup>
                    </p><p> Notwithstanding the presence of a 
considerably moderate leeway that the Judiciary enjoys in interpreting 
constitutional and statutory provisions, it is imperative to emphasize 
that there is a sharp distinction between: (a) liberal construction 
which courts are able to find out the true meaning of statutes from the 
language used, the subject matter, and the purposes of those framing 
them; and (b) the act of a court in engrafting upon a law something that
 has been omitted which someone believes ought to have been embraced—the
 former is a legitimate exercise of judicial power while the latter is 
judicial legislation forbidden by the tripartite division of powers 
among the three departments of government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup>
 It presupposes that any perceived "gap" or legal vacuum should be 
within the parameters set by law for courts have no authority to 
short-circuit the democratic process of legislation and determine for 
themselves thru interpretation the best policy that should have been 
clearly enunciated by such statutes. As such, courts should always be 
mindful that, in establishing doctrines, it does not tread on the powers
 of Legislature—whose members are duly elected by the People as their 
representatives and as their instruments of enacting their Sovereign 
Will. This judicial paradigm <b>ensures that the possibility of grave abuse of discretion is mitigated and that decisions are tethered to the law</b>.
 Accordingly, it may be said that the primary duty of adhering to the 
text of the law is in recognition of the inherent nature of the 
democratic process wherein the people elect their representatives who, 
in turn, choose and pursue the appropriate policies on the former's 
behalf. Moreover, the principal judicial recourse of adhering to the 
text of the law before utilizing extrinsic aids or extraneous sources is
 the ultimate manifestation of impartiality and the most objective of 
ways to apply and interpret the law.
                    </p><p> Presently, there is <b><i>no</i></b> constitutional provision or law which<b><i> automatically</i></b>
 grants bail, releases on recognizance or allows other modes of 
temporary liberty to all accused or inmates who are 
clinically-vulnerable (<i>i.e</i>. sickly, elderly or pregnant). As it 
stands, courts concerned will still have to consider the following 
guidelines for bail in Sections 5 and 9, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules 
of Criminal Procedure which is quoted hereunder:
                    </p><blockquote>
                      <p> Section 5. Bail, when discretionary. — Upon conviction by the Regional Trial Court of an offense not punishable by death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i>,
 or life imprisonment, admission to bail is discretionary. The 
application for bail may be filed and acted upon by the trial court 
despite the filing of a notice of appeal, provided it has not 
transmitted the original record to the appellate court. However, if the 
decision of the trial court convicting the accused changed the nature of
 the offense from non-bailable to bailable, the application for bail can
 only be filed with and resolved by the appellate court.</p>
                      <p> Should the court grant the application, the 
accused may be allowed to continue on provisional liberty during the 
pendency of the appeal under the same bail subject to the consent of the
 bondsman.</p>
                      <p> If the penalty imposed by the trial court is 
imprisonment exceeding six (6) years, the accused shall be denied bail, 
or his bail shall be cancelled upon a showing by the prosecution, with 
notice to the accused, of the following or other similar circumstances:</p>

                    <p> The above-mentioned enumerations clearly pertain to <b>purely factual questions</b>
 that trial courts are equipped to pass upon. Moreover, the 
consideration of these factors which includes others not mentioned but 
are analogous to the ones provided means that such guidelines <b>do not work in isolation</b>.
                    </p><p> In this case, the ground of "humanitarian reasons" raised by the petitioners <i>only concerns the fifth factor</i>—age
 and health of the accused. This means that, if this Court will make a 
pronouncement which automatically grants bail or recognizance thereby 
dispensing with the task of evaluating all the factors, such 
predetermination of an entitlement to provisional liberty will 
effectively <b>create a class</b> of prisoners <b>with a substantive right</b> for it is clear that inmates who are liberated are better off than those who are not. <i>Substantive law</i>
 is that part of the law which creates, defines and regulates rights, or
 which regulates the right and duties which in turn give rise to a cause
 of action; that part of the law which courts are established to 
administer; as opposed to <i>adjective or remedial law</i>, which prescribes the method of enforcing rights or obtain redress for their invasions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> Since the function of adjudication implies a determination of facts,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> dispensing with such function of evaluation will also have the effect of <b>creating a substantive right</b>.
 A judicial pronouncement which predetermines an eligibility or 
entitlement does not anymore undergo a "method of enforcing rights or 
obtaining redress of their invasions" which is the very essence of being
 "adjective" or "remedial" thereby intruding into the sphere of 
substantive law.
                    </p><p> Admittedly, the Court may "fill in the gaps" of the law in some circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup>
 But such "gaps" should be within the parameters of the law and such act
 of "filling" should not amount to the creation of a substantive right 
with a corresponding substantive obligation. Besides, the factors in 
Section 9, Rule 114 are intended to "fix a reasonable amount of bail." 
In other words, they cannot be used in the same manner as the factors in
 Section 5 of the same Rule to determine whether an accused is entitled 
to bail.
                    </p><p> Here, the undersigned acknowledges that, 
under Section 25 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, Executive 
Judges of the Regional Trial Courts have the responsibility to "conduct 
monthly personal inspections of provincial, city, and municipal jails 
and their prisoners within their respective jurisdictions;" "ascertain 
the number of detainees, inquire on their proper accommodation and 
health and examine the condition of the jail facilities;" and "order the
 segregation of sexes and of minors from adults, ensure the observance 
of the right of detainees to confer privately with counsel, and strive 
to eliminate conditions inimical to the detainees." However, this does 
not mean that the "age and health of the accused" shall be the only 
determining factor for the grant or denial of bail (assuming for the 
sake of argument that the factors in Sections 5 and 9 are 
interchangeable) as it is obvious that there are other factors that 
courts in bail applications should consider.
                    </p><p> Relatedly, the creation of a "Prisoner 
Release Committee" entails the need for establishing funds for 
operational purposes. Since Section 24, Article VI of the Constitution 
explicitly states that appropriation bills shall originate exclusively 
at the House of Representatives, any attempt on the part of this Court 
to order (premised on interpretation) for a disbursement or release of 
funds for a particular purpose which is devoid of any constitutional or 
statutory fiat will cross the realm of legislative functions. Granting 
reliefs or inventing remedies which are totally devoid of clear 
constitutional or statutory basis is simply <i>ultra vires</i>. As 
maintained by Justice Bernabe, it is beyond the power of the Court to 
institute policies that are not judicial in nature. She further explains
 that, while the Court understands the plight of petitioners in light of
 this unprecedented public health emergency, the creation of a similar 
Prisoner Release Committee is a policy matter best left to the 
discretion of the political branches of government.
                    </p><p> At this point, it becomes noteworthy to 
stress that the civil law tradition does not essentially allow courts to
 craft policies of substantive import. In a book co-authored with Bryan 
A. Garner (famously known as the Editor-in-Chief of Black's Law 
Dictionary), the late former US Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin 
Scalia laments:
                    </p><blockquote>
                      <p> Ours is a common-law tradition in which 
judicial improvisation has abounded. Statutes were a comparatively 
infrequent source of English law through the mid-19th century. Where 
statutes did not exist, the law was the product of judicial invention, 
at least in those many areas where there was no accepted common law for 
courts to "discover." It is unsurprising that the judges who used to be 
the lawgivers took some liberties with the statutes that began to 
supplant their handiwork—adopting, for example, a rule that statutes in 
derogation of the common law (judge-made law) were to be narrowly 
construed and rules for filling judicially perceived "gaps" in statutes 
that had less to do with perceived meaning than with the judges' notions
 of public policy. Such distortion of texts that have been adopted by 
the people's elected representatives is undemocratic. In an age when 
democratically prescribed texts (such as statutes, ordinances, and 
regulations) are the rule, the judge's principal function is to give 
those texts their fair meaning.</p>
                      <p> Some judges, however, refuse to yield the 
ancient judicial prerogative of making the law, improvising on the text 
to produce what they deem socially desirable results—usually at the 
behest of an advocate for one party to a dispute. The judges are also 
prodded by interpretive theorists who avow that courts are "better able 
to discern and articulate basic national ideals than are the people's 
politically responsible representatives." On this view, judges are to 
improvise "basic national ideals of individual liberty and fair 
treatment, even when the content of these ideals is not expressed as a 
matter of positive law in the written Constitution."</p>
                      <p> To the extent that people give this view any 
credence, the notion that judges may (even should) improvise on 
constitutional and statutory text enfeebles the democratic polity. As 
Justice John Marshall Marian warned in the 1960s, an invitation to 
judicial lawmaking results inevitably in "a lessening, on the one hand, 
of judicial independence and, on the other, of legislative 
responsibility, thus polluting the bloodstream of our system of 
government." Why these alarming outcomes? First, when judges fashion law
 rather than fairly derive it from governing texts, they subject 
themselves to intensified political pressures—in the appointment 
process, in their retention, and in the arguments made to them. Second, 
every time a court constitutionalizes a new sliver of law—as by finding a
 "new constitutional right" to do this, that, or the other—that sliver 
becomes henceforth untouchable by the political branches. In the 
American system, a legislature has no power to abridge a right that has 
been authoritatively held to be part of the Constitution—even if that 
newfound right does not appear in the text. Over the past 50 years 
especially, we have seen the judiciary incrementally take control of 
larger and larger swaths of territory that ought to be settled 
legislatively.</p>
                      <p> It used to be said that judges do not "make" law—they simply apply it. In the 20<sup>th</sup>
 century, the legal realists convinced everyone that judges do indeed 
make law. To the extent that this was true, it was knowledge that the 
wise already possessed and the foolish could not be trusted with. It was
 true, that is, that judges did not really "find" the common law but 
invented it over time. Yet this notion has been stretched into a belief 
that judges "make" law through judicial interpretation of democratically
 enacted statutes. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> In the context of US Constitutional law, the 
aforementioned commentary will surely spark debates. Aside from the fact
 that the US had always considered itself as a common law jurisdiction 
since its inception, a perennial theoretical battle has always divided 
the US Supreme Court into two (2) opposing ideological camps primarily 
because of the "unenumerated rights clause" in the Ninth Amendment of 
their Constitution which reads:
                    </p><blockquote>
                      <p> The enumeration in the Constitution, of <b>certain rights</b>, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. (Emphasis supplied)</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> The "liberal" justices of the US Supreme Court 
posit that they are constitutionally-empowered and authorized to 
recognize these "certain rights" which are "implied" by their 
Constitution. They are mostly known to be advocates of the "Living 
Constitution" doctrine where it is ideal to "interpret" the provisions 
in such a way as they "adapt to the times" and "as understood and 
intended by the people of the present." The "conservative" justices, on 
the other hand, argue that it should be Congress—being the people's 
representatives—who are constitutionally-authorized to determine these 
"implied certain rights." They believe that it is "undemocratic" to have
 the unelected judges craft or select policies to meet the exigent needs
 of the times. Understandably, the terms "certain rights" in the Ninth 
Amendment makes Justice Scalia's conservative and highly-textualist 
statements controversial in the arena of US Constitutional law 
discussions.
                    </p><p> In the context of Philippine Constitutional 
law discussions, such "conservative-versus-liberal" debates have little 
bearing or relevance to jurisprudence. The present Philippine 
Constitution, although it draws most of its significant provisions from 
the US Constitution, does not have a provision similar or related to the
 "unenumerated rights clause" of the Ninth Amendment which suggests 
either the existence of implied rights or that the legal system or 
tradition should predominantly adhere or be based on common law instead 
of civil law. The Declaration of Principles and State Policies in 
Article II as well as the Bill of Rights in Article III contain no such 
"unenumerated rights" provision. Neither does Article VIII nor all the 
other articles in the Constitution have the effect of giving the 
Judiciary the power to "determine" any right which may have been 
"implied" in the Constitution. In fact, the opposite seems to be the 
case as it is explicitly shown in Section 1, Article VIII of the 
Constitution which states:
                    </p><blockquote>
                      <p> Section 1. The <b>judicial power</b> shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.</p>
                      <p> Judicial power<b> includes</b> the <b>duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies</b> involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to <b>determine</b> whether or not there has been a <b>grave abuse of discretion</b> amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. (Emphasis supplied)</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> There is nothing in the aforementioned provision
 that the power "to settle actual controversies" which can be 
interpreted to mean that the Judiciary may "recognize certain rights" 
implied in the Constitution thru interpretation or simple application of
 laws. Even the word "includes," when used in the context of the whole 
second paragraph clearly appears to merely enumerate or state the <b>scope</b>
 of "judicial power" which includes both the duty to—(a) settle actual 
controversies; and (b) determine whether or not there has been a grave 
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the 
part of any branch or instrumentality of the government. Moreover, it 
cannot be reasonably implied that the term "justice" in the phrase 
"courts of justice" gives magistrates an unfettered prerogative of 
straying away from legislative enactments. On the contrary, the phrase 
"to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion 
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction" strongly suggests that even
 judicial functions should be within the parameters of the law. Such 
principle is shown by rulings explaining that the <i>writ</i> of <i>certiorari'</i>s purpose is supervisory to keep inferior courts within the parameters of their respective jurisdictions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> Since jurisdiction is "the power and authority of a court to hear, try, and decide a case"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> "conferred only by the Constitution or by statute,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup> it is inevitable to assume that explicit provisions define the limits of judicial power only to those matters <i>within the confines</i> of the law.
                    </p><p> Besides, the adjudicative approach of 
primarily resorting or deferring to the text of the law is not without 
cogent reasons. It greatly minimizes, if not removes, any personal and 
subconscious bias that an unelected magistrate may inadvertently factor 
in weighing the rights or interests and obligations of conflicting 
parties. This is the reason why a judge must always maintain cold 
neutrality and impartiality for he or she is a magistrate, not an 
advocate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> Moreover, such 
approach is also in recognition of the idea that, in a democratic and 
republican system of government, laws are borne out of the general 
consensus of the people's directly chosen representatives. It ensures 
that magistrates do not wander far away into their own subjective 
preferences. As such, what it says according to the text of the 
provision to be construed compels acceptance and negates the power of 
the courts to alter it, based on the postulate that the framers and the 
people mean what they say.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup>
                    </p><p> Accordingly, those claiming that the resort 
to common law is "progressive" fail to realize that even such legal 
tradition is as ancient as the civil law tradition relative to the 
modern times. The idea is not novel or revolutionary such as to create a
 messianic realization that our Judiciary, all on its own, should 
suddenly discard the civil law aspect of its legal tradition and wholly 
replace it with common law.
                    </p><p> However, the undersigned is not saying that 
the Philippines cannot change the primary aspect of its legal system or 
tradition from civil law to common law. Such shift in legal tradition 
should be done in a constitutionally-permissible manner. Stated 
differently, there are constitutionally-sanctioned processes or remedies
 available to change a policy, governmental structure, or legal culture.
 These processes should not be bypassed for the sake of convenience or 
disputable exigencies if this government is one "of laws and not of 
men." All that the undersigned is emphasizing is that a shift in legal 
tradition would require no less than a constitutional (or legislative 
for purely statutory rights and obligations) amendment or revision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup>—a
 process explicitly sanctioned in the Constitution itself. For now, the 
Judiciary cannot short-circuit the legislative democratic process and 
invent a new right in the guise of interpretation.
                    </p><p> At some point, the people should be able to 
bear the brunt of being responsible in their exercise of the 
constitutional right to suffrage. The present existing policies are but 
fruits of the seeds sowed by the people thru the exercise of their right
 to vote. Policies are virtually the results of public consensus—of 
majoritarian choice, if the basic ideals of democracy itself are to be 
respected. Those who are unhappy with these policies have the option to 
vote for a new set of officials come elections. For the majority, this 
is relatively effortless; but for the minority, it is up to them to <i>convince</i> those on the other side on the <i>merits</i> of their choices—there should be <i>no compulsion</i>,
 even thru judicial enforcement, as it is a vice on sovereign will; 
unless, of course, fundamental rights are arbitrarily violated. More 
importantly, those principles and values that we have come to accept as 
"absolute" or to recognize as "inherent" did not even start out as 
such—they arose and developed as a result of the people's collective and
 cumulative experiences as well as their corresponding responses over 
time. We might hold some values or principles dear to our hearts, but 
that does not mean that we are absolutely entitled to legally enforce 
them against others just because we strongly believe in them; more so 
that strong personal beliefs especially of unelected magistrates do not 
make general consensus. These values and principles <b>must first be recognized</b> by the Constitution or law <b>in a clear and discernible manner</b>.
 Surely, principles and values are not static just as all the other 
aspects of the world that influence or dictate our lives; but they have 
to function according to the legal platform in which they are 
recognized.
                    </p><p> Besides, society has matured to the point 
where a fundamental safeguard known as the Bill of Rights have been 
positively recognized in the Constitution instead of implied from the 
vague and undefined concept of common or natural law. Thru experience 
and thru democracy's emergence, fears that fundamental rights and 
freedoms might be trumped by the arbitrariness of government's 
legislature in wielding its power have long dissipated. The Constitution
 had already placed sovereign power in the hands of the people and had 
bound the hands of the government from abusing its power.
                    </p><p> <b><i>Second</i></b>, courts cannot take an 
unbridled approach of considering anything judicially-perceived to be 
"lacking" in the text of the law as "gaps" which instantaneously call 
for the application of equity because it violates the principle of 
separation of powers.

 of these cases, the undersigned evinces his observations that: (1) the 
grant of a relief based on equity was, in turn, based on some <i>specific provision</i> of law found on the Civil Code and other laws which allow for the application of equity to some degree (<i>e.g</i>.
 Articles 19, 477, 1192, 1229, 1310, 1359, 1362, 1423, 1486, 1520, 1547,
 1601, 1603, 1711, 1722, 1741, 1762, 1794, 1797, 1798, 1819, 1831, 2142,
 2208, 2215 and 2227 of the Civil Code); and (2) the exercise of equity 
jurisdiction was resorted to set aside the rules of procedure in favor 
of resolving cases on the merits or upholding substantive rights.
                    </p><p> In the instant case, the petitioners' 
reliance on equity is misplaced for they are asking this Court to grant 
them a relief not supported by any provision of the Constitution or law.
 While the rules on bail appear to be inflexible on the petitioners' 
part, equity does not authorize courts to create substantive rights by 
way of "adjustment" and in the guise of interpretation. Granting 
provisional liberty to the petitioners may or may not be morally right 
depending on the personal belief of each individual person. However, 
what is "moral," "just," "fair," or "equitable" is highly subjective and
 relative; which is why a reasonable inference (such as the text of a 
law) is needed to minimize subjectivity and strengthen the impartiality 
of presiding magistrates and mitigate instances of grave abuse of 
discretion. As aptly put in <b><i>Rural Bank of Parañaque, Inc. v. Remolado, et al.</i></b>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[197]</sup>
                    </p><blockquote>
                      <p> Justice is done according to law. As a rule, 
equity follows the law. There may be a moral obligation, often regarded 
as an equitable consideration (meaning compassion), but if there is no 
enforceable legal duty, the action must fail although the disadvantaged 
party deserves commiseration or sympathy.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> More importantly, the Court sitting <i>en banc</i> in <b><i>Republic v. Provincial Government of Palawan</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[198]</sup> had emphatically declared:
                    </p><blockquote>
                      <p> The Court finds the submission untenable. <b>Our courts are basically courts of law, <i>not</i> courts of equity</b>.
 Furthermore, for all its conceded merits, equity is available only in 
the absence of law and not as its replacement. As explained in the old 
case of <i>Tupas v. Court of Appeals</i>:</p>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p> Equity is described as justice outside legality, which simply means that it cannot supplant although it may, as often happens, <b>supplement</b>
 the law. We said in an earlier case, and we repeat it now, that all 
abstract arguments based only on equity should yield to positive rules, 
which pre-empt and prevail over such persuasions. <u>Emotional appeals 
for justice, while they may wring the heart of the Court, cannot justify
 disregard of the mandate of the law as long as it remains in force</u>. The applicable maxim, which goes back to the ancient days of the Roman jurists - and is now still reverently observed – is "<i>aequetas nunquam contravenit legis</i>." (Emphasis supplied)</p>
                      </blockquote>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> At this juncture, the undersigned deems it the proper time to point out that equity should <b>not</b> encompass <b><i>all</i></b>
 matters considered or perceived as "absence" or "gaps" of the law. The 
logic is simple: the areas or subjects beyond or outside the confines of
 written law are infinite in number. Individual cognition of humans 
allows each one to use his or her reasoning faculties differently from 
one another. In effect, it would almost certainly lead each magistrate 
to formulate his or her own version of natural law from the infinite 
area outside of written law. Consequently, if courts are allowed to 
grant reliefs in recognition of substantive rights not expressly 
intended by Congress to be included, judicial legislation would result. 
Specifically, if Articles 9 and 10 of the Civil Code are interpreted to 
give courts an <i>unfettered discretion</i> in choosing what subjects 
they perceive as "gaps" or "absence" in the law, then "the fundamental 
constitutional principles which underlie our tripartite system of 
government"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[199]</sup> would be put 
to naught as legislative functions may now be indirectly exercised by a 
branch of government other than Congress. If the constitutional policy 
on the separation of powers is to be respected, the same provisions of 
the Civil Code cannot also be interpreted to allow Congress to impliedly
 delegate its legislative powers to the courts in the guise of 
interpretation. Moreover, disregarding explicit provisions and even 
established precedents on the sole ground of equity creates 
jurisprudential instability because the application of laws and legal 
principles will become unpredictable. Certainly, society would be less 
chaotic if all those governed by our laws would have the ability to 
reasonably predict the consequences of their actions. Adverse sanctions 
which can be reasonably foreseen diminish the exposure to exasperation 
as well as the allure of taking the law into one's own hands.
                    </p><p> As such, <b>a resort to <i>equity</i> is more of an <i>exception</i> rather than the general rule</b>. It is not at par with written laws as it is subjective. Textual provisions are <b>clear manifestations</b>
 of what Congress intends to include as subjects of legislation—equity 
is, frankly, a mere adjudicative approximation of what such intent 
includes. The wisdom behind limiting equity's application within the 
confines of written law is to prevent magistrates from straying away 
from fairly discernible legislative intent. Such is the reason why 
interpolation is improper where the meaning of the law is clear and 
sensible, either with or without the omitted word or words, because the 
primary source of the legislative intent is in the language of the law 
itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[200]</sup> Moreover, 
emotions used as an attempt to trigger the application of equity are 
unstable and an emotional approach to adjudication often promotes bias, 
thereby slowly eroding a magistrate's impartiality. Hence, for equity to
 be properly applied: (1) it must be suppletory to written law; (2) it 
must not amount to a creation or grant of judicially-enforceable 
substantive rights or obligations; (3) it must, at least, be based on or
 consistent with some specific provision of law in view of the principle
 "that every statute must be so interpreted and brought in accord with 
other laws as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence – <i>interpretere et concordare legibus est optimus interpretendi</i>;"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[201] </sup>and (4) it must subject any catch-all provision to the principle of <i>ejusdem generis</i>
 "where a general word or phrase follows an enumeration of particular 
and specific words of the same class or where the latter follow the 
former, the general word or phrase is to be construed to include, or to 
be restricted to persons, things or cases akin to, resembling, or of the
 same kind or class as those specifically mentioned."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[202]</sup> The undersigned's intention here is <u>not to strangle equity but to put it in its proper place in the context of statutory law</u>.
 Therefore, it is apt that the political branches of government be left 
to their devices to pursue adaptive measures while the Judiciary should 
endeavor itself to preserve and foster legal stability.
                    </p><p> <b><i>Third</i></b>, <u>equity is applied only in the absence— never in contravention— of statutory law</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[203]</sup> In this regard, the Recognizance Act<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup> provides for the statutory requirements for release on recognizance.

                    <p>Thus, when the offense is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, life imprisonment, or death, the accused's release on recognizance is no longer a matter of right—it becomes discretionary.</p>
                    <p> In addition, Section 12 of the Recognizance Act provides:
                    </p><blockquote>
                      <p> Section 12. <i>No Release on Recognizance After Final Judgment or Commencement of Sentence; Exception</i>. – <b>The
 benefits provided under this Act shall not be allowed in favor of an

Probation Law if the application for probation is made before the 
convict starts serving the sentence imposed, in which case, the court 
shall allow the release on recognizance of the convict to the custody of
 a qualified member of the barangay, city or municipality where the 
accused actually resides. (Emphasis supplied)</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> The afore-cited provision prohibits any release 
on recognizance after a judgment has become final or when the accused 
has started serving his sentence. The only recognized exception pertains
 only to the release of those detainees who are entitled to the benefits
 of the Probation Law; but only if the application for probation is made
 before the convict starts serving the sentence imposed.
                    </p><p> As to the petitioners' prayer for the grant 
of bail, Section 13, Article III of the Constitution is clear that bail 
is not a matter of right in cases where the evidence of guilt is strong 
of those persons charged with offenses punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. This simply means that a specific constitutional provision exists which <i>requires</i> a <i>prior determination</i> that the evidence of guilt is not strong for those accused charged with offenses punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>
 before bail may be granted. Such constitutionally-required prior 
determination cannot be dispensed by reason of equity or exercise of 
equity jurisdiction.
                    </p><p> As aptly explained by Justice Bernabe, our 
Constitution and statutes prescribe a legal framework in granting bail 
or recognizance to persons deprived of liberty pending final conviction.
 When the accused is charged with an offense punishable by death, <i>reclusion perpetua</i>
 or life imprisonment, the usual procedure is for the accused to apply 
for bail with notice to the prosecutor. Pursuant to the rules, the 
accused may also seek a reduction of the recommended bail amount,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup> or seek a release through recognizance upon satisfaction of the conditions set for by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup>
                    </p><p> Complementing this view, Associate Justice 
Amy C. Lazaro-Javier also opined that it is not necessary to invoke 
equity or humanitarianism so courts could have the needed flexibility to
 do justice in a particular case under specifically unique 
circumstances, or to be able to rely upon broad moral principles of 
reasonableness, fair dealing and good conscience in resolving issues.
                    </p><p> In essence, the existence of the 
constitutional provisions on bail as well as the Recognizance Act 
evidently militates against the resort to equity.

                    <p>In situations where bail is discretionary, the 
judge who either issues a warrant of arrest or grants a bail application
 while fixing a reasonably amount is duty-bound to primarily consider 
the following factors which are not limited to the previously mentioned 
factors in Section 9, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Criminal 
Procedure. In other words, a bail hearing is an indispensable 
requirement; especially when the accused is charged with an offense 
punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, life imprisonment, or death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[213]</sup></p>
                    <p> In <b><i>Enrile</i></b>, the Court emphasized 
that while the Philippines honors its "commitment to uphold the 
fundamental human rights as well as value the worth and dignity of every
 person," the grant of bail to those charged in criminal proceedings as 
well as extraditees must be based upon a <b>clear and convincing showing</b>: (a) <u>that the detainee will <b><i>not</i></b> be a <b>flight risk</b> or a <b>danger</b> to the <b>community</b></u>; <b><i><u>and</u></i></b> (b) <u>that there exist special, humanitarian and compelling circumstances</u>. Under the rules on syntax, the conjunctive word "and" denotes a "joinder or union" of words, phrases or clause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[214]</sup>
 This means that "special, humanitarian and compelling circumstances" as
 a ground for granting bail does work in isolation—it has to be <i>accompanied</i> by <i>other</i>
 considerations. Moreover, the same ruling also emphasized that the 
"principal purpose of bail... is to guarantee the appearance of the 
accused at the trial, or whenever so required by the court." Meaning, 
when this Court reviewed the factual findings of the Sandiganbayan which
 were exposed during the bail hearings, <i>all</i> relevant circumstances were first <i>balanced</i>
 on the scales of justice before a ruling was handed down—bail was not 
automatically granted as a matter of right due to humanitarian reasons; 
but as a matter of discretion due to other accompanying factors. 
Besides, as asserted by Chief Justice Peralta, the <b><i>Enrile</i></b> Ruling cannot be considered as <i>pro hac vice</i>—a Latin term meaning "for this one particular occasion"—cannot be relied upon as a precedent to govern other cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[215]</sup> because such type of ruling violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[216]</sup>

Even if the alleged facts underlying humanitarian reasons were to be 
accepted without question, they <b>still have to be weighed</b> against the fact that <u>the charges against the petitioners <b>involve serious matters of national security and public safety</b></u>.
 In the petitioners' case, one need not stretch his or her imagination 
in contemplating a situation where a person of deteriorating health, for
 instance, can still commit crimes such as conspiracy to commit 
rebellion or can become an accomplice or accessory to the commission of 
rebellion. In the age of modern technology where the use of cellular 
phones is rampant and access to the internet is relatively effortless, a
 strong possibility looms that the petitioners may still possess the 
necessary ability to strategize hostile measures against the government 
or give aid to their active comrades by providing intelligence reports 
in their surroundings. Even if the Court were to ignore the concern of 
the possibility that some petitioners may be flight risks, the 
possibility of endangering the community is not remote. Such is the 
reason why this Court in <b><i>Villaseñor v. Abano, et al.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup> enunciated that <u>both
 "the good of the public as well as the rights of the accused" and "the 
need for a tie to the jurisdiction and the right to freedom from 
unnecessary restraint before conviction under the circumstances 
surrounding each particular accused" should all be <b><i>balanced</i> in one equation</b></u>.
 As a consequence, the petitioners' reliance on this ruling is patently 
misguided. In the case of former Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, there was 
showing that he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community.
                    </p><p> <b><i>Fifth</i></b>, the grant or denial of 
bail applications is within the jurisdiction of the trial courts 
well-equipped to handle questions of fact.
                    </p><p> The Rules of Criminal Procedure <b>requires a hearing</b> before resolving a motion for bail by persons charged with offenses punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> where the prosecution may discharge its burden of showing that the evidence of guilt is strong.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup> This hearing, whether summary or otherwise,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[219]</sup> is mandatory and indispensable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[220]</sup>
 Connectedly, a "summary hearing" means such brief and speedy method of 
receiving and considering the evidence of guilt as is practicable and 
consistent with the purpose of the hearing which is merely to determine 
the weight of the evidence for the purpose of bail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup> If a party is denied the opportunity to be heard, there would be a violation of procedural due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[222]</sup>
 Thus, in applications for bail, courts are duty-bound to: (a) notify 
the prosecutor of the hearing of the application for bail or require him
 to submit his recommendation; (b) conduct a hearing of the application 
for bail regardless of whether or not the prosecution refuses to present
 evidence to show that the guilt of the accused is strong for the 
purpose of enabling the court to exercise its sound discretion; (c) 
decide whether the evidence of guilt of the accused is strong based on 
the summary of evidence of the prosecution; and (d) if the guilt of the 
accused is not strong, discharge the accused upon the approval of the 
bail bond—otherwise; bail should be denied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup>
 Therefore, regardless of the trial court's disposition in applications 
for bail, the order should not be tainted with grave abuse of discretion
 and should give all parties an opportunity to present their respective 
pieces of evidence to support their causes or defenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup>
 As elucidated by Justice Bernabe, the Court would be betraying its 
mandate to apply the law and the Constitution should it prematurely 
order the release of petitioners on bail or recognizance absent the 
requisite hearing to determine whether or not the evidence of guilt 
against them is strong.
                    </p><p> Relatedly, it is a settled rule that this Court is not a trier of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup>
 With respect to a direct invocation of this Court's original 
jurisdiction writs, the same shall not be allowed unless the redress 
desired cannot be obtained in the appropriate courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup>
 The rationale for this rule is two-fold: (a) it would be an imposition 
upon the precious time of this Court; and (b) it would cause an 
inevitable and resultant delay, intended or otherwise, in the 
adjudication of cases, which in some instances had to be remanded or 
referred to the lower court as the proper forum under the rules of 
procedure, or as better equipped to resolve the issues because this 
Court is not a trier of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[227]</sup>
 Like Justice Bernabe, Associate Justice Henri Jean Paul B. Inting also 
shares the view that the Court cannot prematurely order the petitioners'
 release, either on bail or recognizance, without the mandatory bail 
hearing for the determination of the strength of the prosecution's cases
 against them because it is not equipped to receive evidence and make 
separate factual assessments for each petitioner in order to determine 
his or her entitlement to bail.
                    </p><p> Here, the petitioners pray for their release
 on recognizance or bail and for the creation of a "Prisoner Release 
Committee" which strongly indicates that theirs is a petition for bail 
or recognizance filed directly before this Court. This cannot be done 
because, as previously pointed out, the factors enumerated in Sections 5
 and 9, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure are purely 
factual in nature. To determine whether evidence of guilt of the accused 
is strong, the conduct of bail hearings is required where the 
prosecution has the burden of proof, subject to the right of the defense
 to cross-examine witnesses and introduce evidence in rebuttal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[228]</sup>
 Only after weighing the pieces of evidence as contained in the summary 
will the judge formulate his or her own conclusion as to whether the 
evidence of guilt against the accused is strong based on his discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[229]</sup>
                    </p><p> Besides, the principle espoused in <b><i>Enrile</i></b>
 cannot be applied in the instant case for the purpose of entertaining 
the present petition because, in the case of former Senator Juan Ponce 
Enrile, a bail hearing was indeed conducted by the Sandiganbayan. The 
same cannot be said of the petitioners who, whether deliberate or not, 
failed to provide enough data or information in their petition involving
 the following matters: (a) specific charges, nature of their crimes and
 corresponding penalties; (b) stages of trial or proceedings; (c) 
specific dates and lengths of detention; (d) any motion filed before the
 trial courts for provisional release and; (e) present results of 
physical examinations on their status of health relating to COVID-19. 
For this reason, the Court has no way of assessing whether or not the 
evidence of guilt as to the petitioners is strong. As observed by both 
Justice Bernabe and Justice Caguioa, the petitioners have not shown that
 any of them have filed the necessary bail applications. It was also not
 shown by the petitioners that bail hearings were conducted in their 
respective cases in order to determine whether or not there exists 
strong evidence of guilt, which would, in turn, determine their 
qualification or disqualification for the reliefs prayed for. As Justice
 Zalameda bluntly puts, the petitioners are seeking to carve out for 
themselves a special circumstance that is not present in our established
 rules but failed in their duty to present the reasons why the general 
rule is not applicable to them; in effect, they want this Court to turn a
 blind eye to the established rules which take into account the nature 
and gravity of the crimes committed, as well as the number of years 
served.
                    </p><p> Even assuming for the sake of argument that 
the petitioners had managed to attach documents proving the foregoing 
pieces of information, the determination of whether or not guilt is 
strong should still be lodged with the trial courts who are 
well-equipped to handle them. As precisely declared by Justice Caguioa, 
the want of necessary factual details brought about by a proper bail 
hearing precludes this Court from a full calibration of each 
petitioner's eligibility for either release on bail or recognizance.
                    </p><p> Incidentally, since the petitioners failed 
to provide the data as to whether they have previously applied for bail,
 the Court is also not in the proper position to direct all the trial 
courts where each of the petitioners' respective cases are pending to 
conduct bail proceedings or expedite unresolved bail applications. To do
 so would constitute an implied nullification of previously concluded 
bail proceedings in which some of the respective trial courts may have 
found strong evidence of guilt against some of the petitioners. This 
would result in a re-hearing or duplication of otherwise concluded 
proceedings. As such, the same petition <b>should have been individually and separately filed before the respective <i>trial courts</i> where each the petitioners' cases are currently pending</b>.
 Otherwise, this Court will be flooded with a deluge of bail 
applications seeking for a factual evaluation of every petitioner's 
unique circumstances. 
                    </p><p><b><i>Sixth</i></b>, the respondents have adequately shown that they have already undertaken efforts to address the COVID-19 concern.
                    </p><p> Judicial notice is the cognizance of certain
 facts that judges may properly take and act on without proof because 
these facts are already known to them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[230]</sup> Put differently, it is the assumption by a court of a fact without need of further traditional evidentiary support.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[231]</sup>
 The principle is based on convenience and expediency in securing and 
introducing evidence on matters that are not ordinarily capable of 
dispute and are not bona fide disputed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[232]</sup>
                    </p><p> Here, the Court can take judicial notice of 
the fact that COVID-19 is transmitted from person to person via 
droplets, contact, and fomites. It is transmitted when one individual 
talks, sneezes, or coughs producing 'droplets' of saliva containing the 
COVID-19 virus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[233]</sup> These 
droplets are then inhaled by another person. COVID-19 transmission 
usually occurs among close contacts. It is therefore important to 
maintain a distance of more than one meter away from any person who has 
respiratory symptoms.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[234]</sup> 
Likewise, it has been conveyed to the general public that there are 
population groups who have a higher risk of developing sever COVID-19 
infections such as individuals aged 60 and above, pregnant, and those 
with underlying conditions or co-morbidity at risk of COVID-19 
exacerbation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[235]</sup> This 
information is of public knowledge as has been imparted not only by 
international COVID-19 experts through different information media but 
also through the official acts of the executive department, through the 
issuances and advisories of the Department of Health and the country's 
Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). As 
such, mandatory and discretionary judicial notice can be taken on this 
fact.

COVID-19 in detention facilities, to wit: (a) the suspension of inmate 
visitation as early as March 11, 2020; (b) continuous conduct of 
information dissemination on precautionary measures against COVID-19; 
(c) provision of facemasks and mandatory wearing of such among persons 
deprived of liberty (PDLs); (d) social distancing among PDLs; (e) 
regular exercise of PDLs to boost their immune system; (f) distribution 
of vitamins among PDLs; (g) medicines and special diets given to PDLs 
who have pre-existing medical conditions; (h) rigid disinfection of 
supplies and deliveries inside prison' cells; (i) regular sanitation and
 disinfection of the whole jail perimeter including jail buildings and 
jail cells; (j) improvised foot bath to prevent virus to be carried 
inside jail cells and; (k) special monitoring for PDLs with pre-existing
 conditions.</p>
                    <p> In case where PDLs become infected or show

pursue the following safety measures: (a) immediate isolation of PDL 
with COVID-19 symptoms; (b) assessment by the jail nurse on the patient;
 (c) if associated with COVID-19, the jail officials refer the patient 
to the Department of Health (DOH) in accordance with the DOH referral 
procedure; (d) immediate conduct of contact tracing to monitor the 
extent of inmate exposure; and (e) the jail official also informs the 
inmate's family of the status and health condition of the inmate who is 
infected. Moreover, the BJMP Verified Report also states that there are 
already established isolation rooms equipped with medical equipment and

                    <p>The Bureau of Corrections' Verified Report 
contains specific measures adopted throughout correctional facilities in
 the country, to wit: (1) general information drive about COVID-19; (2) 
no contact policy between inmates; (3) strict fourteen (14) days 
quarantine for newly committed PDLs; (4) proliferation and creation of 
isolation facilities to accommodate future COVID-19 patients; (5) no 
face mask, no entry policy; (6) the immediate deployment of manpower for
 the construction and renovation of facilities of PDLs and; (7) strict 
monitoring of ingress and egress of health personnel across jail 
buildings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[239]</sup></p>
                    <p> Indeed, the whole nation is under unprecedented 
times with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The threat of infection 
of COVID-19 reaches everyone even Filipinos outside prison jails. 
Although inmates of prison jails are at high risk of infection, the 
Bureau of Corrections and the BJMP have been steadfastly containing the 
spread of the pandemic inside jails throughout the country. Based on the
 records available to this Court, it appears that both bureaus have 
enforced proper social distancing and are safeguarding PDLs with special
 health conditions or high-risk inmates. Moreover, both bureaus also 
have in place isolation methods to secure PDLs in the unfortunate event 
an inmate becomes infected with COVID-19. As observed by Chief Justice 
Peralta, the Bureau of Corrections even put in place the necessary 
infrastructure to provide inmates a facility for online visits/video 
conference with their relatives. In light of these developments, the 
Filipino people including PDLs throughout the country should be secure 
in their thoughts that both bureaus are presumably performing their 
duties in properly handling the spread of the COVID-19 virus in 
detention facilities despite budgetary constraints. 
                    </p><p> <b><i>Seventh</i></b>, the petitioners have ample remedies under existing laws and Supreme Court issuances. 
                    </p><p> Notably, the Court is certainly attuned to 
the extreme needs of decongesting detention facilities to promote social
 distancing during this critical time. Initially, this Court thru the 
Office of the Chief Justice (OCJ) had already taken the initiative of 
issuing the following Administrative Circulars to address the problem of
 jail congestion in this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, to wit: (a) 
Administrative Circular No. 38-2020; (b) Administrative Circular No. 
37-2020; (c) Administrative Circular No. 33-2020. Likewise, the Office 
of the Court Administrator (OCA) also issued the following circulars: 
(a) OCA Circular No. 93-2020; (b) OCA Circular No. 91-2020; and (c) OCA 
Circular No. 89-2020—to implement the OCJ's administrative circulars. 
Both the OCJ and the OCA's circulars are intended to expedite the 
process of resolving bail applications currently pending especially 
those of indigents as well as providing guidelines for videoconferencing
 and electronic filing. All that the petitioners have to do is avail of 
the benefits under these issuances which are more than adequate to 
address their concerns on the COVID-19 pandemic—unless they are not so 
qualified or they failed to post the required bail amount, then they 
have to remain in detention and undergo trial to prove their innocence. 
                    </p><p> To date, the following issuances have been 
promulgated to directly and indirectly facilitate the proceedings 
involving the possible release of PDLs:

                    <p> Clearly, the foregoing data shows that this 
Court's issuances thru the OCJ have made a significant impact in 
decongesting jails and other detention facilities in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, ample judicial remedies are available to the 
petitioners and other similarly-situated PDLs who seek provisional 
liberty. Likewise, administrative remedies for PDLs who are currently 
serving their sentences like petitioner Lilia Bucatcat are also 
available to them. As pointed out by both Chief Justice Peralta and 
Justice Zalameda, such administrative actions present an 
incontrovertible proof that institutions of the justice system other 
than the Judiciary are indeed enacting measures to decongest our 
detention and penal facilities in order to mitigate the possible spread 
of COVID-19. As such, the petitioners have no valid reason to insist 
that they have no other judicial or administrative remedy save for a 
direct recourse to this Court.</p>
                    <p> Besides, release on bail or recognizance is not 
the only way to decongest jails. This Court, thru former Chief Justices 
Hilario G. Davide, Jr. and Reynato S. Puno, had previously promulgated 
Administrative Circular Nos. 12-2000<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[248]</sup> and 08-2008<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[249]</sup>
 which gave the trial courts the option to impose the penalty of fine 
with subsidiary imprisonment instead of imprisonment itself. This is 
also supplemented by the enactment of Republic Act No. 11362<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[250]</sup> (Community Service Act) which authorized courts to require community service <i>in lieu</i> of jail service for offenses punishable by <i>arresto menor</i> and <i>arresto mayor</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[251]</sup>
 To claim that releasing prisoners on bail or recognizance is the only 
way to decongest jails is to ignore Congress and this Court's previous 
decongestion efforts that have already been put in place for trial 
courts to apply either in deciding the case or upon motion of the 
parties.
                    </p><p> <b><i>Last</i></b>, Philippine 
constitutional and statutory provisions remain in force despite the 
ongoing pandemic as well as the international calls for the release of 
prisoners.
                    </p><p> As Chief Justice Peralta puts it, neither 
the pandemic nor the executive declaration of a Luzon-wide lockdown has 
the effect of suspending our laws and rules, much less of shutting down 
the Judiciary. In support of this finding, Justice Zalameda quoted 
Justice Leonen's ponencia in <b><i>Abogado, et al. v. Department of Environment and Natural Resources, et al.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[252]</sup>
 wherein the latter clearly enunciated that "[t]he imminence or 
emergency of an ecological disaster should not be an excuse for 
litigants to do away with their responsibility of substantiating their 
petitions before the courts." This is also supplemented by Associate 
Justice Jose C. Reyes, Jr.'s (Justice Reyes) opinion that the Philippine
 government is not expected to simply conform to the manner of releasing
 prisoners being adopted by other countries because such release is 
qualified by certain conditions. As pointed out by Chief Justice 
Peralta, the initiatives of other countries in decongesting prison 
facilities were based on laws and rules prevailing in those 
jurisdictions— the Philippines did not lag behind in this respect. 
Therefore, <b>if the true ideals of independence are to be valued at 
all, supranational entities and foreign sovereigns should not be allowed
 to <i>dictate</i> how the Philippines should conduct or handle its 
internal affairs; especially when it comes to protecting the lives, 
health and safety of its citizens.</b>

which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the Legislature
 or executive branch of the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[253]</sup>
 These questions are concerned with issues dependent upon the wisdom, 
not the legality, of a particular act or measure being assailed in which
 this Court will not normally interfere unless the case shows a clear 
need for it to step in to uphold the law and the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[254]</sup>
 Recourse to the political question doctrine necessarily raises the 
underlying doctrine of separation of powers among the three great 
branches of government that the Constitution has entrenched.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[255]</sup>
                    </p><p> In relation to the political questions 
doctrine, police power is the power of the state to promote public 
welfare by restraining and regulating the use of liberty and property;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup> although it also extends to providing for all public needs as <i>parens patriae</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup>
 It has been established by jurisprudence that police power finds no 
specific Constitutional grant for the plain reason that it does not owe 
its origin to the Charter since it is inborn in the very fact of 
statehood and sovereignty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[258]</sup>
 However, no less than the Constitution declares that "[t]he maintenance
 of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty, and property, and 
promotion of the general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all 
the people of the blessings of democracy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[259]</sup>
 Such seemingly redundant constitutional declaration only serves to 
buttress the State's inherent prerogative "to prescribe regulations to 
promote the health, morals, education, good order or safety, and general
 welfare of the people [as it] flows from the recognition that <i>salus populi est suprema lex</i>— the welfare of the people is the supreme law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[260]</sup>
                    </p><p> Concomitantly, the power to promote the 
health, morals, peace, education, good order or safety and general 
welfare of the people by making statutes or ordinances is <i>vested in the legislature</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[261]</sup>
 The most obvious manifestation of such power are penal statutes in 
which the State defines and punishes crimes as well as lays down the 
corresponding criminal rules of procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[262]</sup>
 Also, related to the enactment of penal statutes as an implement of 
police power, it is necessary either for the State agents to have 
"custody of the law" in bail applications or for the courts to acquire 
"jurisdiction over the person" of the accused<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup>—
 the purpose of which is for the accused "to have a speedy, impartial, 
and public trial, to meet the witnesses face to face, and to have 
compulsory process to secure the attendance of witnesses and the 
production of evidence in his behalf."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup>
 In other words, the State's act of detaining a person charged with a 
crime even when his or her guilt is still to be proven by the 
prosecution is not without pragmatic and underlying wisdom. Deprivation 
of liberty, especially if evidence of guilt is strong or no bail was 
posted, in such instance ensures that: (a) the court will have 
jurisdiction over the person of the accused, as earlier stated, in order
 to render a binding judgment; (b) the state agents will be assured of 
having the ability to bring the accused to participate in necessary 
proceedings as required by the court; and (c) the accused will be 
prevented from committing another crime which endangers society or from 
undertaking further acts to conceal the crime being charged against him 
or her. Verily, it is reasonable to assume that police power which 
includes keeping persons accused of a crime in custody is not subject to
 a reasonable debate.
                    </p><p> In the case of the petitioners' continued 
confinement in their respective detention facilities, the Court cannot 
issue an order for the creation of a "Prisoner Release Committee" in the
 absence of any law and in the absence of any concluded bail hearing 
which resulted in the grant of provisional liberty. As it stands, only 
the political branches of government (Executive and Legislative) have 
the power to determine for themselves if such recourse is warranted. The
 only act that the Court may do under the circumstances is to order the 
conduct of bail hearings before the trial courts with dispatch. Besides,
 it must be emphasized in the first place, that the legislature, which 
is the constitutional <b>repository of police power</b> and exercises the prerogative of determining the policy of the State, is by force of circumstances <b>primarily the judge of necessity, adequacy</b> or <b>reasonableness</b> and wisdom, of any law promulgated in the <b>exercise</b> of the police power, or of the <b>measures adopted to implement the public policy</b> or to <b>achieve public interest</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup> In instances, the President may exercise police power to a limited extent only for the purpose of securing public safety.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup> Thus, it is the elected representatives of the People who should determine "the greatest good for the greatest number"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[267]</sup> in times of national emergencies.
                    </p><p> Besides, whenever a conundrum arises <b><i>in times of emergency</i></b>
 when police power collides with constitutionally-protected freedoms or 
fundamental rights, the political question doctrine will often tip the 
balance in favor of general welfare acts or policies in view of the 
State's duty to primarily protect general interests. Such rule of 
interpretation is consistent with the basic principle instilled in <b><i>Marcos, et al. v. Manglapus, et al.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[268]</sup> articulating that: "[i]t must be borne in mind that the Constitution, aside from being an allocation of power[,] <u>is also a <b>social contract</b> whereby the people have <b>surrendered</b> their <b>sovereign powers</b> to the State <b>for</b> the <b>common good</b></u>.” <i>However</i>,
 while public safety is the paramount and overriding concern of the 
State and, while it is also true that laws should be interpreted in 
favor of the greatest good of the greatest number during emergencies, <i>individual freedoms also have to be respected</i>.
 As Justice Reyes describes, such duty entails the complex task of 
harmonizing fundamental interests of every individual, both free and 
deprived of liberty, and the general public and, while certain 
individual's plea for the application of the "humanity of law" may be 
considered in exceptional circumstances, public protection is equally 
paramount and thus, can never be discounted. Thus, in upholding police 
power measures over constitutional freedoms in <i>times of emergency</i>,
 the Court should subject any encroachment of either constitutional or 
statutory rights to the following interpretational parameters:

                    <p>The current choice of the State to continually detain the petitioners satisfies the aforementioned criteria for these reasons:</p>
                    <p> <b><i>First</i></b>, the State's exercise of its
 prerogative to elect appropriate strategies under the present public 
health emergency situation branches have ample basis. 
                    </p><p> "Public safety" involves the prevention of 
and protection from events that could endanger the safety of the general
 public from significant danger, injury/harm, or damage, such as crimes 
or disasters— it is an abstract term with no physical form with a 
boundless range, extent or scope.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[269]</sup>
                    </p><p> In the case at hand, there is wisdom in the 
continued detention of the petitioners as the nature of their respective
 charges is serious enough to justify their continued detention <i>until</i>
 bail hearings have been conducted and their applications have been 
acted upon favorably. Viewed in the context of the Executive 
department's vantage point, the release of the petitioners endangers 
national security. It can be reasonably inferred under the circumstances
 that the Executive department has already made up its mind that the 
last thing they need in the fight against COVID-19 is to face the 
hostilities of armed rebel groups. As it is there are reports of 
COVID-19 cases already permeating in jails; there are also reports that 
rebel groups have launched armed attacks against the military and the 
police who are engaged in their duties of distributing relief goods and 
manning the check points. At this point, the most prudent course of 
action that the Court may do is to defer to the political branches as 
regards the matter of selecting the most appropriate strategy to 
maintain public order and preserve public safety. As Justice Zalameda 
opines, there has to be a balance between the State's duty to protect 
the specific victims of the crime as well as the general public, and the
 petitioners' rights under international law.
                    </p><p> <b><i>Second</i></b>, the State's measure of
 continually detaining the petitioners is reasonably related to its 
objective of maintaining public order and preserving public safety. 
While there is still no judicially declared terrorist organization in 
our jurisdiction pursuant to Section 17<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[270]</sup> of R.A. No. 9372<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[271]</sup> to date,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[272]</sup> the US and the European Union have both classified the CPP, NPA and <i>Abu Sayyaf</i> Group as foreign terrorist organizations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[273]</sup>
 Obviously, this is a legitimate and vital concern to national security.
 As earlier discussed, the government cannot afford to gamble its 
chances and resources by allowing the petitioners who are allegedly key 
members of the CPP-NPA-NDF to roam free while the COVID-19 pandemic 
remains an imminent and grave threat. During this time, the government 
cannot afford to lose its front-liners in its battle against the 
pandemic. The last thing that this Court should do <i>in times of nationwide public health emergency</i>
 is to tip the scales of justice against public safety and against 
national security interests. This realization alone adequately <i>supports the reasonable link or relation</i> between the petitioners' continued detention and the objective of suppressing the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    </p><p> However, such pronouncement <u>is merely for the <b>very limited purpose</b> of determining whether or not there is a reasonable link or relation</u> between the assailed government measures or concerns and the legitimate objectives regarding general welfare <i>in times of emergency</i>. Admittedly, the undersigned cannot, in good conscience, naively ignore age-old and popular <em>allegations</em> that the CPP-NPA-NDF is a terrorist organization. But as part of due process, <u>the undersigned <b>cannot also preempt</b> at this time <b>any finding</b> that the authorizing division of the Court of Appeals may encounter in the future</u> should the DOJ file an application under the newly-enacted Section 26 of R.A. No. 11479<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[274]</sup>
 (formerly Section 17 of R.A. No. 9372 which used to lodge proscription 
proceedings before the Regional Trial Court) to have the CPP-NPA-NDF 
declared "as a terrorist and outlawed group of persons, organization, or
 association." In essence, the DOJ <b><i>still has to prove</i></b> in 
such proscription proceedings that the CPP-NPA-NDF was and is indeed 
engaged in acts constitutive of terrorism. As voiced out by Justice 
Reyes, the Court should refrain at this time from making such 
pronouncements that goes into the merits of petitioners' pending cases.
                    </p><p> <b><i>Last</i></b>, the petitioners' continued detention cannot be considered as an unnecessarily oppressive act of the State.
                    </p><p> Oppression has been defined as "an act of cruelty, severity, unlawful exaction, domination or excessive use of authority."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[275]</sup> Since the petitioners are allegedly members of the CPP-NPA-NDF, their continued detention is still deemed <b>necessary</b>
 until and unless they prove during the bail hearing that the evidence 
of their supposed guilt is not strong. Such unavoidable restraint of 
liberty is not "unnecessarily oppressive" as the petitioners have not 
shown that the State had been indifferent to their clinical needs. The 
medical certificates attached by the petitioners as annexes adequately 
prove that the Bureau of Corrections and the BJMP had not been remiss in
 their duties of assisting inmates in undergoing the required medical 
checkups. Had the opposite been the case, the petitioners would have 
been left to their own devices to deal with their own vulnerable health.
 Allowing the petitioners to undergo medical checkups with the necessary
 assistance from State agents negates the presence of "excessive use of 
authority," "cruelty" or "domination." Under the extant circumstances, 
the State cannot be reasonably considered by the Court as having acted 
cruelly in continually denying the petitioners of their liberty in the 
midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                    </p><p> In a nutshell, the petitioners' prayers in 
seeking for the release on recognizance or bail and for the creation of a
 "Prisoner Release Committee" (along with the issuance of ground rules 
for eligible prisoners) indicate that theirs is a petition for bail or 
recognizance filed directly before this Court. As explained in detail 
earlier in the discussions, not one of these prayers may be granted for 
the following reasons:

                    <p>Although the Court may, in some instances, refer 
bail or recognizance applications filed before it to the trial courts, 
it is not feasible to do so in this case because: (a) some of the 
petitioners may have already filed their bail or recognizance 
applications before the respective trial courts handling their cases; 
(b) re-opening bail or recognizance applications may unnecessarily 
prolong the criminal proceedings if evidence of guilt adduced by the 
prosecution had already been adjudged by the respective trial courts as 
strong; (c) bail or recognizance application is an absolute prerogative 
or option of a detained accused; and (d) guidelines for the possible 
release of PDLs have been put in place. Under the circumstances, the 
most prudent course of action is to let the petitioners pursue their 
bail or recognizance applications before the <b><i>proper forum</i></b>.
 After all, this Court had already promulgated several issuances to 
facilitate the possible release of PDLs—all that the petitioners have to
 do is to abide by these guidelines.</p>
                    <p> At this point, it is wise to impart Chief 
Justice Peralta's conclusion that the petitioners are probably seeking 
administrative—not judicial—remedies that would genuinely address their 
concerns in regard to which this Court, as overseer of the Judiciary, 
could exercise no other prerogative than <b>to direct the trial courts concerned to resolve the underlying criminal cases with deliberate dispatch</b>.
 That judicial remedy is unavailable to the reliefs prayed for, is all 
the more apparent from their collective sentiment that the 
government-imposed quarantine and lockdown measures, which in the 
interim necessarily denied them of supervised access to their families 
and friends, have negatively affected their mental well-being. As the 
petitioners complain about languishing in isolation, they fail to see 
that in truth, the rest of the outside world is likewise socially 
isolating as a basic precautionary measure in response to a pandemic of 
this kind. They lament the lingering fear of a potential infection 
within their confinement on account of their respective physical 
vulnerabilities and hereby plead that they be indefinitely set free, 
without realizing that it is the same exact fear which looms outside of 
prison walls.
                    </p><p align="center"> <b><u>Conclusion</u></b>
                    </p><p> The world is currently facing a battle that 
harbors the potential to be one of the deadliest in history. The enemy 
cannot be seen and its workings cannot, as of yet, be understood even by
 the most brilliant of minds in the scientific community. Faced with a 
monumental task of balancing all governmental efforts of curbing a 
formidable enemy for the benefit of the general population against some 
sensible but conjectural fears that the health of some inmates or 
detainees might be neglected by authorities, it is prudent to interpret 
the Constitution and the law in a manner which places public safety as 
the pinnacle of all concerns for "[s]elf-preservation is the first law 
of nature"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[276]</sup> and "the fundamental and paramount objective of the [S]tate [is to bring] about the greatest good to the greatest number.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[277]</sup>
 However, as a matter of duty, such interpretation is of course subject 
to strict libertarian safeguards. While the undersigned sympathizes with
 the petitioners' miserable plight, it simply cannot act in a manner 
violative of the fundamental law. The remedy simply lies with the 
political branches to pursue. As lucidly explained in <b><i>Vera, et al. v. Avelino, et al.</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[278]</sup> by Associate Justice (later Chief Justice) Cesar Bengzon:
                    </p><blockquote>
                      <p> Let us not be overly influenced by the plea 
that for every wrong there is a remedy, and that the judiciary should 
stand ready to afford relief. There are undoubtedly many wrongs the 
judicature may not correct, for instance, those involving political 
questions. x x x</p>
                      <p> Let us likewise disabuse our minds from the 
notion that the judiciary is the repository of remedies for all 
political or social ills. We should not forget that the Constitution has
 judiciously allocated the powers of government to three distinct and 
separate compartments; and that judicial interpretation has tended to 
the preservation of the independence of the three, and a zealous regard 
of the prerogatives of each, knowing full well that one is not the 
guardian of the others and that, for official wrong-doing, each may be 
brought to account, either by impeachment, trial or by the ballot box.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> Despite Associate Justice Gregorio Perfecto's 
livid and scathing dissent that the afore-cited ratiocination "is 
irrelevant" because the Court at that time was supposedly "dealing with a
 constitutional wrong which, under the fundamental law, can and must be 
redressed by the [J]udiciary,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[279]</sup>
 the reliefs prayed for by the petitioners are 
constitutionally-impossible to grant because it involves "engrafting 
upon a law something that has been omitted which someone believes ought 
to have been embraced"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[280]</sup>—a 
clear act of judicial legislation. The petitioners and the public have 
to understand that, as guardian of the Constitution, this Court cannot 
break its sworn duty to uphold the fundamental law. Succinctly, the 
Court is not constitutionally-empowered to perform acts contrary to the 
principle of separation of powers no matter how lofty the underlying 
intentions may be.
                    </p><p> Besides, impartiality demands that this 
Court should exercise an even-handed temperament in balancing the 
conflicting interests embodied in both the general welfare clause and 
the constitutionally-protected fundamental rights. An emotional approach
 to an extraordinarily tense situation betrays the objective resolution 
of highly-controversial disputes. Therefore, the undersigned is of the 
view that it is not what this Court is <i>willing</i> to do—but what it <i>can</i> do—under the circumstances which determines the fate of the present petition.
                    </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the undersigned votes to <b>DENY </b>the instant petition for lack of merit and for improperly invoking the Court's original jurisdiction.

 The traditional definition of international law is that it is a body of
 rules and principles of action which are binding upon civilized states<b> in their relations to one another</b> (Bernas, <i>An Introduction to Public International Law</i>, 1<sup>st</sup> Ed. (2002) p. 1).

 More recently, the law of nations or international law is defined as 
"rules and principles of general application dealing with the conduct of
 States and of international organizations and with their relations 
inter se, as well as some of their relations with persons, natural or 
juridical." (<b><i>United States v. Al Bahlul</i></b>, 820 F.Supp.2d 1141 [2011]), citations omitted; see also: U.N. Charter Art. 93, ¶ 5.

 <i>opinion juris sive necessitates</i> (opinion as to law or necessity);" see also: <b><i>Vinuya, et al. v. Romulo, et al.</i></b>,

 Nothing is better settled than that the Philippines being independent 
and sovereign, its authority may be exercised over its entire 
domain. There is no portion thereof that is beyond its power. Within its 
limits, its decrees are supreme, its commands paramount. Its laws govern 
therein, and everyone to whom it applies must submit to its terms. That 
is the extent of its jurisdiction, both territorial and personal. 
Necessarily, likewise, it has to be exclusive. If it were not thus, 
there is a diminution of its sovereignty (<b><i>Reagan v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i></b>,
 G.R. No. L-26379, December 27, 1969, 141 Phil, 621, 625). In the final 
analysis, this Court already had the opportunity to clarify that "[t]he 
fact that international law has been made part of the law of the land <u>does <b><i>not</i></b> pertain to or imply the <b>primacy</b> of international law over national or municipal law in the municipal sphere</u>. The
 doctrine of incorporation, as applied in most countries, decrees that 
rules of international law are given equal standing with, but are not 
superior to, national legislative enactments. xxx <u>In states where the constitution is the highest law of the land</u>, such as the Republic of the Philippines, <u>both statutes and treaties may be invalidated if they are in conflict with the Constitution</u> (<b><i>Secretary of Justice v. Lantion, et al.</i></b>, G.R. No. 139465, January 18, 2000, 379 Phil. 165-213, citations omitted).

 Current data suggest person-to-person transmission most commonly 
happens during close exposure to a person infected with the virus that 
causes COVID-19, primarily via respiratory droplets produced when the 
infected person speaks, coughs, or sneezes. Droplets can land in the 
mouths, noses, or eyes of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled 
into the lungs of those within close proximity. Transmission also might 
occur through contact with contaminated surfaces followed by 
self-delivery to the eyes, nose, or mouth. The contribution of small 
respirable particles, sometimes called aerosols or droplet nuclei, to 
close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. However, airborne 
transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely
