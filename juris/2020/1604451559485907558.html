The CA thus decreed the setting aside of the October 22, 2013 Order of the RTC, the dismissal of the information in Criminal Case No. T-3754, and the quashal of the warrant of arrest against Cu. The dispositive portion of the CA's Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the Order dated October 22, 2013 is here by <b>SET ASIDE</b>.

They insist on the competence of the subject explosives as evidence and claim that the same have been seized legally. They argue that while Mayor Pilapil's ocular inspection of the mining site was conducted without a search warrant, the consequent taking of the subject explosives may nonetheless be justified under the <i>plain view doctrine</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><center><b>OUR RULING</b><br></center><br>Mayor Pilapil's seizure of the subject explosives is illegal and cannot be justified under the plain view doctrine. The warrantless ocular inspection of the mining site operated by BCMC and Prime Rock that preceded such seizure, and which allowed Mayor Pilapil and his team of police officers and barangay officials to catch a view of the subject explosives, finds no authority under any provision of any law. In addition, established circumstances suggest that the incriminating nature of the subject explosives could not have been immediately apparent to Mayor Pilapil and his inspection team.<br><br>The subject explosives were thus seized in violation of the constitutional proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures. As such, they were correctly regarded by the CA as "<i>fruits of a poisonous tree</i>" subject to the <i>exclusionary principle</i>. Fittingly, they cannot be considered as valid bases of a finding of probable cause to arrest and detain an accused for trial.<br><br>Hence, we deny the petitions.<br><br>Section 2, Article III of the Constitution ordains the right of the people against <i>unreasonable</i> searches and seizures by the government. The provision reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 2. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and for any purpose shall be inviolable, and no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.<br></blockquote>Fortifying such right is the <i>exclusionary principle</i> adopted in Section 3(b), Article III of the Constitution. The principle renders any evidence obtained through unreasonable search or seizure as inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>(2) Any evidence obtained in violation of this or the preceding section shall be inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding.<br></blockquote>What then are unreasonable searches and seizures as contemplated by the cited constitutional provisions?<br><br>The rule of thumb, as may be deduced from Section 2, Article III of the Constitution itself, is that searches and seizures which are undertaken by the government outside the auspices of a valid search warrant are considered unreasonable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> To be regarded reasonable, government-led search and seizure must generally be sanctioned by a judicial warrant issued in accordance with requirements prescribed in the aforementioned constitutional provision.<br><br>The foregoing rule, however, is not without any exceptions. Indeed, jurisprudence has recognized several, though very specific, instances where warrantless searches and seizures can be considered reasonable and, hence, not subject to the exclusionary principle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Some of these instances, studded throughout our case law, are:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><blockquote><ol><li>Consented searches;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></li><li>Searches incidental to a lawful arrest;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></li><li>Searches of a moving vehicle;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></li><li>Seizures of evidence in plain view;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></li><li>Searches incident of inspection, supervision and regulation sanctioned by the State in the exercise of its police power;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></li><li>Customs searches;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></li><li>Stop and Frisk searches;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and<br></li><li>Searches under exigent and emergency circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The instance of particular significance to the case at bench is the soÂ­-called seizures pursuant to the <i>plain view doctrine</i>.<br><br>Under the plain view doctrine, objects falling within the plain view of a law enforcement officer, who has a right to be in a position to have that view, may be validly seized by such officer without a warrant and, thus, may be introduced in evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> An object is deemed in plain view when it is "<i>open to eye and hand</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> or is "<i>plainly exposed to sight</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In <i>Miclat, Jr. v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> we identified the three (3) requisites that must concur in order to validly invoke the doctrine, to wit:<br><blockquote>The "plain view" doctrine applies when the following requisites concur: <b>(a) the law enforcement officer in search of the evidence has a prior justification for an intrusion or is in a position from which he can view a particular area; (b) the discovery of evidence in plain view is inadvertent; (c) it is immediately apparent to the officer that the item he observes may be evidence of a crime, contraband or otherwise subject to seizure</b>.<br></blockquote>Guided by the foregoing principles, we now address the issues at hand.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>The established facts betray the claim of petitioners that the plain view doctrine justifies the warrantless seizure of the subject explosives. The first and third requisites necessary to validly invoke the said doctrine are not present in the instant case.<br><br><center><b>A</b><br></center><br>The first requisite of the plain view doctrine assumes that the law enforcement officer has "<i>a prior justification for an intrusion or is in a position from which he can view a particular area</i>[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> This means that the officer who made the warrantless seizure must have been in a <i>lawful</i> position when he discovered the target contraband or evidence in plain view. Here, it was established that Mayor Pilapil and his team of police officers and barangay officials were able to view the subject explosives during the course of their ocular inspection on the mining site operated by BCMC and Prime Rock. Hence, in order to ascertain the existence of the first requisite of the doctrine in the case at bench, an inquiry into the legality of such inspection is necessary. <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="30%"><div align="justify"><strong>Mayor Pilapil And His Inspection Team Were Not In A Lawful Position When They Discovered The Subject Explosives</strong></div></td><td width="70%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>In the case at bench, it is undisputed that Mayor Pilapil and his team entered and conducted an ocular inspection on the mining site of BCMC and Prime Rock without any judicial warrant. As petitioners concede, Mayor Pilapil was moved to carry out such entry and inspection solely by reports which suggest that Prime Rock was engaging in mining activities, in violation of the CDO issued by the MGB RO5.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Upon reaching the mining site, however, Mayor Pilapil and his inspection team actually encountered no active mining operations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> What they were able to chance upon were the subject explosives which, at the time, were kept in bags and stored inside a room, albeit one whose door was ajar.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The foregoing facts clearly establish that Mayor Pilapil and his inspection team were not in a lawful position when they discovered the subject explosives. The intrusion and inspection of the mining site of BCMC and Prime Rock, which afforded Mayor Pilapil and his team the opportunity to view the subject explosives, were illegal as they were not sanctioned by a warrant. Moreover, there is nothing in the facts which indicate that such entry and inspection fall within any of the recognized instances of valid warrantless searches. <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="30%"><div align="justify"><strong>Mayor Pilapil Has No Statutory Authority To Conduct A Warrantless Inspection Of The Mining Site Operated By BCMC And Prime Rock<br><br></strong></div></td><td width="70%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>The petitioners would insist, however, that Mayor Pilapil was authorized to enter and undertake a warrantless inspection of the mining site operated by BCMC and Prime Rock by virtue of the following provisions of the law and executive regulations:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><ol><li><b>Section 444(b)(3)(iv) of Republic Act (<i>RA</i>) No. 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991 (<i>LGC</i>)</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> which gives municipal mayors the power to issue business licenses and permits.

The first has to be carried out by an MMT as described under Section 185 of the RIRR. The second, on the other hand, may be conducted by a provincial governor or city mayor, in addition to the regional director of the MGB.<br><br>Verily, Mayor Pilapil's intrusion and warrantless inspection on the mining site operated by BCMC and Prime Rock find absolutely no justification under the Mining Act and its RIRR. A municipal mayor-<i>on his own and acting by himself</i>-has no authority to order and conduct any of the administrative inspections sanctioned under the said act and executive rule. In this respect, we no longer perceive any need to dwell into petitioners' invocation of Sections 8(e), 80, 87 and 94 of the RIRR as grounds for Mayor Pilapil's actions; the same simply has no merit.<br><br>Mayor Pilapil's zeal to cur b illegal mining activities within his municipality is commendable. However, that zeal can never justify taking a course of action that is not authorized under the law, much less be an excuse to flout basic constitutional rights of the people. Upon receiving the reports that Prime Rock was allegedly engaged in illegal mining, Mayor Pilapil could have simply applied for a judicial warrant to search the mining site of BCMC and Prime Rock for the purpose of verifying such report. Yet, he did not. Instead, Mayor Pilapil, on his own initiative, assembled a team of police officers and barangay officials, and led them in a raid that is not sanctioned by any provision of law. Under such circumstances, we cannot but make the conclusion that the warrantless ocular inspection conducted by Mayor Pilapil and his team on the mining site operated by BCMC and Prime Rock was illegal.<br><br>The illegality of the aforesaid ocular inspection means that Mayor Pilapil and his team were not in a lawful position when they were able to view the subject explosives. By this, the first requisite for a valid invocation of the plain view doctrine cannot be considered satisfied. Accordingly, Mayor Pilapil and his team's subsequent warrantless seizure of the subject explosives is not reasonable and runs against the constitutional proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.<br><br><center><b>B</b><br></center><br>Assuming for the sake of argument that Mayor Pilapil's prior intrusion and inspection of the mining site operated by BCMC and Prime Rock had been lawful, the warrantless seizure of the subject explosives still cannot be sustained. The third requisite of the plain view doctrine-that the incriminating character of the item seized must have been immediately apparent to the officer who made the seizure-is just the same absent in the case at bench.<br><br>Even in the midst of a valid intrusion by a law enforcement officer, the plain view doctrine cannot be used to justify the indiscriminate seizure of any item that happens to fall within such officer's open view.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> A contrary rule is nothing short of allowing government agents to conduct general exploratory searches of evidence - a scenario precisely condemned by the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Thus, as conceived in jurisprudence, only items whose <i>incriminating character is immediately apparent</i> to the law enforcement officer may be seized pursuant to the plain view doctrine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>In <i>United Laboratories, Inc. v.

A practical, non-traditional probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required. The evidence thus collected must be seen and verified as understood by those experienced in the field of law enforcement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Emphases supplied, citations omitted).<br></blockquote>Stated otherwise, in order to satisfy the third requisite of the plain view doctrine, it must be established that the seized item-<i>on the basis of the attending facts and surrounding circumstances</i>-reasonably appeared, to the officer who made the seizure, as a contraband or an evidence of a crime.<br><br>As said, this requisite was not met in this case.<br><br>Taking another look at the established facts, we are convinced that the incriminating character of the subject explosives-if indeed they have one-Â­was not immediately apparent to Mayor Pilapil and his inspection team. The facts attending and surrounding the discovery and seizure of the subject explosives could not have engendered a reasonable belief on the part of Mayor Pilapil and his team that the subject explosives were contraband or evidence of a crime, <i>viz</i>.:<br><ol><li>The presence of the explosives within a mining site is not unusual. Even the Mining Act recognizes the necessity of explosives in certain mining operations and, by this reason, confers a <i>conditional</i> right on the part of a mining contractor or permittee to possess and use explosives, provided they procure the proper government licenses therefor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Hence, the mere possession of explosives, especially by a mining contractor in a mining site, cannot be instantly characterized as illegal <i>per se</i>.<br><br></li><li>At the time they were first discovered by a member of Mayor Pilapil's inspection team, the subject explosives were not being used or even being prepared to be used. They were kept in bags which, in turn, were stored inside an open room.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Thus, no inference that such explosives were evidence of any alleged illegal mining can be drawn.<br></li></ol>The foregoing circumstances clearly contradict any notion that there was any observable illegality in the subject explosives. Mayor Pilapil and his inspection team seized the subject explosives without any probable cause, nay without any reason, apart from the subject explosives being exposed to their sight. Such seizure, therefore, is arbitrary and seems to have been made only in the hopes that the subject explosives would subsequently prove to be a contraband or an evidence of a crime. The seizure, in other words, is nothing but a veiled fishing expedition of evidence.<br><br>Their incriminating character not being immediately apparent, the subject explosives-even if discovered in plain view-are not items that may be validly seized without a warrant pursuant to the plain view doctrine. Accordingly, Mayor Pilapil and his team's warrantless seizure of the subject explosives is not reasonable and runs against the constitutional proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Since the subject explosives have been unequivocally seized in violation of the constitutional proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures, they are properly regarded by the CA as "<i>fruits of a poisonous tree</i>" subject to the <i>exclusionary principle</i> set forth in Section 3(b), Article III of the Constitution.
