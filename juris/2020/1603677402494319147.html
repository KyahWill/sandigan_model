Consequently, all outstanding purchase orders of Tyreplus were considered immediately due and demandable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p><p>In his Letter dated March 17, 2000, however, Lim firmly asserted that Tyreplus merely changed its name to Superpro which had assumed all the indebtedness of Tyreplus,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> thus:</p><blockquote><p>The dissolution was purely on my own prerogative as being the owner, as you were duly informed of his resignation and the change in business name last January and absorbing all deliveries to TYREPLUS and its indebtedness by SUPERPRO.</p></blockquote><p>Total sent respondents another Letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated March 30, 2000, emphasizing its belated discovery that Superpro was a separate entity and not merely the new trade name of Tyreplus. It reiterated that there ought to be only one distributor in any given marketing territory. Hence, the Distributorship Agreement with Tyreplus had to be pre-terminated before a new one may be forged with Superpro, <em>viz</em>.:</p><blockquote><p>x x x <strong>TPPC found out that SUPERPRO is an entirely new organization</strong> – a new corporation based on SEC. Reg. No. D2000- 00129, with the following as stockholders Edgardo M. LIM; xxx. Furthermore, <strong>the Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws, and the rest of the registration documents made no reference or relationship to the "former" TYREPLUS</strong>.</p><p><strong>In view of the foregoing, TPPC is constrained to treat SUPERPRO as distinct from and unique to TYREPLUS</strong>, the lubricants distributor of TPPC in Southern Mindanao.</p><p>Under TPPC's policy on the distributorships, TPPC prefers to have only one distributor in a given marketing territory. <strong>Thus, the distributorship for TYREPLUS had to be pre-terminated before a new distributorship in the territory with a different entity such as SUPERPRO may be effected</strong>.</p><p>In any case, the right of TPPC to pre-terminate its distributorship agreement with TYREPLUS is justified by TYREPLUS' breach of certain provisions on said agreements such as Article 9 thereof, which stated, thus:</p><p align="center">xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xxx</p><p><strong>Therefore, TYREPLUS cannot assign the distributorship agreement unilaterally to a distinct entity, SUPERPRO.

(emphasis supplied)</p></blockquote><p>When it subsequently learned that Lim issued stop-payment-order on the PSBank checks, it asked PSBank to pay the amounts in question pursuant to a bank guaranty which Lim obtained from PSBank precisely to pay off Tyreplus' indebtedness to Total. But PSBank informed Total that it cannot release payment because Lim as President of Tyreplus did not signify his conformity to pay Total's claim against Tyreplus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> PSBank further clarified, thus:</p><blockquote><p align="center">xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xxx</p><p>For purposes of clarification, we wish to emphasize the in every LOU issued by PS Bank, and as a standard procedure, conformity of the requesting client is always reflected in the LOU, signifying the client's express assent to the contents of the LOU.</p><p align="center">xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xxx</p><p>Moreover, it goes without saying that the undertaking submitted by PSBank will only arise once the conditions set forth in the LOUs are fully established – that Tyreplus failed to satisfy its obligation to TPPC <strong>and</strong> that Mr. Lim expressly signified his conformity that Tyreplus indeed failed to settle the amount claimed. <u><strong>These two are conditions <em>sine qua non</em>, and cannot be separated from each other.</strong></u> (Emphasis supplied)</p></blockquote><p>Lim kept making false representations that Tyreplus merely changed its name to Superpro. Lim also caused the transfer of Tyreplus' rights and obligations to another entity, Superpro, without Total's consent in violation of Article 9 of the Agreement. Worse, Lim did not signify his conformity to PSBank's payment of Tyreplus' obligations to Total, notwithstanding that he himself had obtained this credit line supposedly for the purpose of paying off Tyreplus' obligations to Total.</p><p>By way of counterclaim, Total prayed that Tyreplus and Lim be held jointly and severally liable for: a) P472,926.30 representing Tyreplus' unpaid obligation; b) liquidated damages equivalent to 20% of the principal claim; c) actual damages of P300,000.00; d) exemplary damages of P50,000.00; and e) attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p><p align="center"><strong>The Trial Court's Ruling</strong></p><p>In its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated November 15, 2005, the trial court ruled that Total validly pre-terminated its Distributorship Agreement with Tyreplus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></p><p>The trial court found that Total agreed to enter into a new Distributorship Agreement with Superpro because Lim led it to believe that Tyreplus got dissolved and changed its name to Superpro.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><p>Tyreplus, therefore, was ordered to pay Total P472,926.30 representing its unpaid obligations, P25,000.00 as liquidated damages, P94,585.26 as attorney's fees,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> plus P5,000.00 per hearing, and P60,000.00 as actual damages, <em>viz</em>.:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p><blockquote><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, this Court rules in favor of Defendant TOTAL PETROLEUM PHILIPPINES CORPORATION.

Consider:</p><p>a) On January 31, 2000 or barely two (2) months after the execution of the Distributorship Agreement between Total and Tyreplus on December 1, 1999, Lim, using the letterhead of "Superpro Ind. Sales Corp." wrote Total that "Superpro Industrial Sales Corporation" will be the new trade name of Tyreplus Sales Corporation;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></p><p>b) On February 4, 2000, Lim had a meeting with Total's Marketing Manager Beau Santos, and Total's Sales Executive Gigi Gonzales<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> where Lim reiterated that Tyreplus had changed its name to Superpro;</p><p>c) On February 10, 2000, or the day when the new Agreement with Superpro was executed, Lim never retracted his previous assertions that Tyreplus had been dissolved and had a new corporate name Superpro;</p><p>d) After the execution of the new Agreement between Total and Superpro, Total products supposedly intended for Tyreplus were stored inside a warehouse owned by Superpro. It was Superpro which eventually distributed these products for sale to the public.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></p><p>e) On February 11, 2000, PSBank sent a Letter of Undertaking to Total informing the latter that Lim had secured a bank guaranty in the amount of P500,000.00 in favor of Total <em><strong>"to answer for the obligations of Superpro, and its predecessor Tyreplus."</strong></em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></p><p>f) By letter dated February 25, 2000, Lim, again using the letterhead "Superpro Ind. Sales Corp." assured Total that <em><strong>"all billings to Tyreplus will be guaranteed payment by Superpro."</strong></em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></p><p>It was these false representations which led Total to enter into a new Agreement with Superpro in lieu of the one it already had with Tyreplus which per Lim's letters and verbal statements had just changed its name to Superpro. But it turned out that Superpro and Tyreplus are, in reality, not one but two (2) separate entities; Lim, acting as President of both companies himself has later confirmed the separate existence of these entities. Before the trial court, the Court of Appeals and this Court, Lim has stood by this confirmation. Notably, Lim's turn around had started only after he had already forged a new Agreement with Total on Superpro's behalf. Obviously, Lim's end goal was to be able to secure from Total two (2) Agreements for each of his two (2) companies in circumvention of Total's "one distributor, one area" business policy. Fortunately for Total, however, it promptly discovered Lim's scheme and wasted no time in effecting the cancellation of both Agreements. Surely, estoppel is a principle of equity to protect an innocent party against a double talking or double acting individual or entity. It is not the other way around.</p><p>Surely, when Tyreplus assigned its financial obligations and the distribution and sale of Total products to Superpro, Tyreplus clearly violated the non-transferability clause under Article 2 and Article 9 of the Distributorship Agreement. Again, this clause is material to the business policy of Total not to allow more than one (1) distributor in the same marketing territory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> This contractual breach warranted the revocation or pre-termination of the Agreement.</p><p><em><strong>Liability of Tyreplus' President<br> Edgardo Lim</strong></em></p><p>We now resolve whether Lim should be held personally liable for Tyreplus' obligations in his capacity as its President.</p><p>In <em><strong>Bank of Commerce v.

The obligations of a corporation, acting through its directors, officers, and employees, are its own sole liabilities. Therefore, the corporation's directors, officers, or employees are generally not personally liable for the obligations of the corporation.</p><p>To hold a director or officer personally liable for corporate obligations, <strong>two requisites</strong> must concur: (1) complainant must allege in the complaint that the director or officer assented to patently unlawful acts of the corporation, or that the officer was guilty of gross negligence or bad faith; and (2) complainant must clearly and convincingly prove such unlawful acts, negligence or bad faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> To hold a director or officer personally liable for debts of the corporation, and thus pierce the veil of corporate fiction, the bad faith or wrongdoing of the director or officer must be <strong>established clearly and convincingly</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></p><p>Here, Lim had been the <strong>frontrunner in the transactions</strong> between Total and Tyreplus, and subsequently, Total with Superpro. Lim <strong>categorically identified himself</strong> as the President of Tyreplus and Superpro. Lim <strong>admitted and declared his active participation</strong> in the management and operation of Tyreplus and Superpro, as the President of both companies, <em>viz.:</em></p><blockquote><p>Q: Now, Mr. Witness, when did you cause the change in the corporate name of Tyreplus to Superpro Industrial Corporation?<br> A: As I have mentioned in the early statement that after the resignation of Mr. Brigido Tan, after I made personal investigation, <strong>I decided to change the name of Tyreplus to Superpro</strong> and we did it on the early part of January 2000.</p><p>xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xxx</p><p>Q: Now, Mr. witness, when did the Total Petroleum Philippines Corporation know that you change the corporate name of Tyreplus Industrial Sales to Superpro Industrial Sales Corporation?<br> A: I sent them a letter last January 31, 2000 xxx then we personally discussed xxx that <strong>I am changing the name of Tyreplus to Superpro.</strong> (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Lim's letter dated March 17, 2000 addressed to Total emphasized that Tyreplus' <em><strong>"dissolution was purely on his own prerogative."</strong></em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Ultimately, Lim as the President of Tyreplus is the <strong>controlling mind</strong> of this company, as Tyreplus had no mind of its own.</p><p>In many instances, Lim's oral and written communications to Total led the latter to believe that Tyreplus merely changed its name to Superpro. It turned out to be a mistaken belief but it was entirely sourced from Lim's false representations. The same caused Total to execute a new Agreement with Superpro in lieu of the Agreement earlier forged with Tyreplus which was believed to have already changed its name to Superpro. Days <em>after</em> the contract with Superpro was executed, Lim started changing this tone, this time, he claimed that Superpro had actually emerged as a new entity. Not only that. For no valid reason, Lim, on behalf of Tyreplus, ordered a stop-payment on the checks he issued as payment for the obligations of Tyreplus to Total. And after Total demanded payment of the obligations of Tyreplus, Lim, on behalf of Tyreplus, instituted the case for damages against Total.</p><p>Clearly, Lim dealt in bad faith when he knowingly misled Total into executing the new Agreement with Superpro. Lim falsely declared to Total that Tyreplus' name was merely changed to Superpro, albeit he subsequently asserted that in fact the companies are two (2) distinct and separate. Lim's misuse of Tyreplus as a corporation to perpetuate breach of contractual obligations renders Lim personally liable.</p><p><em><strong>International Academy of Management and Economics v. Litton and Co., Inc.</strong></em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> is in point, thus:</p><blockquote><p>[t]he doctrine of alter ego is based upon the <strong>misuse of a corporation by an individual</strong> for wrongful or inequitable purposes, and in such case the court merely disregards the corporate entity and holds the individual responsible for acts knowingly and intentionally done in the name of the corporation" (Emphasis supplied)</p></blockquote><p>Lim, therefore, should be made liable jointly and severally liable<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> with Tyreplus in the payment of the latter's obligations due to Total.</p><p><em><strong>Monetary awards due to Total</strong></em></p><p>In <em><strong>Talampas, Jr. v.

In this case, the Distributorship Agreement between Tyreplus and Total shows no stipulation on liquidated damages to be paid in case of breach thereof. In the absence of stipulation, the award of P25,000.00 as liquidated damages should be deleted.</p><p>On exemplary damages, Article 2229<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> of the <em>Civil Code</em> provides that exemplary or corrective damages may be imposed, by way of example or correction for the public good, in addition to either moral, temperate, liquidated, or compensatory damages.
