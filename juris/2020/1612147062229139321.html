				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Acceleration clauses in loans for a fixed term give creditors a choice to: (1) defer collection of any unpaid amounts until the period ends; or (2) invoke the clause and collect the entire demandable amount immediately.

As security, Gotesco executed a real estate mortgage over a 20,673-square-meter property covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-70389.

First, it claims that despite the ten-year term of the loan, the Compromise Agreement required petitioner to pay respondent in quarterly amortizations. Because petitioner last made payment in 2006, respondent was entitled to move for the execution of the judgment on the Compromise Agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Second, it posits that the reversal of the June 16, 2010 Order was within Judge Marajas' duty to review a prior ruling, especially in this case where the ruling was allegedly contrary to the terms of the Compromise Agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Third, it claims that stare decisis was inapplicable in this case because the June 16, 2010 Order is not an issuance of the Supreme Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Finally, it argues that the petition for certiorari filed by petitioner before the Court of Appeals was erroneous since the issuance of a writ of execution did not involve any exercise of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The issues to be resolved in this case are:<br><br>First, whether or not Judge Ernesto L. Marajas committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when he issued his August 18, 2011 Resolution granting the motion for reconsideration of respondent International Exchange Bank, now Union Bank of the Philippines, and setting aside the June 16, 2010 Order of Judge Wilfredo De Joya Mayor; and<br><br>Second, whether or not respondent Union Bank of the Philippines has the right to cause the immediate execution of the December 14, 2001 Judgment on the Compromise Agreement upon petitioner Gotesco Properties, Inc.'s failure to pay its quarterly amortizations.<br><br><div align="center"><b>I</b><br></div><br>A motion for reconsideration is among the remedies an aggrieved party may avail of against an adverse judgment or final order as provided for in Rule 37, Section 1 of the Rules of Court:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Grounds of and Period for Filing Motion for New Trial or Reconsideration.</i> — Within the period for taking an appeal, the aggrieved party may move the trial court to set aside the judgment or final order and grant a new trial for one or more of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of said party:<br><blockquote>(a) Fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against and by reason of which such aggrieved party has probably been impaired in his rights; or<br><br>(b) Newly discovered evidence, which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered, and produced at the trial, and which if presented would probably alter the result.<br></blockquote>Within the same period, the aggrieved party may also move for reconsideration upon the grounds that the damages awarded are excessive, that the evidence is insufficient to justify the decision or final order, or that the decision or final order is contrary to law.</blockquote>The purpose of a motion for reconsideration is for the moving party to point to purported errors in the assailed judgment or final order which that party views as unsupported by law or evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> It "grant[s] an opportunity for the court to correct any actual or perceived error attributed to it by re-examination of the legal and factual circumstances of the case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's position that the principle of <i>stare decisis</i> precluded the issuance of the August 18, 2011 Resolution contradicts the very reason why motions for reconsideration are allowed by the Rules of Court. An aggrieved party is permitted to question alleged errors in a judgment or final order, and should the court find merit in the moving party's arguments, then it is duty-bound to correct those errors. Rule 37, Section 3 of the Rules of Court states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. <i>Action Upon Motion for New Trial or Reconsideration</i>. —The trial court may set aside the judgment or final order and grant a new trial, upon such terms as may be just, or may deny the motion. If the court finds that excessive damages have been awarded or that the judgment or final order is contrary to the evidence or law, it may amend such judgment or final order accordingly.<br></blockquote>When a motion for reconsideration is granted, the decision of the court embodying such grant supersedes the original judgment or fmal order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the principle of stare decisis applies only to final decisions of this Court, because only this Court may create judicial precedents that other courts should follow. In <i>De Mesa v. Pepsi Cola Products Phils., Inc. :</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The principle of <i>stare decisis el non quieta movere</i> is entrenched in Article 8 of the Civil Code, to wit: &nbsp;<br><br>ART. 8.&nbsp; Judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution shall form a part of the legal system of the Philippines.<br><blockquote>It enjoins adherence to judicial precedents. It requires our courts to follow a rule already established in a final decision of the Supreme Court. That decision becomes a judicial precedent to be followed in subsequent cases by all courts in the land. The doctrine of stare decisis is based on the principle that once a question of law has been examined and decided, it should be deemed settled and closed to further argument.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[50]</sup></font> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted </blockquote>"Decisions of lower courts or other divisions of the same court are not binding on others."<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[51] </sup></font>No grave abuse of discretion is committed<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[52]</sup></font> when a judge sets aside an earlier ruling rendered by the previous judge in the same trial court branch for the same case, especially when, as in this case, a reversible error had been committed.<br><br>The issuance of a writ of execution of a final and executory judgment is generally a court's ministerial duty. However, this is subject to certain exceptions. In <i>Chiquita Brands, Inc. v. Omelio:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><blockquote>Ordinarily, courts have the ministerial duty to grant the execution of a final judgment. The prevailing party may immediately move for execution of the judgment, and the issuance of the writ follows as a matter of course. Execution, being "the final stage of litigation . . . [cannot] be frustrated."<br><br>Nevertheless, the execution of a final judgment may be stayed or set aside in certain cases. "Courts have jurisdiction to entertain motions to quash previously issued writs of execution[.]" They "have the inherent power, for the advancement of justice, to correct the errors of their ministerial officers and to control, their own processes."<br><br>A writ of execution may be stayed or quashed when "facts and circumstances transpire" after judgment has been rendered that would make "execution impossible or unjust."<br><br>In<i> Lee v. De Guzman, </i>the trial court issued a writ of execution directing a car manufacturer to deliver a 1983 Toyota Corolla Liftback to a buyer. The manufacturer moved to quash the writ. Instead of ordering the manufacturer to deliver the car, this Court ordered the manufacturer to pay damages. The cessation of the manufacturer's business operations rendered compliance with the writ of execution impossible.<br><br>Another exception is when the writ of execution alters or varies the judgment. A writ of execution derives its validity from the judgment it seeks to enforce. Hence, it should not "vary terms of the judgment . . . [or] go beyond its terms." Otherwise, the writ of execution is void. Courts can neither modify nor "impose terms different from the terms of a compromise agreement" that parties have entered in good faith. To do so would amount to grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Payment or satisfaction of the judgment debt also constitutes as a ground for the quashal of a writ of execution. In Sandico, Sr. v. Piguing, although the sum given by the debtors was less than the amount of the judgment debt, the creditors accepted the reduced amount as "full satisfaction of the money judgment." This justified the issuance of an order recalling the writ of execution.<br><br>A writ of execution may also be set aside or quashed when it appears from the circumstances of the case that the writ "is defective in substance," "has been improvidently issued," issued without authority, or was "issued against the wrong party."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>Respondent's Motion for Execution was initially denied on the basis of prematurity. According to Judge Mayor in his June 16, 2010 Order, the ten-year term loan in the Compromise Agreement started on March 31, 2003, and would only end in 2013:<br><blockquote>. . . Considering that the subject nature of the compromise agreement especially the amount loaned was restructured into a 10-year term loan. With the duration of the 10-year period as provided in the Compromise Agreement from March 31, 2003 and would end in the year 2013 which renders the motion to issue writ of execution premature. As clearly, the 10-year term loan ends in 2013 when the obligations shall have been fully settled and paid by the plaintiff. Hence, prior thereto, the motion for execution prayed for by the defendant is therefore considered premature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></blockquote>Concededly, the final whereas clause of the Compromise Agreement did state:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, the parties have decided to enter into a compromise agreement which would entail the re-structuring of the outstanding loan of Gotesco Properties, Inc. with iBank into a ten (10) year term loan with the mortgage of real estate properties mentioned in Articles 2.1.3 and 2.1.4 hereof and the Real Estate Mortgage and the Surety Agreement mentioned in the First Whereas Clause as its security/collateral.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></blockquote>However, this clause must not be read in isolation, but should be reconciled with the rest of the Compromise Agreement. Among the relevant portions are:<br><blockquote>1.1.

The remaining balance of P246,740,000.00 was divided into 28 quarterly amortizations, payable starting March 31, 2003 until the balance was fully paid. The balance was likewise subject to a 12% per annum interest rate, also payable quarterly. Any unpaid interest or principal amortization was further subject to a 12% per annum penalty interest.<br><br>Should petitioner fail to pay any amount when due, Section 1.7 of the Compromise Agreement allowed respondent to declare the entire obligation due and demandable. Furthermore, pursuant to Section 4.03 of the Compromise Agreement, respondent was given the right to move for the immediate execution of the total amount due.<br><br>An examination of Sections 1.7 and 4.03 of the Compromise Agreement shows that they are in the nature of acceleration clauses. An acceleration clause is a provision in a contract wherein, should the debtor default, the entire obligation shall become due and demandable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> This Court has held that acceleration clauses are valid and produce legal effect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's claim that the loan only becomes due and demandable after 10 years is wrong. Even when there is a fixed term for the loan, the creditor may invoke the contract's acceleration clause should the debtor fail to comply with their obligation to pay the stipulated installments. In <i>Spouses Ruiz v. Sheriff of Manila:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>With respect to the first assigned error, the appellants lay stress [on] the following last two sentences of the provision of the mortgage contract quoted above, to wit:<br><blockquote>". . . Failure to pay two successive monthly amortizations will cause this loan to be automatically due and payable in its entirety. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this loan shall not run for more than 5 years."</blockquote>Interpreting the above stipulation, the appellants claim that despite the acceleration clause they had five years from January 18, 1961 within which to pay their mortgage debt because of the phrase "notwithstanding the foregoing" in the last sentence. Since the five-year period had not yet expired when the mortgage was foreclosed, said foreclosure, they point out, was premature.<br><br>The appellants' interpretation is totally without merit. To ascertain the meaning of the provision of the mortgage contract relied upon by the appellants, its entirety must be taken into account and not merely its last two sentences. A reading of the entire provision will readily show that while the appellants were allowed to amortize their loan at the rate of not less than P300.00 a month they were under obligation to liquidate the same within a period of not more than five (5) years from the date of the execution of the contract; but if they should fail to pay two successive monthly amortizations, then the entire loan would be due and payable. It is obvious that the phrase "notwithstanding the foregoing" does not refer to the acceleration clause but to the stipulation that the loan had to be "amortized at the rate of not less than P300.00, including interest on unpaid balance, at the rate of 8% per annum,, said interest and capital amortization to be effected at the end of each month." There is nothing inconsistent between the acceleration clause and the last sentence. All that the parties meant is that while monthly amortizations could be as little as P300.00 the loan should anyway be paid within 5 years; and that failure to pay two successive amortizations would render the entire loan due and payable. Consequently, default having been committed for twelve months, the foreclosure of the mortgage was not premature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Acceleration clauses in loans for a fixed term give creditors a choice to: (1) defer collection of any unpaid amounts until the period ends; or (2) invoke the clause and collect the entire demandable amount immediately.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> This right to choose is meaningless if the obligation is made demandable only when the term expires.<br><br>In this case, it is undisputed that petitioner had defaulted payment on its quarterly amortizations, with its last payment being made on June 2, 2006.M Petitioner has neither pleaded nor produced any evidence to the contrary. Because of petitioner's nonpayment, respondent invoked the acceleration clauses in the Compromise Agreement to declare petitioner's entire loan due and demandable, then exercised its right pursuant to Section 4.03 to move for the immediate execution of the Compromise Agreement. Thus, the Regional Trial Court correctly reversed its earlier ruling and granted respondent's Motion for Execution.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is <b>DENIED.</b> The February 10, 2014 Decision and April 22, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
