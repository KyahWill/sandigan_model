LapeÃ±a, Jr. in the decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 1389[7] promulgated on August 14, 1989, "when Ireneo, the registered owner, died, the land went to his heirs, namely, his wife, [Catalina] and his daughter, [Vicenta] by right of succession. [Mariano and Vicenta] were therefore justified in claiming the right to work on the land as co-owners thereof. Moreover, as pointed out by the trial court, it is undisputed that [Mariano and Vicenta] have been the ones actually cultivating the land in question even when Ir[e]neo was still living until he died in 1983 and up to the present. Thus, [Mariano and Vicenta] are not only co-owners, but actual cultivators of the land in question who are covered by the security of tenure provision of PD 27 which was issued in 1972, when [Mariano and Vicenta] were already in actual cultivation of the land in question.<br><br><b>[The CA] did not fail to note that when (Ireneo] died, he was not merely a tenant over [the disputed lots]. He was already the registered owner thereof.

Upon Vicenta's death, her surviving spouse Mariano became a co-owner of said lots by the right of succession. A co-owner cannot be ejected from any property an aliquot part of which he owns.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Nevertheless, the CA affirmed the denial of the parties' monetary claims due to lack of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration coupled with a motion to admit the same on December 16, 2009, 98 days<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> following the expiration of their fifteen (15)-day reglementary period.

Should a person make a partition of his estate by an act <i>inter vivos</i>, or by will, such partition shall be respected, insofar as it does not prejudice the legitime of the compulsory heirs.<br><br><b>A parent who, in the interest of his or her family, desires to keep any agricultural, industrial, or manufacturing enterprise intact, may avail himself of the right granted him in this article, by ordering that the legitime of the other children to whom the property is not assigned, be paid in cash.</b> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><i>Presentacion is the qualified sole owner-cultivator under PD 27.</i><br><br>Consistent with the procedure set forth in MC 19, Petitioners' predecessor-in-interest Presentacion filed her Letter-request and Petition for Reallocation with the DAR Regional Director. Presentacion's Letter-request and Petition for Reallocation were successively granted through the DAR Regional Director's Orders dated May 31, 1999<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and December 11, 2000.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In turn, these Orders became final on August 10, 1999<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and January 4, 2001,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> respectively.<br><br>Mariano does not dispute that Presentacion was the oldest surviving heir of Ireneo at the time of the latter's death. He also does not assail that Presentacion possessed the qualifications necessary to succeed Ireneo as new owner-cultivator under MC 19. Thus, in the absence of any extra-judicial settlement assigning in Vicenta's (Mariano's wife) favor the priority right to become sole owner and cultivator of the disputed lots, her husband Mariano's claim of possession is left with no leg to stand on.<br><br>Nevertheless, Presentacion, as lawful successor of Ireneo and new owner-cultivator of the disputed lots, was bound to compensate Ireneo's other compulsory heirs to the extent of their respective legal interests in the disputed lots, subject to the payment of whatever outstanding obligations the deceased farmer-beneficiary might still have, as required by MC 19.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> This obligation to compensate Ireneo's other compulsory heirs now falls upon Petitioners, as successors-in-interest of the late Presentacion.<br><br>However, the Court recognizes that the identification of Ireneo's other heirs and the determination of their respective interests in the disputed lots as well as their obligations to said deceased farmer-beneficiary are factual matters which cannot be resolved in a petition for review. Accordingly, the Court deems it proper to remand the case to the DAR Regional Director, the latter having primary jurisdiction over all matters relating to the implementation of agrarian laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><i>Res judicata</i> does not apply.<br><br>The assailed Decision and Resolution affirmed Mariano's claim of possession on the ground of <i>res judicata</i>, and cites as basis, previous judgments awarding possession of the disputed lots in Mariano's favor. Accordingly, an examination of the principle of <i>res judicata</i> as a bar by prior judgment is in order. On this score, <i>Dela Rosa v. Mercado</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> is instructive:<br><blockquote>A prior decision is conclusive in a second suit where the elements of <i>res judicata</i> are present. For a prior judgment to constitute a bar to a subsequent case, the following requisites must concur:<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>it must be a final judgment or order;<br><br></li><li>the court rendering the same must have jurisdiction over the subject matter and over parties;<br><br></li><li>there must be between the two cases identity of parties, identity of subject matter and identity of causes of action; and<br><br></li><li>it must be a judgment or order on the merits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote></blockquote>To recall, the previous judgments which the CA recognized as basis to apply the principle of <i>res judicata</i> are the October 1986 RTC Decision, the August 1996 PA Decision and the Decision rendered by PA Vasquez from which this Petition stems.<br><br>The October 1986 RTC Decision resolved a complaint for recovery of possession and damages filed by Ireneo's second wife Catalina against Mariano and Vicenta, who, at that time, was still alive. Therein, Catalina claimed that she was entitled to possession of the disputed lots as CLT holder. The issue thus raised in said case was whether Catalina could lawfully eject Mariano and Vicenta from the disputed lots.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The RTC ruled in the negative, as Catalina failed to produce her alleged CLT. In fact, during the course of the RTC proceedings, both parties admitted that the only CLT issued over the disputed lots was the one issued in favor of Ireneo<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> - the very same one relied upon by Presentacion, and now, by Petitioners.<br><br>On the other hand, the August 1996 PA Decision resolved a complaint for recovery of possession and damages between Presentacion and Vicenta. Therein, PA TraviÃ±a dismissed Presentacion's complaint primarily on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, holding as follows:<br><blockquote>This Adjudicator finds merit in [Vicenta's] position on the jurisdictional incompetence of the Adjudication Board to hear and decide this case x x x. Definitely, this case is infused with a valid issue of tenancy: the question of who among the heirs of the late tenant-beneficiary [Ireneo] should take over the [disputed lots] he left behind.<br><br>And <b>this tenancy issue is met squarely by [MC 19] providing for the <i>Rules and Regulations in Case of Death of a Tenant-Beneficiary</i> and making the whole process one of administrative concern cognizable only by the DAR Secretary through the Department's Regional and local field offices</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis and italics supplied)<br></blockquote>Taking her cue from the August 1996 PA Decision, Presentacion later filed her Letter-request and Petition for Reallocation with the DAR Regional Director which, as earlier stated, were both granted.<br><br>Close scrutiny of the foregoing judgments confirms that they do not serve as proper basis to apply the principle of <i>res judicata</i>.<br><br>The October 1986 RTC Decision involved a different party-plaintiff who asserted an entirely different cause of action.<br><br>Moreover, while the August 1996 PA Decision involved the same parties who raised issues similar to those raised in this case, said Decision does not constitute a judgment on the merits which would operate to bar the resolution of the substantive issues in a subsequent case, inasmuch as it was premised primarily on lack of jurisdiction - recognizing, in fact, that the "question of who among the heirs of the late tenant-beneficiary [Ireneo] should take over the [disputed lots] he left behind"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> was an administrative concern cognizable only by the DAR Secretary.<br><br>As well, it is equally evident that the Decision rendered by PA Vasquez in DARAB Case No. VI-1342-IL-01 cannot prompt the application of <i>res judicata</i>. Considering that said Decision is the subject of this present Petition, it cannot, by any means, be deemed a final judgment on the merits.<br><br>Hence, contrary to Mariano's insistence, <i>res judicata</i> does not apply in the present case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
