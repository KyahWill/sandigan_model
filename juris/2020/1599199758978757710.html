In the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated March 25, 2009, the Ombudsman dismissed the case. The subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied in the Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> dated September 6, 2010. As can be culled from the Ombudsman's Resolution in that case, Dominguez claimed that there were irregularities in the purchase of the Mitsubishi van, thus:<br><br><blockquote>1. The bidding was rigged because the vehicle was not procured through public bidding in violation of Section 10, Rule IV, Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR for brevity) of R.A. 9184;<br><br>2.

The purchase price in the amount of Nine Hundred Ninety-Nine Thousand, Nine Hundred Ninety-Nine Pesos Philippine Currency (PhP999,000.00) is excessive based on the price quotation submitted by MotorPlaza, Inc. in the amount of PhP781,000.00 for a Mitsubishi Van with the same specifications.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Citations omitted.)</blockquote><br><br>There were attempts to consolidate OMB-L-C-07-0106-A with OMB-C-C-11-0107-C.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> However, the attempts were futile by reason of the dismissal of OMB-L-C-07-0106-A.<br><br>On November 4, 2014, the Ombudsman rendered the assailed Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It noted that the charges against respondents <i>a quo</i> were anchored on the documents alleged to have been modified to hide the irregularities in the procurement of the Mitsubishi van. The Ombudsman picked up on the report of the NBI, and pointed out that, initially, what was reflected in the bid documents was the procurement of a <i>Mitsubishi van</i>. However, it was subsequently made to appear in some bid documents that the procurement was for an <i>ambulance</i> for the Bontoc General Hospital (BGH).<br><br>Specifically as regards the charge for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, the Ombudsman found that the elements thereof are present to constitute as basis for a finding of probable cause against petitioner and his co-respondents <i>a quo</i>.<br><br>The Ombudsman disposed of the case in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, this Office finds probable cause to prosecute MAXIMO B.

It need not be based on clear and convincing evidence of guilt, not on evidence establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and definitely not on evidence establishing absolute certainty of guilt. In determining probable cause, the average man weighs facts and circumstances without resorting to the calibrations of the rules of evidence of which he has no technical knowledge. He relies on common sense. What is determined is whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed, and that the accused is probably guilty thereof and should be held for trial.

He maintains that the changes made in the bid documents were done in order to reflect that what was actually purchased and delivered to the provincial government was an ambulance unit with equipment and accessories as originally intended, and not just one Mitsubishi van. Petitioner further submits that there was no change in the purpose or use of the purchased vehicle; thus, no injury was caused to the government. Neither was there any unwarranted benefit granted him and his co-respondents <i>a quo</i> to any private party. The Ombudsman has no basis to conclude that Ronald Kimakim, the owner of Ronhil Trading, was the sole bidder.<br><br>After a careful study of the case, the Court finds that petitioner failed to show that the Ombudsman conducted the preliminary investigation in an arbitrary and despotic manner. On the contrary, the Ombudsman properly performed its duty in determining whether petitioner is probably guilty of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.<br><br>Section 3(e) of RA 3019 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 3. <i>Corrupt practices of public officers.</i> â In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:<br><br>x x x x<blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">(e) </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.

A reading of the assailed Resolution shows that the Ombudsman was of the well-founded belief that the complained acts and omissions constituted a violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019. The Ombudsman categorically found as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Contrary to Pagteilan, Kollin, Gut-omen, Likigan and Wanawan's claim, Kimakim was the <i>sole bidder</i> for the procurement of the Mitsubishi van. Without showing its basis, the Provincial Government declared Kimakim as the winner. This was done despite the <u>presence</u> of irregularities in the procurement process, i.e. modification of the procurement documents upon discovery that the actual intent of the procurement was for a service vehicle and not for an ambulance. Such violation of the Procurement Law should have alerted public respondents before the procurement was finalized. By allowing the procurement process to continue despite the manifest irregularities in the procurement, public respondents caused undue injury to the government in the amount of <u>P87,700.91</u> and gave Kimakim unwarranted/undue benefit, to the detriment of public service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Emphasis and citations omitted; underscoring in the original.)</blockquote><br><br>As established below and admitted by petitioner, the latter's participation in the subject transaction was in the preparation of the Post-Qualification Evaluation Report, Post-Qualification Evaluation Summary Report and Bid Evaluation Report, which the NBI reported to have been fabricated or falsified in order to hide the anomalies in the transaction between Ronald C. Kimakim and Gov. Maximo B. Dalog regarding the procurement of the Mitsubishi van. In finding probable cause against petitioner, the Ombudsman held:<br><br><blockquote>Also, inasmuch as not one from the respondents lifted a finger to stop the procurement, despite the glaring irregularities, clearly indicate the <u><i>conspiratorial design</i></u> of respondents to <u><i>favor</i></u> Kimakim through the circumvention of RA 9184, deception of the government and complete disregard of the principles of <u>accountability</u>, <u>responsibility</u> and <u>transparency</u>.<br><br>Further, by allowing the deviation or change in the actual use of the Mitsubishi van and their failure to <i>outrightly</i> reflect the word '<u>ambulance equipment and accessories</u>' in the majority of the procurement documents, clearly establishes the <i>badge of conspiracy</i> as without the indispensable participation of each of respondents, the whole process would have not been completed. Although it appears that their acts were independent, it were, <i>in reality</i>, <u>concerted</u> and <u>cooperative</u>, indicating closeness of personal association, concerted action and concurrence of sentiments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis and citations omitted; underscoring in the original.)</blockquote><br><br>Petitioner also makes much of the dismissal of OMB-L-C-07-0106-A. He contends that since the case has already been dismissed, the charge for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 cannot be revived in OMB-C-C-11-0107-C. Petitioner goes as far as invoking the principle of finality on resolutions and even alleging forum shopping.<br><br>The contention lacks merit primarily because petitioner was not even a party in OMB-L-C-07-0106-A. At any rate, the Court observes that the justification for the dismissal of the charge for violation of RA 3019 in OMB-L-C-07-0106-A was not because the investigating officer did not strongly and honestly believe that respondents therein were not guilty of the crime charged. Instead, it was, because, as exactly worded in the Resolution:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br><blockquote>x x x [T]he complainant charged the respondents of violation of the anti-graft law without even specifying the acts which should constitute any of the corrupt practices defined in Section 3 of R.A. 3019. The indiscriminate accusation that respondents violated the law without any reference to any corrupt acts does not merit any consideration, adding to it the fact that it is not, in the least, corroborated by any evidence. Hence, the charge must fail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote><br><br>But more importantly, the dismissal of OMB-L-C-07-0106-A is not a judgment on the merits. Hence, petitioner cannot invoke finality of resolutions. As the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>Jurisprudence has long settled that preliminary investigation does not form part of trial. Investigation for the purpose of determining whether an actual charge shall subsequently be filed against the person subject of the investigation is a purely administrative, rather than a judicial or quasi-judicial, function. It is not an exercise in adjudication: no ruling is made on the rights and obligations of the parties, but merely evidentiary appraisal to determine if it is worth going into actual adjudication.<br><br>The dismissal of a complaint on preliminary investigation by a prosecutor "cannot be considered a valid and final judgment." As there is no former final judgment or order on the merits rendered by the court having jurisdiction over both the subject matter and the parties, there could not have been <i>res judicata</i> x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Another matter raised by petitioner is denial of due process. According to him, he was not given an opportunity to controvert the charge of violation of RA 3019 as what he was directed to file a counter-affidavit to was only the charge of falsification. Petitioner further gives the impression that the allegations below against him, such as those contained in the NBI Report, focused on the charge of falsification and not on Section 3(e) of RA 3019. Thus, in stating his defenses below, he also did not focus on the charge for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019. He was then surprised to find out that the Ombudsman found probable cause to indict him for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.<br><br>Petitioner's allegations do not persuade and are belied by the record. <i>First</i>, Dominguez's affidavit specifically charged him and his co-respondents <i>a quo</i> with violation of RA 3019. The affidavit expressly cited the documents that petitioner prepared and signed in connection with the procurement of the Mitsubishi van. <i>Second</i>, the NBI Case Report categorically recommended, among other things, that petitioner and some of his co-respondents <i>a quo</i> be charged with violation of Section 3 of RA 3019. Significantly, the NBI Case Report provided a detailed and lengthy report in support of its conclusion an recommendation. <i>Third</i>, nowhere in the Order dated March 17, 2011 of the Ombudsman did it require petitioner and his co-respondents <i>a quo</i> to file a counter-affidavit only to the charge of falsification. Also, all the charged offenses were explicitly stated in the first page of the Order. <i>Fourth</i>, petitioner filed a counter-affidavit. Therein, he even acknowledged being charged with violation of RA 3019. The filing of the counter-affidavit was an opportunity for him to explain his side of the controversy. <i>Fifth</i>, with respect to the Ombudsman's Resolution, petitioner had the chance to question it and seek reconsideration thereof, which he actually did through his Motion for Partial Consideration. Thus, petitioner has no basis at all to claim that he was deprived of ah opportunity to be heard.<br><br>Lastly, petitioner invokes his right to a speedy disposition of cases, saying that it took the Ombudsman a long time to resolve the complaint.<br><br>It bears stressing that the right to a speedy disposition of cases is a flexible concept.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> A mere mathematical reckoning of the time involved is not sufficient.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Due regard must be given to the facts and circumstances surrounding each case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The right is deemed violated only when the proceedings are attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Petitioner has failed to substantiate his claim, or to even show that there was an unreasonable, arbitrary, and oppressive delay on the part of the Ombudsman in conducting the preliminary investigation. He even admits not following up on his case believing that it was dismissed since OMB-L-C-07-0106-A had already been dismissed.<br><br>In the case of <i>Tilendo v. Ombudsman</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>Even assuming there was delay in the termination of the preliminary investigation, Tilendo is deemed to have slept on his right to a speedy disposition of cases. From 22 October 1999, when he submitted to the NBI his counter-affidavit, after asking for several extensions of time, Tilendo did nothing until December 2002. It seems that Tilendo was insensitive to the implications and contingencies of the projected criminal prosecution posed against him. He did not take any step whatsoever to accelerate the disposition of the matter. Tilendo's inaction gives the impression that he did not object to the supervening delay, and hence it was impliedly with his acquiescence. He did not make any overt act like, for instance, filing a motion for early resolution. He asserted his right to a speedy disposition of cases only when the Deputy Ombudsman-Mindanao required him to file his counter-affidavit to the NBI complaint.<br><br>Tilendo's contention of violation of his right to speedy disposition of cases must fail. There was no unreasonable and unjustifiable delay which attended the resolution of the complaints against him in the preliminary investigation phase.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></blockquote><br><br>For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds the present petition to be without basis.<br><br>To emphasize the basic concept that must be borne in mind throughout this Decision, the Court quotes the following:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [S]o long as <i>substantial evidence</i> supports the Ombudsman's ruling, his decision should stand. In a criminal proceeding before the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman merely determines whether probable cause exists x x x. Probable cause is a reasonable ground of presumption that a matter is, or may be, well founded on such a state of facts in the mind of the prosecutor as would lead a person of ordinary caution and prudence to believe, or entertain an honest or strong suspicion, that a thing is so. As the term itself implies, probable cause is concerned merely with probability and not absolute or even moral certainty; it is merely based on opinion and reasonable belief. x x x <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> is <b>DENIED</b>.
