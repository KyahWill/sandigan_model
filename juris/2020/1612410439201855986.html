When arraigned, appellant pleaded not guilty. </p> <p><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></p> <p> The prosecution presented seven witnesses: complainants (1) Ramirez, (2) Tucay, and (3) Christopher Yambao (Yambao); police officers (4) Police Officer 2 Zandro B. Llacuna (PO2 Llacuna), (5) Senior Police Officer 4 Ronald Alvaira (SPO4 Alvaira), and (6) Senior Police Officer 3 Valerian Papelleras (SPO3 Papelleras); and (7) Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) Representative Eraida Dumigpi (POEA Rep. Dumigpi).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p> <p> Ramirez testified that sometime in March 2009, he was referred to Jennifer Magat (Magat) who, at that time, was in Bongabon, Nueva Ecija looking for job applicants. Magat instructed him to go to a medical clinic in Malvar Street, Manila and paid P5,000.00 for the processing of documents. Thereafter, Magat introduced him to appellant, whom she identified as her boss. Appellant represented herself as a licensed agent of Pert/CPM Manpower Exponents Company, Inc. (Pert/CPM Manpower) and promised him that he would be deployed to Qatar as a waiter within six (6) months. Afterwards, appellant took the job application documents of Ramirez for processing and Ramirez paid her a total of P34,000.00 as payment for the training fee, medical examination, visa application, and POEA Certificate. Ramirez demanded for a receipt but appellant did not issue one. Eventually, Ramirez and the other complainants discovered that appellant was not an agent of Pert/CPM Manpower and reported the matter to PNP-CIDG. Police officers took Ramirez's statement and thereafter, devised a plan to conduct an entrapment operation against appellant. During the entrapment operation, Tucay, Yambao, and Richard Peroche<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Peroche), handed their payments to appellant who was thereafter, apprehended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p> Tucay testified that in April 2009, she met Magat, who instructed her and a certain Emil Catacutan to go to Manila if they wanted to apply for work abroad. In Manila, Tucay paid Magat P8,000.00 for her medical examination and processing of documents. Tucay kept following up the status of her application but Magat insisted that these were still being processed. Tucay threatened to file a case against Magat, who in turn, returned P5,000.00 to her.</p><p> Magat introduced Tucay and the latter's boyfriend, Yambao, to appellant whom she identified as her boss. Appellant told Tucay and Yambao that she will be the one to process their applications. Appellant promised Tucay that she would be hired as a receptionist while Yambao would be hired as a mechanical engineer. In exchange for appellant's services, she paid appellant a total of P43,500.00. However, Tucay was not deployed to Qatar as promised, instead appellant asked for an additional P5,000.00 from Tucay, Yambao, and Peroche for the issuance of a POEA Certificate. Meanwhile, Tucay, Peroche, and Yambao discovered that appellant was not a licensed agent so they reported her to the PNP. During the entrapment operation, Tucay, Yambao, and Peroche met appellant to pay her the additional amounts and they were accompanied by police officers wearing civilian clothes. After Peroche handed appellant the envelope containing the marked money, the police officers arrested appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p> Yambao corroborated the testimony of Tucay to the effect that appellant promised that she would process their job applications for abroad. Yambao paid appellant P37,500.00 as payment for his medical examination and processing fee. Yambao likewise confirmed that appellant demanded from them an additional P5,000.00 for the release of their POEA Certificates. During the entrapment operation, Yambao confirmed that after Peroche paid appellant the marked money, the police officers arrested appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p> PO2 Llacuna and SPO3 Papelleras conducted the entrapment operation against appellant. PO2 Llacuna stated that on 12 May 2009, two (2) pieces of P100.00 bills containing ultraviolet fluorescent powder (marked money) were given to the complainants. The police officers proceeded to Jollibee, Taft Avenue corner Pedro Gil Street, Manila (Jollibee Pedro Gil) for the operation. He was assigned as the perimeter backup and was in uniform while three (3) police officers wearing civilian clothes were inside Jollibee Pedro Gil. When SPO3 Papelleras gave the pre-arranged signal, he went inside Jollibee Pedro Gil and assisted in the arrest of appellant. Appellant was brought to the crime laboratory where her hands yielded positive results for the presence of ultraviolet fluorescent powder, the same substance used on the marked money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p> SPO3 Papelleras confirmed that an entrapment operation was conducted in Jollibee Pedro Gil. Donning civilian clothes, he observed Tucay, Peroche, and Yambao talking to appellant inside the fast food chain. When Peroche handed the marked money to appellant, he arrested her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p> Finally, the parties stipulated on the testimonies of POEA Rep. Dumigpi and SPO4 Alvaira. As regards POEA Rep. Dumigpi: (a) she was the duly authorized representative of the POEA; and (b) she brought a POEA Certification stating that appellant is neither licensed nor authorized to recruit workers for overseas employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Meanwhile, with regard to SPO4 Alvaira: (a) he was the investigator of the case; (b) he was part of the entrapment operation but was not inside Jollibee Pedro Gil when it transpired; (c) he prepared the marked money; (d) he took and prepared the individual <em>Sinumpaang Salaysay</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the complainants prior to the entrapment operation; (e) he took and prepared the<em> Pinagsamang Sinumpaang Salaysay</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of the complainants; (f) he prepared the booking sheet; and (g) he referred appellant for laboratory examination and thereafter, endorsed the latter for inquest proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p><p> <i>Version of the Defense</i></p><p> The defense presented appellant as the sole witness who interposed the defense of denial and claimed that she, too, was seeking employment abroad.</p><p> Appellant narrated that she met Ramirez at Angelicum Clinic when they were both undergoing medical examination for overseas employment. Thereafter, Ramirez introduced her to Tucay. Tucay and Ramirez had planned to transfer to her agency but this plan did not push through when she was accosted by the PNP-CIDG.</p><p> On the day of the entrapment operation, appellant claimed that she met Tucay and Yambao at Jollibee Pedro Gil. While they were eating, Tucay suddenly shouted, "<i>Hulihin niyo na yan</i>" and the police officers appeared to apprehend her. Appellant was shocked that the complainants identified her as an illegal recruiter. On the way to the police station, a female police officer held her hands, comforting her. Thereafter, she was brought to the crime laboratory for examination. Appellant claimed that she was framed, surmising that the female police officer she met earlier had clandestinely placed ultraviolet fluorescent powder on her hands.</p><p> Finally, appellant denied knowing Magat, claiming that she knew of her as the person who victimized Tucay earlier. She was jobless at that time and was likewise seeking employment abroad and thus, familiar with some of the basic requirements like passport, medical examination, placement fees, and tickets.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b><i>RTC Ruling</i></b> </p><p> On 23 July 2013, the RTC rendered a Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> finding appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and three (3) counts of Estafa. In so ruling, the RTC held that the complainants' positive, consistent, and categorical testimonies as to how appellant defrauded them of their money outweigh appellant's defense of pure denial. Likewise, the RTC noted that appellant never contested that she received money from the complainants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b><i>CA Ruling</i></b> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated 23 August 2017, the CA sustained the judgment of the lower court, stating that the prosecution was able to establish all the elements of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and Estafa beyond reasonable doubt. The CA considered doubtful appellant's defense that she was a fellow aspiring overseas Filipino worker in view of her failure to produce any documentation to that effect. The CA however modified the penalties imposed to properly graduate the same in accordance with the Indeterminate Sentence Law<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and to provide for the imposition of six percent (6%) interest<em> per annum</em> on the civil liabilities awarded. </p><p> Upon Motion for Reconsideration,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> appellant prayed, among others, the application of the provisions of RA 10951<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which effectively reduced the penalty imposed for the crime of Estafa based on the amount involved.</p><p> On 30 January 2018, the appellate court rendered the Amended Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which partially granted appellant's Motion and reduced the penalty of imprisonment for the three (3) counts of Estafa in view of RA 10951, the dispositive portion of which reads: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, the Motion for Reconsideration filed by Ernalyn Palicpic y Mendoza alias "Ermalyn Mendoza”, "Lyn", and "Malyn" is<strong> PARTLY GRANTED.</strong></p> <p> Accordingly, the Decision dated August 23, 2017 of this Court: (1) finding accused-appellant Ernalyn Palicpic y Mendoza alias "Ermalyn Mendoza". "Lyn", and "Malyn"' GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of illegal recruitment in large scale and sentencing accused-appellant to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of five hundred thousand pesos (PhP500,000.00) in Criminal Case No. 10-276564; (2) finding accused-appellant GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of estafa as defined and punished under Article 315(2)(a) of the Revised Penal Code in Criminal Case No. 10-276565 and ordering accused-appellant to indemnify private complainant Christopher C.

Ramirez, Jr. the amount of thirty-four thousand pesos (Php34,00.00); and (5) imposing interest at the rate of 6% <em>per annum</em> on the civil liabilities awarded, to be computed from the finality of the Decision until such amounts are fully paid, is <strong>AFFIRMED</strong> with the following <strong>MODIFICATIONS</strong>:</p> <p> 1. In Criminal Case No. 10-276565, accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to suffer the straight penalty of imprisonment of four (4) months and one (1) day of <em>arresto mayor</em>.</p> <p> 2. In Criminal Case No. 10-276566, accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of three (3) months of <em>arresto mayor</em>, as minimum, to one (1) year and eight (8) months of <em>prision correccional</em> as maximum.</p> <p> 3. In Criminal Case No. 10-276568, accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to suffer the straight penalty of imprisonment of four (4) months and one (1) day of <em>arresto mayor</em>.</p> <p> <strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b><i>The Issue</i></b> </p><p>Whether the guilt of appellant for the crimes of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and Estafa were proven beyond reasonable doubt. </p><p align="center"><b><i>The Court's Ruling</i></b> </p><p>After a judicious study of the case, the Court resolves to dismiss the appeal for failure of appellant to sufficiently show that the CA committed any reversible error in rendering the Amended Decision as to warrant the exercise of the Court's appellate jurisdiction. Thus, the Court sustains appellant's conviction for Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and three (3) counts of Estafa. However, the Court deems it proper to further modify the penalties for Estafa in view of the Indeterminate Sentence Law. </p><p> The offense of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale has the following elements: (1) the person charged undertook any recruitment activity as defined under Section 6 of RA 8042; (2) accused did not have the license or the authority to lawfully engage in the recruitment of workers; and (3) accused committed the same against three or more persons individually or as a group.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p> These elements are obtaining in this case.</p><p> <em>First</em>, the RTC found appellant to have undertaken a recruitment activity without having the requisite license and/or authority when she promised the complainants employment in Qatar for a fee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> This factual finding was affirmed by the CA who observed that: </p><blockquote> <p> A thorough examination of the evidence on record reveals that the prosecution clearly established that accused-appellant represented herself to be a licensed agent of the local manning agency named Pert/CPM Manpower Exponents Company Incorporated x x x. Accused-appellant induced, offered, and promised Edgardo Ramirez, Mary Ann Tucay, and Christopher Yambao ("private complainants", collectively) employment in Qatar - Ramirez would be hired as a waiter, Tucay would be hired as a receptionist, and Yambao would be hired as a mechanical engineer. Private complainants were convinced and made to believe that accused-appellant was authorized to hire them and capable of sending them to Qatar. Accused-appellant took the resumes, medical examination results, and other documentation from Ramirez, Tucay, and Yambao, promising that accused-appellant would be the one to process their applications. In the guise of processing their applications, accused-appellant asked for sums of money from private complainants. x x x Despite receiving sums of money from private complainants, accused-appellant did not issue any receipts. However, private complainants were not deployed to Qatar. This prompted Ramirez, Yambao, and another aspiring applicant, Richard Peroche, to verify with the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) whether accused-appellant had a license to recruit. They discovered that accused-appellant was neither licensed nor authorized to recruit workers for overseas employment, as evinced by the POEA Certification dated May 24, 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> As consistently adhered to by this Court, the matter of assigning values to declarations on the witness stand is best and most competently performed by the trial judge,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> who had the unmatched opportunity to observe the witnesses and to assess their credibility by the various<em> indicia</em> available but not reflected on the record. When such findings have been affirmed by the CA, these are generally binding and conclusive upon the Court. This attains more significance in this case as appellant's bare denial cannot prevail over the positive and categorical testimonies<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> of Ramirez, Tucay, and Yambao. Absent any evidence that the complainants were motivated by improper motives, the trial court's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses shall not be interfered with by this Court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> as in this case.</p><p> <em>Second</em>, the Certification issued by the POEA unmistakably reveals that appellant neither had the license nor the authority to recruit workers for overseas employment. This fact was stipulated upon by the defense when the testimony of POEA Rep. Dumigpi was dispensed with. <em>Third</em>, there are at least three (3) victims in this case which makes appellant liable for large-scale illegal recruitment. Clearly, the existence of the offense of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale was duly proven by the prosecution.</p><p> Meanwhile, the elements of Estafa as charged are, namely: (1) the accused defrauded another by abuse of confidence or by means of deceit; and (2) the offended party, or a third party suffered damage or prejudice capable of pecuniary estimation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The active representation by appellant of having the capacity to deploy Ramirez, Tucay, and Yambao abroad despite not having the authority or license to do so from the POEA constituted deceit as the first element of Estafa. Her representation induced the complainants to part with their money, resulting in damage that is the second element of the Estafa. Considering that the damage resulted from the deceit, the CA's affirmance of her guilt for Estafa as charged was in order.</p><p> Appellant's argument that there was no proof that she received money from the complainants deserves no credence. Suffice it to say that money is not material to a prosecution for illegal recruitment considering that the definition of "illegal recruitment" under the law includes the phrase "whether for profit or not."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Besides, even if there is no receipt for the money given by the complainants to appellant, the former's respective testimonies and affidavits clearly narrate the latter's involvement in the prohibited recruitment.</p><p> <i>Penalties</i></p><p> Finally, as to the penalties imposed, the CA was correct in applying the provisions of RA 10951 to the imposable penalties for Estafa based on the amount defrauded in its Amended Decision. However, the Court deems it proper to further modify the penalties to properly apply the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law. Settled is the rule that an appeal in a criminal case throws the entire case wide open for review and confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine the records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p>The defrauded amounts involved in this case are: P43,500.00 in <em>Criminal Case No. 10-276566</em>; P37,500.00<em> in Criminal Case No. 10-276565</em>; and P34,000.00 in <em>Criminal Case No. 10-276568. </em> </p><p> Under RA 10951,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> when the amount involved is over P40,000.00 but not exceeding P1,200,000.00, the prescribed penalty is only <em>arresto mayor</em>, in its maximum period to <em>prision correccional</em>, in its minimum period, <em>i.e.</em>, four (4) months and one (1) day to two (2) years and four (4) months. However, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum term should be taken from <em>arresto mayor</em>, in its minimum and medium periods,<em> i.e</em>., one (1) month and one (1) day to four (4) months, while the maximum term should be within the medium period of the prescribed penalty, <em>i.e</em>., one (1) year and one (1) day to one (1) year and eight (8) months there being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances present in this case. Thus, the Court finds it proper to impose a penalty of four (4) months of <em>arresto mayor</em>, as minimum, to one (1) year and one (1) month of <em>prision correccional</em>, as maximum.</p><p> On the other hand, if the amount involved is less than P40,000.00, the imposable penalty is only <em>arresto mayor</em>, in its medium and maximum periods, i.e., two (2) months and one (1) day to six (6) months, as is applicable to Criminal Case Nos. 10-276565 and 10-276568. The provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law no longer apply because the imposable penalty is less than one (1) year. Thus, a straight penalty of six (6) months of <em>arresto mayor</em>, in its maximum period is proper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
