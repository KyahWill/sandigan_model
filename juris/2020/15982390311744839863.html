Thereafter, petitioner filed his Reply to "Consolidated Opposition to Accused Canlas' Separate Motions to Quash Information"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated August 11, 2017.<br><br>In its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated September 25, 2017, the Sandiganbayan denied the two motions to quash information.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated September 25, 2017, but this was denied by he Sandiganbayan in its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated November 20, 2017.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Hence, the petition.<br><br>Petitioner adopts his arguments in the two motions to quash information and argues that as a private individual, he can only be held liable under Section 4(b) of RA 3019.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Moreover, Section 3 of RA 3019 applies only to public officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Since the Informations did not allege that he committed the acts provided under Section 4, the Informations should be quashed under Section 3(a), Rule 117 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Petitioner maintains that while the prosecution alleged that the accused public officers acted in conspiracy with him, conspiracy does not make him a public officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further argues that there is not a single case in which a private person was held liable for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 under Section 4(b) of the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Thus, he prays for a reversal, or at least a clarification, of the ruling in several cases decided by the Court to the effect that private individuals may be held liable under Section 3 of RA 3019 if they act in conspiracy with public officers. Pursuant to Sections 3(h) and 3(m), Rule 2 of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court (A.M. No. 10-4-20-SC), the petition falls within the responsibility of the Court <i>En Banc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Lastly, he prays for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) to restrain the Sandiganbayan from holding further proceedings in the two cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and the setting aside of the Resolutions dated September 25, 2017 and November 20, 2017 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case Nos.

Moreover, the Court does not find the need to revisit the doctrine that private individuals may be held liable under Section 3(e) of RA 3019 if they act in conspiracy with public officers.<br><br>The well-settled rule is that "private persons, when acting in conspiracy with public officers, may be indicted and, if found guilty, held liable for the pertinent offenses <i>under Section 3 of RA 3019</i>, in consonance with the avowed policy of the anti-graft law to repress certain acts of public officers and private persons alike constituting graft or corrupt practices act or which may lead thereto."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In <i>PCGG v. Office of the Ombudsman</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court reiterated the well-settled elements of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 as follows: (i) that the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions, <i>or a private individual acting in conspiracy with such public officers</i>; (ii) that he acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence; and (iii) that his action caused any undue injury to any patty, including the government, or giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his functions.<br><br>The Court, in various cases, had the occasion to affirm the indictment and/or conviction of a private individual, acting in conspiracy with public officers, for violation of Section 3 of RA 3019 particularly paragraph (e) thereof.<br><br>Thus, in <i>Go v. The Fifth Division, Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> while the issue therein was whether a private individual may be charged with violation of Section 3(g) of RA 3019, the Court discussed and relied on <i>Singian, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan</i> (<i>Third Division</i>)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (<i>Singian, Jr.</i>) to rule in the affirmative.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In <i>Singian, Jr.</i> , Gregorio Singian, Jr., therein petitioner, a private individual who was then the Executive Vice President of Integrated Shoe, Inc. (ISI), was charged together with some officers of the Philippine National Bank (PNB) with violation of both paragraphs (e) and (g), Section 3 of RA 3019 in connection with the loan accommodations extended by PNB to ISI which were characterized as behest loans.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The Court ruled that the Ombudsman and the Sandiganbayan did not commit grave abuse of discretion when they respectively found probable cause against Singian, Jr. for violation of both paragraphs (e) and (g), Section 3 of RA 3019.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Further, in <i>Uyboco vs. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the Court discussed the criminal liability of Edelbert C. Uyboco (Uyboco), a private individual who acted in conspiracy with his co-accused public officer in the procurement of overpriced dump trucks.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The Court affirmed his conviction by the Sandiganbayan under Section 3(e) of RA 3019.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Similarly, in <i>PCGG v. Navarra-Gutierrez, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the Presidential Commission on Good Governance filed an Affidavit-Complaint against private respondents who were former officers/stockholders of National Galleon Shipping Corporation (Galleon), together with the public respondents who were former officers/directors of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), for violation of Section 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019 in connection with the loans/accommodations obtained by Galleon from DBP which possessed the characteristics of behest loans.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Reversing the Office of the Ombudsman's ruling, the Court ruled that there was probable cause to indict the private respondents and the public respondents for violation of Section 3(e) and (g) of RA 3019.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Given the foregoing pronouncements, the petition, together with the prayer therein that the case be referred to the Court <i>En Banc</i> and that a TRO be issued, should be denied.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
