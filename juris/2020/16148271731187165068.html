The [MC 174] itself does not provide for the amount of financial subsidy x x x. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has not issued a set of guidelines on the implementation of the said [MC 174]. Hence, considering that water districts generate their own income, it is our view that the Board has sufficient discretion and authority to determine the amount of the financial subsidy .that it will grant through a board resolution, subject to the availability of funds. It is noted though that the financial subsidy is intended to support the Botika ng Bayan, and thus, would presumably be for the purpose of purchasing medicines.<br><br>We likewise answer your second query [nature of benefits enumerated under MC 174] in the affirmative. Financial subsidies given pursuant to [MC 174] may be classified as "<i>de minimis</i>" benefits which are not subject to withholding tax on compensation pursuant to Section 2.78.1 (B) (11) (b) of Revenue Regulation No. 2-98. These are being given to address the needs of government employees in the midst of the present global economic crisis, thus:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As to your third query [frequency of grant], [MC 174] is likewise silent as to how often a GOCC may grant the financial subsidy. Hence, unless the Office of the President or the DBM will issue guidelines in the implementation thereof, it is our considered view that there are no legal objections if ZCWD were to adopt its own guidelines on the frequency of the grants, which as mentioned earlier, would be subject to availability of funds.<br><br>Please be guided accordingly. <br>&nbsp;<table =""="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr> <td width="70%"> <br></td><td width="30%"><div align="center">Very truly yours, </div></td> </tr><tr><td><br></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><br></td> <td><div align="center">(signed)</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><br></td> <td><div align="center">ALBERTO C.

In disallowing the payment of financial subsidy amounting to P5,127,523.00, COA further explained:<br><blockquote>[MC 174] particularly item no. 2 of the above paragraph cannot be used as the legal basis for the payment of such benefit since the "financial subsidy" meant monetary assistance to the Botica ng Bayan and not to the employees of the agency. The MC did not specifically mention that financial assistance shall be given to the employees, The phrase "financial subsidy" should not be taken out of context.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>It found all ZCWD officers and employees who received the financial subsidy liable for the disallowance and ordered them to refund the amounts so received.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Consequently, ZCWD appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the disallowance to the COA Regional Director.<br><br><center><i>Ruling of the COA Regional Director</i><br></center><br>In Decision No. 2012-12<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated February 6, 2012, COA Regional Director Roberto T.

It held that, contrary to the mandate of ZCWD Board Resolution No. 206, MC 174 did not authorize any direct payment to the employees. The COA Proper discussed as follows:<br><blockquote>This Commission concurs with the interpretation of the [Audit Team Leader]. Contrary to the assertion of the Petitioners, [MC 174] does not suggest chat the financial subsidy should be paid directly to the employees. The more plausible conclusion is to direct the payment of financial subsidy to the Botika ng Bayan; otherwise, the phrase "to make Botika ng Bayan more accessible" should not have been added in the first place Moreover, the financial subsidy is intended to make the Botika ng Bayan more accessible to the government employees. If payment of financial subsidy should be made directly to the employees, as suggested by the Petitioners, the money received may not necessarily he used to purchase medicines or to purchase them from the Botika ag Bayan. This is beyond what is contemplated under [MC 174].<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, ZCWD filed the present petition.<br><br><center><i>Issues</i><br></center><br>In the present case, the Court shall resolve whether the COA Proper gravely abused its discretion when it upheld the disallowance of the financial subsidy amounts paid to ZCWD employees. Petitioner claims that the COA Proper committed grave abuse: (a) in ruling that MC 174 does not authorize direct payment to government employees as it contemplates a financial subsidy directly in favor of the <i>Botika ng Bayan</i>; and (b) in denying their motion for reconsideration by way of a one-page notice without exhaustively resolving the merits thereof, and thus, failing to distinctly state the facts and the law on which it is based.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><center><i>The Court's Ruling</i><br></center><br>The petition lacks merit.<br><br>At the onset, the Court emphasizes that Our power to review COA decisions <i>via</i> Rule 54 petitions is limited to <i>jurisdictional errors</i> or <i>grave abuse of discretion</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Court generally upholds the COA's ruling, especially in the clear absence of grave abuse on its part.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>A perusal of the petition reveals that only one issue is a <i>bona fide</i> imputation of grave abuse: that the COA Proper violated the constitutional mandate that all decisions must clearly and distinctly contain its factual and legal bases. Petitioners point out that the COA Proper resolved ZCWD's motion for reconsideration of its Decision dated August 28, 2014 only "by way of a one-page notice, which does not exhaustively resolve the merits presented."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The Court disagrees with petitioners.<br><br>Verily, it is recognized in jurisprudence that the constitutional rule requiring a clear and distinct statement of factual and legal basis of a resolution/decision is an indispensable component of the litigant's right to due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Violation thereof amounts to grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>However, the mere brevity of the COA Proper's resolution does not equate to grave abuse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> To recall, the COA Proper denied ZCWD's motion "<i>for failure to raise new matter</i>[<i>s</i>] <i>or show sufficient ground, to justify reconsideration of the assailed</i> [<i>d</i>]<i>ecision</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This reasoning sufficiently justifies its denial.<br><br>Notably, ZCWD offered no new arguments and alleged no novel facts in its motion. The COA Proper already found these unmeritorious. Thus, it did not need to reevaluate the same antecedents, issues, and evidence it previously passed upon in the decision sought to be reconsidered and reiterate the very same findings and legal justifications in an exhaustive resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>That being said, the remaining issue raised in the present petition are not averments of grave abuse of discretion against the COA. At best, the errors imputed upon the COA Proper are merely <i>errors of judgment</i> that cannot be remedied <i>via certiorari</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> To be sure, petitioner bears the burden of proving "not merely reversible error"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> committed by the COA Proper, but "<i>such a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In any case, after a careful review of the records, the Court finds that the disallowance of financial subsidy paid to ZCWD employees was proper. <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="20%"><div align="justify"><em>MC 174 prescribes the grant of financial subsidy directly to government employees.</em></div></td><td width="80%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>The mandate of MC 174 is clear which is "to provide the following [benefits] <i>to</i> [<i>government</i>] <i>employees</i>." One of these benefits is the crux of the present controversy: the provision of a "financial subsidy or other needed support to make the <i>Botika ng Bayan more accessible to them</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The COA, through the Office of the Solicitor General, argues that the circular could not have intended the financial subsidy to be given directly to the employees. Otherwise, "<i>the money received may not</i> [<i>be necessarily</i>] <i>used to purchase</i> [<i>medicine</i>] <i>from</i> [<i>the</i>] <i>Botika ng Bayan, or, worse, may be used to purchase things other than</i> [<i>medicine</i>]."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The Court does not subscribe to this interpretation.<br><br>The circular's plain meaning instructs government agencies to give certain benefits (<i>i.e.</i>, shuttle service, financial subsidy, scholarship programs, PX mart) for the direct enjoyment and consumption of its employees. As clear as it is, the circular "<i>must be given its literal meaning and applied without attempted interpretation</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> That the employees will use the financial subsidy for some other purpose when it is paid directly to them is both specious and speculative.<br><br>Thus, the grant of the subject financial subsidy directly to ZCWD employees finds basis on MC 174. Having been authorized by law, this grant did not violate the 2009 GAA.<br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="20%"><div align="justify"><em>ZCWD Board Resolution No. 206 was issued ultra vires.</em></div></td><td width="80%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>While MC 174 prescribes the provision of a financial subsidy directly to government employees, it did not mention the amount thereof. In the present case, the Board, through Board Resolution No. 206,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> <i>effectively took upon itself to fix the financial subsidy at an amount equal to one-month's salary</i>.<br><br>However, they were not free to determine the amount to be given to ZCWD employees. That the circular was silent as to the financial subsidy amount cannot be construed as a government instrumentality's implied authority to fix it on its own.<br><br>To be sure, ZCWD Board has no authority to fill in the details of what MC 174 may have been lacking. Verily, the Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973 empowers the boards of local water districts such as ZCWD to promulgate rules and regulations. However, their rule-making power shall be limited to setting policies in relation to "<i>local water supply and wastewater disposal systems x x x to achieve national goals and the objective of providing public waterworks services to the greatest number at least cost</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>As things presently stand, there is no law supporting the Board's self-determination of the financial subsidy amount. Thus, their decision to grant and pay the subject financial subsidy was made <i>ultra vires</i>, which renders the subsequent disbursement illegal.<br><br>Parenthetically, even the amount so granted by the Board—a full month's salary—finds no basis in law. <i>First</i>, MC 174 granted the financial subsidy to enable government employees to gain more access to the <i>Botika ng Bayan</i> and to <i>low-cost</i> medicine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> A month's salary, especially those received by high-ranking officials, appears to be disproportionate to the medicine purchases envisioned by the circular and incoherent to its overall objective. <i>Second</i>, the subject subsidy may be considered as a form of medical benefit, which is typically subject to the limits set by applicable laws. Letter of Implementation No. 97, s. 1979,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> for instance, provides a cap of "P2,500.00 <i>per annum</i> per official/employee."<br><br>Thus, even if the Court brushes aside the <i>ultra vires</i> character of Board Resolution. No. 206, the subject disbursement may still be disallowed for being unnecessary<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and/or excessive.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><i>The Board did not act in good faith.</i><br><br>The Court also does not find merit in the Board's claim that they acted in good faith because they merely relied on the OGCC opinion seemingly allowing them to proceed with the financial subsidy's payout.<br><br>Their good faith is negated by their decision to issue the subject resolution and internal guidelines instructing the financial subsidy disbursement <i>without even bothering to wait for the formal issuance of OGCC's opinion</i>. The facts reveal that by the time the OGCC had issued its opinion, the Board had already completed the disbursement. In other words, the opinion was already rendered obsolete by the Board's premature actions. Any reliance on the belated OGCC opinion could only be discounted as mere afterthoughts.<br><br>All told, that they sought to clarify with the OGCC the manner by which MC 174 should be implemented only shows that the Board was well-aware of its ambiguity. However, instead of remaining prudent by simply awaiting implementing rules expressly providing the amount of financial subsidy to be granted under MC 174, the Board proceeded to grant and pay the benefits on its own.<br><br><i>Liability&nbsp; for&nbsp; disallowed amount.</i><br><br>Following the guidelines laid down in <i>Madera v.
