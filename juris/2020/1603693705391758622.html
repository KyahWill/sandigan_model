Respondent COA-CP alleges that the instant Petition was belatedly filed because as per records, a copy of the December 27, 2016 Resolution was earlier served at the address of record of petitioner's counsel by personal service on January 17, 2017, and again, by registered mail on January 26, 2017; that said copy was not received by petitioner's counsel because she had already moved out; and that a certified true copy of the Decision was resent to petitioner's counsel at her new address only because of her letter belatedly informing respondent COA-CP of the change of address.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Petitioner, on the other hand, counters that in the absence of proof, such as an affidavit attesting that a copy of the December 27, 2016 Resolution was indeed served on her counsel on January 17, 2017 through personal service, and again, on January 26, 2017 through registered mail, the reckoning of the period to file the instant Petition should be March 13, 2017, the actual date of receipt of her counsel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> She also claims that a mere photocopy of the logbook<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of respondent COA-CP indicating that service was made on her counsel on January 17, 2017, and again, on January 26, 2017 will not suffice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The Court sides with respondent COA-CP.<br><br>In the case of <i>Gatmaytan v. Sps. Dolor</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the Court gave no credence to the allegation of the petitioner that her counsel received a copy of the decision on a later date for lack of evidentiary basis. In that case, the petitioner claimed that the Court of Appeals erroneously reckoned the date of service on an earlier date as the service on that date was ineffectual having been made on her counsel's former address. Though the Court, in that case, found that the service earlier made to petitioner's counsel was indeed ineffectual, it nevertheless affirmed the dismissal of the appeal due to the failure of the petitioner to discharge the burden of proving the actual date of receipt of her counsel. The Court emphasized that the burden of proving a fact lies on the party who alleges it and that mere allegation does not suffice.<br><br>Similarly, in this case, petitioner contends that the counting of the period should commence on March 13, 2017 in the absence of proof that service was made on January 17 and 26, 2017. Petitioner, however, fails to realize that the burden of proving the timeliness of the instant Petition lies with her,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> not respondent COA-CP. It is incumbent upon her to prove, first, that the service made on her counsel's former address was ineffectual because her counsel was able to promptly inform respondent COA-CP of her change of address, and second, that her counsel received the December 27, 2016 Resolution only on March 13, 2017. These she failed to do.<br><br>It bears stressing that "in the absence of a proper and adequate notice to the court of a change of address, the service of the order or resolution of a court upon the parties must be made at the last address of their counsel of record."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Hence, in case there is a change in address, it is the duty of the lawyer to promptly inform the court and the parties of such change to ensure that all official and judicial communications sent by mail will reach him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Here, based on the letters<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> attached to her Compliance, it appears that petitioner's counsel belatedly informed respondent COA-CP of her change of address. Thus, the service made by respondent COA-CP on January 17 and 26, 2017 at the old address of petitioner's counsel are deemed valid and effectual.<br><br>Besides, even if the Court disregards this procedural defect or lapse in the interest of substantial justice, the Petition would still be dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br><b><i>Due process</i></b><br><br>Invoking her right to due process, petitioner puts in issue the failure of respondent COA-CP to promptly resolve her case within the prescribed period under the Constitution as it took respondent COA-CP thirteen (13) years before finally deciding the case on December 13, 2011,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> She likewise maintains that she was deprived of due process because she was not given copies of the documents used by the Technical Services Office of the Commission to allow her to properly and intellectually prepare her pleadings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The essence of due process, as the Court has consistently ruled, is simply the opportunity to be heard, or to explain one's side, or to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of; thus, for as long as the party was afforded the opportunity to defend himself/herself, there is due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Here, as aptly pointed out by respondent COA-CP, petitioner was not denied due process as she was able to exhaust all legal remedies available to her and that she was informed of the basis of the disallowance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> As to the length of time that the case was pending before respondent COA-CP, this does not in any way affect the validity of the ND.<br><br>As to the fact that petitioner was not furnished authenticated copies of the source documents, this no longer has any bearing on the instant Petition considering that respondent COA-CP, in its December 13, 2011 Decision, already reconsidered the disallowed amounts of P639,523.72, representing the excess contract costs of Phase II, and P80,781.62, representing the excess contract cost for Variation Order No. 1, for failure of the audit team to comply with COA Memorandum No. 97-012 dated March 31, 1997, which requires that copies of the documents establishing the audit findings of over-pricing should be made available to the management of the audited agency in the interest of fairness, transparency and due process.<br><br><b><i>Liability for the disallowed amounts</i></b><br><br>Citing the ruling of the Court in <i>Arias v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> petitioner also insists that she should not be held liable for the disallowed amounts considering that she merely relied on the findings of those under her and the expertise of those in-charge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> She also avers that she should not be held liable in the absence of negligence or bad faith on her part.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's reliance on the <i>Arias</i> case is misplaced.<br><br>To begin with, the case of <i>Arias</i> is a criminal case for violation of Section 3, paragraph (e), of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, in connection with the overpricing of a land purchased by the government as a right of way for its <i>Manggahan</i> Floodway Project in Pasig, Rizal.<br><br>Second. The factual milieus therein are not in all fours with the instant case. In that case, Arias, the auditor who approved in audit the acquisition and payment of the lands, was acquitted by the Court because it found no other ground to sustain a conspiracy charge except for his mere signature or approval appearing on a voucher. In acquitting Arias, the Court took into consideration the fact that he joined the office only after the properties were purchased and the fact that he had no choice but to rely on his subordinates given the volume of documents involved in that case.<br><br>The instant case, on the other hand, involves a disallowance. And unlike in <i>Arias</i>, petitioner herein was the Administrator when the public bidding was conducted up to the time when the payment was issued to Argus. Hence, petitioner cannot evade liability.<br><br>Neither can petitioner claim that there was no negligence or bad faith on her part considering that there were blatant violations of the rules on public bidding, which petitioner as Administrator should have been aware of. As found by respondent COA-CP, the following violations were committed:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>The BAC pre-qualified Argus to participate in the bidding when it was apparent in its license with the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board that it was under the "small" category with allowable range of contract cost up to P3,000,000.00 only.<br><br></li><li>The BAC did not declare a failure of bidding when the bids offered by the three bidders exceeded the AAE for the project.<br><br></li><li>The BAC simply negotiated with the lowest bidder among the three bidders, to lower its bids to conform to the AAE with certain conditions and ultimately recommended the award of the contract for the project to Argus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br><br>Aside from these violations, respondent COA-CP also found that Argus did not actually lower its bid from P16,578,757.00 to P13,187,162.90 as the difference of P3,391,594.10 matched the cost of the materials supplied by IA as requested by Argus.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Finally, regarding the remaining disallowance in the total amount of P1,607,880.66, the Court finds the same in order. The amount of P1,016,621.16, representing the cost of construction materials supplied by IA was disallowed because this was included in the bill of materials but not deducted from the payment made to the contractor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> As to the amount of P591,259.50, this was disallowed due to mathematical error and unsupported claim in Variation Order No. 1.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In view of the foregoing, no grave abuse of discretion can be imputed to respondent COA-CP as to its finding that petitioner is one of those liable for the disallowed amount.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Petition is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b>.
