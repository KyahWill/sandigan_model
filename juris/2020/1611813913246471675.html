Contrary to the OSG's claim, Kepco paid 40% of the basic tax assessed for TYs 2006, 2007 and 2009 in the amount of P143,891,831.90. In compliance with the recommendation of the Technical Working Group (TWG) of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to increase the compromise offer, Kepco paid additional amounts and finalized the compromise offer to P260,848,425.80. This amount was approved by the NEB on December 11, 2017.<br><br>Meanwhile, the CIR filed his own Reply<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> to the OSG's Comment. The CIR asserts that Kepco paid the full 40% of the basic tax assessed for TYs 2006, 2007 and 2009 when it applied for compromise. In consonance with Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 20-2007,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the application was evaluated and processed, the LT Enforcement Collection Division recommended the approval of Kepco's application and thereafter, forwarded the favorable recommendation to Large Taxpayers Service (LTS)-Evaluation Board. After various proposals from the LTS-Evaluation Board to increase the compromise amount and the immediate compliance of Kepco by paying the proposed increase, the LTS-Evaluation Board recommended the approval of the application to the NEB based on doubtful validity. Eventually, the NEB approved Kepco's application and the CIR issued Certificate of Availment in its favor.<br><br><center><b>Ruling</b></center><br><br>There is no dispute that Kepco entered into a compromise agreement with the CIR on its deficiency taxes for TY 2006, and the CIR issued Certificate of Availment on December 11, 2017.

However, the OSG opposed the motion and questioned the validity of the compromise alleging irregularity in the procedure that led to its approval.<br><br>We grant the motion and rule in favor of the compromise.<br><br>The power of the CIR to enter into compromise agreements for deficiency taxes is explicit in Section 204(A)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> as amended (1997 NIRC). The CIR may compromise an assessment when a reasonable doubt as to the validity of the claim against the taxpayer exists, or the financial position of the taxpayer demonstrates a clear inability to pay the tax.<br><br>In this regard, the BIR issued RR No. 30-2002, as amended by RR No. 08-2004, which enumerates the bases for acceptance of the compromise settlement on the ground of doubtful validity, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 3. <i>Basis For Acceptance of Compromise Settlement.</i> â&nbsp; x x x<br><br>1. <i>Doubtful validity of the assessment.</i> â The offer to compromise a delinquent account or disputed assessment under these Regulations on the ground of reasonable doubt as to the validity of the assessment may be accepted when it is shown that:<br><br><blockquote>(a) The delinquent account or disputed assessment is one resulting from a jeopardy assessment x x x; or<br><br>(b) The assessment seems to be arbitrary in nature, appearing to be based on presumptions and there is reason to believe that it is looking in legal and/or factual basis; or<br><br>(c) The taxpayer failed to file an administrative protest on account of the alleged failure to receive notice of assessment and there is reason to believe that the assessment is lacking in legal and/or factual basis; or<br><br>(d) The taxpayer failed to file a request for reinvestigation/ reconsideration within 30 days from receipt of final assessment notice and there is reason to believe that the assessment is lacking in legal and/or factual basis; or<br><br>(e) The taxpayer failed to elevate to the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) an adverse decision of the Commissioner, or his authorized representative, in some cases, within 30 days from receipt thereof and there is reason to believe that the assessment is lacking in legal and/or factual basis; or<br><br>(f) The assessments were issued on or after January 1, 1998, where the demand notice allegedly failed to comply with the formalities prescribed under Sec. 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997; or<br><br>(g) Assessments made based on the "Best Evidence Obtainable Rule" and there is reason to believe that the same can be disputed by sufficient and competent evidence; or<br><br>(h) The assessment was issued within the prescriptive period for assessment as extended by the taxpayer's execution of Waiver of the Statute of Limitations the validity or authenticity of which is being questioned or at issue and there is strong reason to believe and evidence to prove that it is not authentic; or<br><br>(i) The assessment is based on an issue where a court of competent jurisdiction made an adverse decision against the Bureau, but for which the Supreme Court has not decided upon with finality.</blockquote></blockquote><br><br>Kepco's case falls under paragraph e â the assessment became final because Kepco failed to appeal the inaction or "deemed denial" of the CIR to the CTA within 30 days after the expiration of the 180-day period and there is reason to believe that the assessment is lacking in legal and/or factual basis.<br><br>It must be noted that when Kepco filed its protest to the FLD on November 26, 2009, the CIR had 180 days or until May 25, 2010 to act on the protest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Thereafter, Kepco may elevate its protest to the CTA within 30 days from the lapse of the 180-day period,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> or until June 24, 2010. Section 7(a)(2)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of RA No. 9282<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> provides that the "inaction" of the CIR or his failure to decide a disputed assessment within the 180-day period is "deemed a denial" of the protest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Section 3(a)(2),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Rule 4 of the Revised Rules of the CTA further clarifies that "that in case of disputed assessments, the inaction of the [CIR] within the [180]-period under [Section] 228 of the [1997 NIRC] shall be deemed a denial for purposes of allowing the taxpayer to appeal his case to the [CTA]." Clearly, the <i>inaction</i> is deemed an <i>adverse decision</i> of the CIR on the administrative protest. Thus, for purposes of determining whether taxpayers may already appeal to the CTA, the <i>inaction</i> of the CIR within 180 days shall be<i> deemed denial</i> or an <i>adverse decision</i> of the CIR. Since Kepco failed to appeal the <i>inaction</i> or <i>deemed denial</i> or <i>adverse decision</i> of the CIR on June 24, 2010, the assessment for deficiency VAT and FWT for TY 2006 became final, executory and demandable.<br><br>As to whether the CIR properly accepted Kepco's offer for a compromise because "the assessment is lacking in legal and/or factual basis," the general rule is that the authority of the CIR to compromise is purely discretionary and the courts cannot interfere with his exercise of discretionary functions, absent grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Here, no grave abuse of discretion exists. Kepco complied with the procedures prescribed under the BIR rules on the application and approval of compromise settlement on the ground of doubtful validity.<br><br>Contrary to the OSG's claim that Kepco did not pay the full amount offered for compromise upon filing of its application, records show that Kepco paid P143,891,831.90<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> representing 40% of the basic tax assessed for TYs 2006, 2007 and 2009 when it applied for compromise on January 19, 2017.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> For TY 2006, which is the subject of the instant case, Kepco paid P40,963,870.63<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (40% of basic deficiency VAT of P102,409,676.58) and P31,783,857.54<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (40% of basic deficiency FWT of P79,459,643.84) on January 19, 2017.

Dulay in compliance with Section 2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> of RR No. 9-2013. Thereafter, the C1R issued Certificate of Availment in favor of Kepco on December 11, 2017.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>A compromise agreement has the effect of <i>res judicata</i> on the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Compromises are generally to be favored and those entered into in good faith cannot be set aside,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> except when there is mistake, fraud, violence, intimidation, undue influence, or falsity of documents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> None of these exceptions obtain in the present case.<br><br>To be sure, Kepco already paid 100% of the basic deficiency VAT and 40% of the basic deficiency FWT for TY 2006 in the aggregate amount of P134,193,534.12, as evidenced by B1R payment forms.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The CIR approved the compromise settlement as early as December 11, 2017. Kepco now only seeks to have the instant case closed and terminated. Thus, to allow the OSG to question the validity of the compromise settlement alleging anomalies in its approval is not only unfair to Kepco and taxpayers alike that entered into compromise agreements in good faith but there will also be no final and definitive settlement of tax compromises. The dissenting opinion of Justice Carpio in <i>PNOC v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> is enlightening:<br><br><blockquote>A compromise agreement constitutes a final and definite settlement of the controversy between the parties. A compromise agreement, even if not judicially approved, has the effect of <i>res judicata</i> on the parties. Article 2037 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>A compromise has upon <i>the parties the effect and authority of resjudicata</i>; but there shall he no execution except in compliance with a judicial compromise. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>The compromise agreement has the force of law between the parties and no party may discard unilaterally the compromise agreement. Under Section 8.1 of RMO No. 39-86, upon payment of the compromise amount, the tax <i>"case is already closed."</i> The Solicitor General, who withdrew as counsel for the BIR, maintains that the compromise agreement is valid.<br><br>Where a party has received the consideration for the compromise agreement, such party is estopped from questioning its terms and asking for the reopening of the case on the ground of mistake. As explained in <i>McCarthy v. Barber Steamship Lines</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><blockquote><i>Hence it is general rule in this country, that compromises are to be favored, without regard to the nature of the controversy compromised</i>, and that they cannot be set aside because the event shows all the gain to have been on one side, and all the sacrifice on the other, if the parties have acted in good faith, and with a belief of the actual existence of the rights which they have respectively waived or abandoned; and if a settlement be made in regard to such subject, free from fraud or mistake, whereby there is a surrender or satisfaction, in whole or in part, of a claim upon one side in exchange for or in consideration of a surrender or satisfaction of a claim in whole or in part, or of something of value, upon the other, however baseless may be the claim upon either side or harsh the terms as to either of the parties, the other cannot successfully impeach the agreement in a court of justice ... Where the compromise is instituted and carried through in good faith, the fact that there was a mistake as to the law or as to the facts, except in certain cases where the mistake was mutual and correctable as such in equity, cannot afford a basis for setting a compromise aside or defending against a suit brought thereon x x x<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>And whether one or the other party understood the law of the case more correctly than the other, cannot be material to the validity of the bargain. For if it were, then it would follow that contracts by the parties settling their own disputes, would at last be made to stand or fall, according to the opinion of the appellate court how the law would have determined it. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>In <i>People v. Magdaluyo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> the BIR Commissioner approved the agreement which compromised the taxpayer's violation of the Tax Code. The taxpayer paid the compromise amount before the filing of the criminal information in court. The Court ruled that the government could no longer prosecute the taxpayer for violation of the Tax Code.<br><br>The same principle holds true in the present case. <b><u>The parties to the compromise agreement have voluntarily settled the tax liability arising from PNB's failure to withhold the final tax on PNOC's interest income. The parties have fully implemented in good faith the compromise agreement. The new BIR Commissioner cannot just annul the legitimate compromise agreements made by his predecessors in the performance of their regular duties where the parties entered into the compromise agreements in good faith and had already fully implemented the compromise agreements.</u></b><br><br><b><u>To rule otherwise would subject the validity and finality of a tax compromise agreement to depend on the different interpretations of succeeding BIR Commissioners. Such lack of finality of tax compromises would discourage taxpayers from entering into tax compromises with the BIR, considering that compromises entail admissions by taxpayers of violations of tax laws.</u></b> A tax compromise cannot be invalidated except in case of mistake, fraud, violence, undue influence, or falsity of documents. Article 2038 of the Civil Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 2038. A compromise in which there is mistake, fraud, violence, intimidation, undue influence, or falsity of documents, is subject to the provisions of Article 1330 of this Code.<br><br><center>x x x x<br>(Emphasis supplied)</center></blockquote><br>Article 1330 of the Civil Code makes compromises tainted with such circumstances voidable. In the present case, there is no mistake because PNOC's delinquent account clearly falls within the coverage of EO No. 44. Also, PNOC clearly filed its application for tax compromise before the deadline. Thus, none of the circumstances that make a compromise voidable is present in this case. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br><br>Indeed, while taxes are the lifeblood of the government, the power of taxation should be "exercised with caution to minimize the proprietary rights of a taxpayer. It must be exercised fairly, equally and uniformly, lest the tax collector kill the "hen that lays the golden egg." x x x [T]o maintain the general public's trust and confidence in the Government this power must be used justly and not treacherously."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> After all, "in balancing the scales between the power of the State to tax and its inherent right to prosecute perceived transgressors of the law on one side, and the constitutional rights of a citizen to due process of law and the equal protection of the laws on the other, the scales must tilt in favor of the individual, for a citizen's right is amply protected by the Bill of Rights under the Constitution."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, we rule that the compromise settlement between Kepco and the CIR is valid. As such, there is nothing left for us to do but to declare the case closed and terminated.<br><br><b><i>The OSG is entitled to 5% of total<br>deficiency taxes paid by Kepco.</i></b><br><br>Finally, records show that the OSG acted as counsel for the BIR in the case proceedings before the CTA Division in CTA Case No. 8112.
