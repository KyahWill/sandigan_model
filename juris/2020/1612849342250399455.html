Accused-appellant treated the siblings kindly at first, but merely a week after, accused-appellant began to sexually abuse AAA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The first incident happened on the first Saturday of June 2009. Accused-appellant called AAA to his room to pluck his gray hair strands. Once inside, he locked the door, made AAA lie down, and ordered her to remove her shirt and shorts. She fearfully obeyed him and did not cry for help because accused-appellant angrily threatened to kill her and her family.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Feeling powerless, she covered her face with a pillow as accused-appellant fondled and sucked her breasts, and licked her private part. Still unsatisfied, accused-appellant inserted his finger into AAA's private part but withdrew the same after AAA pleaded that it was painful.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Thereafter, AAA dressed up and left.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The following Saturday, accused-appellant called AAA again to his room. This time, he wanted her to give him a massage. Upon AAA's entry, he locked the door and kissed her lips. When she said, "[y]ou said, I will just massage,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> he got angry but did not persist, and allowed her to massage him. She left the room once he fell asleep.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>AAA lost count of the instances accused-appellant sexually molested her but remembered that it happened almost every Saturday.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On 02 January 2010, accused-appellant summoned AAA into his store. She fearfully complied and went inside the store. There, accused-appellant kissed her lips, breasts and vagina, then inserted his penis in/into her vagina. AAA felt both pain and anger.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Moments later, accused-appellant's 18-year-old daughter, CCC, arrived and saw them both naked. When CCC asked his father about what happened, the latter got a knife and warned her against reporting the incident to anyone.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> AAA, thereafter, went home and kept the incidents to herself. CCC, on the other hand, mentioned the incident to DDD, another cousin of AAA, which information ultimately led to FFF, AAA's mother.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>FFF immediately fetched her daughters from accused-appellant's house,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and reported the incident to the <i>barangay</i> officials, and police authorities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> FFF also had AAA undergo medical examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Dr. Angelina Celzo (Dr. Celzo) found positive healed lacerations at the 1, 3, 5 and 7 o'clock positions on AAA's hymen and noted that her vagina admitted one (1) finger-breadth with ease. Dr. Celzo opined that the four (4) lacerations were possibly caused by the insertion of a hard, blunt object.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><center><b>Version of the Defense</b></center><br>Accused-appellant denied the charges against him. Although he admitted that AAA and BBB stayed with him and his family, he claimed that he could not have raped AAA in June 2009 as she was no longer staying with them at that time. Also, the alleged rape on 02 January 2010 could not be true because the day before that, he had a drinking session with his friends until 3:00 A.M. the following day. Later that morning, AAA woke him up and prepared him a cup of coffee. She then cuddled with him and sat on his lap when CCC arrived and saw them in that position.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the RTC</b></center><br>On 28 November 2014, the RTC rendered its Joint Judgment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>1.

On the other hand, sexual assault<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> may be committed by either a man or a woman against a man or a woman through the insertion of the penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or the insertion of any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Information charged accused-appellant with rape through carnal knowledge. However, the pieces of evidence disclose that accused-appellant inserted his finger, not his penis, into the vagina of AAA, without her consent. He achieved this by threatening to kill AAA and her family if she did not submit to his bestial desires. It would thus appear that the incident constituted sexual assault as it involved the insertion of an object into AAA's genital orifice. However, accused-appellant cannot be convicted of sexual assault considering that the latter crime has been held not to be included in rape via sexual intercourse given the essential difference in the means of commission (penile penetration v. object penetration).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The foregoing notwithstanding, the Court finds that based on the facts established, accused-appellant may still be convicted of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610.<br><br>As a rule, an accused can only be convicted of the crime with which he or she is charged. This rule proceeds from the constitutional guarantee that an accused shall always be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him or her. An exception to this is the rule on variance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> under Sections 4 and 5, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court, which states:<br><br><center>RULE 120<br><br><i>Judgment</i></center><br><blockquote>Section 4. <i>Judgment in Case of Variance between Allegation and Proof.</i> - When there is variance between the offense charged in the complaint or information and that proved, and the offense as charged is included in or necessarily includes the offense proved, <b>the accused shall be convicted of the offense proved which is included in the offense charged, or of the offense charged which is included in the offense proved.</b><br><br>Sec. 5. <i>When an offense includes or is included in another.</i> — An offense charged necessarily includes the offense proved when some of the essential elements or ingredients of the former, as alleged in the complaint or information, constitute the latter. <b>And an offense charged is necessarily included in the offense proved, when the essential ingredients of the former constitute or form part of those constituting the latter.</b> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>The due recognition of the constitutional right of an accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation through the criminal complaint or information is decisive of whether his or her prosecution for a crime stands or not. The right is not transgressed if the information sufficiently alleges facts and omissions constituting an offense that includes the offense established to have been committed by the accused,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>While the Information in Criminal Case No. P-4356 alleges the elements of rape through sexual intercourse, the prosecution was able to prove during trial that accused-appellant committed lascivious acts against AAA. The kissing of a minor victim's lips, mashing of her breasts and insertion of the offender's finger into the victim's vagina, have been held to constitute lascivious conduct<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> within the purview of Section 2(h) of the Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases, in relation to Section 5(b) of RA 7610, which defines lascivious conduct as:<br><blockquote>[T]he <b>intentional touching,</b> either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, <b>breast,</b> inner thigh, or buttocks, or the <b>introduction of any object into the genitalia,</b> anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of an person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or public area of a person. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>In People v. Caoili<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Court held that an accused may be held guilty of acts of lasciviousness performed on a child, <i>i.e.,</i> lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610, which was the offense proved, because it is included in rape, the offense charged.<br><br>Corollary to this, the case of <i>People v. Tulagan,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> which reconciled the provisions of acts of lasciviousness, rape via carnal knowledge and sexual assault in the RPC, as amended by RA 8353, <i>vis-a-vis</i> RA 7610, this Court reiterated the guidelines it set forth in <i>People v. Caoili</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> in designating or charging the proper offense in case lascivious conduct is committed under Section 5(b) of RA 7610, and in determining the proper penalty, viz:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> The age of the victim is taken into consideration in designating or charging the offense, and in determining the imposable penalty.<br><br></li><li> If the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the nomenclature of the crime should be "Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610." Pursuant to the second <i>proviso</i> in Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, the imposable penalty is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period.<br><br></li><li> If the <b>victim</b> is exactly twelve (12) years of age, or <b>more than twelve (12) but below eighteen (18) years</b> of age, or is eighteen (18) years old or older but is unable to fully take care of herself/himself or protect herself/himself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition, the crime should be designated as <b>"Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610,"</b> and the imposable penalty is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period to <i>redusion perpetua.</i> (Emphasis supplied)</li></ol></blockquote>Since AAA was 13 years old at the time of the commission of the crime, as shown by her birth certificate,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the proper designation of the crime committed is lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610. Thus, in Criminal Case No. P-4356, this Court finds accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the said offense.<br><br><i>The finding of guilt beyond<br>reasonable doubt for the crime of<br>rape under Art. 266-A, in relation to<br>Art. 266-B of the RPC, in Criminal<br>Case No. P-4357 is proper</i><br><br>To obtain a conviction for a charge of rape under Article 266-A (1) of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the prosecution must establish that: (a) the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (b) he accomplished this act under the circumstances mentioned in the provision, e.g., through force, threat or intimidation. The gravamen of rape is sexual intercourse with a woman against her will.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees that the prosecution had adequately proven accused-appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt for rape committed on 02 January 2010. AAA's testimony, corroborated by Dr. Celzo's medical findings, clearly established that accused-appellant had sexual intercourse with AAA, without the latter's consent. Having instilled fear of physical harm against AAA's person and her family, accused-appellant successfully cowed AAA and led her to believe that she had no choice but to do accused-appellant's bidding.<br><br><i>The credibility of AAA is unaffected<br>by trivial inconsistencies and<br>discrepancies in her Sinumpaang<br>Salaysay and testimony in court</i><br><br>We likewise affirm the factual findings and the evaluation of AAA's credibility and testimony in the absence of showing that the lower courts may have overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied any fact or circumstance of weight and substance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> When a woman, especially a minor, alleges rape, she says in effect all that is necessary to mean that she has been raped. Further, youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity. A young girl's revelation that she had been raped, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her dignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as mere fabrication.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant faults the RTC and the CA for giving credence to AAA's testimony, contending that there were discrepancies between AAA's <i>sinumpaang salaysay</i> and testimony, and that her testimony itself also bore inconsistencies and absurdities. He points to the discrepancies given by AAA about the details of her residence at the time of the first incident, the site of second incident, and the exact number of times he allegedly molested her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The Court is not persuaded.<br><br>The claimed discrepancies refer to trivial matters which neither negate nor disprove the commission of the alleged offenses. Accused-appellant himself admitted that his store is merely 15 meters away from AAA's house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Meanwhile, accused-appellant's house is approximately 70 to 100 meters away from AAA's house per AAA and FFF's estimate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Hence, the distance between accused-appellant's house and AAA's house, as well as his store and AAA's house, was not of such nature as to render it impossible for him to commit the subject offenses. Meanwhile, there is no discrepancy as to the exact number of instances accused-appellant raped AAA since the latter candidly admitted in her testimony the fact that she could not remember the precise number of times she was molested but it always happened on a Saturday.<br><br>At any rate, it has been held that discrepancies or inconsistencies between a witness' affidavit and testimony do not necessarily impair the latter's credibility as affidavits are taken <i>ex parte</i> and are often incomplete or inaccurate for lack or absence of searching inquiries by the investigating officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In the event of any inconsistency between a witness' affidavit and testimony in court, as in this case, the latter shall prevail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant also argues that even AAA's testimony is not credible for being riddled with inconsistencies as to where the second incident occurred, whether penetration took place, his reaction when she refused to massage him, and whether AAA indeed feared him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The argument must fail. The inconsistencies pointed out by accused-appellant refer to minor details only, which do not touch upon the central fact of the crime and do not impair AAA's credibility. If at all, they serve as proof that AAA was not coached or rehearsed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><i>AAA's failure to resist or flee from<br>accused-appellant's clutches, and to<br>immediately seek help or report the<br>incident to the authorities, does not<br>impair the truthfulness of her<br>testimony</i><br><br>Lastly, accused-appellant brands as absurd AAA's claim of molestation because she failed to escape from accused-appellant's house after the first rape incident and immediately inform her mother thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>It has been held that the failure of the victims to shout for help or escape during the incident does not impair their credibility. It is not also fatal to the prosecution's case. No standard form of behavior can be anticipated of a rape victim following her defilement, particularly a child who could not be expected to fully comprehend the ways of an adult. People react differently to emotional stress, and rape victims are no different from them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In this case, AAA was only a 13-year[-]old minor at the time of the incidents. Given her tender age, her failure to immediately flee from accused-appellant, by itself, cannot taint her credibility as a rape victim.<br><br>Neither can the delay in reporting the incidents to the proper authorities taint her trustworthiness. A rape charge becomes doubtful only when the delay in revealing its commission is unreasonable and unexplained.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Here, AAA did not immediately report the incidents to her mother considering the moral ascendancy and influence exerted upon her by accused-appellant, whom she relied on for support of her educational needs, as well as accused-appellant's threats of bodily harm against her and her family.<br><br>All the foregoing considered, this Court affirms accused-appellant's conviction for rape through sexual intercourse under Art. 266-A in relation to Art. 266-B of the RPC, amended by RA 8353.<br><br><i>The penalty and awards of damages<br>must be modified in accordance with<br>the recent jurisprudence</i><br><br>The imposable penalty for lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610, in Criminal Case No. P-4356, is <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium to <i>reclusion perpetua.</i> The Indeterminate Sentence Law (ISL) provides that if the crime is punished under a special law, as in this case, the maximum term shall not exceed the maximum fixed by said law and the minimum shall not be less than the minimum term prescribed by the same. Nonetheless, when the crime is defined in a special law but the penalty therefor is taken from the technical nomenclature in the RPC, the legal effects under the system of penalties native to the Code would necessarily apply to the special law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Applying the ISL, accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty often (10) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor,</i> as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal,</i> as maximum. Accused-appellant is further ordered to pay AAA the amounts of Php 50,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php 50,000.00 as moral damages, and Php 50,000.00 as exemplary damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In Criminal Case No. P-4357, the Court finds the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> in order.
