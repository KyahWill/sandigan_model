Hence, they have already attained the status of regular employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p> Ultimately, petitioners argue that, as regular employees, they are accorded the right to security of tenure and, therefore, their dismissal was illegal for want of just or authorized cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In its Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> upon being required to submit by this Court through its April 2, 2018 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> GMA refutes the existence of an employer-employee relationship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It maintains that petitioners were mere "pinch-hitters or relievers" who were engaged to augment its regular crew whenever there is a need for substitute or additional workforce.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p><p> Further, GMA asserts that the "service fees" given to the workers were "not compensation paid to an employee, but rather remuneration for the services rendered" as pinch-hitters/freelancers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Furthermore, GMA also belies the contention that it exercised control over the workers.

Consequently, there exists no obligation on the part of GMA to re-engage them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> For this Court's resolution are the following issues:</p><p> First, whether or not an employer-employee relationship existed between the petitioners and GMA;</p><p> Second—assuming the existence of an employer-employee relationship—whether or not the petitioners are regular employees of GMA;</p><p> Third, assuming regular employment status, whether or not the petitioners were illegally dismissed.</p><p> The petition is meritorious.</p><p align="center"> <b>I</b> </p><p> Labor cases are elevated to this Court through Rule 45 petitions, following Rule 65 petitions decided by the Court of Appeals on rulings made by the National Labor Relations Commission. From this, two (2) chief considerations become apparent: (1) the general injunction that Rule 45 petitions are limited to questions of law; and (2) that the more basic underlying issue is the National Labor Relations Commission's potential grave abuse of its discretion. In labor disputes then, this Court may only resolve the matter of whether the Court of Appeals erred in determining "the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion and deciding other jurisdictional errors of the National Labor Relations Commission."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></p><p> The general limitation on Rule 45 petitions being concerned with questions of law was discussed in <i>Abuda v. L. Natividad Poultry Farms</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> When a decision of the Court of Appeals decided under Rule 65 is brought to this Court through a petition for review under Rule 45, the general rule is that this Court may only pass upon questions of law. <i>Meralco Industrial Engineering Services Corp. v. National Labor Relations Commission</i> emphasized as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p> This Court is not a trier of facts. Well-settled is the rule that the jurisdiction of this Court in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court is limited to reviewing only errors of law, not of fact, unless the factual findings complained of are completely devoid of support from the evidence on record, or the assailed judgment is based on a gross misapprehension of facts. Besides, factual findings of quasi-judicial agencies like the [National Labor Relations Commission], when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are conclusive upon the parties and binding on this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis in the original)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> In addition, <i>E. Ganzon, Inc. v. Ando, Jr</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> citing <i>Montoya v. Transmed</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> is instructive: </p><blockquote> <p> In labor cases. Our power of review is limited to the determination of whether the [Court of Appeals] correctly resolved the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the [National Labor Relations Commission]. The Court explained this in <i>Montoya v. Transmed Manila Corporation</i>:</p> <blockquote> <p> . . . In a Rule 45 review, we consider the correctness of the assailed [Court of Appeals] decision, in contrast with the review for jurisdictional error that we undertake under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed [Court of Appeals] decision. In ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the [Court of Appeals] decision in the same context that the petition for certiorari it ruled upon was presented to it; we have to examine the [Court of Appeals] decision from the prism of whether it correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the [National Labor Relations Commission] decision before it, not on the basis of whether the [National Labor Relations Commission] decision on the merits of the case was correct. In other words, we have to be keenly aware that the [Court of Appeals] undertook a Rule 65 review, not a review on appeal, of the [National Labor Relations Commission] decision challenged before it. This is the approach that should be basic in a Rule 45 review of a [Court of Appeals] ruling in a labor case. In question form, the question to ask is: <i>Did the [Court of Appeals] correctly determine whether the [National Labor Relations Commission] committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling on the case?</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Citation omitted, emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> It has been settled that the National Labor Relations Commission may be found to have committed grave abuse of discretion when its decision does not provide the following, as stated in <i>E. Ganzon, Inc</i>.: </p><blockquote> <p> . . . not supported by substantial evidence or are in total disregard of evidence material to or even decisive of the controversy; when it is necessary to prevent a substantial wrong or to do substantial justice; when the findings of the [National Labor Relations Commission] contradict those of the [Labor Arbiter]; and when necessary to arrive at a just decision of the case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Citation omitted)</p> </blockquote> <p> These parameters shall guide this Court in resolving the substantial issues in the present Petition.</p><p align="center"><b> II</b> </p><p> GMA insists that petitioners were never hired as its employees, "whether probationary, casual[,] or any type of employment.'<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> According to it, petitioners were merely pinch-hitters or freelancers engaged on a per-shoot basis whenever the need for additional workforce arose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p><p> GMA's arguments fail to impress.</p><p> The question of whether an employer-employee relationship existed between petitioners and GMA has already been settled by the consistent rulings of the National Labor Relations Commission and the Court of Appeals. To once and for all put this matter to rest, this Court further clarifies their pronouncements.</p><p> A four-fold test has been applied in determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship. In <i>Begino v. ABS-CBN</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> To determine the existence of [an employer-employee relationship], case law has consistently applied the four-fold test, to wit: (a) <i>the selection and engagement of the employee</i>; (b) the<i> payment of wages</i>; (c) the <i>power of dismissal</i>; and (d) the employer's <i>power to control</i> the employee on the means and methods by which the work is accomplished. Of these criteria, the so-called "<i>control test</i>" <i>is generally regarded as the most crucial and determinative indicator of the presence or absence of an employer-employee relationship</i>. Under this test, an employer-employee relationship is said to exist where the person for whom the services are performed reserves the right to control not only the end result but also the manner and means utilized to achieve the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, to be considered employees of GMA, petitioners must prove the following: (1) that GMA engaged their services; (2) that GMA compensated them; (3) that GMA had the power to dismiss them; and more importantly, (4) that GMA exercised control over the means and methods of their work.</p><p> On the power of hiring, there is no question that petitioners were engaged by and rendered services directly to GMA.

On the other hand, Dumpit-Murillo was hired by ABC as a newscaster and co-anchor.<p> Sonza's <i>talent fee amounted to P317,000.00 per month</i>, which this court found to be a substantial amount that indicated he was an independent contractor rather than a regular employee. Meanwhile, Dumpit-Murillo's monthly salary was P28,000.00, a very low amount compared to what Sonza received.</p><p> Sonza was unable to prove that ABS-CBN could terminate his services apart from breach of contract. There was no indication that he could be terminated based on just or authorized causes under the Labor Code. In addition, ABS-CBN continued to pay his talent fee under their agreement, even though his programs were no longer broadcasted. Dumpit-Murillo was found to have been illegally dismissed by her employer when they did not renew her contract on her fourth year with ABC.</p><p> In Sonza, this court ruled that ABS-CBN <i>did not control how Sonza delivered his lines, how he appeared on television, or how he sounded on radio</i>. All that Sonza needed was his talent. Further, "ABS-CBN could not terminate or discipline SONZA even if the means and methods of performance of his work . . . did not meet ABS-CBN's approval."

Accordingly, they were regular employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> </p><p> Petitioners' assertions are well-taken. </p><p> Classifying employment, that is, whether an employee is engaged as a regular, project, seasonal, casual, or fixed-term employee, is "determined by law, regardless of any contract expressing otherwise."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p><p> Article 295 of the Labor Code identifies four (4) categories of employees, namely: (1) regular; (2) project; (3) seasonal; and (4) casual employees. Furthermore: </p><blockquote> <p> Article 295.

(Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Brent School, Inc. v. Zamora</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> recognized another category: fixed-term employees. Fixed-term employment sanctions the possibility of a purely contractual relationship between the employer and the fixed-term employee, provided that certain requisites are met. Consequently, terms and conditions stipulated in the contract govern their relationship, particularly with respect to the duration of employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> </p><p> Pursuant to Article 295, <i>GMA Network, Inc. v.

(Citation omitted) </blockquote> <p> Here, GMA argues that petitioners should have rendered "at least one (1) year of service equivalent to 313 working days (6-day work per week) or 261 days (5-day work per week)" before they are deemed to have attained regular status.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> It harps on the March 3, 2017 Decision of the Court of Appeals which noted that petitioners cannot be deemed regular employees since they failed to comply with the one-year period supposedly required by law. Quite notably, GMA does not refute the finding that petitioners performed functions necessary and desirable to its usual business, it merely insists on a supposedly requisite duration. </p><p> From the plain language of the second paragraph of Article 295 of the Labor Code,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> it is clear that the requirement of rendering "at least one (1) year of service[,]" before an employee is deemed to have attained regular status, only applies to casual employees. An employee is regarded a casual employee if he or she was engaged to perform functions which are <i>not</i> necessary and desirable to the usual business and trade of the employer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Thus, when one is engaged to perform functions which are necessary and desirable to the usual business and trade of the employer, engagement for a year-long duration is not a controlling consideration. </p><p> GMA's claim that petitioners were required to render at least one (1) year of service before they may be considered regular employees finds no basis in law. Petitioners were never casual employees precisely because they performed functions that were necessary and desirable to the usual business of GMA. They did not need to render a year's worth of service to be considered regular employees. </p><p> Of course, that petitioners performed functions which were necessary and desirable to GMA's usual trade business could nevertheless mean that they were project employees whose engagements were fundamentally time-bound. This Court finds that they were not. </p><p> As opposed to a regular employee, a project employee <i>may or may not</i> perform functions that are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer. This has been extensively discussed in <i>GMA Network, Inc. v. Pabriga</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [T]he activities of project employees <b>may or may not</b> be usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, as we have discussed in <i>ALU-TUCP v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, and recently reiterated in <i>Leyte Geothermal Power Progressive Employees Union-ALU-TUCP v. Philippine National Oil Company-Energy Development Corporation</i>. In said cases, we clarified the term "project" in the test for determining whether an employee is a regular or project employee: </p> <blockquote> <p> It is evidently important to become clear about the meaning and scope of the term "project" in the present context. The "project" for the carrying out of which "project employees" are hired would ordinarily have some relationship to the usual business of the employer. Exceptionally, the "project" undertaking might not have an ordinary or normal relationship to the usual business of the employer. In this latter case, the determination of the scope and parameters of the "project" becomes fairly easy. It is unusual (but still conceivable) for a company to undertake a project which has absolutely no relationship to the usual business of the company; thus, for instance, it would be an unusual steel-making company which would undertake the breeding and production of fish or the cultivation of vegetables. From the viewpoint, however, of the legal characterization problem here presented to the Court, there should be no difficulty in designating the employees who are retained or hired for the purpose of undertaking fish culture or the production of vegetables as "project employees," as distinguished from ordinary or "regular employees," so long as the duration and scope of the project were determined or specified at the time of engagement of the "project employees." For, as is evident from the provisions of Article [295] of the Labor Code, quoted earlier, <b>the principal test for determining whether particular employees are properly characterized as "project employees" as distinguished from "regular employees," <i>is whether or not the "project employees" were assigned to carry out a "specific project or undertaking," the duration (and scope) of which were specified at the time the employees were engaged for that project.</i></b> </p> <p> In the realm of business and industry, we note that <b>"project" could refer to one or the other of at least two (2) distinguishable types of activities. Firstly, a project could refer to a particular job or undertaking that is within the regular or usual business of the employer company, <i>but which is distinct and separate</i>, and identifiable as such, from the other undertakings of the company.</b> Such job or undertaking begins and ends at determined or determinable times. The typical example of this first type of project is a particular construction job or project of a construction company. A construction company ordinarily carries out two or more [distinct] identifiable construction projects: e.g., a twenty-five-[story] hotel in Makati; a residential condominium building in Baguio City; and a domestic air terminal in Iloilo City. Employees who are hired for the carrying out of one of these separate projects, the scope and duration of which has been determined and made known to the employees at the time of employment, are properly treated as "project employees," and their services may be lawfully terminated at completion of the project. </p> <p> <b>The term "project" could also refer to, <u>secondly</u>, a particular job or undertaking that is <i>not within the regular business of the corporation</i>. </b>Such a job or undertaking must also be identifiably separate and distinct from the ordinary or regular business operations of the employer. The job or undertaking also begins and ends at determined or determinable times... </p> </blockquote> <p> Thus, in order to safeguard the rights of workers against the arbitrary use of the word "project" to prevent employees from attaining the status of regular employees, employers claiming that their workers are project employees should not only prove that the duration and scope of the employment was specified at the time they were engaged, but also <i>that there was indeed a project</i>. As discussed above, the project could either be (1) a particular job or undertaking that is within the regular or usual business of the employer company, but which is distinct and separate, and identifiable as such, from the other undertakings of the company; or (2) a particular job or undertaking that is not within the regular business of the corporation. As it was with regard to the distinction between a regular and casual employee, the purpose of this requirement is to delineate whether or not the employer is in constant need of the services of the specified employee. If the particular job or undertaking is within the regular or usual business of the employer company <i>and</i> it is not identifiably distinct or separate from the other undertakings of the company, there is clearly a constant necessity for the performance of the task in question, and therefore said job or undertaking should not be considered a project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis and underscoring in the original) </p> </blockquote> <p> From this, project employment ultimately requires the existence of a project or an undertaking which could either be: (1) a particular job within the regular or usual business of the employer, but which is distinct and separate, and identifiable as such, from the other undertakings of the company; or (2) a particular job not within the regular business of the company. It is not enough that the employee is made aware of the duration and scope of employment at the time of engagement. To rule otherwise would be to allow employers to easily circumvent an employee's right to security of tenure through the convenient artifice of communicating a duration or scope. </p><p> In this case, GMA repeatedly engaged petitioners as camera operators for its television programs. As camera operators, petitioners performed activities which are: (1) within the regular and usual business of GMA; and (2) not identifiably distinct or separate from the other undertakings of GMA. It would be absurd to consider the nature of their work of operating cameras as distinct or separate from the business of GMA, a broadcasting company that produces, records, and airs television programs. From this alone, the petitioners cannot be considered project employees for there is no distinctive "project" to even speak of. </p><p> Neither should GMA's assertion that petitioners were merely engaged as pinch-hitters or substitutes, whose employment are for a specific duration or period, prevent them from being regular employees. Again, from <i>GMA Network, Inc. v. Pabriga</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> Every industry, even public offices, has to deal with securing substitutes for employees who are absent or on leave. Such tasks, whether performed by the usual employee or by a substitute, cannot be considered separate and distinct from the other undertakings of the company. <i>While it is management's prerogative to device a method to deal with this issue, such prerogative is not absolute and is limited to systems wherein employees are not ingeniously and methodically deprived of their constitutionally protected right to security of tenure. We are not convinced that a big corporation such as petitioner cannot device a system wherein a sufficient number of technicians can be hired with a regular status who can take over when their colleagues are absent or on leave, especially when it appears from the records that petitioner hires so-called pinch-hitters regularly every month</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Fuji</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> citing <i>ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation v Nazareno</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> explained the test for determining regular employment, as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> The test for determining regular employment is whether there is a reasonable connection between the employee's activities and the usual business of the employer. Article [295] provides that the nature of work must be "necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer" as the test for determining regular employment. As stated in <i>ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation v. Nazareno</i>: </p> <blockquote> <p> In determining whether an employment should be considered regular or non-regular, the applicable test is the <i>reasonable connection between the particular activity performed by the employee in relation to the usual business or trade of the employer</i>. The standard, supplied by the law itself, <i>is whether the work undertaken is necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer</i>, a fact that can be assessed by looking into the nature of the services rendered and its relation to the general scheme under which the business or trade is pursued in the usual course. It is distinguished from a specific undertaking that is divorced from the normal activities required in carrying on the particular business or trade.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> GMA is primarily engaged in the business of broadcasting, which encompasses the production of television programs. Following the nature of its business, GMA is naturally and logically expected to engage the service of camera operators such as petitioners, in case it ceases business by failing to shoot and record any television program. Again, that petitioners' work as camera operators was necessary and desirable to the usual business of GMA has long been settled by the consistent rulings of both the National Labor Relations Commission and the Court of Appeals. Even GMA fails to refute these findings. </p><p> This Court finds no cogent reason to depart from these rulings. There is no denying that a reasonable connection exists between petitioners' work as camera operators and GMA's business as both a television and broadcasting company. The repeated engagement of petitioners over the years only reinforces the indispensability of their services to GMA's business. Mindful of these considerations, this Court is certain that the petitioners were GMA's regular employees. </p><p align="center"> <b>IV</b> </p><p> <i>Fuji</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> citing <i>Pabriga</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> explained the standards on fixed-term employment contracts established in <i>Brent</i> in this manner: </p><blockquote> <p> Cognizant of the possibility of abuse in the utilization of fixed-term employment contracts, we emphasized in <i>Brent</i> that <i>where from the circumstances it is apparent that the periods have been imposed to preclude acquisition of tenurial security by the employee, they should be struck down as contrary to public policy or morals</i>. We thus laid down indications or criteria under which "term employment" cannot be said to be in circumvention of the law on security of tenure, namely: </p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="2%"><div align="justify">1)</div></td> <td width="98%"> <div align="justify">The fixed period of employment <i>was knowingly and voluntarily agreed upon</i> by the parties without any force, duress, or improper pressure being brought to bear upon the employee and absent any other circumstances vitiating his consent; or</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">2)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">It satisfactorily appears that the employer and the employee <i>dealt with each other on more or less equal terms with no moral dominance</i> exercised by the former or the latter. </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>These indications, which must be read together, make the Brent doctrine applicable only in a few special cases wherein the employer and employee are on more or less in equal footing in entering into the contract. The reason for this is evident: when a prospective employee, on account of special skills or market forces, is in a position to make demands upon the prospective employer, such prospective employee needs less protection than the ordinary worker. Lesser limitations on the parties' freedom of contract are thus required for the protection of the employee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (Citation omitted, emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> That the contract was "knowingly and voluntarily agreed upon" and that the "employer and employee dealt with each other on more or less equal terms," when taken together, renders a contract for fixed-term employment valid and enforceable. </p><p> Nevertheless, this Court has not cowered in invalidating fixed-term employment contracts in instances where the employer fails to show that it dealt with the employee in "more or less equal terms." As discussed in <i>Pabriga</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> [W]hen a prospective employee, on account of special skills or market forces, is in a position to make demands upon the prospective employer, such prospective employee needs less protection than the ordinary worker. Lesser limitations on the parties' freedom of contract are thus required for the protection of the employee. These indications were applied in<i> Pure Foods Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, where we discussed the patent inequality between the employer and employees therein: </p> <blockquote> <p> [I]t could not be supposed that private respondents and all other so-called "casual" workers of [the employer] knowingly and voluntarily agreed to the 5-month employment contract. Cannery workers are never on equal terms with their employers. Almost always, they agree to any terms of an employment contract just to get employed considering that it is difficult to find work given their ordinary qualifications. Their freedom to contract is empty and hollow because theirs is the freedom to starve if they refuse to work as casual or contractual workers. Indeed, to the unemployed, security of tenure has no value. It could not then be said that petitioner and private respondents "dealt with each other on more or less equal terms with no moral dominance whatever being exercised by the former over the latter.["]</p> </blockquote> <p> To recall, it is doctrinally entrenched that in illegal dismissal cases, the employer has the burden of proving with clear, accurate, consistent, and convincing evidence that the dismissal was valid. Ii is therefore the employer which must satisfactorily show that it was not in a dominant position of advantage in dealing with its prospective employee. Thus, in <i>Philips Semiconductors (Phils.), Inc. v. Fadriquela</i>, this Court rejected the employer's insistence on the application of the Brent doctrine when the sole employer's insistence on the application of the Brent doctrine when the sole justification of the fixed terms is to respond to temporary albeit frequent need of such workers: </p> <blockquote> <p> We reject the petitioner's submission that it resorted to hiring employees for fixed terms to augment or supplement its regular employment "for the duration of peak loads" during short-term surges to respond to cyclical demands; hence, it may hire and retire workers on fixed terms, ad infinitum, depending upon the needs of its customers, domestic and international. Under the petitioner's submission, any worker hired by it for fixed terms of months or years can never attain regular employment status. . . .<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> (Citations omitted) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Similarly, in this case, this Court cannot enable GMA in hiring and rehiring workers solely depending on its fancy, getting rid of them when, in its mind, they are bereft of prior utility, and with a view to circumvent their right to security of tenure. It would be improper to classify Ventura as a fixed-term employee considering that GMA did not even allege the manner as to how the terms of the contract with him were agreed upon. </p><p> It is "the employer which must satisfactorily show that it was not in a dominant position of advantage in dealing with its prospective employee."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Thus, the burden is upon GMA as the employer to prove that it dealt with Ventura in more or less equal terms in the execution of the talent agreements with him. Sweeping guarantees that the contract was knowingly and voluntarily agreed upon by the parties and that the employer and the employee stood on equal footing will not suffice. </p><p> That Ventura never contested the execution of his talent agreements cannot in any way operate to preclude him from attaining regular employment status. This Court is not blind to the unfortunate tendency for many employees to cede their right to security of tenure rather than face total unemployment. </p><p align="center"> <b>V</b> </p><p> As regular employees, petitioners enjoy the right to security of tenure. Thus, they may only be terminated for just or authorized cause, and after due notice and hearing. The burden to prove that a dismissal was anchored on a just or authorized cause rests on the employer. The employer's failure to discharge this burden leads to no other conclusion than that a dismissal was illegal. </p><p> It was thus, incumbent upon GMA to ensure that petitioners' dismissals were made in keeping with the requirements of substantive and procedural due process. GMA, however, miserably failed to allege in its Comment, much less prove, that petitioners' dismissals were impelled by any of the just or authorized causes recognized in in Articles 297,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> 298,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> 299<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> or 279(a)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> of the Labor Code.</p><p> As illegally dismissed employees, petitioners are entitled to reinstatement to their positions with full backwages computed from the time of dismissal up to the time of actual reinstatement.
