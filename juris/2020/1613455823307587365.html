Premiere Development Bank, Bank of the Philippine Islands, Citibank, N.A., Skyrider Brokerage International, Inc. and Marivic-Jong Briones.</i>" The said Orders resolved to issue a writ of execution against respondents and enjoined them to pay the remaining unpaid obligation amounting to One Million Three Hundred Twenty-Eight Thousand Two Hundred Sixty-Three Pesos and Seven Centavos (P1,328,263.07) with 6% per annum from November 30, 2015 until fully paid, and costs of suit.<br><br>The case stemmed from a Complaint for Sum of Money and Damages with an Application for the Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Attachment filed on October 9, 2003, by petitioners against herein respondents. Petitioners alleged that respondent Skyrider Brokerage International, Inc. (Skyrider Brokerage) did not remit to the Bureau of Customs (BOC) the 19 crossed manager's check transmitted unto it (Skyrider Brokerage) by petitioner Yara Fertilizers (Philippines), Inc. [formerly known as Norsk Hydro (Philippines), Inc.], for the purpose of payment of the custom duties and taxes for the fertilizers that were imported by the latter.<br><br>On April 14, 2010, the RTC rendered a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> finding respondents Security Bank Corporation (formerly known as Premiere Development Bank), Skyrider Brokerage, Marivic-Jong Briones (Jong-Briones), and the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) jointly and severally liable to petitioners for the amount of P26,176,006.06 covering the 18 crossed manager's checks purchased from the BPI, plus interest; finding respondents Security Bank Corporation (Security Bank), Skyrider Brokerage, Jong-Briones and the Citibank, N.A.

The appellate court affirmed the findings of the RTC that respondents acted in gross, wanton, and inexcusable negligence in the unauthorized encashment and conversion of the subject checks, to the prejudice of herein petitioners.<br><br>Unsatisfied, respondents filed their Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> before this Court on January 27, 2015. On March 16, 2015, this Court issued a Resolution denying the instant petition "for failure to sufficiently show that the appellate court committed any reversible error in the challenged decision as to warrant the exercise by the Court of its discretionary appellate jurisdiction."<br><br>Since no motion for reconsideration was filed, the Resolution dated March 16, 2015, became final and executory and a corresponding Entry of Judgment dated May 26, 2015, was issued by this Court thereon.<br><br>Thus, on September 18, 2015, petitioners filed a Motion for Execution of the Decision dated April 14, 2010, issued by the RTC and prayed that they be awarded the amount of P109,460,770.61.<br><br>Petitioners asserted that in the absence of an expressed stipulation as to the rate of interest that should govern the parties, the legal interest to be imposed or the actual damages awarded in their favor should be 12% per annum, compounded annually from the date of extrajudicial demand up to June 30, 2013. The legal interest to be imposed from July 1, 2013, until full payment by the respondents of their obligation should be six percent (6%) per annum, compounded annually, by virtue of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Circular No. 799-13, which fixed such legal interest to the same.<br><br>In its Comment, respondent Security Bank contended that the interest on the actual damages awarded should only be imposed at 6% per annum from the date of finality of the Decision on May 26, 2015, until the obligation is fully paid, considering that respondents' obligation did not arise from a loan or forbearance of money, but as a result of fraud and negligence. Furthermore, there is no basis to impose compounding interest on the said damages, and that the Decision dated April 14, 2010, did not impose interest for the other damages awarded to petitioners, <i>e.g.</i>, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees.<br><br><b><center>Ruling of the RTC</center></b><br>On February 19, 2016, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>, granting the Motion for Execution and ordered that a writ of execution be issued in favor of petitioners, to wit:<br><blockquote>Accordingly and in accordance with the foregoing discussions, defendants['] remaining obligation under the subject Decision as of November 30, 2015 should be computed as follows:<br><br><b>Computation of legal interest due on the Actual Damages Awarded in the amount of [P]28,083,790.02 from judicial demand to finality of judgment</b><br><br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Period Covered: October 09, 2003 (date of judicial demand) - May 26, 2015 (date of finality of the decision)</div></td></tr><tr><td width="14%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td width="86%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">P28,083,790.02 x 6% x 11 years, 7 months and 17 days = P19,596,714.72<br></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">P19,596,714.72</div></td><td> <div align="justify">- interest due on the actual damages from judicial demand up to finality of judgment<br></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">+ P28,083,790.02</div></td><td><div align="justify">- actual damages awarded (value of the Manager's checks)<br></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="justify">_____________</div></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td><div align="justify"><strong>P47,680,504.74</strong></div></td><td> <div align="justify">- principal amount with interest due as of May 26, 2015.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br><b>Computation of legal interest due on the actual damages from date of finality of judgment until November 30, 2015</b><br><br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">Period Covered: May 26, 2015 to November 30, 2015 </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="15%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td width="85%"><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">P47,680,504.74 x 6% x 6 months &amp; 4 days = P1,461,766.68<br></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">P1,461,766,68</div></td><td><div align="justify">- interest due from the finality of judgment until November 30, 2015<br></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">+ P47,680,504.74</div></td><td><div align="justify">- principal amount with interest due as of May 26, 2015<br></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">P49,142,271.42</div></td><td> <div align="justify">- Total amount due with legal interest from October 9, 2003 to November 30, 2015.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br><b>Computation of legal interest due on the Moral and Exemplary Damages Awarded in the amount of P400,000.00 each from the date of decision until its finality</b><br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div align="justify">Period Covered.

It found proper to impose the legal interest on the actual damages from the time of judicial demand, or from the time cf the filing of the instant complaint on October 9, 2003, up to the finality of the Decision on May 26, 2015. Also, the actual damages awarded with legal interest shall likewise earn legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of the Decision until, full satisfaction thereof.<br><br>Furthermore, the legal interest due on the moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees ¦ is deemed read into the decision. The computation. of the legal interest at 6% per annum thereon shall start at the time the Decision dated April 14, 2010, was rendered by the RTC, when it was already quantified or liquidated, and fixed by the court.<br><br>However, the RTC found no basis to impose a compounding interest on the damages awarded in favor of petitioners because there exists no contract stipulating the same, nor was it imposed by the RTC in its Decision.<br><br>Finally, the RTC noted the payment made by respondents in the amount of P49,834,l18.90 as partial payment of their obligation under the Decision dated April 14, 2010.<br><br>In its Order dated August 5, 2016, the RTC partially granted petitioners' motion for reconsideration, finding that based on the testimonies of the petitioners' witnesses, the last demand letter was sent to respondents on June 25, 2003.

It is well-settled that once a judgment attains finality, it becomes immutable and unalterable. It may not be changed, altered, or modified in any way even if the modification were for the purpose of correcting an erroneous conclusion of fact or law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>This Court had the occasion to explain the doctrine of finality of judgments, thus:<br><blockquote>The doctrine of finality of judgment is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice, and that, at the risk of occasional errors, the judgments or orders of courts must become final at some definite time fixed by law; otherwise, there would be no end to litigations, thus setting to naught the main role of courts of justice which is to assist in the enforcement of the rule of law and the maintenance of peace and order by setting justiciable controversies with finality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>Despite the finality of the Decision dated April 14, 2010, petitioners insist that respondents' obligation is considered a loan or forbearance, and not due to fraud or negligence. A perusal of the said decision had already settled this issue, to wit:<br><blockquote>It is the Court findings under the evidence presented that <b>defendant [Skyrider Brokerage] and defendant [Jong Briones] are part of the conspiracy in the commission of the fraud against the plaintiff.</b> In the first place, plaintiff engaged defendant [Skyrider Brokerage] wherein the General Manager is defendant [Jong Briones] to pay the taxes due to the government because of the importation of fertilizers abroad. Plaintiff has not authorized said defendants to hire a broker or an agent to do the work for them. But then defendants Skyrider [Brokerage] and [Jong Briones], allegedly hired a certain David Banga to do the work for them for a fee of 10% of the amount being given by plaintiff to defendants Skyrider [Brokerage] and [Jong Briones]. David Banga does not appear to be a licensed customs broker, but the one licensed is [Jong Briones], hence David Banga has no personality when to transact business [<i>sic</i>] with the Bureau of Customs regarding payment of taxes for others unless he is properly authorized by the principal herein, which is the plaintiff. But then the plaintiff did not authorize David Banga t act for and in their behalf.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>With respect to the issue on the liability of Premiere Bank against herein plaintiffs, it was.clearly established by the testimonies and evidence presented that Premiere Bank should be held liable for damages suffered by the plaintiff.<br><br>First, defendant Premiere Bank admitted that it allowed a certain Mr. Arthur Espino to deposit the subject checks in Account Numbers 01-00-780-1 and 0-5-02687-8 in its Pedro Gil Branch on the mere representation of Arthur Espino, using a photocopy of the alleged Certification of Business Name of plaintiff Norteam that he was allegedly the president thereof. Defendant Premiere being a banking institution, it is duly bound to ensure extraordinary diligence in dealing with clients.<br><br>Second, defendant Premiere Bank stamped the subject checks with the notation: 'prior endorsement and/or lack of endorsement guaranteed'.<br><br>Third, <b>there is deliberate and/or negligent act on the part of Manuel Agoncillo, manager of the Pedro Gil Branch of defendant Premiere Bank, in transacting the subject checks to the prejudice of plaintiff Yara Fertilizers and Norteam Transport.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>However, although defendants BPI and Citibank N.A. was not proven to have any knowledge or involvement in any anomaly or irregularity on the subject checks as it cleared and paid the amount of the Manager's checks in reliance on the endorsement stamp of the Premiere Bank as the collecting bank, it cannot at all escape responsibility to plaintiff Norsk Hydro and Norteam being the banks who issued the subject Manager's Check. By issuing the subject checks and clearing the same, <b>it has the duty to reimburse the credited amount on the account of Plaintiffs</b> subject however to its right to claim reimbursement to defendant Premiere Bank who indorsed and warranted all prior endorsement upon which defendants BPI and Citibank relied into."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Any right, fact, or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the detenriination of an action before a competent court in which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies, whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or subject matter of the two actions is the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Thus, the findings of the RTC as to the nature of the source of respondents' obligation to petitioner cannot now be questioned anew by the latter and so late in the proceedings,<br><br><i>The obligation of respondents to <br>petitioners is based on fraud or<br>negligence, and not on loan or <br>forbearance</i><br><br>Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that petitioners can raise into issue that the source of respondents' obligation is from a loan or forbearance, and not from fraud or negligence, this Court rules in the negative.<br><br>A loan or forbearance of money, goods, or credit describes a contractual obligation whereby a lender or creditor has refrained during a given period from requiring the borrower or debtor to repay the loan or debt then due and payable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Forbearance of money, goods or credits, therefore, refers to arrangements other than loan agreements, where a person acquiesces to the temporary use of his money, goods, or credits pending the happening of certain events or fulfillment of certain conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Clearly, the instant case does not involve a loan or forbearance of money but due to fault or negligence by herein respondents. To reiterate, respondents obligation does not involve an acquiescence to the temporary use of a party's money but a performance of a particular service, specifically for respondent Skyrider Brokerage to compute the custom duties and taxes of petitioners, and transmit the payment to the same to the BOC for the release of the imported fertilizers. Respondent Security Bank, on the other hand, was obligated to not encash the crossed manager's checks because it was not an authorized agent bank of the BOC nor was it authorized to receive the payment of custom duties and taxes on behalf of the same. In turn, respondents BPI and Citibank were obligated not to release the amounts covered by the said checks, which are not payable to the order of respondent Security Bank.<br><br>Thus, this Court reiterates the guidelines in computing for the legal interest to an award of actual and compensatory damages, as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%">1. </td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">When the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing.

In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 6% per annum (formerly 12% per annum) to be computed fiom default, i.e., from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.<br></div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>2. </td><td><div align="justify"><b>When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of the court at the rate of 6% per annum.</b> No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages, except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty. Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extra-judicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code), but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained).

Flores,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> we held that:<br><blockquote>The judgment which was sought to be executed ordered the payment of simple "legal interest" only. It said nothing about the payment of compound interest. Accordingly, when the respondent judge ordered the payment of compound interest, he went beyond the confines of his own judgment which had been affirmed by the [CA] and which had become final, x x x <b>Therefore, in default of any equivocal wording in the contract, the legal interest stipulated by the parties should be understood to be simple, not compounded.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>The aforementioned case is clear that the presence of stipulated or conventional interest accrued at the time of judicial demand is required, in order to impose a compounded interest. Nowhere in the complaint herein, was it alleged that the parties had stipulated that respondents' obligation will earn interest. In cases where no interest had been stipulated by the parties, no accrued conventional interest could further earn interest upon judicial demand.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Petitioners' misplaced reliance on our ruling in <i>NFF Industrial Corporation v. G&amp;L Associated Brokerage,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> serve them no purpose. In the said case, respondent G&amp;L Associated Brokerage's liability to petitioner was based on a loan or forbearance of money, as evidenced by the filing of complaint for sum of money against the former. Furthermore, this Court imposed legal interest en respondent's G&amp;L Associated Brokerage's obligation, compounded annually, on appeal and before the decision had attained finality thereafter. Evidently, the factual antecedents of the cited case are not aligned with the instant case herein, despite petitioners' insistence that such distinction made by the RTC is "irrelevant" and "unavailing" thereof. <br><br>This Court also takes note that while petitioners consider the factual differences between <i>NFF Industrial</i> and the instant case as "minute" and do not affect the issue of whether the legal interest imposed herein, should be simple or compounded, they heavily relied on the same distinction in arguing that respondents' obligation is considered as loan or forbearance of money, and not based on fraud or negligence. Petitioners cannot have their cake and eat it, too.<br><br><i>The costs of a suit, are not <br>considered, as monetary award that <br>will earn interest thereon</i><br><br>Finally, petitioners contend that the award of costs of suit in their favor, should also earn legal interest because disregarding the legal interest for costs of suit would be to place the prevailing party at a disadvantage as he will necessarily incur a loss for initiating a legal action to protect his interest because the cost of his money - which is supposed to be approximated by the legal interest - will never be recouped.<br><br>This Court finds this argument as tenuous.<br><br>Cost, in its ordinary sense, contemplates the amount spent or expenses incurred, in order to purchase or acquire a thing or service, usually in the form of either a price or a fee. In the separate opinion of Justice Bernardo P. Pardo in <i>GSIS v. Bengson Commercial Buildings, Inc.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> this Court had the occasion to define what costs of suit are, specifically:<br><blockquote>Costs are certain allowances authorized by statute to reimburse the successful party for expenses incurred in prosecuting or defending an action or special proceedings. These costs have their own legal meaning and import, for, as it was said, "costs are in the nature of incidental damages allowed to the successful party to indemnify him[/her] against the expense of asserting his[her] rights in court, when the necessity of doing so was caused by other's breach of legal duty,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>As such, the costs of.filing a suit includes, but not limited to, those found under Sections 9,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> 10,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>,and 11<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> of Rule 142 of the Revised Rules of Court.<br><br>As can be gleaned from the foregoing, the costs of suit do not partake the nature of a loan or forbearance of money, or even an obligation, in a strict sense, which is demandable by a party against another, as defined under Article 1156<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> in relation to Article 1157<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of the Civil Code. This is strengthened by the fact that the courts can deny the award of the same in favor of the winning litigant, even after presenting proof of its payment. It is rather treated as an expense, that is allowed by law to be reimbursed from a losing party in a suit instituted by a party upon discretion of the courts. Moreover, such reimbursement is strictly limited by the rules and in fact, the prevailing party may recover only the costs provided thereunder, and no other amount may be awarded to the same. Therefore, any costs of suit awarded to a winning litigant cannot earn legal interest, provided for under the rules.<br><br>The concept of interest had been made clear in the case of <i>Siga-an v. Villanueva,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> wherein this Court had ruled that the kinds of interests that may be imposed in a judgment are monetary interest and compensatory interest, to wit:<br><blockquote>Interest is a compensation fixed by the parties for the use or forbearance of money. This is referred to as monetary interest. Interest may also be imposed by law or by courts as penalty or indemnity for damages. This is called compensatory interest. The right to interest applies only by virtue of a contract or by virtue of damages for delay or failure to pay the principal loan on which interest is demanded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>Verily, the costs of suit do not partake the nature of an award that is granted by the courts, which can earn either monetary interest or compensatory interest.<br><br>However, this Court deems it proper to recompute for the correct accrued legal interest on the award of damages granted to herein petitioners, and imposed upon the respective portions of respondents.<br><br><b>Computation of legal interest due on the actual damages awarded to petitioners in the amount of P26,176,006.06 from judicial demand until the finality of judgment against respondents Security Bank, Skyrider Brokerage, Jong Briones, and BPI</b><br><br>Period Covered: June 25, 2003 (date of judicial demand) -
