It sought the denial of Manuel's application based on the following grounds: (a) the land is inalienable and part of the public domain owned by the Republic; (b) Manuel and his predecessors-in-interest were not in continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the land since June 12, 1945 or prior thereto; and (c) the evidence attached to the application insufficiently and incompetently proved his acquisition of the land or his continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation thereof.</p><p> Only the OSG interposed its opposition to the application. As a result, an Order of General Default was issued against the whole world with the exception of OSG.</p><p> During the trial, Manuel presented the following witnesses: (a) Nelson; (b) Arcadio Arcillas (Arcadio); (c) Epifanio Guevarra (Epifanio); (d) Miguel Jaurigue Libot (Miguel); (e) Francisco Malleon (Francisco); and (f) Fermin Angeles (Fermin).</p><p> Nelson attested that Manuel could not personally testify as he was working in Italy. They have known each other since they were children and before Manuel married Maribel F. Cabus.</p><p> Nelson testified that Lot No. 5525 was previously owned by Evaristo Navarro (Evaristo).

Nelson also presented another Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated March 21, 2003 from the CENRO which declared Lot No. 5525-B to be within the alienable and disposable zone under "Project No. 30, Land Classification Map No. 582 certified on December 31, 1925" except for the three meters strip of land along the creek bounding on the northwestern portion which was for bank protection.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p><p> Fermin, a long-time resident of Brgy.

Lot No. 5525 was subsequently owned by Reynaldo, Evaristo's son, who remained in peaceful and continuous possession and ownership of the entire land until he sold a portion thereof, Lot No. 5525-B, to Manuel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> After his acquisition of Lot No. 5525-B, Manuel constructed his house and a corner stone on the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> He also planted black pepper, lanzones, and coffee thereon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p><p> Arcadio further recalled that nobody, other than Reynaldo and his predecessors-in-interest, claimed ownership and possession over the said land.</p><p> Epifanio, Miguel, and Francisco all corroborated Nelson, Fermin and Arcadio's testimonies that Evaristo was the owner of Lot No. 5525 who used the land for planting crops. It was then inherited by Reynaldo who sold a portion thereof to Manuel. Further, they all recalled that as early as the 1940s, the residents of Brgy. San Luis knew that it was Reynaldo and his predecessors-inÂ­ interest who owned the entire land including Lot No. 5525-B before it was sold to Manuel. </p><p> <b>Ruling of the Municipal Trial Court: </b></p><p> In its February 28, 2007 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the MTC granted Manuel's application for original registration after it was sufficiently established that he is the owner of Lot No. 5525-B.

The MTC erred in giving weight and credit to the testimonies of the witnesses which were purely hearsay. The OSG further insisted that Nelson was incompetent to identify the contents of the Deed of Absolute Sale and the Deed of Donation. </p><p> <b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals: </b></p><p> In its January 31, 2011 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the CA affirmed the MTC Decision. It opined that Nelson, as the attorney-in-fact, was authorized to file the application in behalf of Manuel, to represent him in the proceedings, to testify and to present documentary evidence during the trial, and to do any acts in furtherance thereof. Further, Manuel's witnesses sufficiently proved that Manuel, and his predecessors-in-interest were in open, continuous, exclusive, peaceful and adverse possession in the concept of an owner prior to June 12, 1945. </p><p> The OSG filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> which the CA denied in its June 15, 2011 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> Hence, this Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>. </p><p align="center"> <b>Issues</b> </p><p> The OSG raised the following errors to support its petition: </p><blockquote> <p align="center"> I. </p> <p>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN GIVING PROBATIVE VALUE TO HEARSAY EVIDENCE.</p> <p align="center"> II. </p> <p align="justify">NO COMPETENT EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SHOW THAT RESPONDENT WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE LAND FOR AT LEAST THIRTY (30) YEARS.</p> <p align="center"> III. </p> <p align="justify">THE CERTIFICATION THAT THE SUBJECT PROPERTY IS ALIENABLE AND DISPOSABLE IS INSUFFICIENT SANS AN EXPRESS GOVERNMENT MANIFESTATION THAT THE PROPERTY IS ALREADY PATRIMONIAL OR NO LONGER RETAINED FOR PUBLIC SERVICE OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL WEALTH, UNDER ARTICLE 422 OF THE CIVIL CODE.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> In fine, the issues to be resolved are as follows: (a) whether or not the CENRO Certificates are sufficient proofs that Lot No. 5525-B is alienable and disposable; and (b) whether or not Manuel sufficiently proved that he and his predecessors-in-interest were in continuous, peaceful, notorious and exclusive possession in the concept of an owner of the subject land. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><p> The Petition is bereft of merit. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b>The arguments raised in the instant petition involve a mixed question of facts and of law.</b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Rule 45 of the Rules of Court prescribes that only questions of law should be raised in petitions filed under the said rule since factual questions are not the proper subject of an appeal by <i>certiorari</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The Court is not a trier of facts. Thus, We will not entertain questions of fact as factual findings of the appellate court are considered final, binding, or conclusive on the parties and upon this Court especially when supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> The Court, in <i>Leoncio v. De Vera</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> differentiated a question of law from a question of fact in this wise: </p><blockquote> <p> A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, the same must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them. The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances. Once it is clear that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the question posed is one of fact. Thus, the test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise it is a question of fact. </p> </blockquote> <p> Here, the OSG is not only raising a question of law, <i>i.e</i>. on whether the evidence presented by Manuel was sufficient to prove that the subject land is alienable and disposable. It is also raising a question of fact as it seeks the Court's determination as to the veracity and truthfulness of the testimonies of the witnesses presented by Manuel in support of his claim that he and his predecessors-in-interest were in actual, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and ownership of the land even before June 12, 1945. Consequently, the Court is constrained to exercise its jurisdiction in the case since the errors raised by the OSG in its Petition, being mixed questions of fact and of law, are not proper subjects of an appeal by <i>certiorari</i>. </p><p> In any case, the Petition is still dismissible for utter lack of merit. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top"><div align="justify"><b>The requirements under Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree (P.D.)

The CENRO Certificate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> dated February 11, 2003 stated that Lot No. 5525-B is not covered by any public land application or patent.

Hence, since no substantive rights stand to be prejudiced, the benefit of the Certifications should therefore be equitably extended in favor of Manuel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> Clearly, Lot No. 5525-B is an alienable and disposable land of the public domain. The CENRO Certificates dated February 11, 2003 and March 21, 2003 sufficiently showed that the government executed a positive act of declaration that Lot No. 5525-B is alienable and disposable land of public domain as of December 31, 1925.

To establish that the land subject of the application is alienable and disposable public land, the general rule remains: all applications for original registration under the Property Registration Decree must include both (1) a CENRO or PENRO certification and (2) a certified true copy of the original classification made by the DENR Secretary. </p> <p> As an exception, however, the courts â in their sound discretion and based solely on the evidence presented on record â may approve the application, <i>pro hac vice</i>, on the ground of substantial compliance showing that there has been a positive act of government to show the nature and character of the land and an absence of effective opposition from the government. <b>This exception shall only apply to applications for registration currently pending before the trial court prior to this Decision and shall be inapplicable to all future applications. </b>[Citations Omitted.] (Emphasis Supplied.) </p> </blockquote> <p> The grant of an application for land registration on the basis of substantial compliance may be applied subject to the discretion of the courts and only if the trial court rendered its decision on the application prior to June 26, 2008, the date of the promulgation of <i>TA.N.

Thus, even if the case reached the Supreme Court after the promulgation of <i>T.A.N.

Taken together with the words open, continuous, exclusive and notorious, the word <i>occupation</i> serves to highlight the fact that for an applicant to qualify, his possession must not be a mere fiction.

Estate of Santos</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> discussed when possession is considered open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> Possession is open when it is patent, visible, apparent, notorious, and not clandestine. It is continuous when uninterrupted, unbroken and not intermittent or occasional. It is exclusive when the adverse possessor can show exclusive dominion over the land and an appropriation of it to his own use and benefit. And it is notorious when it is so conspicuous that it is generally known and talked of by the public or the people in the neighborhood.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> [Citation Omitted.] </p> </blockquote> <p> Manuel had sufficiently established his possession in the concept of owner of the property since June 12, 1945, or earlier. </p><p> The testimonies of the witnesses are credible enough to support Manuel's claim of possession. Worthy to note that the witnesses unswervingly declared that Evaristo, in the concept of an owner, occupied and possessed Lot No. 5525 even before June 12, 1945. Remarkably, Arcadio, who frequented the land since he was a child, categorically testified that it was Evaristo who possessed and owned Lot No. 5525 as early as 1942. Evaristo performed specific acts of ownership such as planting banana and coffee in the land, and hiring the services of other workers to help him till the soil. Thereafter, Lot No. 5525 was transferred to Reynaldo, Evaristo's son, who continued to cultivate the same. </p><p> The testimony of Arcadio was in confluence with the testimonies of other witnesses. It is important to note the testimony of Fermin who, despite his old age, clearly remembered and firmly stated that their land which was tilled by his father is adjacent to Lot No. 5525 owned by Evaristo. As the owner, Evaristo would direct his workers to plant banana and coffee in his land, harvest the crops, and sell them thereafter. Fermin also vividly recalled that Evaristo donated Lot No. 5525 to Reynaldo in 1958 who continued cultivating the land. Reynaldo then sold a portion thereof, i.e. Lot No. 5525-B, to Manuel who constructed his house and planted various crops therein. </p><p> The possession and occupation as <i>bona fide</i> owner of Evaristo and Reynaldo can be tacked to the possession of Manuel who acquired Lot No. 5525-B by virtue of a Deed of Absolute Sale dated September 25, 1989 executed by Reynaldo in his favor. Notably, Lot No. 5525-B, which is the land subject of the application for registration, is a portion of Lot No. 5525 as evidenced by the Subdivision Plan and the Technical Description of Lot No. 5525-B. Hence, Reynaldo and his predecessors-in-interest's possession of Lot No. 5525 can be transferred to Manuel but only as regards to Lot No. 5525-B, the sold portion and land subject of the application for registration. </p><p> The fact that the earliest tax declaration on record is 1955 does not necessarily show that the predecessors were not in possession of Lot No. 5525 since 1945. Indeed, the Court in a long line of cases has stated that tax declarations or tax receipts are good <i>indicia</i> of possession in the concept of owner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> However, it does not follow that belated declaration of the same for tax purposes negates the fact of possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> This remains true especially in the instant case where there are no other persons claiming any interest in Lot No. 5525 or, in particular, Lot No. 5525-8.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> </p><p> All told, there is no sufficient reason to reverse the findings of the MTC as affirmed by the CA. Lot No. 5525-B is duly proven to be alienable and disposable land of public domain. Further, Manuel has been in continuous, open, notorious and exclusive possession and occupation thereof even before June 12, 1945. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is <b>DENIED</b>.
