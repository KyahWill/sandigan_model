No. 7610, otherwise known as the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act. The Information reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 8<sup>th</sup> day of May 2012, at around 1:00 o'clock early dawn, more or less, in x x x and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, above-named accused, being the brother-in-lawof AAA,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> a 13-year old girl, actuated by lust and with evident premeditation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously, undress said AAA and had carnal knowledge with said minor-victim, against the latter's will, to her damage and prejudice.<br><br>Contrary to law and with aggravating circumstance of minority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>When arraigned on July 3, 2014, XXX entered a plea of not guilty to the crime charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Trial on the merits ensued.<br><br>At the time of the alleged commission of the crime, XXX and AAA were at the house of AAA's aunt.

She averred that she was dragged by XXX towards the place where their plates were placed. XXX undressed AAA, inserted his penis into her vagina and made a push and pull movement. She tried to shout but XXX covered her mouth. After satisfying himself, XXX threatened AAA that he would kill her mother if she tells anyone about the incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>A few days after, AAA told her sister-in-law about her experience in the hands of XXX.

AAA's recollection of her ordeal clearly established that XXX had carnal knowledge of her at the time when everyone in the house was in their deep slumber. XXX dragged AAA by her feet, pulled her to a solitary spot behind the television set, undressed her, and inserted his penis into her vagina despite her objection and resistance. It bears reiterating that the Court accords great respect and even confer finality to the findings of the trial court as to matters which are factual in nature as well as its assessment of the credibility of witnesses. The trial court's firsthand observation and direct estimation of the witnesses place it in a unique position to observe and weigh that elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' deportment on the stand while testifying.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Thus, when there is no clear showing that the trial court's factual findings were tainted with arbitrariness or that the trial court overlooked or misapplied relevant facts and circumstances, or inadequately calibrated the witnesses' credibility, the reviewing court is bound by its assessment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>Furthermore, AAA's narration as to the fact of sexual intercourse was corroborated by the medical certificate issued by Dr. Montejo indicating that the latter's "hymen [was] not appreciated" and that her "vaginal orifice was penetrated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In his direct examination, Dr. Montejo testified:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">COURT:</td></tr><tr><td width="5%" valign="top">Q: </td><td width="95%">When is the hymen intact?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td> It is untouched.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>Was there a laceration?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>I did not see the hymen.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q:</td><td> No more hymen.

A: Yes, Sir.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In bidding for acquittal, XXX impugns AAA's credibility and questions her claim that she was dragged on her feet while she was sleeping and that she was only awakened when he penetrated her. XXX asserts that AAA should have been awakened when she was dragged or during the time when she felt her short pants and underwear were being removed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The argument fails to persuade.<br><br>The prosecution has sufficiently established the sexual congress between XXX and AAA against the latter's will. XXX pulled AAA away from where she was sleeping and, when he found a convenient spot to satisfy his lust, forced himself on her, covered her mouth and let her suffer in silence. Such fact cannot be negated by AAA's account of the events that transpired prior to the sexual attack which XXX finds incredible.<br><br>XXX contends that the victim's narration is unbelievable considering that in the normal course of things, AAA should have been awakened at the time she was dragged or when her shortpants and underwear were being removed. It is worthy to stress that AAA was attacked in the middle of the night while she was sleeping beside her two cousins. There is nothing absurd about the fact that AAA remained in slumber until the rape incident for XXX could not have carried out his sexual advances had he been unwary and reckless in pulling AAA out of their floor bed set up and awakened her at once. Furthermore, ordinary human experience would tell us that it is not impossible for a young child to not be awakened while being dragged because those who have children know that most young children, and even those in their pre-teens, can be transferred, moved, or even lifted from one place to another by their parents and can even be undressed and dressed up without waking up.<br><br>Suffice it to state that XXX's contention pertains to an insignificant detail which does not bear on the very fact of the commission of the offense. Neither does it render XXX's bestial act physically impossible nor inconceivable. For the gravamen of rape is sexual intercourse with a woman against her will or without her consent,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> which was fully sustained by the evidence presented by the prosecution.<br><br>Moreover, the Court cannot concede to XXX's asseveration that the rape incident was improbable because other members of the household were present in the same room where the rape was perpetrated. It has been repeatedly announced that lust respects no time and place; rape defies constraint of time and space.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The abominable crime of rape can be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, along the roadside, within school premises, inside a house where there are other occupants, and even in the same room where other members of the family are also sleeping. It is known to happen even in the most unlikely places. Hence, it is not impossible or incredible for the members of the victim's family to be in deep slumber and not to be awakened while a sexual assault is being committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In view thereof, the courts below correctly found XXX guilty of rape.<br><br>The RTC convicted XXX of rape in relation to R.A. 7610 but the CA, on appeal, modified the July 11, 2016 RTC Decision as to thedamages awarded and the nomenclature of the offense and convicted XXX of rape under Article 266-A, paragraph l(a) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended byR.A.No. 8353.<br><br>The Court agrees with the CA that all the elements for the crime of rape under Article 266-A (1) are extant in this case, to wit: (1) the male offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) he accomplished the said act through force, threat or intimidation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> However, we cannot sustain the appellate court's pronouncement that the prosecution has established XXX's criminal liability under Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610, which provides:<br><blockquote>Section 5. Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse. — Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subject to other sexual abuse; Provided, That when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period;<br><br>x x x x</blockquote>The elements of Section 5(b) are: (1) the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (2) the said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and (3) the child whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>For a charge under R.A. No. 7610 to prosper, it is crucial that the minor victim is a child "exploited in prostitution or other sexual abuse." The Court scrutinized the phrases "children exploited in prostitution" and "other sexual abuse" in <i>People v. Tulagan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> in this wise:<br><blockquote>To avoid further confusion,We dissect the phrase "children exploited in prostitution" as an element of violation of Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610. As can be gathered from the text of Section 5 of R.A. No. 7610 and having in mind that the term "lascivious conduct" has a clear definition which does not include "sexual intercourse," the phrase "children exploited in prostitution" contemplates four (4) scenarios: <u>(a) a child, whether male or female, who for money, profit or any other consideration, indulges in lascivious conduct; (b) a female child, who for money, profit or any other consideration, indulges in sexual intercourse; (c) a child, whether male or female, who due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulges in lascivious conduct; and (d) a female, due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse.</u><br><br>The term "other sexual abuse," on the other hand, is construed in relation to the definitions of "child abuse" under Section 3, Article I of R.A. No. 7610 and "sexual abuse" under Section 2(g) of the <i>Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases.</i> In the former provision, "child abuse" refers to the <u>maltreatment, whether habitual or not, of the child which includes sexual abuse, among other matters. In the latter provision, "sexual abuse" includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct or the molestation, prostitution, or incest with children.</u><br><br>In <i>Quimvel,</i> it was held that the term "coercion or influence" is broad enough to cover or even synonymous with the term "force or intimidation." Nonetheless, it should be emphasized that "coercion or influence" is used in Section 5 of R.A. No. 7610 to qualify or refer to the means through which "any adult, syndicate or group" compels a child to indulge in sexual intercourse. On the other hand, the use of "money, profit or any other consideration" is the other mode by which a child indulges in sexual intercourse, without the participation of "any adult, syndicate or group." In other words, "coercion or influence" of a child to indulge in sexual intercourse is clearly exerted NOT by the offender whose liability is based on Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 for committing sexual act with a child exploited in prostitution or other sexual abuse. Rather, the "coercion or influence" is exerted upon the child by "any adult, syndicate, or group" whose liability is found under Section 5(a) for engaging in, promoting, facilitating or inducing child prostitution, whereby the sexual intercourse is the necessary consequence of the prostitution.</blockquote>For a clearer view, a comparison of the elements of rape under the RPC and sexual intercourse with a child under Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610 where the offended party is between 12 years old and below 18, is in order.<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="550" valign="top"><strong>Rape under Article 266-A (1) (a, b, c) under the RPC</strong></td><td width="550" valign="top"><strong>Section 5 (1) of R.A. No. 7610</strong></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">1. Offender is a man;</td><td valign="top">1. Offender is a man;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2. Carnal knowledge of a woman;</td><td valign="top">2.

Through force, threat or intimidation; when the of- fended party is deprived of reason or otherwise uncon- scious; and by means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority.</td><td valign="top">3. Coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group is employed against the child to become a prostitute.</td></tr></tbody></table><br>As can be gleaned above, "force, threat or intimidation" is the element of rape under the RPC, while "due to coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group" is the operative phrase for a child to be deemed "exploited in prostitution or other sexual abuse," which is the element of sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610. The "coercion or influence" is not the reason why the child submitted herself to sexual intercourse, but it was utilized in order for the child to become a prostitute. Considering that the child has become a prostitute, the sexual intercourse becomes voluntary and consensual because that is the logical consequence of prostitution as defined under Article 202 of the RPC, as amended by R.A. No. 10158 where the definition of "prostitute" was retained by the new law: x x x" (citations omitted and underscoring supplied).</blockquote>In light of the foregoing definition, AAA cannot be deemed to be a child "exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse." Patently, the second element of Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 is lacking in this case. Accordingly, XXX should be convicted for rape under Article 266-A(l) in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended by R.A. No. 8353, and ordered to pay AAA the following: (a) P75,000.00 as civil indemnity; (b) P75,000.00 as moral damages; (c) P75,000.00 as exemplary damages; and (d) interest of 6% per annum on all damages awarded from the date of finality of this judgment until fully paid pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appeal is <b>DENIED.</b> The Decision dated October 8, 2018 of the Court of Appeals-Cebu City in CA-G.R.

As such, the CA ruled that AAA is considered under the law as a child who is "exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (EPSOSA). Thus, accused-appellant's act may be qualified as a violation of Section 5(b) of RA 7610.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> However, the CA upheld the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> under Article 266-B of RA 8353 pursuant to the case of <i>People v. Ejercito</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> wherein the Court held that the provisions of RA 8353 should prevail over Section 5(b) of RA 7610.5<br><br>While the CA correctly ruled that the imposable penalty against the accused-appellant is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> under Article 266-B(l) of RA 8353,<br><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the accused-appellant should be convicted of the crime of Rape under <b><u>Article 266-A(l) in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC as amended by RA 8353,</u></b> and not Rape in relation to Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610 as the element of EPSOSA was not duly proven by the prosecution.<br><br>I reiterate and maintain my position in <i>People v. Tulagan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> that RA 7610 and the RPC, as amended by RA 8353, "have different spheres of application; they exist to complement each other such that there would be no gaps in our criminal laws. They were not meant to operate simultaneously in each and every case of sexual abuse committed against minors."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Section 5(b) of RA 7610 applies only to the <b><u>specific</u></b> and <b><u>limited instances</u></b> where the child-victim is EPSOSA.<br><br>In other words, for an act to be considered under the purview of Section 5(b), RA 7610, "the following essential elements need to be proved: (1) the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (2) the said act is performed with a child 'exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse'; and (3) the child whether male or female, is below 18 years of age."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Hence, it is not enough that the victim be under 18 years of age. The element of the victim being EPSOSA - <i>a separate and distinct element</i> - must first be both alleged and proved before a conviction under Section 5(b), RA 7610 may be reached.<br><br>Specifically, in order for Section 5(b) to apply as compared to Article 336 of the RPC, as amended by RA 8353, it must be <b>alleged</b> and <b>proved</b> that the child — (1) for money, profit, or any other consideration or (2) due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate, or group — indulges in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Information only alleged that the victim was a 13-year old minor, but it did not allege that she was EPSOSA. Likewise, there was no proof or evidence presented during the trial that she indulged in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct either for a consideration, or due to the coercion or influence of any adult.<br><br>Thus, I agree with the <b>ponencia</b> that the accused-appellant should be convicted of Rape under Article 266-A(l) in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC, not Section 5(b), Article III of RA 7610.<br><br>Accordingly, the penalty that ought to be imposed is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and the accused-appellant should pay the victim P75,000.00 as moral damages, P75,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P75,000.00 as civil indemnity. The interest of 6% <i>per annum</i> should be imposed on all the awards for damages from the date of finality of the Decision until fully paid.<br><br>&nbsp; <br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%" valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td width="50%"><div align="center"><strong>(SGD.)
