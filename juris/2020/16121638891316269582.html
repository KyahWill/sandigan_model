About 8:00 p.m., Simbulan accompanied her along Tiago Street to get a ride home when three men on board a van arrived. The men forced her and Simbulan to get on the car and they were brought to the MPD DAID-SOTG where they were investigated, mauled and forced to admit to selling dangerous drugs.

Most importantly, the prosecution was able to establish an unbroken chain of custody. The CA found the explanation of PO2 Reyes that they were already wet from the rain, thus, they decided to conduct the marking and inventory at the police station, justifiable. Further, the alleged inconsistencies in the testimony of PO2 Reyes were inconsequential and had no bearing on the prosecution's cause. Also, that only Crisostomo witnessed the inventory-taking and did not present proof of his identity was not fatal because the parties stipulated on Crisostomo's testimony that he signed the Receipt of Inventory of Property/Evidence Seized as member of the media. Neither did the CA find the failure of the prosecution to present the original of the buy-bust money detrimental to the prosecution's case. The CA pointed out that neither law nor jurisprudence requires the presentation of any money used in the buy-bust operation. It was sufficient that the sale of the dangerous drug was adequately proven and that the <i>corpus delicti</i> was presented in court.<br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Accused-appellant and the People manifested that they will no longer file their respective Supplemental Briefs, taking into account the thorough discussions of the issues in their respective appeal briefs before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br><center><b>RULING</b></center><br><br>We acquit.<br><br>In cases involving dangerous drugs, the prosecution bears not only the burden of proving the elements of the crime, but also of proving the <i>corpus delicti</i> – the dangerous drug itself. The identity of the dangerous drug must be established beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Such proof requires an unwavering exactitude that the dangerous drug presented in court as evidence against the accused is the same as that seized from him in the first place.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> It is thus crucial for the prosecution to establish the unbroken chain of custody of the seized item.<br><br>Section 21(1) of RA No. 9165, the law applicable at the time of the commission of the crime,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> outlines the procedure that police officers must adhere to maintain the integrity of the confiscated evidence, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof.</blockquote><br><br>Specifically, Article II, Section 21 (a) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of RA No. 9165 enumerates the procedures to be observed by the apprehending officers to confirm the chain of custody:<br><br><blockquote>(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof: Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items;</blockquote><br><br>The law and implementing rules mandate that the physical inventory and photographing of the seized items must be in the presence of the accused and the following insulating witnesses: (1) a representative from the media; (2) the Department of Justice (DOJ); and (3) any elected public official, who shall sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>However, in earlier cases, we clarified that the deviation from the standard procedure in Section 21 will not <i>ipso facto</i> render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, provided that the prosecution satisfactorily proves that: (1) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (2) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> The prosecution must explain the reasons behind the procedural lapses and must show that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized evidence had been preserved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> In <i>People v. Ramos</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> this Court explained that in case the presence of any or all the insulating witnesses was not obtained, the prosecution must allege and prove not only the reasons for their absence, but also the fact that earnest efforts were made to secure their attendance:<br><br><blockquote>It is well to note that the absence of these required witnesses does not <i>per se</i> render the confiscated items inadmissible. However, a justifiable reason for such failure or a <b><u>showing of any genuine and sufficient effort to secure the required witnesses</u></b> under Section 21 of RA 9165 must be adduced. In <i>People v. Umipang</i>, the Court held that the prosecution must show that <b><u>earnest efforts</u></b> were employed in contacting the representatives enumerated under the law for "a sheer statement that representatives were unavailable without so much as an explanation on whether serious attempts were employed to look for other representatives, given the circumstances is to be regarded as a flimsy excuse." Verily, mere statements of unavailability, absent actual serious attempts to contact the required witnesses are unacceptable as justified grounds for noncompliance. These considerations arise from the fact that police officers are ordinarily given sufficient time — beginning from the moment they have received the information about the activities of the accused until the time of his arrest — to prepare for a buy-bust operation and consequently, make the necessary arrangements beforehand knowing full well that they would have to strictly comply with the set procedure prescribed in Section 21 of RA 9165. As such, police officers are compelled not only to state reasons for their noncompliance, but must in fact, also convince the Court that they exerted earnest efforts to comply with the mandated procedure, and that under the given circumstances, their actions were reasonable. (Emphasis in the original: citation omitted.)</blockquote><br><br>Indeed, the presence of the insulating witnesses is the first requirement to ensure the preservation of the identity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> In <i>People v. Caray</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> we ruled that the <i>corpus delicti</i> cannot be deemed preserved absent any acceptable explanation for the deviation from the procedural requirements of the chain of custody rule. Similarly, in <i>Matabilas v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> sheer statements of unavailability of the insulating witnesses, without actual serious attempt to contact them, cannot justify non-compliance.<br><br>In this case, there is no showing that the marking and inventory were done in the presence of the three insulating witnesses. The first and second photographs submitted in evidence only show PO2 Reyes marking the plastic sachets in the presence of accused-appellant and Simbulan; while the third photograph, the buy-bust money and the marked plastic sachets.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> That the marking and inventory were done without the insulating witnesses, is evident in the testimony of Crisostomo, who is a <i>kagawad</i> of another barangay and a media practitioner, that "he did not see the two (2) accused when he signed the inventory[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>And, even if Crisostomo was present, he signed in the inventory as a member of the media.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> In the Receipt of Property/Evidence Seized, Crisostomo is the lone signatory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Meanwhile, the police officers did not explain the absence of a representative from the DOJ and another elected public official.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> To be sure, there was no earnest effort, <i>nay</i> attempt, on the part of the buy-bust team to comply with the law and its implementing rules.<br><br>It cannot also escape our attention that it was a certain "PO2 J Rodriguez" who received the request for laboratory examination on the two specimens from PO2 Bernabe at 23:35 of May 30, 2012,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> and not PCI Reyes as claimed by the prosecution.

It was simply declared that PCI Reyes received the specimens from PO3 Bernabe and after examination, she presented the specimens to the prosecutor and the defense counsel. We stress that in order that the seized items may be considered credible, the prosecution must show, by records or testimony, the continuous whereabouts of the exhibit, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is offered into evidence; in such a way that every person who touched the exhibit would describe how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness' possession; the condition in which it was received and the condition it was delivered to the next link in the chain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Such is not the case here.<br><br>Finally, the presumption of regularity of performance of official duty applies only when nothing in the record suggest that the law enforcers deviated from the standard conduct of official duty required by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> It is not conclusive and it cannot, by itself, overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence. Thus, any taint of irregularity, as in this case, affects the whole performance and should make the presumption unavailable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Time and again, we emphasize that while zealousness on the part of law enforcement agencies in the pursuit of drug peddlers is indeed laudable, it is of paramount importance that the procedures laid down by law be complied with. The breaches in the procedure provided in Section 21, Article II of RA No. 9165 committed by police officers and left unexplained by the State, militate against the conviction of accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt, as the integrity and evidentiary value of the <i>corpus delicti</i> had been compromised.<br><br><b>FOR THESE REASONS,</b> the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.
