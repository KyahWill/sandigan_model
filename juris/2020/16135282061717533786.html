The dispositive portion of Decision No. 2016-436 reads: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review of Dr. Eduardo P. Banzon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Philippine Health Insurance Corporation, Pasig City, of Commission on Audit Corporate Government Sector A Decision No. 2012-11 dated July 12, 2012 insofar as Notice of Disallowance No. 09-005-725(08) dated November 20, 2009 with the total amount of P16,275,578.16 is concerned, is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.</p> <p> With respect to Notice of Disallowance. Nos. PHIC 2008-056(07) to 2008-60(07), all dated December 18, 2008; HO 2009-001 dated September 14, 2009; and HO 2009-002 and HO 2009-003, both dated September 30, 2009, with the total amount of P187,796,996.21, the Petition for Review is DISMISSED for being filed out of time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> According to the COA Proper, PHIC failed to file a petition for review relative to ND Nos. 2008-056(07) to 2008-60(07) and HO 2009-001 to 2009-003 within the reglementary period of 180 days or six months. Because of this, the decision sustaining the NDs already became final and executory. While PHIC filed a motion for extension of time to file petition, the COA Proper did not act on it and PHIC could not assume that the belated filing of the petition was justified.</p><p> Relative to ND No. 09-005-725, the COA Proper decreed that the amount of f 16,275,578.16 representing payment of Efficiency Gift to PHIC employees for CY 2007 was disallowed for lack of approval from the OP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It stressed that even if PHIC is exempt from the coverage of the Office of Compensation and Position Classification, it should report to the OP, through the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), its position classification and compensation plans. It underscored that the prior approval of the OP did not remove from the BOD of PHIC the power to fix compensation and allowances of its personnel, but requires it to submit its plans to the OP, through the DBM, to comply with the law. </p><p> The COA Proper also determined that the officials of PHIC who authorized, approved or certified the subject grants could not be deemed in good faith since the law requires the prior approval of the OP. It further ruled that in its earlier Decision Nos. 2014-332 and 2014-665 dated September 12, 2014, it affirmed the disallowance on similar benefits. Thus, it held that the PHIC officials were not in good faith due to such previous NDs on the same subject matter. Regarding the recipient-employees, the COA Proper decreed that they might be in good faith but under the principle of <em>solutio indebiti</em>, a person who receive something by mistake had the obligation to return it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> Subsequently, the COA Proper denied the Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p> Undeterred, PHIC filed this petition for certiorari raising the following grounds: </p><p align="center"><em> Grounds</em> </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">RESPONDENTS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN DISMISSING THE PETITION FOR REVIEW FILED BY [PHIC] ON THE BASIS OF PROCEDURAL TECHNICALITIES.

It added that even assuming that it belatedly filed the petition, in the interest of substantial justice, the petition must be decided on the merits. </p><p> Moreover, PHIC insisted that its Charter conferred upon the PHIC BOD fiscal autonomy to fix the compensation of its personnel. The fiscal independence is the very basis of the grant of the disallowed benefits. In this regard, the payment of the benefits cannot be deemed to be without appropriate legal basis. </p><p> <i>Respondents' Arguments</i> </p><p> Respondents, through the Office of the Solicitor General, countered that the COA Proper correctly dismissed the petition for review because of late filing as regards ND Nos. 2008-056(07) to 2008-60(07) and HO2009-001 to 2009-003. They contended that the mere filing of a motion for extension did not translate to an automatic extension of time to file petition. They added that the perfection of an appeal within the period and in the manner prescribed by law is jurisdictional. Hence, the failure of PHIC to file within the reglementary period warranted the dismissal of its petition for review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p> Respondents likewise argued that even assuming that PHIC timely filed the petition for review, the petition must still fail for lack of merit. They contended that PHIC's reliance on its fiscal autonomy is misplaced because in the recent jurisprudence involving PHIC (<i>Phil. Health Insurance Corp. v. Commission on Audit, et al</i>.),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court already discussed that the power of the PHIC to fix the compensation and allowances of its officers and employees is subject to the standards laid down by applicable laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The Salary Standardization Law (SSL), in particular, provided that all allowances, other than those specified under Section 12 thereof, shall be deemed included in the standardized salary rates of the employees. Since the benefits involved in the subject NDs are not those expressly enumerated under Section 12 of the SSL, then they are already integrated in the standardized salary rates of the employees of PHIC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p><p> Respondents further argued that the officers and BOD of PHIC should have guided themselves with the abundant jurisprudence regarding the power of government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) to fix salaries and allowances which long existed before the subject grants or benefits were given to PHIC personnel. They stressed that the officers and BOD of PHIC cannot claim good faith considering that their positions require them to be acquainted with the applicable laws, rules and regulations anent the grant of benefits to PHIC officers and employees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p> Meanwhile, on January 30, 2018, the Court issued a temporary restraining order restraining and enjoining respondents from executing the assailed COA Decision dated December 27, 2016 and Resolution dated September 7, 2017.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <i>Our Ruling</i> </p><p> To begin with, let it be underscored that a petition under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, involves the issue of whether the respondent committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of its jurisdiction. The Court's review is limited and is confined only to mailers involving the jurisdiction of the respondent, in this case, the COA Proper, and determine whether it acted arbitrarily or whimsically in issuing the assailed Decision and Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p><p> Here, the Court finds that the COA Proper, did not commit any grave abuse of discretion in dismissing PHIC's appeal anent ND Nos. 2008-056(07) to 2008-60(07) and HO2009-001 to 2009-003 for late filing. </p><p> Pursuant to Section 4,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Rule V of the 2009 COA Revised Rules of Procedure (COA Rules), an appeal before the Director of a Central Office Audit Cluster (National, Local or Corporate Sector) or of a Regional Office of the COA must be filed within six months after the receipt of the decision to be appealed. In addition, Section 3,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Rule VII of the COA Rules provides that the appeal with the COA Proper shall be taken within the remaining period of the six months as specified under Section 4, Rule V, with due regard to the suspension of the running of the period as indicated under Section 5<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of the same Rule. </p><p> In this case, neither party disputes that PHIC failed to timely file its appeal with regard to ND Nos. 2008-056(07) to 2008-60(07) and HO 2009-001 to 2009-003. PHIC's only excuse for the belated submission of its petition for review with the COA Proper was that it filed a motion for extension of time to file petition. However, since the COA Proper did not act on the motion, PHIC cannot merely assume that the COA Proper granted it. </p><p> In fact, in the recent case of <em>Philippine Health Insurance Corp. v. Commission on Audit</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> PHIC's appeal with the COA Proper was also dismissed because of the untimely filing of its petition for review. PHIC is in similar situation here. Definitely, because of the late filing of its appeal, the decision of the COA-CGS had already attained finality. </p><p> In another case, also involving PHIC - <em>Philippine Health Insurance Corp. v. Commission on Audit,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Court explained the rule surrounding perfection of appeal, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> As a general rule, the perfection of an appeal in the manner and within the period permitted by law is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional, and the failure to perfect the appeal renders the judgment of the court final and executory. </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> But like any other rule, the doctrine of immutability of judgment has exceptions, namely: (1) the correction of clerical errors; (2) the so-called <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entries which cause no prejudice to any party; (3) void judgments; and (4) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable. x x x</p> </blockquote> <p> In the aforesaid case, the Court ruled in favor of PHIC as its situation fell within one of the exceptions to the doctrine of immutability of judgment. However, none of the exceptions to the rule was established in the instant case. Verily, for the failure of PHIC to timely appeal the decision of the COA-CGS (upholding ND Nos. 2008-056(07) to 2008-60(07) and HO 2009-001 to 2009-003), the same already became final and executory and cannot anymore be disturbed by the Court. </p><p> Indeed, procedural rules, specifically those prescribing time within which appeals may be taken have been often decreed as absolutely indispensable to prevent delay and to assist in the speedy and orderly administration of justice. It follows that PHIC's mere invocation of interest of substantial justice cannot be taken at face value. The assertion of "'the interest of substantial justice' is not a magic wand that will automatically compel this Court to suspend procedural rules."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Rules are promulgated for the benefit of all and the Court is duty-bound to follow them and observe the noble purpose for their issuance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </p><p> At any rate, even if the Court sets aside the technical rules surrounding the perfection of its appeal, still, the case of PHIC will still fail. </p><p> In <em>Phil. Health Insurance Corp. v. Commission on Audit, et al.</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court had aptly discussed that PHIC has no unrestricted discretion to issue any and all kinds of allowances. It has no unlimited power to adopt compensation and benefit schemes for its employees, <em>viz</em>.: </p><blockquote> <p> The extent of the power of GOCCs to fix compensation and determine the reasonable allowances of its officers and employees had already been conclusively laid down in <em>Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) v. COA</em>, to wit: </p> <blockquote> <p> The PCSO stresses that it is a self-sustaining government instrumentality which generates its own fund to support its operations and does not depend on the national government for its budgetary support. Thus, it enjoys certain latitude to establish and grant allowances and incentives to its officers and employees. </p> <p> We do not agree. x x x</p> <p> Even if it is assumed that there is an explicit provision exempting the PCSO from the OCPC rules, the power of the Board to fix the salaries and determine the reasonable allowances, bonuses and other incentives was still subject to the DBM review. In <i>Intia, Jr. v. COA</i>, the Court stressed that the discretion of the Board of Philippine Postal Corporation on the matter of personnel compensation is not absolute as the same must be exercised in accordance with the standard laid down by law, i.e., its compensation system, including the allowances granted by the Board, must strictly conform with that provided for other government agencies under R.A. No. 6758 in relation to the General Appropriations Act. To ensure such compliance, the resolutions of the Board affecting such matters should first be reviewed and approved by the DBM pursuant to Section 6 of P.D. No. 1597.</p> </blockquote> <p> The Court, in the same case, further elaborated on the rule that notwithstanding any exemption granted under their charters, the power of GOCCs to fix salaries and allowances must still conform to compensation and position classification standards laid down by applicable law. Citing<i> Philippine Retirement Authority (PRA) v. Buñag</i>, We said:</p> <blockquote> <p> x x x <b>[N]otwithstanding exemptions from the authority of the Office of Compensation and Position Classification granted to IRA under its charter, PRA is still required to 1) observe the policies and guidelines issued by the President with respect to position classification, salary rates, levels of allowances, project and other honoraria, overtime rates, and other forms of compensation and fringe benefits and 2) report to the President, through the Budget Commission, on their position classification and compensation plans, policies, rates and other related details following such specifications as may be prescribed by the President.</b></p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p align="center"> x x x x </p><blockquote> <p> x x x As clearly expressed in <i>PCSO v. COA</i>, even if it is assumed that there is an explicit provision exempting a GOCC from the rules of the there is an explicit provision exempting a GOCC from the rules of the then Office of Compensation and Position Classification (<i>OCPC</i>) under the DBM, the power of its Board to fix the salaries and determine the reasonable allowances, bonuses and other incentives was still subject to the standards laid down by applicable laws: P.D. No. 985, its 1978 amendment, P.D. No. 1597, the SSL, and at present, R.A. 10149. <b>To sustain petitioners' claim that it is the PHIC, and PHIC alone, that will ensure that its compensation system conforms with applicable law will result in an invalid delegation of legislative power, granting the PHIC unlimited authority to unilaterally fix its compensation structure. Certainly, such effect could not have been the intent of the legislature.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The recent cases of <i>Philippine Health Insurance Corp. Regional Office-Caraga v. Commission on Audit</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and <i>Philippine Health Insurance Corp. v. Commission on Audit</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> echoed the above-cited ruling.</p><p> Thus, it is settled that in granting any additional personnel benefits, PHIC is required to observe the policies and guidelines laid down by the OP relating to position classification, allowances, among other forms of compensation, and to report to the OP, through the DBM, on its position classification and compensation plans, policies, rates and other necessary details following the guidelines as may be determined by the OP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Moreover, since PHIC failed to present any law or DBM issuance authorizing the grant of the benefits in question, the resulting disbursement and receipt are illegal and therefore, must be disallowed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> At the same time, PHIC's fiscal autonomy alone will not justify the questioned grants. Again, the benefits must either be explicitly indicated under applicable law or specifically authorized by a DBM issuance. Considering that the ruling of the Court on the need for approval from the OP has long been existing, the Court cannot allow PHIC to feign ignorance to the pronouncement. The officers and the BOD of PHIC who approved these benefits are duty-bound to understand the significant rules they must implement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In addition, the COA Proper had previously disallowed similar PHIC payment of 12, 2014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> That officers persisted in the payment despite knowledge of prior disallowances involving expenses of the same or similar nature only bolsters their lack of good faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p><p> Given the foregoing, the Court is unconvinced that the officers of PHIC who approved the benefits in questioned acted in good faith when they approved and granted these benefits. </p><p> The Court, nevertheless, reiterates that the ruling of the COA Proper as regards NO Nos. 2008-056(07) to 2008-60(07) and HO2009-001 to 2009-003 had already attained finality. By reason of this, any discussion on the good faith of the PHIC approving and certifying officers as well as of its personnel who received benefits under these NDs is rendered irrelevant. Verily, following the doctrine of immutability of judgment, the Court can no longer reverse, modify or alter the ruling of the COA Proper which upheld these NDs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></p><p> With respect to the Efficiency Gift disallowed under ND No. HO2009-005-725(08), and following the Court's pronouncement in <i>Madera v.

To stress, while termed as "Efficiency Gift," there is no indication that the disallowed amount was <i>genuinely</i> intended as compensation for services rendered by the recipients. Moreover, pursuant to the principle of <i>solutio indebiti</i> and as specified under Article 2154<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of the Civil Code, whenever a person receives something by mistake, the recipient has the obligation to return or refund the benefit so given, otherwise unjust enrichment on the part of the payee will arise.
