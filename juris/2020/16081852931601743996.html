In fact, as shown in LGU-Isabela's OR No. 1805951 dated March 26, 2004, the GMA fund was only transferred to LGU-Isabela on March 26, 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>To bolster his claim, petitioner noted the following: (1) the differences in the engine and serial numbers for the delivered farm tractors and trailing harrows for the GMA Program and that for the Grains Highway Project; (2) the PO numbers, invoices and ORs of Equity Machineries for the two projects are different; (3) the words <i>General Fund-Loan/DBP</i> were stamped in all documents for the Grains Highway Projects, while for the GMA Program; the words <i>Trust Fund-­NALGU</i> were stamped.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Petitioner averred that he did not conspire with his co-respondents; that LCU-Isabela cleared him of any accountability when he left after Governor Dy lost in the 2004 elections; that he used the clearance issued by the office when he re-entered government service in 2005; and that the act complained of was more than eight years ago.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><center><i>Ruling of the Ombudsman</i><br></center><br>On July 14, 2017, the Ombudsman rendered the assailed Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> finding all the respondents to the Complaint, including herein petitioner, guilty of Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service. The Ombudsman found that respondents to the Complaint, in the discharge of their official administrative functions, exhibited evident bad faith, manifest partiality, and gross inexcusable negligence when they gave Equity Machineries unwarranted benefit, advantage, and preference because of their failure to conduct public bidding in the procurement of the farm tractors and trailing harrow. Consequently, the purchase of four units of MF445 Massey Ferguson 4WD Farm Tractor and four units of ACT 20x24 Trailing Harrow was not only irregular, but was a clear violation of the provisions of Section 10, Article IV of RA 9184, causing undue injury to the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Thus, the Ombudsman ruled:<br><blockquote>For failing to observe the due care and vigilance expected of them in the discharge of their respective duties, and for intentionally distorting the truth in the procurement documents which shows their lack of interests and disposition to cheat, respondents Tumamao, Javier, Nicolas, Bala, Mendoza, Aggari, Mabbayad, and [petitioner] committed a flagrant breach thereof, to the serious damage of the government and the public in general.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis and italics omitted.)<br></blockquote>In th is regard, the Ombudsman imposed upon the respondents to the Complaint, including petitioner, the penalty of dismissal from the service with cancellation of civil service eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, perpetual disqualification from holding public office and bar from taking civil service examinations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On December 11, 2017, petitioner filed a Consolidated Motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated October 30, 2017 invoking a speedy disposition of his case and praying for the dismissal by the Court of similar cases due to inordinate delay; that, as a PBAC member, his function was only necessary when PBAC was called upon to convene.

Reference to brand names shall not be allowed.<br></blockquote>In this case, the specific brands, which are MF445 Massey Ferguson 4WD Farm Tractor and ACT model 20x24 Trailing Harrow<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> prevented possible bids from other suppliers; thus depriving the public from having a qualitative benefit and service from a competitive bidding if only there was a strict compliance with the procedures laid down in IRR-A of RA 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act. <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="40%"><div align="justify"><em>Petitioner's act of issuing a certification despite the clear absence of a public bidding, as one of the material requirements, is in complete disregard of the policy of good governance mandated under Section 2 of RA 9184.

As the Ombudsman ruled, had the respondents acted under the ordinary diligence expected of them, they would have raised timely objections and might have ordered the suspension of the transactions instead of issuing certifications and relying on them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The fact that petitioner knew of the missing public bidding for the 2<sup>nd</sup> purchase of the farm tractors and trailing harrows should have cautioned and prevented him from issuing a certification.<br><br>In conclusion, the acts of the respondents, including herein petitioner, when taken together contributed to the unwarranted benefit, advantage, and preference in favor of Equity Machineries. Specifically, when they failed to conduct a public bidding in the procurement of the farm tractors and trailing harrow. As aptly observed by the Ombudsman in its assailed Decision; thus:<br><blockquote>x x x respondents, in the discharge of their official administrative functions, exhibited evident bad faith, manifest partiality, and gross inexcusable negligence, when they gave Equity Machineries unwarranted benefit, advantage and preference, through their failure to conduct public bidding in the procurement of the farm tractors and trailing harrow. As a result, the purchase of 4 units of MF445 Massey Ferguson 4WD Tractor and 4 units of ACT 20x24 Trailing Harrow was not only irregular but also a clear violation of the provisions of RA 9184, foremost of which is Section 10, Article IV; to the undue injury of the government. Thus, the contract entered into is void as it is against the law and public policy:<br><blockquote>Government contracts shall be void, as against the law and public policy, where a statutory requirement of open competitive bidding has been ignored. As a corollary, agreements directly tending to prevent bidding for covered government contracts may violate public policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> (Emphasis and italics omitted.)<br></blockquote></blockquote>All told, the Court finds that indeed petitioner, together with all other respondents in the case, failed to observe due diligence expected of them in the discharge of their functions, and for intentionally distorting the truth in the procurement documents that shows their lack of interest and disposition to cheat<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> to the serious damage of the government and the public in general.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>As to the penalty, the case calls for the application of two pertinent provisions under the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in Civil Service<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (RRACCS) - Sections 49 and 50, which read in this wise:<br><blockquote>Section 49. <i>Manner of Imposition</i>. - When applicable, the imposition of the penalty may be made in accordance with the manner provided herein below:<br><ol type="a"><li>The minimum of the penalty shall be imposed where only mitigating and no aggravating circumstances are present.<br><br></li><li>The medium of the penalty shall be imposed where no mitigating and aggravating circumstances are present.<br><br></li><li>The maximum of the penalty shall be imposed where only aggravating and no mitigating circumstances are present.<br><br></li><li>Where aggravating and mitigating circumstances are present, paragraph [a] shall be applled where there are more mitigating circumstances present; paragraph [b] shall be applied when the circumstances equally offset each other; <b>and paragraph [c] shall be applied when there are more aggravating circumstances</b>. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></li></ol>Section 50. <i>Penalty for the Most Serious Qffense</i>. - If he respondent is found guilty of two (2) or more charges or counts, the penalty to be imposed should be that corresponding to the most serious charge and the rest shall be considered as aggravating circumstances.<br></blockquote>Petitioner was found guilty of Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service. Hence, applying the above provisions under RRACCS, petitioner was correctly imposed the penalty of dismissal from service with cancellation of civil service eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, perpetual disqualification from holding public office and bar from taking civil service examinations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
