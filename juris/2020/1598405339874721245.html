				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Only the police testified for the prosecution. The actual poseur [-] buyer was not presented, and the police officers were 10 meters away. The alleged contraband was laid out on the table when the barangay official came. There was no testimony on the chain of custody from the attesting officers to the persons who tested the alleged contraband. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In contrast, the accused presented five (5) witnesses from the community to prove that the alleged contraband was not taken from the accused, and that no buy-bust operation occurred. The accused testified that when he was searched, they only found two pesos and fifty centavos (P2.50) on his person. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet, the trial court and the Court of Appeals were willing to send this accused to a life in prison and to impose a fine of P500,000.00 for allegedly selling a stick of marijuana. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We reverse. Efforts of law enforcers to go after the real drug syndicates are undermined by these obviously fictitious arrests. All it accomplishes is alienate our people, enable corrupt law enforcers, and undermine the confidence of our people—especially those who are impoverished and underprivileged—on our court's ability to do justice. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Courts must exercise "heightened scrutiny, consistent with the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt, in evaluating cases involving miniscule amounts of drugs [for] [t]hese can be readily planted and tampered."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This Court resolves an Appeal<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> filed by Ronald Suating y Sayon, alias "Bok" (Suating), from the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-GR CEB HC No. 01702 which affirmed the Regional Trial Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> ruling that he was guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Two separate (2) Informations were filed against Suating for violations of Sections 5<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and 11<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> of Republic Act No. 9165,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.

He saw the poseur [-] buyer approach Suating and engage in a short conversation with him. He also witnessed when Suating left the area of operation, only to return to the poseur [-] buyer after a few minutes. While Suating and the poseur [-] buyer were talking, the latter took out the marked money from his pocket and gave it to Suating. In exchange, Suating handed unknown articles suspected to be marijuana.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br>After the sale, the poseur [-] buyer left the area.

Thereafter, the police officers took his photo, made him sign a document, and later brought him to the Negros Occidental Police Provincial Office where he was made to urinate in a disposable cup.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br>&nbsp;<br>The Regional Trial Court convicted Suating of the charges.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Regional Trial Court did not find merit in Suating's contention that the buy-bust operation did not happen,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> specifying how Suating was apprehended through a well-planned entrapment, which was conducted after monitoring and validation by the police officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Regional Trial Court found the testimonies of police officers Bernil and Libo-on to be "detailed and straightforward[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Hinging on the presumption of regularity in the performance of their official duties, and in the absence of any convincing proof that they have ill intent to falsely testify against Suating, the trial court upheld the testimonies of the arresting officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The dispositive portion of the trial court Decision read: &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED: &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In Criminal Case No. 8451-69, this Court finds accused, Ronald Suating y Sayon a.k.a.

He insisted that the prosecution failed to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, as the identity of the confiscated illicit drugs were not sufficiently proven due to non-conformity with the provisions of Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Court of Appeals ruled against Suating.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It held that the illegal sale transaction was effectively completed when Suating gave the hand rolled marijuana cigarette to the poseur [-] buyer in exchange for the marked money. As to the elements of illegal possession of dangerous drugs, Suating failed to persuade that he had legal authority to possess the marijuana cigarette found when he was frisked.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Moreover, his previous act of selling marijuana to the poseur buyer showed his intention to "freely and consciously "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> possess illicit drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Relative to the alleged non-conformity with the chain of custody, the Court of Appeals underscored that the prosecution was able to prove that there was "no gap or confusion in the confiscation, handling, custody and examination"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> of the confiscated illicit drugs. The dispositive portion of its Decision read:<br><blockquote><b> WHEREFORE, </b> the appeal is <b> DISMISSED. </b> The Decision dated July 29, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 69 of Silay City, in Criminal Case No. 8451-69 to 8452-69, is hereby <b> AFFIRMED.</b> <br>&nbsp;<br><b> SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Emphasis in the original) <br></blockquote>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>On July 27, 2015, the Court of Appeals forwarded the records of this case to this Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> pursuant to its June 10, 2015 Resolution which gave due course to Suating's Notice of Appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In its November 11, 2015 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> this Court noted the records forwarded by the Court of Appeals.

Subsumed in the resolution of this issue is whether or not the police officers complied with the chain of custody as provided for under Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 and its Implementing Rules. &nbsp;<br><br>Suating maintains his innocence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While he concedes that the defense of frame-up and denial is weak, he asserts that this cannot be utilized to further the prosecution's cause, as the latter's evidence "must stand or fall on its own weight and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of [his] defense."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Contrary to the ruling of the Court of Appeals,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Suating claims that the prosecution failed to establish the illegal sale of illicit drugs. Arguing that the police officers were 10 meters away from the area of operation, he insists that it would be impossible for them to observe or even hear what transpired during the alleged transaction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> He then questions why the prosecution failed to present the poseur [-] buyer as witness when only the latter can best ascertain the necessary details surrounding the sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As to the chain of custody in handling the seized illicit drugs, Suating underscores the following irregularities on the part of the police officers:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>First, he points out that the marking of the large stick of marijuana cigarette was done neither in his presence nor in the presence of third-party witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Moreover, Suating emphasizes that during the inventory, the confiscated illicit drugs were already laid down on the table when the barangay officials came.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Hence, they have no personal knowledge on how the items were taken from his possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br>&nbsp;<br>Second, he also stresses that since the body search was belatedly undertaken, there is a possibility that the second item might have been merely planted by the police.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br>&nbsp;<br>Lastly, Suating also stresses his misgivings on whether or not the articles allegedly seized from him were the same ones tested by the forensic chemist in the first place, and eventually, the ones presented in court. He posits that the records failed to provide details on who handled the confiscated illicit drugs after examination and up to the moment they were offered as evidence in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> insists that the statements of PO2 Bernil, who had the opportunity to observe the sale from a distance, duly substantiated the identities of both the buyer and seller.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>&nbsp; That even if the actual dialogue cannot be heard, the actions of both the accused and the poseur [-] buyer supports the conclusion that the sale of illicit drugs did happen.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Office of the Solicitor General also underscores that the testimony of the poseur [-] buyer is neither necessary for conviction nor crucial to a plausible prosecution of the charges. With the statements made by the police officers, the testimony of the poseur [-] buyer is only corroborative.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As to the alleged broken chain of custody, the Office of the Solicitor General claims that PO2 Bernil and PO2 Libo-on were able to ascertain the identities of the marked seized illicit drugs. Further, non-conformity with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 does not immediately render the apprehension of an accused as illegal, or the articles seized inadmissible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, it argues that the defense of frame-up necessarily involves the assessment of the credibility and statements of witnesses. It underscores that, as an often repeated rule that higher courts mostly accede to the evaluation of trial courts, which have the opportunity to hear and observe the actuations of witnesses during the proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> &nbsp; <br><b><center><br>I<br><br></center></b>&nbsp;This Court rules in favor of Suating. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Every criminal proceeding begins with the constitutionally safeguarded presumption that the accused is innocent, which can only be overturn by proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The prosecution has the burden of proof.

Through it, the evidence is separated from the <i> corpus </i> of other similar and correlated evidence, starting from confiscation until its disposal at the close of criminal proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> To be at par with the rule on the chain of custody, the marking of the confiscated articles should be undertaken: (1) in the <i>presence </i>of the accused; and (2) <i>immediately </i> upon seizure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> This effectively guarantees that the articles seized "are the same items that enter[ed] the chain and are eventually the ones offered in evidence[.] "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In this case, the prosecution offered no reason as to why the marking of the seized marijuana labelled "BOK-1" was <i>not </i>immediately done after confiscation, but rather only after a considerable lapse of time, thereto when the poseur buyer was able to leave the area of operation:, <i>away</i> from the sight of the accused. Moreover, they particularly failed to explain why the police officers could not have promptly marked the item in the presence of Suating, if only to remove any uncertainty that the marijuana cigarette marked by PO2 Libo-on, and later subjected to laboratory testing, was the very same one allegedly sold by the accused to the poseur [-] buyer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> Here, an apparent break in the chain of custody already existed before the item was even marked. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Additionally, the prosecution's failure to present the poseur [-] buyer is prejudicial to their cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> To emphasize, the negotiations during the assailed transaction was intimately between the poseur buyer and Suating.&nbsp; PO2 Bernil, whose exact location from the area of operation was not specifically stated, was merely observing from a distance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Considering that the poseur buyer was the one who has personal knowledge of the illegal sale transaction since he was the one who conducted the same, his testimony is not merely corroborative to that of the police officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> The quantity of dangerous drugs here is "so small that the reason for not presenting the poseur[-] buyer does not square with such a miniscule amount."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Moreover, this Court observed that while there was a narration that the confiscated items were inventoried and photographed in the police station,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> it is not, however, clear<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> whether such procedures were done in the presence of the required third-party witnesses. To underscore, the prosecution's narrative in the Court of Appeals' Decision states that both the inventory and photograph of the confiscated articles were undertaken before "an <i> elected public official."</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup>&nbsp; However, in the Appellee's Brief, the mandatory procedures were allegedly made "in the presence of Hon.

Although their absence does not <i> per se </i> make the seized articles inadmissible as evidence, the prosecution must prove that it has acceptable reason for such failure, or a showing that it exerted "genuine and sufficient effort" to secure their presence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> which, in this case, the prosecution failed to do. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The attendance of third-party witnesses is called for in order "to ensure that the chain of custody rule is observed and thus, [it] remove[s] any suspicion of tampering, switching, planting, or contamination of evidence which could considerably affect a case. "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Even assuming that the inventory and photographing of the seized articles were made in the presence of two (2) elected public officials-still, the superfluity cannot justify the absence of the other required personalities therein. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>With the glaring lapses committed by the police officers, which inevitably tainted the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized illicit drugs, we cannot help but subscribe to Suating 's contention that there is a possibility that the marijuana stick allegedly confiscated from his possession was merely planted, considering that the body search was belatedly done at the police station and only after more than an hour from his apprehension.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, the prosecution's narration of facts ended when the confiscated articles were examined by Forensic Officer Puentespina, whose findings under Chemistry Report No. D-217-2011 provided that the items yielded positive for marijuana.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> This finding, however, leaves the following questions unresolved: (1) did the confiscated drugs remain under Forensic Officer Puentespina's custody; and (2) were they conveyed to some other place until their presentation in court as evidence? The lack of details on the post-chemical examination custody<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> of the confiscated illicit drugs creates another substantial gap in the chain of custody rule, particularly on the must accounted "turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Section 21, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 "is a matter of <i>substantive </i>law, and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality; or worse, ignored as an impediment to the conviction of illegal drug suspects."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> Moreover, it "spells out matters that are imperative."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup>&nbsp; Even performing actions, which seemingly near compliance but do not really conform to its requisites, is not enough.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> More so, "when the prosecution claims that the seizure of drugs&nbsp; is the result of carefully planned operations, as is the case here."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> &nbsp;<br><br>In addition, the prosecution cannot merely assert the saving clause under the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9165. Non-confonnity with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 is certainly not fatal to the cause of the prosecution, as long as the lapses committed by police officers in the handling of evidence were "recognized and explained in terms of their justifiable grounds and the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence seized must be shown to have [also] been preserved."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>However, these requirements were not present in this case, since the prosecution, to begin with, failed to acknowledge that there were lapses committed by police officers while dealing with the custody of the seized illicit drugs. These irregularities created major gaps in the chain of custody rule, which, if remained unjustified, is prejudicial to the claim of the prosecution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To emphasize, only 0.15 <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> and 0.14 grams<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> of marijuana were confiscated from accused-appellant. For this reason, courts must exercise "heightened scrutiny, consistent with the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt, in evaluating cases involving miniscule amounts of drugs[,] [for] [t]hese can be readily planted and tampered.
