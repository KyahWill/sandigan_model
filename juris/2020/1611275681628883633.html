				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The constitutional question before the Court is whether Sections 10 and 17 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11212<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> violate the constitutional guarantee of due process and equal protection by providing that the power and electricity distribution system in Iloilo City which is owned by the previous franchise holder Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO) may be acquired by the current franchise holder MORE Electric and Power Corporation (MORE), through the exercise of the right of eminent domain, and applied to the same public purpose of power distribution in Iloilo City.<br><br>This constitutional question is raised in the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>, docketed as G.R. No. 248061, filed by MORE against PECO from the July 1, 2019 Judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Mandaluyong City, Branch 209 (RTC) in Civil Case No. R-MND-19-00571-S, declaring that Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 are unconstitutional legislated corporate takeover of the private assets of respondent PECO by petitioner MORE. The same question is raised in a separate Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>, docketed as G.R. No. 249406, filed by the Republic of the Philippines through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) from the same judgment and proceedings and involving the same facts and parties.<br><br>PECO filed a Motion for Consolidation of G.R. No. 248061 and G.R. No. 249406,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Thereafter, PECO filed an Urgent Omnibus Motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> urging the Court to consolidate the petitions and to resolve the same without further delay on the ground that the continuing dispute over possession of the distribution system twice plunged Iloilo City into darkness just when the city is struggling to deal with the current extreme public health emergency. Moreover, if the dispute will continue, electricity and power interruptions will recur to the prejudice of the health and safety of the residents of the city.<br><br>In view of the highest necessity to resolve the constitutional issue, the Court allows the consolidation of the two petitions and proceeds to resolve the same.<br><br><center><b>Antecedent Facts and Proceedings</b><br></center><br>R.A. No. 11212 grants to MORE a franchise to establish, operate and maintain an electric power distribution system in Iloilo City,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Under Section 10, MORE may "exercise the power of eminent domain" when necessary for the efficient establishment of its service. In particular, it may acquire a distribution system consisting of poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used x x x for the conveyance of electric power to end-users in its franchise area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The distribution system which is currently and actually being used in Iloilo City consists of "5 sub-transmission line substations, 450 kilometers of electrical lines, 20,000 poles, 1,300 transformers and 64,000 electrical meters."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> It is owned by PECO, the holder of the franchise since 1922.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> PECO's franchise.expired on January 18, 2019,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and no new franchise has been issued to it since.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> However, as MORE has yet to set up its service, Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 allows PECO to operate the existing distribution system in the <i>interim</i>.&nbsp; PECO presently operates the system under a Provisional Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) issued by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) on May 21, 2019.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>At the same time, Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 expressly provides that, even as PECO is operating the distribution system, this interim. arrangement shall not prevent MORE from acquiring the system through the exercise of the right of eminent domain. Thus, after R.A. No. 11212 took effect on March 9, 2019, MORE filed on March 11, 2019 a Complaint for Expropriation with the RTC of Iloilo City, Branch 37, over the distribution system of PECO in Iloilo City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Earlier, PECO filed on March 6, 2019 with the RTC a Petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> for Declaratory Relief assailing the constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212, on the ground that these provisions violate the constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection. The RTC issued a Temporary Restraining Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (TRO) on March 14, 2019 enjoining commencement of expropriation proceedings and takeover by MORE of PECO's distribution system in Iloilo City, as well as the issuance of a CPCN to MORE by the Department of Energy (DOE) and Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). The RTC then rendered the assailed judgment on the pleadings, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring Sections 10 and 17 of [R.A.I No. 11212 void and unconstitutional for infringing on PECO's right to due process and equal protection of the law. Consequently, PECO has no obligation to sell and respondent has no right to expropriate PECO's assets under Sections 10 and 17 of [R.A.] No. 11212; and PECO's rights to its properties are protected against arbitrary and confiscatory taking under the relevant portions of Sections 10 and 17 or [R.A.] No. 11212.<br><br>Finally, the Temporary Restraining Order dated 14 March 2019 insofar as it enjoins respondent MORE and/or any of its representatives from enforcing, implementing and exercising any of the rights and obligations set forth under [R.A. No.] 11212, including but not limited to commencing or pursuing the expropriation proceedings against petitioner PECO under the assailed provisions; and takeover by respondent MORE of petitioner PECO's distribution assets in the franchise area is hereby made permanent.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC agreed with PECO that, by virtue of its provisional CPCN, PECO's distribution system is currently being devoted to the public use of electricity distribution; and that, as Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 provide that said distribution system will be expropriated by MORE and devoted to the very same public use, said law amounts to an unconstitutional legislated corporate takeover by MORE of the private property of PECO.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In effect, the expropriation will be nothing but a "corporate [takeover]" impelled by corporate greed rather than by public necessity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Sections 10 and 17 violate the constitutional guarantees of due process by authorizing 18 expropriation proceedings that do not serve a genuine public necessity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The RTC further relied on PECO's argument that Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection in that under these provisions MORE may exercise the power of eminent domain even at the stage of establishing its service. In contrast, other legislative franchises grant electric distribution utilities merely the right of eminent domain as may be reasonably necessary for the efficient "maintenance and operation of [their] services."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The issues and arguments revolving around the foregoing ruling and reasoning of the RTC are both substantive and procedural.<br><br><center><b>Issues and Arguments</b></center><br>As defined in <b>G.R.

No. 248061</b> are clearly related. MORE argues that, contrary to the views of the RTC and respondent PECO, expropriation under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves the distinct emergency public purpose of ensuring the continuous and uninterrupted supply of electricity to Iloilo City, as the city transitions from the old franchise holder to the new franchise holder. There is no prohibition to the application of PECO's distribution system to such distinct emergency public purpose, even as the property is already devoted to a related, but ordinary public purpose, which is the provision of power and electricity to the city.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Moreover, Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 recognize that MORE is differently situated from other distribution utilities. For one, within the franchise area of MORE, there is an existing distribution system that continues to burden public space — that is, this distribution continues to occupy streets, lands and properties owned by the government.<br><br>Finally, "Iloilo end-users have paid for" charges to enable PECO to recover its investments in said distribution system; thus, these end-users are entitled to have the system continuously applied to a public use.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> However, the system is owned by PECO which no longer holds a franchise and is therefore unable to apply the system to the public purpose for which it is intended. Ideally, MORE should dismantle the system to unburden public space and make way for a new distribution system; however, as acknowledged by R.A. No. 11212, the ensuing transition will spell extreme inconvenience to the end-users and ruinous disruption to the local economy.&nbsp; Thus, R.A. No. 11212 devised a means whereby MORE, as the new franchise holder, is authorized to take over the distribution system and apply the same to the service of the public, after expropriation and payment of just compensation to PECO.<br><br>As defined in <b>G.R.

No. 9136<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> delegated to public utilities like MORE the power of eminent domain to enable them to exercise their public function.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 highlighted a specific public need, which is to ease the transition of operations from PECO to MORE by expressly providing that the right of MORE to expropriate the distribution system of PECO for the public purpose of electricity and power distribution system, will not be prejudiced or hampered by the <i>interim</i> authority given to PECO to continue to operate the said system for the very same purpose of power distribution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>To summarize, the common substantive issues raised by MORE and the OSG boil down to whether the RTC erred in ruling that Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 are unconstitutional in that these provisions authorize MORE to expropriate the existing distribution system of PECO and apply it to the very same public use for which it is already devoted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In its Comment in <b>G.R. No. 248061</b>, PECO argues that the lack of franchise does not diminish its constitutional right to due process and equal protection against an illegal expropriation of its distribution system.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> It reiterates that "property of a private corporation that is already devoted to public use cannot be taken for the same use, because no public use or necessity can be served by such a taking"; rather, such taking would be nothing but a corporate takeover for private greed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Concretely, the expropriation of its distribution system by MORE could only be intended to advance the latter's corporate interest rather than the public welfare.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>PECO further assails Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 for allowing MORE to exercise the power of eminent domain even at the stage of establishing its distribution system. Such authority is unprecedented in legislative franchises, and gives MORE an undue advantage in violation of the equal protection clause. What is more, the law even provides for immediate effect of the expropriation upon mere deposit of the assessed value, notwithstanding that issues about the legality of the expropriation might still be pending.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>To summarize, as defined by PECO, the substantive issue is whether the RTC correctly held that expropriation under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A.

No. 249406, as sufficient opportunity to be heard on the constitutional issue. Moreover, the issue on the propriety of the judgment on the pleadings can be resolved along with the merits of the petition.<br><br>On the part of respondent PECO, it sought the dismissal of the Petition, G.R. No. 248061, on the ground that MORE engaged in forum shopping by pursuing, simultaneously, a Petition before the Court, an expropriation proceeding in Iloilo City and a Motion for Reconsideration (through the OSG) before the RTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The Court finds that this procedural point has been rendered moot by the Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated September 10, 2019 of the RTC denying the motion for reconsideration of the OSG, and the Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated November 18, 2019 of the court in Iloilo City suspending the expropriation proceedings.<br><br>The foregoing disposition of the procedural issues clears the way for the resolution of the substantive issues in these consolidated petitions. In the light of the foregoing arguments of the parties, the Court identifies the following underlying legal issues that must be resolved in order for the constitutional question to be addressed:<br><ol><li>Whether or not the distribution system of PECO in Iloilo City can be subjected to expropriation for the same public purpose.<br><br></li><li>Whether or not expropriation of the distribution system under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A.

Though inherent, the power is not absolute, but subject to limitations set out in the Constitution, notably in Section 3, Article III, that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law, and Section 9, that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>These constitutional limitations have been strictly interpreted by the Court, given the risk of impairment to the right of the individual to private property that might result from the exercise by the State of the power of eminent domain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Strict interpretation is warranted even more when a mere agent of the State, such as a public utility, exercises a delegated right of eminent domain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>When the power of eminent domain is exercised by an agent of the State and by means of expropriation of real property,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> farther limitations are imposed by law,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the rules of court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> In essence, these requirements are:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>A valid delegation to a public utility to exercise the power of eminent domain or pursue expropriation proceedings over a particular private property;<br><br></li><li> An identified public use, purpose or welfare for which eminent domain or expropriation is exercised;<br><br></li><li>Previous tender of a valid and definite offer to the owner of the property sought to be expropriated, but which offer is not accepted; and<br><br></li><li>Payment of just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>The resolution of the present petition turns on the first and second requirements.

No. 11212 is in accordance with the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection.</li></ol><b>Distribution system of PECO can be subjected<br>to expropriation for the same public purpose</b><br><br>To recall, the first legal issue is whether the distribution system of PECO can be subjected to expropriation for the same public purpose of power distribution. To address this issue, it is necessary to ascertain the nature of the distribution system of PECO in Iloilo City. To this end, the history of the legislative franchises governing the distribution system is examined below.<br><br>In 1921, Act No. 2983 granted a 50-year franchise to Esteban dela Rama to "install, lay, and maintain on all the streets, public thoroughfares, bridges, and public places within said limits, poles, conductors, interrupters, transformers, cables, wires, and other overhead appliances, and all other necessary apparatus and appurtenances" for the operation of an electric, light, heat and power generation and distribution system (distribution system) in the municipalities of Iloilo, La Paz, Jaro and Arevalo, Province of Iloilo, for a period of 20 years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>As the text indicates, the rights that are dependent on the franchise include not just maintenance and operation, but the very establishment and installation of the distribution system. In effect, the distribution system co­exists with the franchise. This explains why under Section 11 of Act No. 2983, upon termination of the franchise, "all property of the grantee used in connection with this franchise shall become the property of the Insular Government." This particular text in Section 11 can be found in various other legislative franchises in electricity distribution issued from 1914 through 1929."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> An analogous provision can be found in public market franchises, which provides that upon expiration of the franchise, the market building constructed by the franchise holder automatically becomes property of the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The toll facilities franchise of Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines also provides that toll facilities and equipment built to carry out the franchise become government property upon expiration of the franchise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Moreover, Section 17 of Act No. 2983 provides that at any time after 20 years, the national government or a political subdivision "to which the right may be assigned, may purchase, and the grantee shall sell thereto all of his plant, poles, wires, buildings, real estate, and all other property used in the enjoyment of this franchise, at a valuation." This particular text on the government's right of expropriation during the life of the franchise (but after 20 years thereof) can be found in various other franchises from 1914 through 1953.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>In 1922, Act No. 3035 authorized Esteban dela Rama (Dela Rama) to "transfer ail rights and privileges to install, maintain, and operate an electric light, heat, and power plant" to PECO, subject to the terms and conditions of Act No. 2983, including Sections 11 and 17 thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> These terms and conditions were later amended by Act No. 3665, in that the franchise area was expanded to other areas beyond Iloilo, and the franchise period was extended to 50 years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Act No. 3665 deleted the provision in Section 11 of Act No. 2983 on the transfer of the distribution system of PECO to the government upon termination of the franchise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> However, Act No. 3665 retained Section 17 of Act No. 2983 on the government's right to expropriate the distribution system, should it decide to take over the franchise.<br><br>Act No. 3665 also incorporated Act No. 3636,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> which prescribes a template for legislative franchises in electric, light, heat and power generation and distribution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Under Section 13 of Act No. 3636, upon termination or revocation of the franchise, all lands or right of use or occupation of lands and rights obtained by the grantee pursuant to the franchise shall revert to the national or local government that originally owned them.

No. 5360 was extended for 25 years by virtue of a Decision dated January 19, 1994 of the National Electrification Commission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> No copy of this decision is available in the records. There is no evidence that the National Electrification Administration (NEA) Decision modified Section 4 of R.A. No. 5360.<br><br>While the particular provision in Act No. 2983, on outright government takeover of the distribution system, is no longer found in subsequent legislative franchises, there remained a provision on the right of the government to exercise eminent domain for the very same public purpose of electricity distribution. Under Section 17 of Act No. 2983, Act No. 3035 and Act No. 3665, the distribution system is susceptible to expropriation subject to the conditions that it is exercised 1) after the 21 year of the franchise; 2) by the national government or the local government to which the right has been assigned; and 3) upon payment of compensation. Section 4 of R.A. No. 5360 retained remnants of Section 17 of Act No. 2983 by providing that the government may exercise the right of expropriation should it "desire to operate and maintain" the system. In other words, under the foregoing legislative franchises, the distribution system of PECO in Iloilo City is susceptible to expropriation by the government for the very same public purpose of electricity distribution. There is no specific public necessity that can precipitate the exercise of eminent domain; mere desire to operate by the government or mere assignment of the right to operate to a local government or agency is sufficient. It is notable that, while these provisions can be found in PECO's own legislative franchises, PECO never questioned their constitutionality.<br><br>The foregoing history of the legislative franchise of PECO establishes that its distribution system in Iloilo City is no ordinary private property. To begin with, the very installation of the distribution system depends on a franchise. Section 1, Act No. 2983, Section 2, Act No. 3035, Section 1, Act No. 3665 and Section 1 of R.A. No, 5360 all provide that the right to construct, install and establish a distribution system on public space in Iloilo City must be based on a franchise. Ownership was co-existent with the franchise. Moreover, the distribution system is burdened with public use even after the termination of the franchise either by expiration or decision of the government. This is evident in the original franchise under Section 11 of Act No. 2983 and Act No. 3035, which provides that upon expiration of the franchise, the distribution system automatically becomes the property of the government, without mention of payment of compensation to Dela Rama or PECO. Moreover, even before expiration of the franchise of PECO, its distribution system may be taken over by the government and put to the very same public use.<br><br><b>Expropriation by MORE of the distribution<br>system of PECO is for a genuine public purpose</b><br><br>The next legal issue is whether expropriation by MORE of PECO's distribution asset under Sections 10 and 17 of P..A. No. 11212 is for a genuine public purpose. To reiterate, while it is the Congress that defines public necessity or purpose, the Court has the power to review whether such necessity is genuine and public in character, by applying as standards the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>In its assailed Decision, the RTC held that while R.A. No. 11212 authorizes MORE to expropriate the private property of PECO and to apply the same to the public purpose of power distribution, such identified public purpose is not genuine for ultimately it is the private interest of MORE that will be served by the expropriation. In other words, the expropriation is an ill-disguised corporate takeover.<br><br>The RTC relied on American jurisprudence, namely <i>Cary Library v. Bliss</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> and West River <i>Company v. Dix</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> to hold that, no genuine and public necessity will be served when private property that is already devoted to public use is expropriated for the very same public use, as such expropriation will amount to taking private property from A and giving it to B without due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>These American cases law, however, has since been qualified, for at present, taking for the same public purpose in favor of a local government<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> and taking for a similar, but not identical public use<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> are valid. The most relevant development in the jurisprudence of that jurisdiction is <i>Kelo v. City of New London</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> and<i> Berman v. Parker</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> which upheld the expropriation of private property to pave the way for economic development, even when ultimately such development will benefit private business. Other jurisdictions have upheld expropriation of private property for redevelopment and subsequent transfer to private developers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Even without these developments in Western jurisprudence, the genuineness of the public purpose of the expropriation of the distribution system of PECO can be determined from R.A. No. 11212 itself.<br><br>Expropriation under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 is not only for the general purpose of electricity distribution. A more distinct public purpose is emphasized: the protection of the public interest by ensuring the uninterrupted supply of electricity in the city during the transition from the old franchise to the new franchise. This distinct purpose has arisen because MORE is the new franchise holder in a city whose public space is already burdened by an existing distribution system, and that distribution system cannot continue to serve a public use for it is owned by the old franchise holder.<br><br>For purposes of clarity, the relevant portions of Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 are reproduced below:<br><blockquote>SEC. 10. <i>Right of Eminent Domain</i>. — Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services x x x The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 17. <i>Transition of Operations</i>. — In the public interest and to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity, the current operator, Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO), shall in the [<i>interim</i>] be authorized to operate the existing distribution system within the franchise area, as well as implement its existing power supply agreements with generation companies that had been provisionally or finally approved by the ERC until the establishment or acquisition by the grantee of its own distribution system and its complete transition towards full operations as determined by the ERC, which period shall in no case exceed two (2) years from the grant of this legislative franchise.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>This provisional authority to operate during the transition period shall not be construed as extending the franchise of PECO after its expiration on January 18, 2019, and it shall not prevent the grantee from exercising the right of eminent domain over the distribution assets existing at the franchise area as provided in Section 10 of this Act.</blockquote>The public necessity of ensuring uninterrupted electricity is implicit in Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212, which authorizes MORE to expropriate the existing distribution system to enable itself to efficiently establish its service. This distinct public necessity is reiterated in Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 under which MORE may initiate expropriation proceedings even as PECO is provisionally operating the distribution system. In fact, this distinct public necessity of ensuring uninterrupted electricity is the very rationale of the ERC in granting PECO a provisional CPCN.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The provisional CPCN is the legal basis of PECO's continued operation of the distribution system. PECO cannot deny that such distinct necessity to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply is public and genuine.<br><br>Moreover, under R.A. No. 9136, one recognized public purpose is the protection of "public interest as it is affected by the rates and services of electric utilities and other providers of electric power."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The Court has sustained the taking of private property to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity in<i> National Electrification Administration v. Maguindanao Electric Cooperative, Inc.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> It recognized this authority in NEA which, under Presidential Decree No. 269, may order the transfer of the distribution assets of Maguindanao Electric Cooperative, Inc. as the old franchise holder to Cotabato Electric Cooperative, Inc. as the new franchise holder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, R.A. No. 11361<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> recently took effect declaring that the uninterrupted conveyance of electricity from generating plants to end-users is not just a matter of public interest, but already an elevated "matter of national security and is essential to sustaining the country's economic an development.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Without a doubt, the provision of uninterrupted supply of electricity is a public purpose which is distinct from the general purpose of electricity distribution. Such distinct purpose is both public and genuine.<br><br>Finally, MORE points out that the end-users in Iloilo have a stake in the uninterrupted operation of the distribution system, for the charges they have been paying PECO include the cost of recovery of its investment. While it is unfortunate that MORE did not substantiate this important point with data on the structure of the distribution charges and the extent to which payment of these charges by the end-users in Iloilo City have allowed PECO to recover its investment in the distribution system, it remains a valid expectation on the part of the end-users that they will enjoy uninterrupted supply of power and electricity during the transition from the old franchise holder to the new franchise holder. In sum, expropriation by MORE of the distribution system of PECO under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves both the general public interest of conveying power and electricity in Iloilo City and the peculiar public interest and security of ensuring the uninterrupted supply of electricity. The RTC erred in declaring these provisions unconstitutional.<br><br>Justice Leonen dissents on two grounds. First, Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212 is unconstitutional for it simultaneously favors MORE with unwarranted benefits that are not enjoyed by other public utilities that are similarly situated, and discriminates against PECO by allowing expropriation of its assets upon payment of the assessed value rather than the fair market value.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>The Dissenting Opinion reiterates the argument of PECO that, unlike other public utilities, MORE is accorded by law the privilege of expropriating the existing distribution system in the franchise area and immediately taking over the same upon deposit of the full amount of the assessed value. Other public utilities that are similarly situated, namely Mactan Electric Company, Inc. (MECO), Tarlac Electric, Inc. and Angeles Electric Corporation, have the power of expropriation, but not the power of immediate takeover.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>The conceptual premise of the argument is flawed, for which reason the conclusion is faulty. While all are public utilities, MORE is not similarly situated as MECO, Tarlac Electric, Inc. and Angeles Electric Corporation. The latter public utilities are existing franchise holders with existing and functioning distribution systems. MORE is a new franchise holder that is virtually deprived of the option to set up a new distribution system, not only because the existing public space is burdened with the distribution system of the old franchise holder, but also because it must hit the ground running and ensure the uninterrupted and continuous supply of electricity to the city. MORE is therefore peculiarly and doubly burdened. It must not only supply electricity, it must also prevent any disruption that might arise from its takeover of the franchise.<br><br>The Dissenting Opinion adds that MORE is unusually favored with a monopolistic franchise even as it has no track record in the business of power distribution. The dismal performance of PECO as the old monopolistic franchise will not be undone by inflicting a novice public utility like MORE upon the residents of Iloilo City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Unfortunately, the competence of this Court is limited to the determination of the constitutionality of R.A. No. 11212, and does not extend to the assessment of the expertise of MORE or any franchise holder. The ineptitude of the holder does not translate to the unconstitutionality of its franchise. The remedy for that is non-renewal or cancellation, not judicial review.<br><br>As compared to other franchise holders, PECO is not inordinately prejudiced. Its distribution system is no ordinary private property for it has been historically burdened with the public interest of electricity distribution. The distribution system was built on public spaces pursuant to the original franchise of Dela Rama, specifically Section 1 of Act 2983, as well as the transfer and continuation franchise of PECO, specifically Section 1 of R.A. No. 5360. Contrary to the Dissenting Opinion, the termination of the franchise of PECO did not mean that the public purpose for which the distribution system (including the public lands and spaces to which it is attached) was installed automatically ceased. Section 1 of R.A. No. 5360 granted to PECO "the right and privilege to install, lay and maintain on all streets, public thoroughfares, bridges and public places within said limits, poles, wires, transformers, capacitors, overhead protective devices, and pole line hardware, and other equipment necessary for the sale distribution of electric current to the public." Even maintaining possession of the distribution system must be for the original public purpose for which the privilege of installing it was granted.<br><br>In her Dissenting Opinion, Justice Lazaro-Javier extends the concept of bill of attainder to cover Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 in that these legislations purportedly single out PECO and subject the latter to punishment without the benefit of trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> This conception that bills of attainder is problematic for, as correctly pointed out by Justice Leonen in his dissent, a legislative franchise is not a right, but a special privilege the grant, amendment, repeal or termination of which is granted to Congress by no less than the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Consequently, the termination of a franchise by its expiration is not a deprivation of a right or property that amounts to punishment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> There is no question that the franchise of PECO was allowed to lapse because of its failure to render competent public service. No prior judicial trial of the performance of PECO is required before the Congress may decide not to renew PECO's franchise. The power of this Court to subject to judicial review the constitutionality of a franchise legislation does not include the power to choose the franchise holder. That is not our place in the constitutional scheme of things.<br><br>The grant to MORE of the authority to initiate expropriation of the distribution assets of PECO is within the power of Congress to make, subject to the requirements of a valid expropriation. That the assets of PECO will be the subject of expropriation does not signify that it is being singled out. Only PECO has had a franchise over the same area. There is no other previous franchise holder. Only its assets continue to burden public space in the franchise area. If and when other distribution assets are allowed to be installed and to operate in the same franchise area, their expropriation by MORE is not precluded by Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212.<br><br>Going back to the Dissenting Opinion of Justice Leonen, it is correct that the government could have availed of Section 4 to expropriate the distribution system during the term of the franchise. That the government let the franchise lapse without initiating expropriation directly or through an agent does not mean that it is no longer able to do so. There is no shelf-life to the power to expropriate. There is no prohibition against the government initiating expropriation of the distribution system for as long as all the requirements of a valid expropriation are met. In fact, a month after the expiration of the franchise of PECO, the government, through R.A. No. 11212, set into motion the expropriation of the distribution asset by authorizing MORE as its agent.<br><br>The Dissenting Opinion echoes the respondent that the authorization given to MORE to take over the distribution system upon deposit of the assessed value is discriminatory. Both fail to see that Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 still requires payment of just compensation, even as, for the purpose of immediate takeover, it allows mere deposit of the assessed value. Deposit of the assessed value is without prejudice of the determination of just compensation by the RTC in the expropriation case. To reiterate, immediate takeover is warranted by the public necessity for and heightened security interest in the continued and uninterrupted supply of electricity.<br><br>In sum, being peculiarly situated, MORE was validly granted by Section 10 with a unique power of expropriation. Moreover, given that its distribution system is imbued with public interest, PECO was not unusually prejudiced by the reservation in Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212 to expropriate the property. Section 10 is no class legislation. It is constitutional.<br><br>The second ground cited in the Dissenting Opinion of Justice Leonen is that Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 is unconstitutional for it authorizes an expropriation that serve no distinct public purpose and, as such, amounts to a taking without due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>The Dissenting Opinion overlooks that there are two distinct public purposes to be served by the expropriation clause in R.A. No. 11212. One public purpose is power distribution as ordinarily carried out by public electric utility on a day-to-day basis. Another is the public purpose and security interest of preventing any disruption in the supply of electricity during the period of takeover by the new franchise holder from the old franchise holder. No less than PECO invoked this second distinct public purpose when it applied for and operated the distribution system under a provisional CPCN following the expiration of its franchise. To emphasize, when PECO operated the distribution system under the provisional CPCN it did so, not for the ordinary public purpose of power distribution (which it could no longer fulfill), but for the distinct public purpose of forestalling a power interruption during the transition. It is this second distinct public purpose which impels immediate expropriation and takeover of the distribution asset of PECO pursuant to Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212.<br><br>It is true that ultimately MORE will benefit from the expropriation, just as PECO benefited from the grant of the privilege to install the distribution system on public space. However, the benefit to MORE does not detract from the distinct public necessity to be served by the expropriation, as such step would prevent massive and prolonged economic disruption in the city, not to mention oppressive discomfort by its residents.<br><br>Justice Lazaro-Javier argues that Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 virtually enable MORE to piggyback on PECO in order to establish and operate its franchise. Every legislative franchise enables the franchise holder to expropriate with the view of building its distribution system. Even PECO obtained the franchise from Dela Rama along with the authority to use public spaces for the installation of its distribution system. MORE is authorized to acquire the assets of PECO and any other assets of any other entity that might be available as these are necessary for the discharge of its public franchise.<br><br>Finally, the Dissenting Opinion of Justice Leonen misunderstood the import of the discussion on <i>Kelo v. City of London</i>. It is to demonstrate that the RTC's reliance on <i>Cary Library v. Bliss</i> and <i>West River Company v. Dix</i> is misplaced for the jurisprudence in that foreign jurisdiction is still evolving. As summarized by the Court, the current state of that jurisprudence is that taking for the same public purpose, but in favor of a local government or for a similar, but not identical public purpose is valid. The Court need not borrow from this jurisprudence, as there is more than sufficient basis in the facts and law of this to uphold the constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17 of R.A, No. 11212.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant Petitions are <b>GRANTED</b>.

In <i>National Power Corporation v. Posada</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (<i>National Power Corp.</i>), the Court described the two phases of expropriation proceedings as follows:<br><blockquote>Expropriation, the procedure by which the government takes possession of private property, is outlined primarily in Rule 67 of the Rules of Court. It undergoes two phases. The first phase determines the propriety of the action. The second phase determines the compensation to be paid to the landowner, x x x<br><blockquote>[In the first phase, the trial court] is concerned with <b>the determination of the authority of the plaintiff to exercise the power of eminent domain and the propriety of its exercise in the context of the facts involved in the suit</b>. It ends with an order, if not of dismissal of the action, "of condemnation declaring that the plaintiff has a lawful right to take the property sought to be condemned, <b>for the public use or purpose described in the complaint</b> x x x."<br><br>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote></blockquote>Thus, it is not merely the amount of just compensation, <b>but the propriety of the taking itself</b>, which is up for judicial determination by the courts. Accordingly, the evaluation of the propriety of the taking is, in theory, a judicial function. As held in <i>National Power Corp.:</i><br><blockquote>The power of eminent domain is an inherent competence of the state. It is essential to a sovereign. Thus, the Constitution does not explicitly define this power but subjects it to a limitation: that it be exercised only for public use and with payment of just compensation. <u><b>Whether the use is public or whether the compensation is constitutionally just will be determined finally by the courts</b></u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Generally, the propriety of an eminent domain taking is hinged on its "public use." This is implicit from Section 9, Article III of the 1987 Constitution which states that <b>"[p]rivate property shall not be taken for public use</b> without just compensation." The Court, however, reckoned that the exercise of the power of eminent domain is <b>also circumscribed by the due process clause of the Constitution</b>, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>In general, eminent domain is defined as "the power of the nation or a sovereign state to take, or to authorize the taking of, private property for a public use without the owner's consent, conditioned upon payment of just compensation." It is acknowledged as "an inherent political right, founded on a common necessity and interest of appropriating the property of individual members of the community to the great necessities of the whole community."<br><br><b>The exercise of the power of eminent domain is constrained by two constitutional provisions: (1) that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation under Article III (Bill of Rights), Section 9 and (2) that no person shall be deprived of his/her life, liberty, or property without due process of law under Art. III, Sec. 1</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>The term "public use" is undefined in the eminent domain clause of our Constitution. In this regard, the Court recognized that "there is no precise meaning of 'public use' and the term is susceptible of myriad meanings depending on diverse situations."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Historically, there are two (2) views on this matter. The first is the <u>narrow definition</u> of public use – that is "<b>[t]he limited meaning attached to 'public use' is '<u>use by the public</u>' or 'public employment</b>,' that 'a duty must devolve on the person or corporation holding property appropriated by right of eminent domain to furnish the public with the use intended, and that there must be a right on the part of the public, or some portion of it, or some public or quasi-public agency on behalf of the public, to use the property after it is condemned."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> However, this narrow definition of "public use" being equivalent to the "use of the public" has been later superseded by a more expansive definition of the term <b>equating "public use"</b> to <b>"public purpose."</b><br><br>In the United States, where we have patterned our own Constitution, the Supreme Court (SCOTUS), in <i>Kelo v. New London</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (<i>Kelo</i>), explained the evolution of the term "public use" as applied in eminent domain cases:<br><blockquote>[T]his "Court long ago rejected any literal requirement that condemned property be put into use for the general public." <b>Indeed, while many state courts in the mid-19th century endorsed "use by the public" as the proper definition of public use, that narrow view steadily eroded over time. Not only was the "use by the public" test difficult to administer (e.g., what proportion of the public need have access to the property? at what price?), but it proved to be impractical given the diverse and always evolving needs of society. Accordingly, when this Court began applying the Fifth Amendment to the States at the close of the 19th century, it embraced the broader and more natural interpretation of public use as "public purpose."</b> Thus, in a case upholding a mining company's use of an aerial bucket line to transport ore over property it did not own, Justice Holmes' opinion for the Court stressed "the inadequacy of use by the general public as a universal test." <i>Strickley v. Highland Boy Gold Mining Co</i>., 200 U. S. 527, 531 (1906). We have repeatedly and consistently rejected that narrow test ever since.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>As stated in <i>Kelo</i>, the SCOTUS has embraced the broad interpretation of public use as "public purpose," reasoning that not only was the "use by the public" test difficult to administer, but it was also impractical "given the diverse and always evolving needs of society." Thus, the SCOTUS has "repeatedly and consistently rejected that narrow test ever since."<br><br>In our jurisdiction, this Court has acceded to "[t]he more generally accepted view [which] sees <b><u>'public use' as 'public advantage, convenience, or benefit</u></b>, and that anything which tends to enlarge the resources, increase the industrial energies, and promote the productive power of any considerable number of the inhabitants of a section of the state, or which leads to the growth of towns and the creation of new resources for the employment of capital and labor, [which] contributes to the general welfare and the prosperity of the whole community.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In <i>Manapat v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> this Court stated that "the 'public use' requisite for the valid exercise of the power of eminent domain is <u>a flexible and evolving concept influenced by changing conditions</u>. At present, it may not be amiss to state that <b>whatever is beneficially employed for the general welfare satisfies the requirement of public use</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>However, it is well to point out that, at least in the United States, adherence to the expansive definition of "public use" as the standard for eminent domain takings has not gone without any strident dissent.<br><br>In the same case of <i>Kelo</i>, Justice Clarence Thomas (Justice Thomas) lamented that "[t]he Framers embodied that principle in the Constitution, <b>allowing the government to take property not for 'public necessity,' but instead for 'public use</b>.' Defying this understanding, the [SCOTUS] [has] replace[d] the Public Use Clause with a 'Public Purpose' Clause, (or perhaps the 'Diverse and Always Evolving Needs of Society' Clause) x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In addition to defying the "most natural reading of the clause," Justice Thomas also forewarned of the danger of the government taking one's private property and giving it to another private individual, whereby the taking may be legitimized because of "<b>the incidental benefits that might accrue to the public from the private use</b>," <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><b>The most natural reading of the Clause is that it allows the government to take property only if the government owns, or the public has a legal right to use, the property, as opposed to taking it for any public purpose or necessity whatsoever</b>. At the time of the founding, dictionaries primarily defined the noun "use" as "[t]he act of employing any thing to any purpose." 2 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 2194 (4th ed. 1773) (hereinafter Johnson). The term "use," moreover, "is from the Latin utor, which means 'to use, make use of, avail one's self of, employ, apply, enjoy, etc." J. Lewis, Law of Eminent Domain §165, p. 224, n. 4 (1888) (hereinafter Lewis). <b>When the government takes property and gives it to a private individual, and the public has no right to use the property, it strains language to say that the public is "employing" the property, regardless of the incidental benefits that might accrue to the public from the private use</b>. The term "public use," then, means that either the government or its citizens as a whole must actually "employ" the taken property. See <i>id</i>., at 223 (reviewing founding-era dictionaries).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15] </sup>(Emphases supplied)</blockquote>Parenthetically, Justice Thomas reasoned that by defying the natural import of the term "public use," "we are afloat without any certain principle to guide us" since there is "no coherent principle limits what could constitute a valid public use x x x." In contrast, "<b>[i]t is far easier to analyze whether the government owns or the public has a legal right to use the taken property than to ask whether the taking has a 'purely private purpose</b> x x x.' Otherwise, "the Court [would] eliminate public use scrutiny of takings entirely."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In the same vein, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor (Justice O'Connor), in <i>Kelo</i>, argued that by expanding the definition of "public use," the qualifying standard would lose any practical relevance since "<b>nearly any lawful use of real private property can be said to generate some incidental benefit to the public</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Accordingly, there would be no more "constraint on the eminent domain power," <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>In moving away from our decisions sanctioning the condemnation of harmful property use, the Court today significantly expands the meaning of public use. <b>It holds that the sovereign may take private property currently put to ordinary private use, and give it over for new, ordinary private use, so long as the new use is predicted to generate some secondary benefit for the public—such as increased tax revenue, more jobs, maybe even aesthetic pleasure</b>. But nearly any lawful use of real private property can be said to generate some incidental benefit to the public. Thus, if predicted (or even guaranteed) positive side-effects are enough to render transfer from one private party to another constitutional, then the words "for public use" do not realistically exclude any takings, and thus do not exert any constraint on the eminent domain power.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>In this relation, Justice O'Connor cautioned that this broad interpretation of "public use" allows one's property to be taken in favor of those "with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms."'<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In the end, "<b>the government now has license to transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with more</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> This, to her, runs counter to the concept of a just government "which <i>impartially</i> secures to every man, whatever is his own," <i>viz</i>.:</http:></http:><http: supreme="" justia.com="" cases="" federal="" us="" 527="" 627="" #tab-="" opinion-1960553=""><http: law.justia.com="" cases="" massachusetts="" supreme-court="" volumes="" 151="" 151mass364.html=""></http:></http:></div><blockquote><div align="JUSTIFY"><http: supreme="" justia.com="" cases="" federal="" us="" 527="" 627="" #tab-="" opinion-1960553=""><http: law.justia.com="" cases="" massachusetts="" supreme-court="" volumes="" 151="" 151mass364.html="">Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party,

 are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and

 transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with more. 
The Founders cannot have intended this perverse result. "[T]hat alone is

Rutland et al. eds. 1983).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></http:></http:></div></blockquote><div align="JUSTIFY"><http: supreme="" justia.com="" cases="" federal="" us="" 527="" 627="" #tab-="" opinion-1960553=""><http: law.justia.com="" cases="" massachusetts="" supreme-court="" volumes="" 151="" 151mass364.html="">While SCOTUS rulings, much less, opinions of dissenting US Justices, are not binding in our jurisdiction, they are nonetheless persuasive in shaping our own doctrinal bearings. As previously mentioned, this Court has subscribed to the doctrine equating "public use" to mere public interest, public purpose, or public advantage. Thus, as long as the taking of private property subserves some form of general welfare, the public use requisite of the eminent domain clause in our Constitution is met, leaving the amount of just compensation as the only remaining issue.<br><br>Notably, while this Court has held that "[t]he number of people is not determinative of whether or not it constitutes public use, <b>provided [that] the use is exercisable in common and is not limited to particular individuals,"</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><b> still, <u>the <i>discernible divide</i> between a taking that subserves some public interest but at the same time, accommodates a clear private benefit, and which between the two in a particular case is a mere incidence, remain blurry subjects in our current body of jurisprudence</u></b>.<br><br>In <i>Vda. De Ouano v. Republic</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> cited in the 2015 case of National Power Corp., the Court expressed that "the direct use by the state of its power to oblige landowners to renounce their productive possession to another citizen, who will use it predominantly for that citizen's own private gain, is offensive to our laws,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>In <i>esse</i>, expropriation is forced private property taking, the landowner being really without a ghost of a chance to defeat the case of the expropriating agency. In other words, in expropriation, the private owner is deprived of property against his will. Withal, the mandatory requirement of due process ought to be strictly followed, such that the state must show, at the minimum, a genuine need, an exacting public purpose to take private property, the purpose to be specifically alleged or least reasonably deducible from the complaint.<br><br>Public use, as an eminent domain concept, has now acquired an expansive meaning to include any use that is of "usefulness, utility, or advantage, or what is productive of general benefit [of the public]." If the genuine public necessity—the very reason or condition as it were— allowing, at the first instance, the expropriation of a private land ceases or disappears, then there is no more cogent point for the government's retention of the expropriated land. <b>The same legal situation should hold if the government devotes the property to another public use very much different from the original or deviates from the declared purpose to benefit another private person. It has been said that the direct use by the state of its power to oblige landowners to renounce their productive possession to another citizen, who will use it predominantly for that citizen's own private gain, is offensive to our laws.</b><br><br>A condemnor should commit to use the property pursuant to the purpose stated in the petition for expropriation, failing which it should file another petition for the new purpose. If not, then it behooves the condemnor to return the said property to its private owner, if the latter so desires. The government cannot plausibly keep the property it expropriated in any manner it pleases and, in the process, dishonor the judgment of expropriation. This is not in keeping with the idea of fair play.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>This notwithstanding, there is no clear and settled guidance in our cases so as to determine what is "predominant" use for another's own private gain. Rather, what is more compellingly abound in our jurisprudence is the doctrine that the public use requirement is satisfied by the taking being premised on some public advantage, convenience, or benefit.<br><br>However, it must be discerned that the grant of the authority to expropriate is different from the propriety of the expropriation itself. As initially mentioned, this case only concerns the issue of the constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212, which provisions must be examined against the prevailing jurisprudential standard that public use is equal to "whatever is beneficially employed for the general welfare." In this regard, the propriety of the public use anent petitioner MORE Electric and Power Corporation's (MORE) taking of respondent Panay Electric Company, Inc.'s (PECO) specific properties is not yet at issue here. The assailed statutory provisions only accord eminent domain power in favor of MORE, but the actual exercise of such power is still subject to judicial scrutiny in the expropriation proceedings. Hence, perhaps in the proper case where the Court is called to examine the expansive/narrow scope of the public use concept in relation to a specific taking, the Court will be able to amply resolve this quandary. That case may well be the appeal to this Court from the expropriation proceedings involving PECO's properties.<br><br>Nonetheless, I already deem it proper to draw attention to the above divergence of opinions anent the interpretation of "public use" in order to magnify two points relevant to this case:<br><br>First, the broad definition of "public use" seems to create a practical conundrum as to whether or not the propriety of an exercise of eminent domain power, <i><b>when delegated by the State to a franchisee</b></i>, is still properly a judicial function, or just a matter of the judiciary confirming the determination already made by legislature.<br><br>To explain, implicit in the franchise grant is the advancement of public interest. Conceptually, franchisees are given statutory privileges to conduct the covered activities in their franchise for the benefit of the public. Thus, when a franchisee is concomitantly conferred with an eminent domain power to acquire private properties, any taking made under the legal cover of the grantee's franchise will theoretically satisfy the requirement of public use.<br><br>At this juncture, it may not be amiss to point out that while the statutory delegation of eminent domain power to franchisees does not dispense with the need of filing expropriation proceedings before the court, the practical effect, however, is that trial courts are put in an awkward position to defer to Congress' will, else it be accused of frustrating the pursuits of the franchisee who enjoys the imprimatur of the lawmaking body. In fact, it may also be argued that the franchisee's taking under the cover of its franchise will always carry some semblance of public benefit,<b><i> regardless of the private benefit it will gain.</i></b><br><br>To note, this scenario wherein private entities have been delegated eminent domain powers in their respective franchises is not only attendant to MORE, but also to other public utilities. To illustrate, Section 10 of MORE's franchise reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 10. <i>Right of Eminent Domain.</i> - <b>Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the right of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient maintenance and operation of services</b>.

In <i>Kelo</i>, Justice Thomas especially criticized the "almost insurmountable deference to legislative conclusions that a use serves a 'public use,'" <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>A second line of this Court's cases also deviated from the Public Use Clause's original meaning by allowing legislatures to define the scope of valid "public uses."<i> United States v. Gettysburg Electric R. Co.</i>, 160 U. S. 668 (1896), involved the question whether Congress' decision to condemn certain private land for the purpose of building battlefield memorials at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, was for a public use. <i>Id</i>., at 679-680. Since the Federal Government was to use the lands in question, id., at 682, there is no doubt that it was a public use under any reasonable standard. Nonetheless, the Court, speaking through Justice Peckham, declared that "<b><u>when the legislature has declared the use or purpose to be a public one, its judgment will be respected by the courts, unless the use be palpably without reasonable foundation</u></b>." <i>Id</i>., at 680. As it had with the "public purpose" dictum in <i>Bradley, supra</i>, the Court quickly incorporated this dictum into its Public Use Clause cases with little discussion. See, e.g., <i>United States ex rel. TVA</i> v. <i>Welch</i>, 327 U. S. 546, 552 (1946); <i>Old Dominion Land Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 269 U. S. 55, 66 (1925).<br><br><b>There is no justification, however, for affording almost insurmountable deference to legislative conclusions that a use serves a "public use."</b> To begin with, a court owes no deference to a legislature's judgment concerning the quintessentially legal question of whether the government owns, or the public has a legal right to use, the taken property. Even under the "public purpose" interpretation, moreover, it is most implausible that the Framers intended to defer to legislatures as to what satisfies the Public Use Clause, uniquely among all the express provisions of the Bill of Rights. We would not defer to a legislature's determination of the various circumstances that establish, for example, when a search of a home would be reasonable, see, e.g., Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 589-590 (1980), or when a convicted double-murderer may be shackled during a sentencing proceeding without on-the-record findings, see <i>Deck v. Missouri</i>, 544 U. S. ___ (2005), or when state law creates a property interest protected by the Due Process Clause, see, e.g., <i>Castle Rock</i> v. <i>Gonzales</i>, post, at _______; <i>Board of Regents of State Colleges</i> v. <i>Roth</i>, 408 U. S. 564, 576 (1972); <i>Goldberg</i> v. <i>Kelly</i>, 397 U. S. 254, 262-263 (1970).<br><br>Still worse, it is backwards to adopt a searching standard of constitutional review for nontraditional property interests, such as welfare benefits, see, <i>e.g., Goldberg, supra</i>, while deferring to the legislature's determination as to what constitutes a public use when it exercises the power of eminent domain, and thereby invades individuals' traditional rights in real property. The Court has elsewhere recognized "the overriding respect for the sanctity of the home that has been embedded in our traditions since the origins of the Republic," <i>Payton, supra,</i> at 601, when the issue is only whether the government may search a home. Yet today the Court tells us that we are not to "second-guess the City's considered judgments," ante, at 18, when the issue is, instead, whether the government may take the infinitely more intrusive step of tearing down petitioners' homes. Something has gone seriously awry with this Court's interpretation of the Constitution. Though citizens are safe from the government in their homes, the homes themselves are not. <b>Once one accepts, as the Court at least nominally does, <i>ante</i>, at 6, that the Public Use Clause is a limit on the eminent domain power of the Federal Government and the States, there is no justification for the almost complete deference it grants to legislatures as to what satisfies it</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote>As Justice Thomas pointed out, with the prevailing legal regime, "when the legislature has declared the use or purpose to be a public one, <b>its judgment will be respected by the courts, unless the use be palpably without reasonable foundation</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> However, with our expansive definition of public use, where - in Justice O'Connor's words - "<b>nearly any lawful use of real property can be said to generate some incidental benefit to the public</b>,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> it would be quite difficult to tag any taking done under the cover of a franchise as "unreasonable." Most probably, it would only be in <b>extreme cases where the taking is completely and wantonly without any public purpose</b> that our courts can validly rule against the propriety of a franchisee's taking of another's private property. In so doing, for as long as this wanton and complete unreasonableness does not exist, a taking may be done to advance private benefit.<br><br>This brings me to my second and final point: the expansive definition of public use as mere taking for some public interest, purpose or benefit appears to legitimize the regime of allowing franchisees to take private properties, irrespective of the franchisee's private gain. As I have discussed, this Court has yet to draw any clear delineation between the commingling of private interests with public purposes when it comes to eminent domain takings. Neither has our Court prohibited the delegation of eminent domain powers to franchise holders albeit being private entities. In fact, the Court recognizes that the power of eminent domain may be delegated "even to private enterprises performing public services."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In this case, Associate Justices Marvic M.V.F. Leonen and Amy C. Lazaro-Javier strikingly present the background facts which show that MORE was intentionally benefited by Congress to the prejudice of PECO. PECO, despite being the longstanding franchise holder of electric distribution in Iloilo City for 96 years, has now been ousted from its statutory privilege to so operate. <i>As to whether or not PECO deserves to continue its franchise or whether MORE is qualified as a new franchisee is clearly beyond the province of the Court as it is a pure political question left to the wisdom of Congress</i>. However, more than the stripping of PECO's franchise, PECO - it is claimed - stands to lose its entire operation system, goodwill, and even employees through an explicit statutory enactment which not only recognizes a new franchisee but also enables the latter to practically take over PECO's business at the cost of paying the fair market value of its assets. To this point, it may be posited that while PECO may be able to realize "just" compensation, it is effectively left as a shell corporation. Further, despite receiving the "fail- market value" of its properties, PECO would get paid much less than if it openly deals with a buyer in the market. Unlike in judicial proceedings, business and trade acumen may be utilized when one sells assets in the open market. Also, it is pertinent to note that the "fair market value" of a former franchisee's assets may be diluted in value since some of them may prove to be un-utilizable by the owner considering that it had already been stripped of the franchise, and thus, diminishing their future utility. Hence, in the hands of the previous franchisee, the assets may be valued less at the time of the taking.<br><br>Nevertheless, in theory, PECO's precarious situation is actually legitimized by our prevailing framework on eminent domain. Hypothetically speaking, there is nothing legally prohibiting the government to delegate the eminent domain power to a private entity embedded in its franchise, and in so doing, allow the takeover of the properties of the previous franchisee upon the reason that the taking is - in the language of our numerous franchise laws - "actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted."<br><br>In fine, up until our current paradigm on "public use" <i>completely</i> or <i>partially</i> shifts, Section 10 - and its corollary provision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Section 17<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> of RA 11212 - are in accord with subsisting doctrine, and hence, constitutional.

Section 10 confers unwarranted benefits to a specific corporation, i.e., More Electric—benefits that are not conferred to other public utilities similarly situated to it. Equally, Section 10 burdens and discriminates against a specific corporation, Panay Electric Company, Inc. (Panay Electric Company), by deeming the latter's assets subject to expropriation and acquirable by the payment of the assessed value of the properties, a mere percentage of what could be the negotiated price payable to Panay Electric Company, had it and More Electric dealt in the open market.<br><br>Furthermore, the taking allowed under Section 10 is not for public use. Section 10 permits the taking of private property already devoted to the same public purpose by an entity with no experience whatsoever in electricity distribution, and who will be operating as a monopoly; therefore, there will be no benefit to the public. The taking serves nothing but private interests. Section 17 of Republic Act No. 11212, in turn, enables the application of Section 10 by legislatively mandating the corporate takeover of Panay Electric Company by More Electric. This is not a case of a true expropriation, but rather a confiscation of property and a shameless violation of Article III, Sections 1 and 9 of the Constitution. Sections 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. 11212 must be struck down.<br><b><center><br>I<br></center></b><br>The Constitution in Article III, Section 1 provides that "[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws." The equal protection clause mandates that "all persons under similar circumstances . . . must be treated in the same manner . . . both in the privileges conferred and the liabilities imposed."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Consequently, class legislation, or a law that discriminates against some, but favors others, is prohibited.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The prohibition on class legislation does not mean that valid classifications cannot be created by law. However, to be valid, the classification must — at the very least—conform to the traditional standard of reasonableness.

Here, the challenged provision is Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212, which delegates to More Electric Power Corporation the right of eminent domain. Eminent domain, or the State's inherent power to forcibly acquire private property for public use upon payment of just compensation,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[9]</sup></font> necessarily involves the right to property. In turn, the right to property is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution, specifically under Article III, Section 1, and Article III, Section 9, among others. Therefore, We must apply the strict scrutiny, or the compelling state interest test, in resolving the present case.<br><br>Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212, particularly states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 10. <i>Right of Eminent Domain</i>. — Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. <u>The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided, That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid:</u><br><br><i>Provided, further</i>, <u>That upon the filing of the petition for expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the assessed value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid</u>. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties being expropriated in order to determine their assessed value. (Underscoring provided)</blockquote>As worded in the provision, More Electric may:<br><blockquote>[A]cquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area[.]</blockquote>Furthermore, upon notice to the owner of the properties and upon deposit of the full amount of their assessed value, the provision entitles More Electric to immediately take over the properties sought to be expropriated. While nowhere named in Section 10, Panay Electric Company is implicitly referred to in the provision, it being the owner of the private property "previously, currently or actually used" in the distribution of electricity in Iloilo.<br><br>To my mind, Section 10 grants unwarranted benefits to More Electric—benefits that are not granted to other public utilities similarly situated to it. Section 10 is an example of class legislation proscribed by the equal protection clause.<br><br>When read in isolation, Section 10 appears to be consistent with the Constitution, law, and judicial prerogatives. Section 10 requires that the provisional amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property be paid upon entry to the property sought to be expropriated, consistent with Rule 67, Section 2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of the Rules of Court on expropriation. Section 10 even speaks of a "final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid[,]" again, seemingly consistent with Article III, Section 9<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of the Constitution, and that the determination of just compensation is an exclusively judicial function as held in <i>Export Processing Zone Authority v. Dulay</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and <i>National Power Corporation v. Spouses Zabala</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> among others.<br><br>However, when read in conjunction with the legislative franchises of other public utilities, Section 10 clearly gives More Electric undue benefits.<br><br>Section 10 allows More Electric to immediately take possession, control, and even demolish, the properties expropriated upon payment of the assessed value of the properties. This amount is significantly lower than that payable to Panay Electric Company, had the government—during the 95-year effectivity of Panay Electric Company's franchise—chosen to expropriate the latter's properties. To recall, More Electric's franchise requires it to deposit an amount equivalent to the full amount of the assessed value of the properties sought to be expropriated.<br><br>In contrast, Panay Electric Company's legislative franchise, Republic Act No. 5360, provided that the government must pay Panay Electric Company the fair market value of its properties, had the government chosen to operate the electricity distribution system for itself. In other words, Panay Electric Company's franchise required that the full amount of just compensation required under the law be paid before the Government can take Panay Electric Company's properties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Section 4 of Republic Act No. 5360 provided:<br><blockquote>SECTION 4. It is expressly provided that in the event the Government should desire to operate and maintain for itself the system and enterprise herein authorized, the grantee shall surrender its franchise and will turn over to the government all equipment therein at fair market value.</blockquote>By definition, the assessed value of a piece of property is that determined by a local government unit for purposes of real property taxation. It is a mere percentage<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and therefore, necessarily lower, than the fair market value or "the price at which a property may be sold by a seller who is not compelled to sell and bought by a buyer who is not compelled to buy[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> This is a marked difference in the amount payable upon immediate taking, and is one clear economic benefit to More Electric; a grant that, in my view, serves no compelling state interest. That the government has delegated the power of eminent domain to other electric distribution utilities <i>without the same benefit</i> emphasizes that the benefits granted to More Electric Power are unwarranted.<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="0" border="1"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="39%"><div align="center"><strong>Mactan Electric<br>&nbsp; Company, Inc. <br> [Republic Act No. <br> 10890 (2016)] </strong></div></td> <td width="29%"><div align="center"><strong>Tarlac Electric, Inc.<br>&nbsp; [Republic Act No.<br>&nbsp; 10795 (2016)]</strong></div></td> <td width="32%"><div align="center"><strong>Angeles Electric <br> Corporation <br> [Republic Act No. <br> 9381 (2007)]</strong></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">SECTION 9. <i>Right of Eminent Domain.</i> — Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the right of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient maintenance and operation of services.

Nowhere does Section 10 mention Panay Electric Company, at least directly. However, the provision cannot be read in any other way except that More Electric will conduct its business at the expense of <i>Panay Electric Company.</i><br><br>To recall, Section 10 enables More Electric to "acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment <i>previously, currently or actually used</i>, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized."<br><br>Further, the owner of these distribution facilities "previously, currently or actually used" is no other than Panay Electric Company, it being the previous franchise holder that had exclusive authority to operate an electricity distribution facility in Iloilo City. While Section 10 seemingly allows More Electric to expropriate property other than those owned by Panay Electric Company, still, More Electric could operate an electricity distribution business and prevent further brownouts in Iloilo <i>only </i>by forcefully acquiring Panay Electric Company's assets.<br><br>In its Petition for Review on Certiorari, More Electric repeatedly averred that Panay Electric Company's franchise had already expired, and More Electric, being the current franchise holder, has the sole authority to operate the power distribution system in Iloilo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It is true that a power distribution system is a public utility that may be operated only with a legislative franchise. Furthermore, there cannot be any vested right in the continued grant of a franchise, a franchise being a mere privilege that is always subject to amendment or even repeal by the State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, a franchise only relates to the privilege of <i>operating</i> a public utility,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The ownership over the assets used to operate the public utility, on the other hand, is an entirely different matter. The assets of the private corporation operating a public utility are private property, and ownership over these assets remains with the former franchise holder, notwithstanding the expiration of the franchise.<br><br>The right of ownership is composed of a bundle of rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> These rights include, firstly, the right to enjoy the thing owned, or <i>jus utendi</i>, which further includes the right to receive from the thing what it produces.<br><br>Second, the owner of a thing also has the right to consume it by its use, otherwise called <i>jus abutendi.</i><br><br>Third, the right to dispose, or <i>jus disponendi</i>, is also included in this bundle of rights.<br><br>Finally, an owner has the right to exclude others from the possession of the thing or <i>jus vindicandir</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>With the expiration of the franchise, what the former franchise holder surrenders is the right to use the property, and the right to enjoy income from it. What remains are: (1) the right to dispose of the property; as well as (2) the right to exclude others from its possession. Except, if as one of the terms of the grant of the franchise, the former franchise holder likewise surrendered these rights.<br><br>That a franchise holder owns the assets used to operate the public utility is precisely why there are eminent domain provisions in legislative franchises. Specifically for Panay Electric Company, among the terms of its franchise is that it surrender the equipment used for electricity distribution at fair market value, should the Government choose to operate and maintain for itself the electricity distribution system.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Panay Electric Company's franchise expired without the Government exercising the privilege in Section 4 of Republic Act No. 5360. Therefore, Panay Electric Company remains the owner of the electricity distribution system it had established in Iloilo, with the concomitant right to dispose of or exclude others from possessing the electricity distribution system.<br><br>Consequently, just because More Electric is the current franchise holder, it does not automatically mean that it can operate the power distribution system unquestionably owned by another private entity.

It was in Kelo where the United States Supreme Court held that private property may be taken for purposes of "economic development," the promotion of which "is a traditional and long accepted function" of government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Strong dissents were registered in <i>Kelo</i>. In Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's dissenting opinion, she decried that:<br><blockquote>[u]nder the banner of economic development, all private property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner, so long as it might be upgraded—i.e. given to an owner who will use it in a way that the legislature deems more beneficial to the public—in the process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> </blockquote>Chief Justice William Rehnquist joined her in her dissent, along with Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.<br><br>Expounding further on why "economic development" is too vague to be considered as "public use" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, she said:<br><blockquote>In moving away from our decisions sanctioning the condemnation of harmful property use, the Court today significantly expands the meaning of public use. It holds that the sovereign may take private property currently put to ordinary private use, and give it over for new, ordinary private use, so long as the new use is predicted to generate some secondary benefit for the public—such as increased tax revenue, more jobs, maybe even aesthetic pleasure. But nearly any lawful use of real private property can be said to generate some incidental benefit to the public. Thus, if predicted (or even guaranteed) positive side-effects are enough to render transfer from one private party to another constitutional, then the words "for public use" do not realistically exclude <i>any</i> takings, and thus do not exert any constraint on the eminent domain power.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73] </sup>(Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>Justice O'Connor warned that under the <i>Kelo </i>ruling, only those with significant influence and power in the political process will be benefited by "economic development" takings:<br><blockquote>Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms. As for the victims, the government now has license to transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with more. The Founders cannot have intended this perverse result. "[T]hat alone is a just government," wrote James Madison, "which <i>impartially</i> secures to every man, whatever is his <i>own</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>Justice Thomas agreed with Justice O'Connor, but went further to say that the United States Supreme Court had unduly expanded the meaning of "public use." Thus, he recommended that "public use" be narrowly reinterpreted to mean "use by the public," the way the Framers of the Constitution of the United States had intended it to be.<br><blockquote>"When we depart from the natural import of the term 'public use,' and substitute for the simple idea of a public possession and occupation, that of public utility, public interest, common benefit, general advantage or convenience. . . we are afloat without any certain principle to guide us." . . . Once one permits takings for public purposes in addition to public uses, no coherent principle limits what could constitute a valid public use. . . It is difficult to imagine how a court could find that a taking was purely private except by determining that the taking did not, in fact, rationally advance the public interest. . . The Court is therefore wrong to criticize the "actual use" test as "difficult to administer." ... It is far easier to analyze whether the government owns or the public has a legal right to use the taken property than to ask whether the taking has a "purely private purpose" - unless the Court means to eliminate public use scrutiny of takings entirely.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup></blockquote>Further, Justice Thomas said that the courts are not duty-bound to defer to legislative determinations of public use:<br><blockquote>There is no justification, however, for affording almost insurmountable deference to legislative conclusions that a use serves a "public use." To begin with, a court owes no deference to a legislature's judgment concerning the quintessentially legal question of whether the government owns, or the public has a legal right to use, the taken property. Even under the "public purpose" interpretation, moreover, it is most implausible that the Framers intended to defer to legislatures as to what satisfies the Public Use Clause, uniquely among all the express provisions of the Bill of Rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></blockquote>The foregoing discussions of <i>Berman</i> and <i>Kelo</i> show that the cases do not apply here. The properties were expropriated in Berman and Kelo for a public use different from that to which they were initially devoted to. Besides, More Electric sought to expropriate Panay Electric Company's properties, not for economic development, but supposedly for the uninterrupted supply of electricity in Iloilo.<br><br>Further, diametrically opposed to the rulings in <i>Berman</i> and <i>Kelo</i>, this Court's 1919 ruling in <i>City of Manila v. Chinese Community of Manila</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> remains true: whether a taking under the power of eminent domain is for public use is a judicial question. In <i>City of Manila v, Chinese Community of Manila</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><blockquote>It is true that many decisions may be found asserting that what is a public use is a legislative question, and many other decisions declaring with equal emphasis that it is a judicial question. But, as long as there is a constitutional or statutory provision denying the right to take land for any use other than a public use, it occurs to us that the question that whether any <i>particular use</i> is a public one or not is ultimately, at least, a judicial question. The legislature may, it is true, in effect declare certain uses to be public, and, under the operation of the well-known rule that a statute will not be declared to be unconstitutional except in a case free, or comparatively free, from doubt, the courts will certainly sustain the action of the legislature, unless it appears that the particular use is clearly not of a public nature. The decisions must be understood with this limitation; for, certainly, no court of last resort will be willing to declare that any and every purpose which the legislature might happen to designate as a public use shall be conclusively held to be so, irrespective of the purpose in question and of its manifestly private character. Blackstone in his Commentaries on the English Law remarks that, so great is the regard of the law for private property that it will not authorize the least violation of it, even for the public good, unless there exists a very great necessity therefor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote>The present case is a classic example of abuse of eminent domain powers and a deprivation of property without due process of law. Under a semblance of legitimacy, a private entity is allowed to take private property for its own proprietary interests. A law was passed to mask a forced corporate takeover by a private entity.

Thus, we have consistently ruled that statutes and executive issuances fixing or providing for the method of computing just compensation are not binding on courts and, at best, are treated as mere guidelines in ascertaining the amount thereof.

The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: <i>Provided</i>, That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid:<br><br><i>Provided, further</i>, That upon the filing of the petition for expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the assessed value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation.

The applicable generation rate shall be the provisional or final rate approved by the ERC.<br><br>This provisional authority to operate during the transition period shall not be construed as extending the franchise of PECO after its expiration on January 18, 2019, and it shall not prevent the grantee from exercising the right of eminent domain over the distribution assets existing at the franchise area as provided in Section 10 of this Act. During such interim period, the ERC shall require PECO to settle the full amount which the ERC has directed to refund to its customers in connection with all the cases filed against it.<br><br>To reduce the length of the transition period, the ERC and all agencies issuing the requisite licenses shall prioritize all applications relevant to the establishment and operation of the distribution system under its franchise.<br><br>The grantee shall, as far as practicable and subject to required qualifications, accord preference to hiring former employees of PECO upon commencement of business operations.<br><br>An information dissemination campaign regarding public services and operations of the grantee shall be made to all end-users in the franchise area.<br><br>The grantee and PECO shall jointly ensure that employees not hired by the grantee shall receive all separation and/or retirement benefits they are entitled to in accordance with applicable laws.<br><br>The DOE shall, during the transition, ensure that there will be uninterrupted supply of electricity in the existing franchise area.</blockquote>Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO) argues in the main that the power of eminent domain delegated to More Electric and Power Corporation<br><br>(MORE) amounts to a confiscatory, ill-disguised takeover of its corporate assets, and is therefore violative of PECO's constitutional rights to due process and equal protection.<br><br>I concur with the <i>ponencia</i> that this argument does not hold water. I furthermore agree with the ponencia's holding that the aforementioned provisions which authorize the grantee, MORE, to expropriate the existing distribution assets of PECO at the franchise area, and provide for transition of operations, respectively, pass constitutional muster.<br><br>The power of eminent domain, essentially legislative in nature, may be validly delegated to local government units, other public entities, and public utilities, such as MORE, an electric power distribution utility. The scope of this delegated legislative power is narrower than that of the delegating authority and may only be exercised in strict compliance with the terms of the delegating law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>But for all its primacy and urgency, the power of expropriation is by no means absolute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The limitation is found in Section 9, Article III of the 1987 Constitution, which provides that: "Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation." Clearly, the two essential limitations on the power of eminent domain are that: (1) the purpose of taking must be for public use; and (2) just compensation must be given to the owner of the private property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> These constitutional safeguards serve as a check on the possible abuse of this power and circumscribe the excessive encroachment on the property rights of the individual.<br><br>For this purpose, the Court has recognized that the term "public use," which traditionally was limited to actual use by the public, has evolved in this jurisdiction to include "whatever is beneficially employed for the community."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Conversely, when the taking is for a <i>purely</i> private purpose, such that there is no perceptible benefit flowing to the public, the taking ought to be struck down for being unconstitutional. It is repugnant to our laws to use the power of eminent domain over private property <i>predominantly </i>for purposes of another citizen's private gain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The Court has hewed to this principle, which was first enunciated in the old American case of <i>Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> that notwithstanding the inherent power of the State to expropriate all property, the Constitution does not sanction the taking of a private party for the <i>sole purpose</i> of transferring it to another private party, even when there is payment of just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>At the same time, the right to take private property for public purposes must necessarily originate from "the necessity" and the taking must be limited to such necessity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The burden of proving the necessity is borne by the State, which takes precedence before resolving any issue involving just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The necessity need not be absolute but only a reasonable or practical necessity, such as would combine the greatest benefit to the public with the least inconvenience and expense to the condemning party and the property owner consistent with such benefit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> If genuine public necessity is absent or eventually ceases, the expropriation of the private property cannot continue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In this regard, it is my view that despite the enormous power of eminent domain, the constitutional limitations on its exercise is an explicit recognition of the protection accorded to one's right to property,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The power affects an individual's right to private property, a constitutionally-protected right necessary for the preservation and enhancement of personal dignity and intimately connected with the rights to life and liberty. As such, the need for a circumspect operation of this exercise cannot be overemphasized.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The Court, under its expanded power of judicial review, retains the authority to determine whether there is grave abuse of discretion in the exercise of the power of eminent domain. The Court's judicial function is not stymied by the expanded definition of public use, especially when the purported public use is merely incidental or pretextual, thereby serving as a guise to favor private interests.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In other words, the elements of public purpose and genuine necessity must be clearly shown. A bare invocation that the taking is for a public purpose or is attended with genuine necessity should never serve as an automatic and absolute guarantee to the Court that the taking is legal.<br><br>Taking all the foregoing limits on the exercise of the power of eminent domain in consideration, I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the assailed provisions of R.A. 11212 do not suffer from constitutional infirmities.<br><br><i>The authority granted to MORE under<br>Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. 11212 is<br>reasonably necessary for the exercise<br>of its franchise</i><br><br>A careful examination of the limits of the power of eminent domain under the peculiar factual circumstances of this case yields to the conclusion that the grant to MORE of the delegated power was imperative for the urgent and important public purpose that MORE was tasked to undertake under its franchise. Prior to the award of the legislative franchise to MORE, PECO was the lone electric power distribution utility in Iloilo City for 96 years, or close to a century. This rather distinct situation, in my view, was a crucial factor in the legislative decision to craft Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. 11212.<br><br>From 1923 until January 18, 2019, PECO was a holder of a franchise to establish, operate, and maintain a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end-users in Iloilo City. Since its franchise was granted, PECO established a distribution system consisting of 5 sub-transmission line substations, 450 kilometers of electrical lines, 20,000 poles, 1,300 transformers and 64,000 electrical meters. Personnel under its employ numbered to around 400.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> For the longest time, the residents of Iloilo City were exclusively<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> serviced by PECO, the sole franchise holder for the operation of an electric power distribution utility.<br><br>Its position as the sole operator of the electric power distribution utility in Iloilo City is typical in the industry, as the energy distribution sector has always been a natural monopoly. Since the operation of an electric power distribution utility involves extremely high-fixed costs, it would be more efficient if only one producer services the community.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Hence, the assailed provisions, which purportedly granted MORE "unwarranted benefits" and "discriminate" against PECO,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> should be appreciated in light of these unique factual circumstances. MORE, as a new player in the electric power distribution sector, naturally needs to establish, as opposed to merely maintain, its services.<br><br>In this regard, it is inaccurate to compare the franchise of MORE with other electric power distribution utilities, as Associate Justice Marvic Leonen would have it,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> because these comparisons stand on unequal footing. The other electric power distribution utilities cited in the Dissenting Opinion of Justice Leonen have franchises which were renewed, extended, or granted due to their having previously operated in the area covered by their new franchises. Thus:<br><ol><li>Mactan Electric Company, Inc. started its initial operations in 1967.

To hold otherwise would effectively constrain Congress to continuously renew the existing franchise of the current operator despite its sub-par service, until another prospective operator has built its own capital assets. However, given the high-fixed costs and other barriers to entry, few players, if any, will even attempt to enter the industry without first securing a franchise.<br><br>Neither is MORE given unwarranted benefits when Section 10 of R.A. 11212 granted it the authority to take possession of expropriated properties after the payment of a provisional amount based on their <i>assessed value.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> True, had the government proceeded to expropriate PECO's assets pursuant to its legislative franchise under R.A. 5360, the government is obliged to pay the <i>fair market value</i> of PECO's properties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> But textually, Section 4 of R.A. 5360 reveals that the provision contemplates a government takeover during the lifetime of PECO's franchise. By virtue of this provision, the government is granted the option to operate the electric power distribution system itself, cutting short PECO's franchise without requiring the prior deposit or payment of any provisional value before the government enters the property expropriated. Thus, the fair market value on which the payment of just compensation is based pertains to the final amount that the government would have paid had it proceeded to take over PECO's operations. In contrast, the assessed value referred to in Section 10 of R.A. 11212 is the provisional amount that MORE should deposit in order to immediately possess the property being expropriated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It is not the final amount of compensation contemplated in Section 4 of R.A. 5360.<br><br>The payment of a provisional amount less than the fair market value, in order to possess the property expropriated, is also not a unique requirement applicable to MORE alone. The payment of the assessed value of the property is likewise provided in Section 2,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Rule 67 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Upon the deposit of this provisional amount, the issuance of the writ of possession is a ministerial duty on the part of the trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Also, under R.A. 7160<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> or the Local Government Code, the LGU may enter the property expropriated upon the deposit of 15% of the fair market value based on the current tax declaration of the property to be expropriated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Clearly, MORE was not granted unwarranted economic benefits by Section 10.<br><br>At any rate, Section 10 does not, by any means, foreclose or limit the payment of just compensation on the basis of the assessed value as this is, again, merely a provisional amount. MORE is still liable for the full amount of just compensation to be determined during the expropriation proceedings on the basis of, among other things, the market value of the property.<br><br>Certainly, after MORE takes possession of the expropriated property belonging to PECO, PECO is entitled to the payment of the full amount of just compensation, which is the full and fair equivalent of the loss incurred by the affected owner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In determining the amount of just compensation, the trial court is bound to consider the market value of the property and the current value of like property, among other things. In addition, interest would be awarded as an indispensable part of just compensation, in order "to ensure that the owner is fully placed in a position as whole as he was before the taking occurred."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In other words, in compliance with the constitutional mandate on eminent domain and as a basic measure of fairness,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the State would be required to pay interest to compensate PECO for the opportunity cost of immediately losing its property without receiving immediate full payment therefor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> As such, PECO would be entitled to receive the real, substantial, full and ample equivalent of the properties lost.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In this light, Section 10 of R.A. 1 1212 does not serve to narrow the court's parameters in determining just compensation by limiting it to the assessed value only. It is therefore erroneous to compare the assessed value in Section 10 of R.A. 11212 on the one hand, and the fair market value in Section 4 of R.A. 5360 on the other, in order to arrive at a conclusion that MORE received an unusual economic benefit by virtue of its franchise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Ultimately, the determination of just compensation in expropriation cases always factors in the fair market value of the property.<br><br>Given that proper expropriation proceedings would still be, as they have in fact already been, instituted,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> as provided for under Section 10, there is likewise no merit to the observation of Associate Justice Amy Lazaro-Javier that the provision has effectively rendered judicial proceedings for the expropriation of PECO's properties as a mere ceremonial procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Section 10 is a provision of delegation by Congress to the grantee, which merely gives it the authority to exercise the power of eminent domain. Section 10 relevantly and explicitly provides that the exercise would be subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, that proper expropriation proceedings shall be instituted, and that just compensation shall be paid therefor.<br><br>As constructed, nothing in Section 10 shows that judicial proceedings for expropriation would be but an empty exercise. In fact, it sets out a restriction against expropriation to what may be <i>reasonably</i> necessary for the general purposes of the services of PECO. This includes the "efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services." For the specific purpose of "<i>acquiring</i> private property, such as poles, wires, cables, transformers, and other machinery and equipment," the language of the provision even shifts significantly from a mere reasonable necessity to one of being "<i>actually</i> necessary for the realization of the purpose for which [R.A. 11212] is granted." This, to my mind, provides a guide to and a standard for the court to follow during the trial for the expropriation proceedings that have been instituted. With this language, the safeguard afforded by the legislature against any abuse of the delegated right of eminent domain to MORE is, at once, evident.<br><br>In sum, while the exercise of the power of eminent domain over the electric power distribution facilities of PECO may garner benefits in favor of MORE, this would be but incidental. Notably, its duties as a public utility would nonetheless remain regulated by the government. At the end of the day, at the proper expropriation proceedings instituted for the purpose, the abiding reality would be for the court to be satisfied with evidence proffered by MORE — that its intended taking would invariably be for the good of the public, is actually necessary, and that there is just compensation therefor.<br><br><i>The authority granted to MORE under<br>Sections 10 and 17 is not meant to<br>punish PECO without a judicial trial</i><br><br>It must be borne in mind that this case involves the expiration of the exclusive franchise of a previous grantee and the subsequent act of Congress of granting a franchise to another applicant which has satisfactorily shown its capacity to carry the work, not only for commercial purposes, but for the public interest of ensuring the continuous and uninterrupted supply of electricity in the franchise area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> This is the proper context by which this case should only be viewed. As it stands, as well, the petition itself does not challenge either the legislative act of granting the franchise to MORE or the denial of PECO's application for extension.<br><br>Accordingly, R.A. 11212, particularly Sections 10 and 17, cannot be validly characterized as a bill of attainder, as Justice Lazaro-Javier advances in her Dissenting Opinion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> A bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punishment on individuals or members of a particular group without judicial trial. For a law to be considered a bill of attainder, it must be shown to contain all of the following: (a) a specification of certain individuals or a group of individuals; (b) the imposition of a punishment, penal or otherwise, and (c) the lack of judicial trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> For the second element, Justice Lazaro-Javier cites American jurisprudence in laying down the three factors in determining whether the statute was punitive: (a) whether it fell within the historical meaning of legislative punishment; (b) whether, viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed, it could reasonably be said to further non-punitive legislative purposes; and (c) whether it evinced an intent to punish.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> None of these factors are evident here.<br><br>R.A. 11212 cannot be classified as a bill of attainder simply because Sections 10 and 11 do not constitute "punishments" in the sense of the bill of attainder clause as it has been interpreted. To suggest that R.A. 11212 was enacted for the purpose of punishing PECO is, to say the least, an overstretch and a diminution of the legitimate purpose and intent of Congress behind the enactment of the law. R.A. 11212 involves a grant of a franchise to MORE and nothing else. It bears stressing that the grant of a franchise is not a right but a mere privilege, and to construe the non-renewal of PECO's franchise as a punishment is wholly baseless and completely unwarranted.<br><br>Moreover, a review of the deliberations, as cited by Justice Lazaro- Javier, shows that Congress was not motivated by an intent to punish PECO. The explanatory note of House Bill No. (HB) 8132, the precursor bill to the legislative franchise of MORE, stated that the quality of service of PECO had been wanting over the years. Among the complaints against it were: overbilling or overcharging, poor customer relations, distributor-related power outages, inadequately maintained lines, inadequate investment in distribution facilities, and inordinate delay in the restoration of power services. The explanatory note stated further that PECO's historical abuse and inefficiency pose as obstructions to the economic growth of Iloilo City and to its people's welfare, health, and well-being. These findings were confirmed by a representative from the Energy Regulatory Commission during the legislative hearing for HB 8132, in addition to the findings on the dismal financial condition of PECO.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> It has been repeatedly stated in these deliberations that the legislature's primary concern has been to secure the continuous and efficient supply of electricity in Iloilo City.<br><br>Consequently, the identification of PECO's shortcomings, which eventually led to the non-renewal of its franchise, was not meant to inflict any punishment against PECO so as to consider R.A. 11212 as a bill of attainder. Contrary to Justice Lazaro-Javier's claim, PECO was not being "singled out" for being "expressly identified as the wrongdoer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Rather, it was simply part and parcel of the whole legislative process in the grant or renewal of franchises. Necessarily, as PECO was the previous franchise holder for close to a century and the issue concerned the renewal or grant of said franchise, there was a need to examine the performance of PECO. This was not done to punish PECO but to determine whether its franchise should be renewed. It was but natural and reasonable to expect that an evaluation of PECO's performance as the existing franchise holder would come into play.<br><br>Thus, given PECO's track record of inefficiency and shortcomings in providing public service to the residents of Iloilo City, the legislature found it wise to discontinue its franchise and to grant the authority instead to MORE. The expiration then of PECO's franchise, coupled with its distinct position as the only existing electric power distribution utility in Iloilo City, demonstrates that legitimate reasons impelled Congress to bestow on MORE the authority to expropriate distribution facilities existing in the franchise area and to provide for a smooth transition of PECO's operations.<br><br>In the same manner, the fact that MORE is a new player in the industry and that there is no guarantee that it will be able to serve the public better than the former owner is not enough reason to invalidate Section 10.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The Constitution does not require, for a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain, that the public is served in an "ideal" way. It suffices that the power is exercised for public use which, to reiterate, covers "whatever is beneficially employed for the community."<br><br>In fine, I remain convinced that Sections 10 and 17, viewed as integral parts of the grant of franchise in R.A. 11212, are constitutional. The rationale of these provisions cannot be overturned by potential unconstitutional effects resulting from a distrustful reading. It must be underscored that the grant of a franchise is constitutionally committed to the Legislative department. This has to be considered with the presumption of constitutionality "rooted in the doctrine of separation of powers which enjoins upon the three coordinate departments of the Government a becoming courtesy for each other's acts. The theory is that every law, being the joint act of the Legislature and the Executive, has passed careful scrutiny to ensure that it is in accord with the fundamental law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The Court can go no further than to inquire whether Congress had the power to enact a law. It cannot delve into the wisdom of policies Congress adopts or into the adequacy under existing conditions of measures it enacts. The equal protection clause is not a license for the courts "to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Consonant with this principle is another deep-rooted doctrine that on the side of every law lays the presumption of constitutionality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> This strong predilection for constitutionality takes its bearings on the idea that it is forbidden for one branch of the government to encroach upon the duties and powers of another. If there is any reasonable basis upon which the legislation may firmly rest, the courts must assume that the legislature is ever conscious of the borders and edges of its plenary powers, and has passed the law with full knowledge of the facts and for the purpose of promoting what is right and advancing the welfare of the majority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>The presumption of constitutionality may, of course, be challenged. Challenges, however, shall only be sustained upon a clear and unequivocal showing of the bases for invalidating a law and not merely a doubtful, speculative, or argumentative one.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In other words, the grounds for nullity must be beyond reasonable doubt, for to doubt is to sustain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> In this regard, I find no invalidity or unreasonableness that appears on the face of the assailed provisions, or is established by proper evidence which could rebut the presumption.<br><br>Finally, the wisdom of the grant of franchise to MORE should not be determinative of the constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The Court cannot look into allegations that R.A. 11212, specifically its Sections 10 and 17, was enacted solely to benefit MORE to the prejudice of PECO. The delegated power of eminent domain under Section 10 is authorized by Section 23<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> of the EPIRA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; It is also not limited for the sole purpose of expropriating PECO's properties, and like any other franchise holder delegated with the power of eminent domain, its exercise is subject to constitutional and statutory requirements. On the other hand, Section 17 on the transition of operations between MORE and PECO can reasonably be read as impelled by public interest in preventing interruptions in the distribution of electric power in Iloilo City, and as a measure of social justice in favor of the displaced PECO employees. Both of these reasons are within the Legislative department's power to provide. Beyond these expressed purposes are speculations that the Court should not consider.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, I concur with the majority decision to <b>GRANT</b> the petitions and to declare Sections 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. 11212 as NOT <b>UNCONSTITUTIONAL</b></http:></http:></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><http: supreme="" justia.com="" cases="" federal="" us="" 527="" 627="" #tab-="" opinion-1960553=""><http: law.justia.com="" cases="" massachusetts="" supreme-court="" volumes="" 151="" 151mass364.html=""><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><br></sup></http:></http:></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><http: supreme="" justia.com="" cases="" federal="" us="" 527="" 627="" #tab-="" opinion-1960553=""><http: law.justia.com="" cases="" massachusetts="" supreme-court="" volumes="" 151="" 151mass364.html=""><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> AN ACT GRANTING MORE ELECTRIC AND POWER CORPORATION A FRANCHISE TO ESTABLISH, OPERATE, AND MAINTAIN, FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FOR THE CONVEYANCE OF ELECTRIC POWER TO THE END USERS IN THE CITY OF ILOILO, PROVINCE OF ILOILO, AND ENSURING THE CONTINUOUS AND UNINTERRUPTED SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY IN THE FRANCHISE AREA, February 14, 2019.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> See <i>Heirs of Alberto Suguitan v.

A DU is a natural monopoly. Allowing more than one DU within the same geographical area will result to a higher electricity rates (<i>sic</i>) for consumers within that geographical area.<br><br>A natural monopoly is a monopoly in an industry in which high infrastructural cost and other barriers to entry relative to the size of the market gives the largest suppliers in an industry[,] often the first supplier in the market[,] an overwhelming advantage over potential competitors, x x x<br><br>Let's assume that we have two distribution utilities, namely: Blue DU and Red DU. Blue DU is the old distribution utility while Red is the new distribution utility. Both DUs are operating [in] Color Cloud Town[.] Color Cloud Town has 50 electric consumers. All 50 electric consumers are originally consumers of Blue DU. Blue DU has a capital investment of 100. Blue's distribution charge is determined by dividing its capital with the number of its consumers as follows: 100 divided by 50 is equivalent to two. Number two represents the distribution charge for all 50 consumers of Blue at that time [as] the sole DU in Color Cloud Town. After some time, Red entered the electric distribution market and began building [its] own distribution facility. Red's initial capital is 30 and was able to convince 10 electric consumers in Color Cloud Town to change its electric distribution's service [provider]. Similar to Blue, Red['s] distribution [charge] is determined by dividing its capital with the number of its consumers as follows: 30[,] the investment[., divided by 10[,] the number of consumers[,] is equivalent to three. Three represents the distribution charge for the first 10 electric consumers of Red. On the other hand, as Blue's consumers decrease, its distribution charge is recomputed x x x by dividing its capital with the number of its consumers x x x [which] is equivalent to 2.5, the 2.5 represents the distribution charge for the remaining electric consumers x x x of Blue.<br><br>As provided in the above illustration, an increase in the number of DUs operating in the market, will ultimately result to higher distribution rates chargeable not only by the new DU by the previously existing DU because of the reduction in the number of consumers sharing the capital cost."

The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties being expropriated in order to determine their assessed value.<br><br>SECTION 17.

During such interim period, the ERC shall require PECO to settle the full amount</b> which the ERC has directed to refund to its customers in connection with all the cases filed against it.<br><br>To reduce the length of the transition period, the ERC and all agencies issuing the requisite licenses shall prioritize all applications relevant to the establishment and operation of the distribution system under its franchise.<br><br><b>The grantee shall</b>, as far as practicable and subject to required qualifications, <b>accord preference to hiring former employees of PECO</b> upon commencement of business operations.<br><br>An information dissemination campaign regarding public services and operations of the grantee shall be made to all end-users in the franchise area.<br><br>The grantee and PECO shall jointly ensure that employees not hired by the grantee shall receive all separation and/or retirement benefits they are entitled to in accordance with applicable laws.<br><br>The DOE shall, during the transition, ensure that there will be uninterrupted supply of electricity in the existing franchise area.</blockquote><b><i>A. Essence of a bill of attainder</i></b><br><br>Bills of attainder have often been associated with criminal statutes. There is however <b>no reason not to use</b> the proscription against them to <b>civil statutes</b> that mirror what bills of attainder do in the criminal setting.<br><br>Functionally and traditionally, bills of attainder as well as ex post facto laws have been invoked to nullify civil statutes or regulations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The <b>essence </b>of a bill of attainder is the <b>substitution of a legislative for a judicial determination of the legitimacy of a deprivation.</b> The constitutional ban against bills of attainder serves to implement the <b>principle of separation of powers</b> by <b>confining legislatures to rule-making and thereby forestalling legislative usurpation of the judicial function.</b><br><br>History in perspective, <b>bills of attainder</b> were employed <b>to suppress government takings of life or property involving unpopular causes</b> and political minorities, and it is <b>against this evil</b> that the constitutional prohibition is directed. Thus:<br><blockquote>ON reviewing the U.S. Constitution, <b>it is easy to assume that the document contained no takings protection language prior to the addition of the Fifth Amendment, as part of the Bill of Rights. In reality, however, a takings protection was inserted directly into the body of the Constitution in 1787. This was the ban on bills of attainder,</b> found in Article I, Sections 9 and 10. <b>A bill of attainder is an egregious taking of life or property by an arbitrary legislative act, and the ban on bills of attainder was primarily meant to protect the people from such arbitrary takings by the government</b>. During the antebellum period, construing the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection was well known, and lawyers and judges frequently referred to this ban. It was only after the Civil War that this commonly understood takings protection faded gradually into disuse, primarily because of the Fourteenth Amendment's incorporation doctrine. Today, this protection is all but forgotten.<br><br><b>Recognizing the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection greatly aids in understanding several constitutional issues that have otherwise not been fully understood</b>. For example, seeing the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection helps in understanding why the Eleventh Amendment's passage was in large measure a reaction to potential attainder lawsuits against the states. We also better understand why the ban on <i>ex post facto</i> laws only needed to apply to criminal matters, and <b>more clearly see how takings law/attainders were a driving force for separating governmental powers, particularly between the legislature and the judiciary</b>. Finally, we can better understand why many of the founders - particularly James Madison - so greatly feared factions as the greatest threat to the new republic. In short, the ban on bills of attainder illuminates the early workings of the new constitutional republic in America.<br><br><b>This article mostly draws from the founders' comments at the Constitutional Convention and the antebellum case law that treats the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection. The jurists' and practitioners' statements in these early cases - including comments from such luminaries as John Marshall and Daniel Webster - demonstrate their understanding of the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection, independent of the Fifth Amendment</b> or any other state takings language. Likewise, their statements about the ban on bills of attainder clarify the other constitutional doctrines discussed in this article.<br><br><b>Even though the antebellum era has long since passed, the concept that the ban on bills of attainder is a takings protection and its clarification of other constitutional doctrines has value for us today. There is no compelling reason why the antebellum understanding of bills of attainder is any less legitimate now than back then</b>. To be sure, the Fifth Amendment protections now apply to state takings due to the Fourteenth Amendment's incorporation doctrine. But this application in no way negates the ongoing potential effectiveness of using the ban on bills of attainder in the Constitution as a takings protection. <b>Indeed, there will be times that the ban on bills of attainder will be a better fit for a particular judicial problem than the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments. Examples could include legislation targeting unpopular groups or groups holding property which the government wants. Accordingly, courts today should consider applying this provision of the Constitution as a takings protection, just as the courts formerly did</b>. If they do, the courts will discover that it will not only serve to protect the innocent from arbitrary takings, but that it will also help clarify constitutional doctrines today as it did in former times.

Therefore, if one follows American jurisprudence, one must also consider whether the provision <b>could still be construed as amounting</b> to a legislative determination of guilt and punishment.<br><br>In <i><b>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc</b></i>., a public utility <b>wished to pass on the costs of a power outage</b> to the consumers. A replacement generator had been purchased fifteen (15) years prior to the outage, but was not installed until the defective generator finally failed. A prior agreement was in place whereby Consolidated Edison could <b>pass certain costs on to its ratepayers in the form of temporary rate increases</b> subject to statutory review by the New York Public Service Commission. The Assembly and Senate, however <b>passed a bill</b> without amendment, thus:<br><blockquote>§1. ...By continuing to operate steam generators known to be defective, and thereby increasing the risk of a radioactive release and/or an expensive plant outage, the <b>Consolidated Edison Company failed to exercise reasonable care on behalf of the health, safety and economic interests</b> of his customers. <b>Therefore it would not be in the public interest for the company to recover from ratepayers any costs</b> resulting from the February 15, 2000 outage at the Indian Point 2 Nuclear Facility.</blockquote>The prohibition on recovering the cost extended to base rates "or any other rate recovery mechanism."<br><br>The appellate court stated that an <b>indispensable element</b> of a bill of attainder is the fact that <b>it defines past conduct as wrongdoing</b> and then <b>imposes punishment on that past conduct</b>. The court considered <b>three (3) factors</b> in determining <b>whether the statute was punitive:</b><br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether it fell within the <b>historical meaning of legislative punishment</b>,<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether, viewed in terms of the <b>type and severity of burdens imposed</b>, it could <b>reasonably be said to further non-punitive</b> legislative purposes, and<br><br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether it evinced an <b>intent to punish</b>.</blockquote>The court focused on the last two (2) criteria, finding that <b>eliminating harm to innocent third parties</b> is a <b>purpose consistent with punishment, and that general and specific deterrence are traditional justifications for punishment</b>. The court determined that <b>a quite substantial proportion of the costs</b> in question <b>could have been passed on unchallenged in a routine</b> generator replacement. <b>Nothing but punishment could justify preventing</b> Consolidated Edison from <b>passing these</b> costs on to ratepayers. The court also found that the <b>legislative history clearly evinced an intent to punish.</b><br><br><i><b>Consolidated Edison</b></i> is also <b>remarkable</b> in the <b>clearly punitive intentions</b> voiced by the <b>legislators themselves</b> and the inference which can be<b> drawn from the language</b> of the provision itself. Clearly, the court in that case was of the view that <b>the legislature had concluded that the act of the public utility in failing to replace the generator was worthy of sanction, and viewed the legislation as imposing that sanction.</b><br><br><b><i>United States v. Lovett</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> concerned a provision which decreed that <b>no salary or other compensation was to be paid to certain employees</b> of the Government, specified by name, unless they were again appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The individuals in question allegedly had communist leanings. The court found that the purpose of the legislation was <b>permanently to bar</b> those individuals <b>from government service because of</b> what Congress thought about <b>their political beliefs</b>. The court further stated that <b>the provision achieved the same purpose as would a statute which designated the conduct as criminal</b>. The court, too, rejected the argument that the section did not provide for the dismissal of the individuals, but merely forbade governmental agencies to compensate them for any work.<br><br><i><b>Lovett</b></i> is notable because <b>the subjects of the provision were singled out from other government employees because of their political views, and were publicly blacklisted</b>. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that the <b>legislative intention</b> was <b>to punish the subjects for their beliefs and to make an example of them in order to deter others.</b><br><br>In the same vein, <i><b>Acorn v. United States</b></i> mentioned that the element of <b>punishment</b> involved the consideration of <b>three (3) interdependent factors:</b><br><blockquote>(1) whether the challenged statute falls within the <b>historical meaning of legislative punishment (historical test of punishment)</b>; (2) whether the statute, "viewed in terms of <b>the type and severity of burdens imposed, reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes" (functional test of punishment</b>); and (3) whether <b>the legislative record "evinces a [legislative] intent to punish" (motivational test of punishment)</b>. Selective Serv. Sys., 468 U.S. at 852, 104 S.Ct. 3348. All three factors need not be satisfied to prove that a law constitutes "punishment;" rather, "th[e] factors are the evidence that is weighed together in resolving a bill of attainder claim." Con. Edison, 292 F.3d at 350.</blockquote>According to <i><b>Acorn</b></i>, "the Supreme Court has recognized that certain types of punishment are 'so <b>disproportionately severe and so inappropriate to nonpunitive ends</b> that they <b>unquestionably have been</b> held to fall within the proscription of the [Bill of Attainder Clause]'." Confiscation of one's property is one that has <b>long been recognized</b> as a type of punishment.<br><br>The <b>functional test of punishment</b> looks at the <b>type and severity of the burdens imposed</b>. Essentially, it answers the <b>question</b>, <i>what will happen to the attainted entity, will it close shop and eventually be driven out of any business whatsoever and into bankruptcy?</i> Thus:<br><blockquote>"A <b>grave imbalance or disproportion between the burden and the purported nonpunitive purpose suggests punitiveness, even where</b> the statute bears some <b>minimal relation</b> to nonpunitive ends." Id.; accord Con. Edison, 292 F.3d at 350 ("Where a statute establishing a punishment declares and imposes that punishment on an identifiable party ... we look beyond simply a <b>rational relationship</b> of the <b>statute to a legitimate public purpose</b> for <b>less burdensome alternatives</b> by which the <b>legislature could have achieved</b> its <b>legitimate nonpunitive objectives</b>."</blockquote>The <b>motivational test of punishment</b> examines the<b> intent of the legislators</b> in enacting the statute - upon the <b>legislature's determination</b> that the <b>attainted entity</b> was guilty of abusive and fraudulent practices. This test looks for the <b>declaration of guilt</b> of the attainted entity by the legislature during its deliberations or in the statute itself and a congressional trial to determine such guilt. The standard of proof is clear legislative intent to punish.<br><br>To summarize, the <b>test of punishment</b> involves two (2) steps. <b>First</b>, identify if the legislation <b>looks at past conduct as a wrongdoing. Second</b>, determine if the legislation<b> imposes burdens or deprivations</b> on that <b>past conduct</b>. To complete the second step in the test,<b> consider the three (3) factors</b> in resolving <b>whether the statute is punitive</b>: (a) whether it fell within the <b>historical meaning of legislative punishment</b>, (b) whether, viewed in terms of the <b>type and severity of burdens imposed</b>, it could reasonably be s<b>aid to further non-punitive</b> legislative purposes, and (c) whether it evinced an<b> intent to punish</b>.<br><br>Lastly, in <i><b>Cummings v. Missouri,</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> it was held that a legislation is nonetheless a bill of attainder <b>even if</b> the persons or entities are <b>singled out</b> and <b>punished only indirectly</b>, that is, the punishment does <b>not directly</b> <b>follow </b>from the ascription of wrongdoing in the legislation. Thus:<br><blockquote><b>If the clauses</b> of the second article of the constitution of Missouri, to which we have referred, <b>had in terms declared that Mr. Cummings was guilty</b>, or should be held guilty, of having been in armed hostility to the United States, or of having entered that State to avoid being enrolled or drafted into the military service of the United States, <b>and, therefore, should be deprived</b> of the right to preach as a priest of the Catholic Church, or to teach in any institution of learning, there could be no question that the clauses would constitute a bill of attainder within the meaning of the Federal Constitution.<b> If these clauses, instead of mentioning his name, had declared that all priests and clergymen within the State of Missouri were guilty of these acts, or should be held guilty of them, and hence be subjected to the like deprivation, the clauses would be equally open to objection</b>. And, f<b>urther, if these clauses had declared that all such priests and clergymen should</b> be so held guilty, and <b>be thus deprived, provided they did not</b>, by a day designated, <b>do certain specified acts, they would be no less within the inhibition</b> of the Federal Constitution.<br><br>In all these cases there would be the <b>legislative enactment creating the deprivation without any of the ordinary forms and guards provided for the security of the citizen in the administration of justice</b> by the established tribunals.<br><br>The results which would follow from clauses of the character mentioned do follow from the clauses actually adopted. The difference between the last case supposed and the case actually presented is one of form only, and not of substance.<br><br>The <b>existing clauses presume the guilt</b> of the priests and clergymen, <b>and adjudge the deprivation</b> of their right to preach or teach <b>unless the presumption be first removed by their expurgatory oath</b> - in other words, <b>they assume the guilt</b> and <b>adjudge the punishment conditionally.</b> The clauses supposed differ only in that <b>they declare the guilt instead of assuming it. The deprivation is effected with equal certainty</b> in the one case as it would be in the other, <b>but not with equal directness. The purpose of the lawmaker in the case supposed would be openly avowed; in the case existing it is only disguised. The legal result must be the same, for what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly.</b> The Constitution deals with substance, not shadows. Its inhibition was levelled at the thing, not the name. It intended that the <b>rights of the citizen should be secure against deprivation for past conduct by legislative enactment, under any form, however disguised</b>. If the inhibition can be evaded by the form of the enactment, its insertion in the fundamental law was a vain and futile proceeding.</blockquote><br><i><b>iii. Lack of judicial trial</b></i><br><br>To illustrate, the <b>proper</b> procedure for the taking of private property and the<b> improper</b> manner of doing it have been <b>spelled out</b>, as follows:<br><blockquote>If a legislature or state agency wants to take property, the <b>proper </b>procedure entails <b>designating the property to be taken, filing a lawsuit identifying the property and its owners</b>, and <b>allowing the owners to contest the compensation</b> that the legislature or state agency offers. This procedure essentially refers the consummation of <b>the taking to the judiciary</b>. This process happens all the time today and is relatively well understood. Other than the initial designation of land to be taken, <b>the entire procedure takes place in the judicial branch.</b><br><br>A <b>bill of attainder seeks to bypass</b> this procedure. It <b>identifies the property to be taken</b>, and then <b>brazenly takes it</b>, frequently with <b>the excuse that the legislature is merely punishing an unworthy individual or group</b>. No meaningful procedure is allowed for protest, and compensation is ignored. A structural check on legislative aggrandizement is the very heart and soul of the ban on bills of attainder and the essence of the separation of powers. As Justice Chase said in <i>Calder v. Bull</i>:<br><br>These <b>acts [of attainder] were legislative judgments; and an exercise of judicial power</b> ... The <b>ground </b>for the <b>exercise of such legislative power was this, that the safety of the kingdom depended on the death, or other punishment, of the offender</b>: as if traitors, when discovered, could be so formidable, or the government so insecure! With very few exceptions, the advocates of such laws were stimulated by ambition, or personal resentment, and vindictive malice. To prevent such, and similar, acts of violence and injustice, I believe, the Federal and State Legislatures, were prohibited from passing any bill of attainder.<br><br>Justice Chase's articulation corresponded with the understanding of his fellow jurists and practitioners during the antebellum period. Attorneys making arguments to the courts during this time often identified <b>the ban on bills of attainder</b> as a l<b>egislative intrusion into the judicial sphere</b>, and as a <b>takings protection</b>.</blockquote><i><b>C.

The <b>court proceedings for expropriation</b> have become a <b>fait accompli</b> with the outcome <b>already decided</b> by <b>legislative fiat.</b><br><br>The <b>next element</b> already <b>resolved by Congress</b> to exist is <b>genuine public necessity</b>.

Section 17 <b>reinforces </b>this <b>determination</b> of <b>genuine public necessity</b> when it <b>mentions PECO</b> and <b>authorizes </b>the <b>expropriation</b> of properties within the franchise area <b>that are actually necessary</b> for the franchise, namely, those mentioned in Section 10.<br><br>So did the <b>congressional deliberations</b> quoted below, which <b>confirmed</b> that the <b>only way for MORE</b> to <b>establish, operate</b>, and <b>maintain</b> its franchise is <b>for it to take over PECO's properties</b>.<br><br>What is problematic about Section 10 and Section 17 is the <b>preclusion</b> of any debate on the <b>genuine public necessity of expropriating</b> PECO's "<i>poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment</i>." Section 10 is categorical - it <b>mentions</b> the foregoing properties as examples of those properties that are "<b>actually necessary</b> for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted." Section 10 and Section 17 <b>forestall a judicial determination</b> as to the <b>genuine public</b> necessity for the taking of these properties.<br><br>In <i><b>Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance</b></i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the public <b>necessity </b>warranting the transfer of properties from one private owner to another private owner, as in the present case,<b> must be nothing short</b> of "<b>urgent cases</b>, or <b>cases of the first necessity.</b>" This <b>type of condemnation cannot be likened</b> "to the case of personal property taken or used in time of war or famine, or other extreme necessity[, or] to the temporary possession of land itself, on a pressing public emergency, or the spur of the occasion. In the latter case there is no change of property." Hence, <b>condemnation</b> of one's property <b>ought to be a remedy of last resort.</b><br><br><b><i>De la Paz Masikip v. The City of Pasig</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> explains that the requisite of <b>genuine public necessity</b> is defeated by the <b>existence of properties</b> and <b>remedies other than</b> or <b>alternative to expropriation:</b><br><blockquote>In this case, petitioner contends that respondent City of Pasig failed to establish a <b>genuine necessity</b> which<b> justifies the condemnation</b> of her property. While she does not dispute the intended public purpose, nonetheless, she insists that <b>there must be a genuine necessity for the proposed use and purposes. According to petitioner, there is already an established sports development and recreational activity center</b> at Rainforest Park in Pasig City, <b>fully operational and being utilized by its residents</b>, including those from Barangay Caniogan. Respondent does not dispute this. <b>Evidently, there is no "genuine necessity" to justify the expropriation.</b><br><br><b>The right to take private property for public purposes necessarily originates from "the necessity" and the taking must be limited to such necessity</b>. In <i>City of Manila v. Chinese Community of Manila</i>, we held that the very foundation of the right to exercise eminent domain is a genuine necessity and that necessity must be of a public character. Moreover, <b>the ascertainment of the necessity must precede or accompany and not follow, the taking of the land</b>. In <i>City of Manila v. Arellano Law College</i>, we ruled that <b>"necessity within the rule that the particular property to be expropriated must be necessary</b>, does not mean an absolute but only a reasonable or practical necessity, <b>such as would combine the greatest benefit to the public with the least inconvenience and expense to the condemning party and the property owner</b> consistent with such benefit."<br><br><b>Applying this standard</b>, we hold that respondent City of Pasig has <b>failed to establish that there is a genuine necessity to expropriate</b> petitioner's property. Our scrutiny of the records shows that the Certification issued by the Caniogan Barangay Council dated November 20, 1994, the basis for the passage of Ordinance No. 42 s. 1993 authorizing the expropriation, indicates that the intended beneficiary is the Melendres Compound Homeowners Association, a private, non-profit organization, not the residents of Caniogan. It can be gleaned that the members of the said Association are desirous of having their own private playground and recreational facility. <b>Petitioner's lot is the nearest vacant space available</b>. The purpose is, therefore, not clearly and categorically public. <b>The necessity has not been shown, especially considering that there exists an alternative facility for sports development and community recreation in the area</b>, which is the Rainforest Park, available to all residents of Pasig City, including those of Caniogan.<br><br><b>The right to own and possess property is one of the most cherished rights of men</b>. It is so fundamental that it has been written into organic law of every nation where the rule of law prevails. <b>Unless the requisite of genuine necessity for the expropriation of one's property is clearly established, it shall be the duty of the courts to protect the rights of individuals to their private property</b>. Important as the power of eminent domain may be, the inviolable sanctity which the Constitution attaches to the property of the individual requires not only that the purpose for the taking of private property be specified. <b>The genuine necessity for the taking, which must be of a public character, must also be shown to exist.</b></blockquote>Sections 10 and 17 are <b>all-encompassing</b> in that they already <b><i>a priori</i> authorize</b> the condemnation of <i>"poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment"</i> even during the <i>transition period</i> <b>without any showing</b> of a <b>genuine public necessity in that there are no alternatives</b> to taking them.<br><br>PECO's situation is <b>akin to </b>those early cases that litigated the <b>ban against bills of attainder:</b><br><blockquote>Daniel Webster was one of the most articulate critics in <b>opposing legislative attempts to justify bills of attainder with the claim that whatever the legislature did satisfied due process or the law of the land</b>. Webster gave his views on this issue in the <b>cases involving Dartmouth College</b>. Webster acted as counsel for the college in arguments before both the New Hampshire Supreme Court in 1817 and on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1819. As described in <i><b>Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,</b></i> the <b>New Hampshire legislature passed a law that fundamentally altered the college's corporate form</b>. It is significant that <b>this was not a state college, but a wholly private one. The legislature expanded the number of trustees from 12 to 21, transferred college property to the new trustees</b>, and <b>authorized the treasurer to retain and hold college property against the will of the original trustees</b>. Webster decried the legislation as unauthorized. He noted that <b>in passing this bill, the legislature had targeted a single entity for improper treatment, passing sentence upon the college as if the legislature were a court promulgating a judgment</b>. Webster alluded to Blackstone, noting that the New Hampshire acts "have no relation to the community in general, and which are rather sentences than laws."<br><br>In response to New Hampshire's claim that its acts satisfied due process because the legislature created the law of the land, Webster noted:<br><br>Everything which may pass under the form of an enactment, is not, therefore, to be considered the law of the land. If this were so, acts of attainder, bills of pains and penalties, acts of confiscation, acts reversing judgments, and acts directly transferring one man's estate to another, legislative judgments, decrees and forfeitures, in all possible forms, would be the law of the land. Such a strange construction would render constitutional provisions, of the highest importance, completely inoperative and void. It would tend directly to establish the union of all powers in the legislature.<br><br><b>Therefore, when the legislature acts in a judicial capacity and passes a bill of attainder taking private property, and then seeks to proclaim itself above challenge in doing so, the legislature denies due process and engages in the most egregious of takings. The ban on bills of attainder was designed specifically to protect private property from such an eventuality.</b> For Webster, New Hampshire's actions in respect to the college and the taking of its property constituted a due process/law of the land violation, and defied the separation of powers precisely because the legislature exceeded its authority and acted as a judicial body.<br><br>The 1838 Maryland case Regents of the <b><i>University of Maryland v. Williams</i></b> forcefully restated this point. In this case, the court decried <b>state legislation whereby the university's property was taken and given to a new board of trustees</b>, just as in Dartmouth College. The court commented on the <b>legislature's improper intrusions on judicial power</b> in these words:<br><br>If the transferring one person's property to another, by a special and particular act of the legislature, is a [sic] depriving him of his property, by or according to the law of the land, then any legislative judgment or decree, in any possible form, would be according to the law of the land, although there existed at the time no law of the land upon the subject, and that too by a tribunal possessing no judicial power, and to which all such power is denied by the constitution. Such a construction would tend to the union of all the powers of the government in the legislature, and to impart the attribute of omnipotency to that department, contrary to the genius and spirit of all our institutions; and the office of courts would be not to declare the law or to administer the justice of the country, but to execute legislative judgments and decrees, not authorized by the constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><b>In sum, the ban on bills of attainder is, in many ways, the quintessential declaration of the need for a separation of powers. If bills of attainder are allowed, then the legislature is supreme, and neither the judiciary nor any other body can question or set aside the legislature's acts</b>. The ban on bills of attainder bridged the gap between the separation of powers embodied by the Constitution's framework and takings law as described in the Fifth Amendment. <b>Bills of attainder are judicial acts by the legislature, in which the legislature defies takings law by taking property without following the proper method. A taking needs to be consummated in a certain way, and a bill of attainder is the wrong way</b>. A legislature may not sit as a judicial body and declare whatever it does as satisfying due process or the law of the land. Hence, a proper understanding of the intent and scope of the ban on bills of attainder clarifies the separation of powers and increases an understanding of its true meaning as an unbreachable dividing line separating the reach of the different branches of government.<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[24]</sup></font></blockquote>There are existing alternatives for the properties <b>already adjudged</b> by RA 11212 as being <b>"actually necessary."</b> To be sure, MORE can obtain buildings other than PECO's to establish and run its franchise. This is also true for PECO's <i>poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, infrastructure, machineries and equipment</i>. There is <b>no conclusive showing of genuine public necessity</b> to expropriate these items - yet Sections 10 and 17 have already determined that they are <b>actually necessary</b> for expropriation.<br><br>As MORE admitted during the Committee Hearings (see below for a more extensive treatment):<br><blockquote>Well, the other option is definitely MORE Power is ready to build its own distribution assets, 'no. We can provide our own personnel and, well, again, as also mentioned during the last, I think, during the last two hearings, 'no, we were saying that personnel is not really that difficult to source, 'no, since it is readily available in the market."</blockquote>MORE also acknowledged that it can allegedly build its facilities and operate the franchise in <b>only a year's time</b>: "... <i>since I think capital is not a problem for us, if let's say, we're given at least a year, I mean I think we can ... we can actually come up with the system. Because like, let's say, substations, there are mobile standby substations that we can use immediately, deploy immediately while, let's say, building the permanent substations, 'no. So, I guess, again, I mean, since capital is not a problem for us then, I think at least a year would be more or less right.</i>.. "<br><br>This shows the <b>lack of genuine public necessity</b> for the taking, which Sections 10 and 17<b> have unfortunately already adjudged to be present</b> to justify the condemnation.<br><br><b>Mere convenience</b> for MORE is not what is required by law as the basis of <b>genuine public necessity</b>. Even in the face of necessity, <b>if it can be satisfied without expropriation</b>, the same should not be imposed. The <b>convenience of the condemning party has never been the gauge</b> for the exercise of eminent domain.<br><br>The true standard for <b>genuine public necessity is adequacy</b>. Hence, when there is <b>already an existing adequate alternatives</b>, as in this case, even when the alternatives, for one reason or another, be inconvenient, the need to expropriate is <b>entirely unjustified.</b><br><br>Lastly, Section 10 has as well <b>determined a presumptive amount for the just compensation to be paid</b> by MORE to PECO.<br><br>The deliberations have also <b>pegged an amount for just compensation</b> (see below).<br><br>Congress has to <b>peg the amount of just compensation</b> because this amount would be <b>added to MORE's billings</b> to its consumers as a means of reimbursing itself of such payment, and therefore, would ultimately impact on MORE's viability as a franchise.<br><br><i><b>Reducing the judicial <br>expropriation proceedings to a mere<br>ceremonial function</b></i><br><br>What is clear from both the language of Sections 10 and 17 and the legislative intent as expressed during the Committee Hearings is the <b>singling out of PECO</b> and the <b>determination by legislative fiat of the presence of all the elements to validate the taking of its properties.</b><br><br>RA 11212 has resolved the elements of public use and genuine public necessity, and the presumptive quantum of just compensation. Thus, the statute has rendered any court proceeding on expropriation to be merely ceremonial.<br><br><b><i>Third, the legislative confiscation<br>of PECO's properties for </i>MORE's take-­<br>over <i>and </i>immediate benefit and use <i>is<br>the</i> punishment <i>for PECO's alleged<br>wrongdoings</i>, which in turn <i>is a</i> direc<br>t outcome <i>of the non-renewal of its<br>franchise and the award of the franchise<br>to MORE.</i></b><br><br>To stress, the element of <b>punishment</b> in the bill of attainder test <b>does not mean</b> that the legislature has to convict a person of a specified crime or to exact punishments of pain or death.<br><br><b>Burdens and deprivations</b> upon targeted persons or entities, without any formal legislative pronouncement of moral blameworthiness or formal intent to punish, may <b>constitute punishment</b> depending on this <b>test - whether</b> the <b>legislation </b>has a <b>punitive objective <i>or</i></b> a <b>legitimate non-punitive legislative purpose.<br></b><br>Where the <b>legitimate legislative purpose</b> is <b>non-existent</b> or is <b>far out­weighed</b> by an <b>intention to cause deprivation</b>, it is <b>reasonable to conclude</b>, that <b>punishment of individuals disadvantaged</b> by the enactment was the <b>purpose </b>of the legislators.<br><br>As stated, the test involves two (2) steps. First, identify if the legislation <b>looks at past conduct as a wrongdoing</b>. Second, determine if the legislation <b>imposes burdens or deprivations</b> upon that <b>past conduct</b>. To complete the second step in the test, <b>consider </b>the <b>three (3) factors</b> in resolving <b>whether the statute is punitive</b>:<br><br>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether it fell within the <b>historical meaning of legislative punishment</b> (historical test),<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether, viewed in terms of the <b>type and severity of burdens imposed</b>, it could <b>reasonably be said to further non-punitive</b> legislative puiposes (functional test), and<br><br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; whether it evinced an <b>intent to punish</b> (motivational test).<br><br>Here, Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 <b>originated from</b> the alleged <b>wrongdoings </b>of <b>PECO </b>as a franchise holder. Upon this alleged <b>past misconduct, burdens and deprivations</b> are imposed: the <b>non-renewal</b> of PECO's franchise, the award of the franchise to <b>MORE</b>, and the latter's <b>take-­over</b> of PECO's properties through <b>expropriation </b>whose <b>propriety Congress has already determined</b> through the assailed provisions.<br><br>This <b>fulfils </b>the <b>first step</b> of the <b>test</b>.<br><br>As regards the <b>second step</b>, I first focus on the <b>historical meaning of legislative punishment</b> or the <b>historical test of punishment</b>. According to the <b>congressional deliberations</b> quoted below, the <b>legislative confiscation</b> of PECO's properties has been decreed to <b>eliminate harm to innocent third parties</b> and <b>to the viability of MORE as the new franchise holder</b>, i.e., the continuous supply of electricity to consumers by <b>MORE</b>. It may also be reasonably presumed that Congress wants to send a message via the legislated condemnation of properties to franchise holders to shape up or ship out, <i>i.e</i>., <b>general </b>and <b>specific deterrence</b>. Together with the <b>protection of people and communities, deterrence</b> is the <b>traditional </b>and <b>historical justification</b> for <b>punishment</b>.<br><br>As borne by the <b>congressional deliberations</b> (see below), <b>routine expropriation clauses</b> in franchise grants do <b>not </b>function as the <b>principal and primary backbone</b> for the establishment, operation, and maintenance of a franchise. This type of clause does <b>not </b>settle the propriety of expropriation and allows <b>courts to determine</b> the propriety of expropriation. But <b>routine</b> <b>expropriation clauses are unlike Sections 10</b> and <b>17 </b>of RA 11212 where <b>Congress has already put the bind on courts to complete the expropriation of PECO's properties</b> to ensure the supply of electricity in the franchise area. <b>Nothing but punishment justifies</b> the <b>compulsion </b>and <b>urgency </b>to expropriate <b>PECO's</b> properties.<br><br>I will also quote Senator William Gatchalian's statements which <b>confirm </b>the claim that <b>PECO</b> has been punished not only through the non­renewal of its franchise (which Congress admittedly has the constitutional authority) but also through the <b>expropriation of PECO's properties</b> via Sections 10 and 17. The Honorable Senator is quoted to have said:<br><blockquote>As of March, Meralco had 6.4 million residential accounts, or 92 percent of the total in its franchise area in Metro Manila and neighboring provinces. Commercial customers accounted for 530,864 (8 percent) connections and industrial customers, 10,580 (0.2 percent).<br><br>"I'm pleased with the swift resolution (of the ERC) to impose a fine ... But the penalty of P19 million, for me, is just a drop in the bucket for Meralco," Gatchalian said.<br><br>"I think the almost P300 million in penalty is reasonable enough because their violation is nonconformity to the orders of the ERC," the senator said.<br><br>"If they still resist, I will advise ERC to mete out heftier fines and find other ways to penalize (Meralco)," he said in a separate radio interview.<br><br>No breakdown of charges<br><br>Gatchalian assailed Meralco and other power distributors for their continued failure to clearly explain to their customers the breakdown of monthly charges, such as the collection of environmental fee and feed-in- tariff allowance and a universal tax on all electric consumers.<br><br>He said the recent decision of the House of Representatives to deny ABS-CBN's application for a new franchise should be a lesson to all holders of legislative licenses.<br><br>In fact, he said, any legislator could seek a review of Meralco's franchise as part of Congress' oversight authority even before the power distributor could apply for an extension.<br><br>"Based on our experience with ABS-CBN, the sins of the past can come and haunt you.

Your Honor, well, what we are hoping is that if their franchise will not be granted or the extension will not be granted, <b>we are hoping to—well, if granted the franchise- to operate and maintain the distribution system of their existing network</b>, Your Honor.<br><br>REP. UYBARRETA_ So, on the assumption that on January 2019 <b>the current franchise of PECO will not be renewed, then you will take over.</b><br><br>MR. CASTRO. Your Honor, that is the...<br><br>REP. UYBARRETA. Yeah, that is the premise because you are applying.<br><br>MR. CASTRO. Yes, Your Honor.<br><br>REP. UYBARRETA. <b>And do you have the necessary infrastructures to supply the customer needs of Iloilo?</b><br><br><b>MR. CASTRO. At the moment, well, I would say we don't have it</b> but if given the... granted the franchise and well, the existing franchise holder is also... Well; if the franchise is extended, well, we are considering to also put up our own infrastructure, Your Honor.<br><br>REP. UYBARRETA. What is the current growth as far as demand is concerned of Haila city?<br><br>MR. CASTRO. I am sorry, Your Honor, the current growth of?<br><br>REP. UYBARRETA. Demand, as far as power is...<br><br>(MS. AID A P. MOLINYAWE TOOK OVER)<br><br>REP. UYBARRETA You mentioned earlier iyong reduction of rates, iyong customer service, iyong upgrading of customer satisfaction, iyong pagbabawas natin ng brownout and instances. Well, these are all good for the consumers and gusto rin namin iyon. But here in our... the Committee, we would like to be assured that the... ultimately the customers of Iloilo City hindi mapre-prejudice. Iyon naman lang po ang gusto namin dito.<br><br>We are one with you as far as that aspect is concerned. Kasi mahirap na... alam mo po pag pinag-uusapan natin ang mahal na kuryente, madali tayong umangal. But ang hindi natin nare-realize ang pinakamahal na kuryente ay iyong walang kuryente. And we're talking about inflation here, mahal ang gastusin sa bigas, marami ang nagugutom. Pera pag dineprayb(deprive) ninya iyong mga kababayan natin from Iloilo na mapanood iyong Probinsiyano, patay tayong lahat diyan. <b>That's the reason why we're trying to help you achieve your goals also. So, you mentioned wala kayong infrastructure right now. Wala kayong substation, wala kayong linya currently, and you intend to take... to supply them by year 2017... ah, 2019. Doon lang po ako may worry na ano. Kasi, well, you can contract although until such time that your amendments are approved the Securities and Exchange Commission, then you can contract with suppliers. But again iyong goal ninyo is to distribute and by distribution you need all these infrastructures and facilities. You need the substation na pagdadalahan n'yo, para icascade ninyo, ibaba ninyo, you need the 69 KB lines. You need secondary and collateral lines. You need all the transformers to bring it down to the consumers. Kaya sabi ko nga po sa inyo eh mahirap tayong hindi natin mabigyan iyong Iloilo ng kuryente. So, can you just enlighten this Representation and also this Committee on the exact plan as far as MORE Corporation is concerned?</b><br><br>MR. CASTRO. Yes, Your Honor. Thank you for that comment, Your Honor. <b>Yeah. Again, our base case, I would say, is the... if the franchise of PECO will end and we may have... well, we will be granted the franchise, 'no, is, well, we will take over the assets of PECO, 'no. And, well, these are... Your Honor, that's correct that, well, depriving consumers of power, 'no, is... well, our primary... well, is not... well, may not be good. It's not really good. But what we have in mind, Your Honor, is that in the long term, 'no, when... if we are able because we are confident that we will be able to bring down the rates, 'no. </b>I mean, given the basket of suppliers that they have now as was flashed earlier, they are not taking advantage.

Your Honor, the customer profile ... well, Iloilo ... well, the franchise area is about 66,000 customers.

So, it's a... well, definitely there are commercial, especially recently when Megawide or Megaworld, Ayala and all the others started to put up the malls the last two... well, three to four years. The... well, rather, the customer profile has already... well, for commercial has already increased but in terms of industrial, I would say it is on the low side, Your Honor.<br><br>REP. UYBARRETA. <b>And these malls that you mentioned, are they sourcing their power sa current franchise holder or are they directly connected?</b><br><br><b>MR. CASTRO. Yes, Your Honor.

Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to ask this question sa ERC. Sabi ni Cong. Caloy na ang nagiging problema, what happens in a scenario wherein one has the franchise and the other one has the asset, anong magiging remedy ng ERC diyan? Anong ruling ninyo diyan? Paano ninyo didiskartehan iyan?</b><br><br>MR MAATUBANG. ML Chair, Your Honor, actually, we have submitted that in our position paper, Your Honor, and already discussed that during the previous hearing, Your Honor, that in the event that there are two DUs in one geographical location, there will be economies of scale, that problem. So, in the end, there will be a problem with the consumers. <b>And in terms of assets, Your Honor, that's the problem, the other one has no assets on how it will be delivered their electricity and the other one has the assets.</b><br><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. In the event that only one will be given the franchise, ang isang assumption mo riyan sa statement mo,dalawa sila.<br><br>MR. MAATUBANG. Yes, Sir.<br><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. Ngayon, kung isa lang, paano?<br><br>MR. MAATUBANG. That's the problem, Your Honor. So that will be a problem in terms of regulation, in terms of prices because there will be economies of scales in terms of rate regulations, Your Honor. <b>And at the same time, the one with no asset, Your Honor, basically they will... there's the option to tap the other one for the billing of the service which is being done right now, like for the sales in our electric cooperatives.</b> That would also be a scenario, Your Honor.<br><br><b>REP. TAMBUNT1NG. So iyong mga... ang precedence niyan will be the winning franchise holder will have to negotiate with the one with the asset and acquire. Ganyan ang mangyayari diyan. Iyong. mga cooperatives na sinasabi mo kapag, may nananalong iba, siya ang bumibili nung asset nung natalo. Tama ba iyon? lyon ba ang precedence niyon?</b><br><br>MR. MAATUBANG. No, Your Honor. I am just only saying that <b>in case there are two DUs, then one DU that has no assets, has to.,, has an option to wheel its power to the other one. So they will have to rent the distribution utility to deliver its power to its customers</b>, Your Honor.<br><br>REP. GATCHALIAN. Mr. Chair, can we ask if that is allowable by law, what you are saying?<br><br>MR. MAATUBANG. Yes, right now it's open access, Your Honor. That is allowed, Your Honor.<br><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. You know, when we award a franchise, only Congress has the power to take it back because you cannot rise above sa source. Kung ang sinabi namin ikaw ang franchise holder, you cannot sublease your franchise and give it to somebody else without informing Congress because that's not transferable. So I don't think that is allowed. Your opinion, I think, is not really happening na ang prangkisa ha, prangkisa that emanates from Congress is being transferred to a different entity without the knowledge of Congress or permission from Congress.<br><br>MR. MAATUBANG. No, Your Honor, what I am saying is that in terms of access of electricity. For example, if an end-user wants to get power from other sources other than the DU, they can wheel that power to the host DU.<br><br>REP. GATCHALIAN. Mr. Chair, I think ERC has an attorney here, their legal. So maybe the question of Congressman Tambunting is better answered by Attorney Arjay.<br><br>MR. ARJAY LOUIE B. CUANAN (Attorney III, Energy Regulatory Commission). Yes, good morning, Mr. Chair. Good morning to the Members of the Committee. Actually, the question is if there is a precedent already, if the legislative franchise has been transferred or subleased to other cooperatives. Is that right?<br><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. Yes.<br><br>REP. GATCHALIAN. Is that allowable by law and is there a precedent already that happened before, for the appreciation of the Committee?<br><br><b><b></b><ol start="5"><b></b><li><i>The </i>forced condemnation by legislation <i>of PECO's properties to serve</i> the business interests of MORE <i>as the new franchisee</i> is unprecedented and the first of its kind<i> in franchise law-making and regulation.</i></li></ol>MR. CUANAN. Yes. Regarding the first question, Your Honor, the law explicitly provides that it is not allowed to transfer or to lease the legislative franchise that has been granted by, Congress, without the permission or without the conscnt of the Congress itself, their granting power.<br><br>With respect to the second question, we actually don't have the idea yet if there is... if the said subleasing of legislative franchise has been happening because as what we've said, this is not... this is prohibited by law.<br><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. So can we go back to the first question which is, what happens if one has the franchise and the person, the incumbent whose franchise will lapse and has the assets but with no franchise, so one has the permission, the permit but the other one has the asset. What is now...how would ERC rule on this?<br><br>MR. CUANAN. Actually, Your Honor, as we speak today, we have not ruled on that particular, we have not encountered such particular issue so far, where there is a franchise holder and the other one has the asset. So probably, the existing franchise holder will take over or will buyout the assets of the old franchise holder.<br><br>REP. GATCHALIAN. So, if they will take over, through a corporate takeover, then hindi na ho nila kailangan humarap ngayong umaga dito, So they will take over the company...<br><br>REP. GATCHALIAN. (Continuing) ... the company if they want to, the corporate entity if they wanna take over the assets only without the corporate entity. And the corporate itself, the PECO, already has a franchise eh. So, why are you applying a new franchise here, if that's your intention, ha? We're just trying to understand.</b><br><br>MR. CUANAN. Sorry, Your Honor. I think PECO has a separate juridical entity. If they want to maintain, I mean they want to have a juridical... separate juridical personality from PECO, the existing franchise holder, so they need to secure a franchise.<br><br>REP. GATCHALIAN. So, hindi na ho applicable iyong sinagest(suggest) ni Engineer Maatubang and the question of the Honorable Tambunting about<b> Company A who has the asset and Company B... but losing, 'no, and Company B who has the liquidity but wants to take over the asset</b>. So, that's what we're trying to connect here and if that is allowable also by law, kayong ERC ang makakasagot diyan.<br><br><b>MR. CUANAN. Okay. For that, Your Honor, MORE Corporation has to secure legislative franchise. And if they will be given that franchise or granted that franchise then, probably, they can secure or buyout the assets of PECO, which is the existing franchise holder, if in case PECO will ... PECO's franchise will not be renewed</b>. Okay, Mr. Chairman.<br><br>REP. GATCHALIAN. So, the asset only, not including the franchise. What if PECO's franchise was renewed?<br><br>MR. CUANAN. Actually, we have not encountered that, Your Honor. We have no precedent on that because... we have actually one which is Bicol Light which is already... which is still pending before the Senate. But we have not encountered a situation where there are two distribution utilities within the geographical area.<br><br>THE CHAIRPERSON. Okay, before that, the Chair would like to recognize Congressman Montoro.<br><br>I have just one additional question. Iyong pinaka... from what I understand iyong pinaka-question kasi, paano iyong transition period, for example nga sa scenario na ma- approve ang MORE? And then, let's say, hindi ma-renew kaagad iyong PECO since January mag-e-expire na, sino'ng magsu-supply ng kuryente, habang iyong MORE o iyong period na iyon na mag-expire ang PECO? Ano iyong MORE kunwari magse-set up pa nu'ng kanilang infra ng equipment, siyempre mag,.medyo may kakailanganin na time iyon eh especially if hindi naman bibilhin iyong assets na existing. So, sino'ng magsu-supply sa Panay? Like, iyong ERC ba nagbibigay ba kayo ng provisional authority na mag-operate muna sila until such time na ready na iyong MORE? Or, papaano ang magiging set-up? Hindi naman puwedeng mag-brownout iyong Panay.<br><br>REP. TEODORO G. MONTORO. Mr. Chair, can I?<br><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. I think... yes. So, is it. .. Attorney, I think the... to amend, 'no, the question really is, what if there is a standoff and they don't want to sale to the winning bidder? What... how would you rule? Would you give a PA to them pending the approval, the sale?<br><br>MR. CUANAN. Sir, may I just hand over the floor to Engineer Maatubang?<br><br>MR. MAATUBANG. Your Honor, if that is the case, Your Honor, there will be a problem in regulations in terms of how we will regulate the two distribution utilities, That's the... that's what our concern here that was submitted in this Honorable Commission.<br><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. I think very specific naman po iyong tanong. Iyong tanong is kung hindi sila magka". alam nating magkakaproblema kaya nga ho kami nagtatanong sa inyo, 'no. Alam namin may problema. Ngayon, ano hong magiging solusyon ho n'yo? Ano'ng magiging ruling n'yo diyan? Magbibigay ba kayo ng provisional permit? "O, sige, tuloy ka muna, PECO, habang nagtatayo iyong nanalong", winning franchise owner:'<br><br>MR. CUANAN. Sir, since we don't encounter yet this particular issue, can we refer this yet to the Committee, if ever, I mean, to the Commission, if ever? Give us an opportunity to confer the matter to the Commission. Because our existing policy is we grant Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessit... Necessity and Convenience to the distribution utility and that is based on the legi... or dependent on the legislative franchise being granted by the Congress. So, if the franchise is denied, so immediately ipso facto the CPCN is also denied.<br><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. Correct.<br><br>Mr. Chair, we are walking on very thin ice here, sabi nga ng ERC,<i><b> this is the very first time that this is happening</b></i>. Kasi nga po, ang distribution and transmission business is a natural monopoly, accepted po iyan in any country and all over the world that <b>distribution and transmission is a natural monopoly kasi po sa laki ng gastos para mag set up ng facilities. I heard that MORE committed that they will be able to put up their facilities, their complete distribution facilities within one year, I don't want to debunk that or ano, I just wish them well. But we know for a fact that just to set up one substation entails a lot of years and months, that's just one substation. And during last hearing, it was stated that for one distribution utilities to be able to supply the need of the franchise area that we are referring to or we are discussing here, a minimum of five substations will be required. That is capital intensive. We are not even talking about the distribution lines. We are not even talking about 'yung mga capacitor, 'yung mga transformers, the meters, the new meters, the new lines that will be put in. Again, kaya I just appeal for us to be very, very careful in deciding this. I will go for any move to give better service to any given consumers. I'm all for that. But I'm also on the side of caution kasi nga ano eh, I have nothing against MORE</b>, if they can promise better service, I'm all for that kasi at the end of the day, we are all here for the welfare of the consumers. But I just caution that kasi hindi natin napag-uusapan 'yung aspeto na 'yon that the signal that we will be ending to the lending institution and to the investors, kung ano man ang gagawin natin dito, will have repercussion on that. That's just my manifestation, Mr. Chair.<br><br>MR. OFALSA. (Continuing)...EPIRA po, RA 9136, may third party valuation po na isa- submit on the valuation of the assets. But for now po, when a... sa existing policy ng ERC in existing distribution utilities, we have guidelines using a standard on how we value the assets po. Katulad po sa electric cooperatives, we use the NEA guidelines on the valuation of the assets. For private utilities for purposes of performance-based regulated, we use po iyong SKM valuation namin. This is more on technical valuation of the existing assets of all distribution utilities po.<br><br><b>REP. TAMBUNTING. So, in previous take overs, this is the same formula that was used.<br><br>MR. OFALSA. Wala pa kasi kami, Sir, I do not recall of any take overs of distribution. Siguro, Sir, in the past, iyong mga maliliit, ano, iyong mga una...</b><br><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. Iyong hindi pa tayo ipinapanganak.<br><br><b>MR. OFALSA. Yes, opo, mayroon po sigurong ganoon.

Your Honors, ang isa pong alternative to them putting up is to, iyon na nga po, take over the current facilities but subject to the payment of just compensation. Kasi mayroon din naman pong portion of the cost of those facilities na equity ng PECO and then you also have the obligations. So, iyon po iyong isang alternative para ho dire-diretso iyong service po ng kuryente</b>. Pero iyon na nga po ang sinabi ko ho kanina, strictly speaking po. Kaya po sabi ko po kanina, strictly speaking, iyon po talaga iyong legal implication without a franchise. But I don't think na pagdating po ng alas onse... 11:59 ng gabi, eh, talagang magsha-shutoff. Hindi naman po. Hindi naman po siguro ganoon ang mangyayari.<br><br>REP. UYBARRETA. Just, actually, I will not be asking too much question already because except for the fact that I requested for a technical report which I got this morning. However, just to., for us as the Committee on Franchise, to have a wider perspective of what we are doing right now. Iyong sinabi kanina that both DUs will be operating at a loss, in layman's term, ang sinasabi doon is pahabaan ng pisi, kung sino 'yung makakatagal na lugi magpatakbo ng negosyo at mag-survive, iyon 'yung matitira. Mr. Chair, that's a very dangerous business practice. Mahirap po if we are enticing investors to come in in our country at sasabihin natin, "Pahabaan kayo ng pisi, eh anyway parehas kayong lugi eh." That's a very dangerous business concept for us. Now, just so that we will have a bigger picture also. I'm pretty sure because of my experience sa DUs and the electric cooperatives, I'm pretty sure that the existing franchise has existing loans, one hundred percent ako sure diyan, one hundred and ten percent sure ako diyan, they have existing loans because most of the time, when you upgrade or even repair your facilities, you take in loan and then you apply that sa capex application, ina-apply sa ERC and then the ERC would give them the proper rate and a time frame or a time table to recover. Naka-apply po. Now, assuming this thing will happen, ang bigger question natin is, ano ang mangyayari sa existing loans ng existing franchise holder? Are we giving a very bad signal to the investors and to the lending institutions that we have?<br><br>Mr. Chair, we are walking on very thin ice here, sabi nga ng ERC,<i><b> this is the very first time that this is happening</b></i>. Kasi nga po, ang distribution and transmission business is a natural monopoly, accepted po iyan in any country and all over the world that <b>distribution and transmission is a natural monopoly kasi po sa laki ng gastos para mag set up ng facilities. I heard that MORE committed that they will be able to put up their facilities, their complete distribution facilities within one year, I don't want to debunk that or ano, I just wish them well. But we know for a fact that just to set up one substation entails a lot of years and months, that's just one substation. And during last hearing, it was stated that for one distribution utilities to be able to supply the need of the franchise area that we are referring to or we are discussing here, a minimum of five substations will be required. That is capital intensive. We are not even talking about the distribution lines. We are not even talking about 'yung mga capacitor, 'yung mga transformers, the meters, the new meters, the new lines that will be put in. Again, kaya I just appeal for us to be very, very careful in deciding this. I will go for any move to give better service to any given consumers. I'm all for that. But I'm also on the side of caution kasi nga ano eh, I have nothing against MORE</b>, if they can promise better service, I'm all for that kasi at the end of the day, we are all here for the welfare of the consumers. But I just caution that kasi hindi natin napag-uusapan 'yung aspeto na 'yon that the signal that we will be ending to the lending institution and to the investors, kung ano man ang gagawin natin dito, will have repercussion on that. That's just my manifestation, Mr. Chair.<br><br>MR. OFALSA. (Continuing)...EPIRA po, RA 9136, may third party valuation po na isa- submit on the valuation of the assets. But for now po, when a... sa existing policy ng ERC in existing distribution utilities, we have guidelines using a standard on how we value the assets po. Katulad po sa electric cooperatives, we use the NEA guidelines on the valuation of the assets. For private utilities for purposes of performance-based regulated, we use po iyong SKM valuation namin. This is more on technical valuation of the existing assets of all distribution utilities po.<br><br><b>REP. TAMBUNTING. So, in previous take overs, this is the same formula that was used.<br><br>MR. OFALSA. Wala pa kasi kami, Sir, I do not recall of any take overs of distribution. Siguro, Sir, in the past, iyong mga maliliit, ano, iyong mga una...</b><br><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. Iyong hindi pa tayo ipinapanganak.<br><br><b>MR. OFALSA. Yes, opo, mayroon po sigurong ganoon. Pero in my experience po sa ERC, we did not encounter any take overs of existing franchise utility po.</b><br><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. Mr. Chair, may I ask the More representatives? Do you agree with the formula presented by ERC?<br><br><b>MR. CASTRO. Your Honors, yes, we agree with the formula. Now, however, still I think... well, when it comes... because there has been no experience 011 private company take over and... well, and let me just say that. ..just going back to that question... to the answer earlier that there has to be just compensation</b> and I think this is related to that, Mr. Chair. The question is if, let's say, the asking price of the... well, of the existing asset owner is too high that would jeopardize the rate, ano, to the end consumer, still I think... well, an approach might not be totally acceptable because, at the end of the day, it's gonna be the consumers who will take it. So, that's why I think there has to be a deeper study on who actually owns really the assets, I mean, upon take over. Because as you correctly pointed out, part of it has already been recovered. In fact, if... well, from the distribution assets right now, if, let's say, there are assets that are fully recovered which means that consumers have already paid for it over a period of time, the question is does it still... make sure that it's still owned by PECO wherein...<br><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. Correct.<br><br>MR. CASTRO.... well, a company like us who would be negotiating for just compensation be included in the asset-based.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[28]</sup></font><br><br>X X X X<br><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. Thank you very much, Atty. Jan. For the transition plan which has been submitted to the ComSec, maybe we can ask Mr. Roel Castro to expound on this, with the permission of the Chair.<br><br>THE CHAIRPERSON. Mr. Castro, do you have a presentation or...<br><br><b>MR. ROEL Z. CASTRO (President, MORE Electric and Power Corporation). Good morning, Your Honors. Yes, we have a short presentation on the transition plan.<br></b><br>REP. TAMBUNTING. Please proceed.<br><br><b>MR. CASTRO. Next, please. So, upon granting of franchise, Monte Oro Power will negotiate with PECO for the purchase of its distribution assets. Assuming that there is... that it is positive then we will apply for the certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity and we will deploy technical personnel to conduct the operations improvement plan; develop the planning and control processes for operations and maintenance; deploy security; and conduct a total system and network audit. Should the negotiation be successful, as stated during the last hearing, we are... actually we are open and we would like to hire the existing personnel of PECO; develop a total distribution network development plan; implement the processes to determine the cost-effective capital investments, establish maintenance program; create the corporate planning group to establish and optimize management processes. Now, if there is a failure to reach an agreement, which means that PECO and MORE Power cannot... well, has no agreement on terms, MORE Power will file an expropriation case, 'no, the right to expropriate is integral part of the franchise if approved, and MORE Power will definitely pay just compensation to PECO as determined by the court.</b><br><br>Well, if we're still on the premise that there is a failure to reach an agreement, MORE Power will have a standby quick maintenance and response team which we are in the process of putting together that we can readily deploy in case there will be a need, in case of emergency situations where major installation like substations will be compromised. We are also in the process of already looking for a possible mobile standby substations that will be backed-up by the emergency response team. And these are facilities that are readily available. Now, for the technical and operational readiness, our... well, we're contemplating that the emergency response team which is made up of engineers, technicians, and specialists who will man important facilities/like substations are ready on call for a 24/7 deployment. Standby mobile substations in case of emergency, third-party line maintenance team and crew is also being ... we're in the process of already getting these team. The third party meter readers, as well as, we will make sure that the customer relations desk would be available 24/7 also in cooperation with the different media outlets to make sure that if there are questions or maybe any confusion ...<br><br>MR. CASTRO. (Continuing) ... confusion from the customer side, we will be able to respond to those queries. <b>Well, the other option is definitely MORE Power is ready to build its own distribution assets, 'no. We can provide our own personnel and, well, again, as also mentioned during the last, I think, during the last two hearings, 'no, we were saying that personnel is not really that difficult to source, 'no, since it is readily available in the market</b>. Now, on human resources, MORE Power will hire the services of the current employees who may be willing to work with us. MORE Power will hire a competent local HR Manager and, as we speak now, we actually already have applications from different... from a number of HR practitioners from Iloilo, 'no, to lay down the process of employment and among this, priority is really giving the training and development of its employees. Plans and programs-well, this is on the assumption that, well, the... we're able to come in which is... which has been laid down in the plans and programs that we've submitted to the Committee. We will make a thorough system audit. Prepare the necessary repair maintenance and even... well, from the audit, I think we'll be able to already find out if what are the improvements, immediate medium-term and long-term improvements, that will be needed. And immediately deploy the SCADA system throughout the franchise area. Well, on the distribution plan, well, I think these are some details already which we can move to the next. So, in conclusion, MORE Power will be prepared to implement the following from transition period and bring it to normal operations as soon as possible. Again, the smooth transition of normal operations including hiring of deserving employees, infusion of sufficient funding, develop and design the new distribution system, develop/implement new set of maintenance operating rules, the balance of energy, continuous training, improve responsiveness increase system, reliability and bring down the systems loss. With that, I'd like to thank the Committee for giving us the opportunity to present the transition plan.

Kasi, Mr. Chair, 'pag binigyan natin ng prangkisa itong MORE, it follows dapat handa sila. Kasi the consumers in Panay Island, hindi puwedeng maghintay, hindi ba? Hindi puwedeng maghintay. 'Yung question nung expropriation, if we give them the franchise. But what if... what if. .. if we also renew the franchise, 'di ba? If we... if this Committee and this House will renew their franchise, it follows na mas nauna 'to, ang PECO, mas sila ang nagsisimula sa ngayon, 'di ba? Sa ngayon sila. Of course, it is allowed, it's a free competition. But 'yung point ko, 'yung sinasabi niyong negotiation in the presentation, siguro naman dapat malaman natin kung ano na ang status ng negotiation. And nandito rin pala 'yung mga taga-PECO.

If negotiation between PE... no, 'yung MORE, if negotiation between PECO and MORE failed kung i-grant natin ang PECO and there is a pending bill in this Committee.

I-expropriate niyo, eh, there's a pending application in this Committee, this House. So, medyo may problema tayo doon.

OFALSA. Okay. The letter is dated September 25, 2018, addressed to Honorable Franz E. Alvarez, Chairperson, Committee on Legislative Franchise. "During the House Representatives' Committee on Legislative Franchises hearing on House Bill No. 8132 last September 12, 2018, the Energy Regulatory Commission was directed to submit its supplemental position paper on the said bill. In compliance with the said directive, please find attached ERC's Supplemental Position Paper in response to the queries and additional information requested during the hearing. We hope that the Committee will consider the same during the deliberation of this piece of legislation. Thank you." Signed by Chairperson and CEO, Agnes V.S.T. Devanadera.<br><br>The letter... the title of this position is ERC's Supplemental Position Paper on House Bill No. 8132, AN ACT GRANTING THE MORE MINERALS CORPORATION A FRANCHISE TO ESTABLISH, OPERATE AND MAINTAIN FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FOR THE CONVEYANCE OF ELECTRIC POWER TO END-USERS IN THE CITY OF ILOILO, IN THE PROVINCE OF ILOILO.<br><br>During the Committee on Legislative Franchises' hearing on House Bill 8132 last September 18, 2018, legal issues and operational concerns on the occurrence of any of the following scenarios were raised, namely....<br><br><b>We go now to scenario number two - where franchise is granted to MMC and PECOs franchise is not renewed. PECO is the existing franchise electric utility with exclusive authority to operate and maintain a distribution system in Iloilo City. As such, PECO owns the only existing distribution assets in Iloilo City</b>. In the event that PECO's franchise is not renewed and another entity that is MMC is given the franchise to operate and maintain a distribution system in Iloilo City, a question was raised on whether PECO will be allowed to operate the existing distribution system during the transition phase of MORE Minerals. As earlier pointed out in the supplemental position paper, an entity operating and maintaining a distribution system must first secure a franchise. In the case of PECO, once existing franchise expires, it may no longer engage in the business of distribution of electricity and ERC has no legal basis to issue any authority to PECO for the latter to operate its distribution system. As ERC has no authority over PECO after the expiration of the latter's franchise, the ERC will defer to the wisdom of the Congress on whether to grant PECO a legislative franchise that will allow PECO to continue operating its distribution system.<br><br>MR. INOCENCIO FERRER, JR. (Board Member, Panay Electric Company). Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Sorry but I have flu, 'no, so my voice is not very clear. I am Atty. Inocencio Ferrer, Jr. I represent PECO and the majority of the Board Members of PECO. Mr. Chairman, we have previously filed several letters opposing the House Bill of Congressman Gus Tambunting. And<b> in answer directly to the question of whether or not PECO is amenable to selling its assets or the company to MORE, I can categorically say... state that after conferring with the majority owners of PECO, they are not amenable to sell their assets and they will contest and bring to court any move by MORE to use the government power to expropriate their assets and give it to a private entity</b>. It is our position, Mr. Chairman, that <b>based on the presentation of the President of MORE, he actually admitted that they don't have any assets on the electrical power distribution. He admitted that. In fact, his only plan is to buy us out and if we refuse to sell, then he will invoke the government... the government... he will use the government to expropriate our assets and award it to a private entity. Number two, the President of MORE admitted now, that's why I wanted him to admit it under oath that they don't have any personnel. They don't have any technicians, experts in the field of electric power distribution and their only plan is to hire our employees</b>. Third, Your Honor, I don't think what he presented is a rollout plan. <b>Usually, a rollout plan tells the Honorable Members the year-to-year activities of MORE to purchase equipment, to install equipment, to apply for permits on the barangay level, the city level to install their infrastructure. They should present that to the Chairman year- to-year. Every year how much assets they will buy. Every year, how many employees they will hire. Every year, how many equipment that they will purchase. But they have not submitted a rollout plan. Instead, what they are actually telling the public is they will invoke the power of the Constitution to expropriate our property and to award it to a private entity</b>. I think, Your Honor, that will violate the Anti-Graft Law. Anyway, we will question that in the Supreme Court. Your Honor, may I, again, ask the Chairman to distribute the various opposition... the various opposition submitted to this Honorable Committee against... the opposition against... the very strong opposition against the application of MORE.<b> In fact, the biggest association of power distributors, electric power distributors, in the Philippines submitted a very, very strong objection. They are the expert in the field and this association, PEPOA, they are called PEPOA, and PEPOA is a Private Electric Power Operators Association of the Philippines, the only expert association of private operator, strongly oppose the application of MORE because they don't have any assets. MORE does not have a single asset on the ground now in Iloilo City, nothing. Their only plan is just to expropriate our property and allow the government to pay us in court.</b> Second, the Private Electric Power Operators Association, which represents all... all the private electric power distributors in the country, strongly supported the House Bill of Congressman Xavier Jesus Romualdo, House Bill 6023, in favor of PECO.... Finally, Your Honor, <b>at that time that MORE filed its application on August 22, less than 40 days ago, MORE was a mining company. It was a mining company with only 2.5 million pesos capital and it did not have a single experience or track record in electric power distribution. Therefore, at that time they filed the application, they were not entitled. They were not qualified. And if they are now submitting the amendment of their Article, it merely states that they have... what? Two hundred fifty million pesos and they are going to try to takeover a multi- billion peso existing electric power distribution</b>. That is incredible...<br><br>MR. CASTRO. Thank you very much, Your Honor. Well Just to reiterate, well, what we've stated during the first hearing.<b> Yes, while we still don't have the... I would say, the... the full complement, but, well, at the officers' level,</b> we actually have an experienced general manager of an electric cooperative which is about three times, at least three times bigger than PECO, with a customer base of over 200 thousand, and by experience, was able to bring down systems losses from double digit to single digit, 'no. We have another general manager of another electric coop who will be joining us very soon. Again, his experience is a customer base four times bigger than that of PECO. PECO is about 60 thousand. This another GM that we are-and I'm not yet in the position to name him-actually has been managing electric coop of another urbanized area of about 225 thousand customers, ano. And experience would show na in his management, he was able to bring down systems losses and was able to turn around the... the financials of this utility from barely negative to positive. Also together with us is a former Undersecretary of Energy and former NAPOCOR President, Cyril Del Callar, who is very much acquainted with the power industry from the very time he joined, well, his law profession in the power industry and up to this date. Well, on the... on the owner's side, Monte Oro was also ... we were part owner of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippine, when we privatized TransCo, 'no. And NGCP, we won the bid for 3.95 billion U.S. Dollars and we were able to ... well, we had... we have the capital, we had the we were able to comply with what was needed on the financial side, needed by the by the government that's why we were awarded that franchise for the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines. And as we had... we have the capital, we had the we were able to comply with what was needed on the financial side, needed by the by the government that's why we were awarded that franchise for the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines. And as we....<br><br>REP. A. M. BRAVO. Thank you very much, idol. <b>Assuming that MORE is capable of putting up the infrastructure, questioning their capability maybe, well, not proper as of this present as made mentioned by the author that it requires first a franchise so that they will be able to build up the facilities. Assuming that they are capable of building up and maybe to ... after such build up they will be ready to propel the business in favor of the consumer it will take how many years do you think to do it?</b><br><br>MR. CASTRO. Well, in our...<br><br><b>REP. A. M. BRAVO. On an assumption that PECO will not sell.</b><br><br>MR. CASTRO. Mr. Chair, Honorable Chair, in our opinion, well, <b>since I think capital is not a problem for us, if let's say, we're given at least a year, I mean I think we can ... we can actually come up with the system. Because like, let's say, substations, there are mobile standby substations that we can use immediately, deploy immediately while, let's say, building the permanent substations, 'no. So, I guess, again, I mean, since capital is not a problem for us then, I think at least a year would be more or less right</b>, Mr. Chair. Thank you.<br><br>REP. ANICETO JOHN D. BERTIZ. Idol ko 'yun si Bravo, pero I'm so honored that I was called. Good morning po, good morning, Mr. Chair. Actually, my question is in line with the... just a follow-up question with Congressman Anthony Bravo. Of course, it is incumbent for us, for this Committee to know what are the transitory plans and I would like to ask more... no, I mean, <b>I will not ask more but the MORE Mineral Corporation to know about what is your immediate plan because our worry is from now until January when PECO expires, what will be your immediate plan?</b> Because you know, that's the only time you will start putting up your electric posts, whatsoever, power plant, et cetera, et cetera, clearances, right of way, issues, trees to be cut, DENR, et cetera, et cetera. So, ano 'yung mangyayari? Comes January, na ano ang mangyayari doon sa ilang libong consumers or users ng existing power plant? So I just would like to know what is your immediate "' because, you know, we cannot leave those thousands of families, you know, push them back to the dark ages especially in Iloilo. Thank you, Mr. Chair.<br><br>THE CHAIRPERSON. Mr. Castro.<br><br>MR. CASTRO. Your Honor, well, we presented earlier the transition plan when the hearing started, 'no, but just to summarize, it's well, <b>once we are granted of franchise, in good faith we would negotiate with PECO on the purchase of their distribution assets. If there's a failure in that respect, well, there is the imbedded in the franchise, the expropriation</b>. Well, the other option actually is that we can come up in well, as stated earlier, within a year, at least we can come up with our own facilities, Mr. Chair. That in essence are the three points that we've presented earlier. Thank you.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>I purposely quoted at length the congressional deliberations to prove that the <b>business plan</b> has <i><b>all along</b></i> been to <b>take PECO's properties at all costs</b> since these <b>properties</b>, as <b><i>cleverly decreed</i></b> in <i><b>Section 10</b></i>, are <b>those properties "actually necessary</b>" for the <b>establishment </b>and operation of <b>MORE's</b> franchise. It has to be <b>that way</b> because petitioner <b>MORE </b>has <b>none of the facilities</b> to distribute electricity to consumers.<br><br><b>Expropriation </b>is a <b>foregone </b>conclusion; it is the <b>only way</b> by which <b>MORE </b>as the new franchisee can <b>establish and operate</b> the distribution of electricity; <b>without expropriation</b>, since <b>PECO </b>is not willing to sell its assets, Iloilo residents will suffer a <b>black-out</b>. The <b>impact</b> of Section 10 and Section 17, as their <b>respective texts</b> prove and as envisioned by the legislators, is to render the <b>condemnation </b>a <b>fait accompli</b>, and the provision on <b>expropriation proceedings a ceremonial procedure.</b><br><br>That the legislative record reveals much concern about protecting the business of<b> MORE by volunteering the taking of PECO's properties</b> is<b> nothing but consistent with</b> House Bill 8132's conclusion that "<i>[t]he quality of service of PECO has been wanting.

"</i><br><br><b>PECO's</b> representative was even <b>invited </b>to give a statement on <b>MORE's</b> application for a franchise in what appeared to be a <b>congressional trial </b>of <b>PECO's</b> alleged failings. Apart from the non-renewal of its franchise and the award thereof to <b>MORE</b>, the <b>takeover of PECO's properties by MORE</b> is the <b>legislative punishment</b> for <b>PECO's</b> purported failings.<br><br><b>MORE's business plan</b> and congressional intent are <b>relevant </b>to the <b>conclusion </b>that <b>Sections 10</b> and <b>17 </b>are <b>indeed bills of attainder</b> because they <b>follow the template</b> as to <b>why bills of attainer are enacted and why they should be banned</b>. The <b>template </b>has been elucidated as follows:<br><blockquote><b>We have just seen the danger that arises when a legislature acts in a judicial capacity and enacts bills of attainder to take private property, while simultaneously asserting that its actions are consistent with the law of the land</b>. That discussion was missing only one important ingredient - <b>motive</b>. This section discusses <b>factions as the motive for legislative defiance of due process</b>. Once again, the ban on bills of attainder is by far the best aid in understanding why factions are so dangerous.<br><br><b>Why would a legislature be tempted to defy due process, take property without compensation, and declare that its acts are above judicial review? What possible motive could elected officials have for such misguided behavior? Factions are the answer.</b> For a surprisingly clear statement as to why this is so, we turn to governmental genius James Madison. If anyone understood the workings and dangers of government, he did. Madison directly linked property takings, governmental factions, and rogue legislatures acting in a judicial capacity.<br><br>The occasion for Madison's interweaving of these topics was The Federalist No. 10. This is perhaps the single most famous of the Federalist papers penned by Madison, Hamilton, and Jay, and is best known for discussing the dangers of factions. What is less known is that this essay also related directly to bills of attainder and eminent domain takings as well.<br><br>In the middle of The Federalist No. 10, Madison made the seemingly innocent comment that <b>"no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause." This seems self-evident. How can a man judge whether he is worthy of punishment? But Madison then took this simple concept one step further and applied it to the workings of government - more specifically, the legislature</b>. He said: "[A] body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens?" In other words, Madison raised the very point discussed by Webster and Hamilton above. <b>The legislature is tempted constantly to step into the judicial sphere, unless something prevents it from doing so.</b> While Webster and Hamilton spoke in terms of individualized legislation, such as bills of attainder targeted at persons or small groups of people, Madison spread the canvas farther. Was not the same principle true when large groups were targeted for unfair treatment as well? Could not such far-reaching laws also be bills of attainder?<br><br><b>And just what were the groups that comprised opposing factions?</b> Madison gave the answer in no uncertain terms: <b>"The most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests</b> in society." Madison was no communist, however, and he was not in any way criticizing an unequal distribution of property or asserting that there should be a redistribution of the same to make everyone equal. For him, such a proposition would be impossible, since the acquisition of property was derived from the very unique personalities of individual men. He referred to this concept as "the diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate." Then came his key point - that <b>it was the government's job to protect and preserve such individual faculties, which in turn would forever preserve factions:</b><br><br>The protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From <b>the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties.<br><br>What type of government would preserve property factions as necessary and unavoidable</b> elements of society, <b>while at the same time preventing them from controlling the legislature</b> and exceeding its powers through bills of attainder? A large republic, answered Madison in The Federalist No. 10 - <b>a republic in which small groups of representatives from large and distant population centers would effectively hold each other in check.</b><br><br>Of course, Madison believed that <b>the most effective way the Congress could accomplish this task was through a legislative veto</b>, as he had originally proposed. This legislative veto, <b>however, had been overturned and replaced with a judicial veto over unacceptable state acts, such as the ban on bills of attainder</b>. Madison still hoped and believed that the structure of the federal republic, combined with the limits in Article I, Section 10, would provide the needed protection against factions. He stated in the Federalist No. 44:<br><br>Bills of attainder, ex-post-facto laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation... <b>Very properly, therefore, has the convention added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights ... The sober people of America are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed the public councils. They have seen with regret and indignation that sudden changes and legislative interferences,</b> in cases affecting personal rights, <b>become jobs in the hands of enterprising and influential speculators ...</b><br><br>Madison was not the only one who said that the ban on bills of attainder was the chief vehicle to overcome the dangers of factions. Justice Iredell in <i>Minge v. Gilmour</i> said:<br><br><b>In times of violent faction or confusion of any kind, men are often prompted, if they can, to destroy their adversaries under the color of the la</b>w. The numerous acts of attainder in England, and other arbitrary parliamentary punishments, show how necessary it was for a wise people, forming a constitution for themselves,<b> to guard against tyrannies like these.</b><br><br>In sum, <b>the greatest fear of the founding generation was that the factions</b> - which are always present in society, and <b>which arise because of unavoidable differences in property ownership</b> - would <b>use the government itself to oppress</b> their fellow citizens. The founders hoped that the nature of America's large republic would overcome this problem. But if the republic failed to do so fully, <b>a very specific ban on egregious, faction- based takings legislation could also be used as a protection. This protection was the ban on bills of attainder</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><i><b>D. Conclusion</b></i><br><br>Admittedly, the use of the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection has long faded. Nonetheless, it does not need to be that way. As has been said:<br><blockquote><b>The ban on bills of attainder still stands as a bulwark of liberty to those whose property is arbitrarily taken by an unjustified legislative act</b>. The provision itself has not changed, but only our understanding of it. <b>The provision can protect </b>both persons and groups who for a time are unpopular - such as those of Japanese descent in World War II, suspected communists in the 1950s, or suspected terrorists today - as well as <b>persons or groups that own property the government wants, and then exerts pressure to obtain. Courts today should not be afraid to apply this unique and powerful tool as it was applied in the days of our early history</b>. And when they do, courts will discover that it clarifies many other constitutional principles as well.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><b>II. <i>Sections 10 and 17 violate the equal protection clause.</i></b><br><br>In <i><b>Biraogo v. The Philippine Truth Commission of 2010</b></i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the Court nullified then President Aquino's Executive Order No. 1 creating the Truth Commission and tasking it to investigate reported cases of graft and corruption allegedly committed during the presidency of President Macapagal-Arroyo. The Court held that this executive rule violated the equal protection clause, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>The equal protection clause is aimed at all official state actions, not just those of the legislature. Its inhibitions cover all the departments of the government including the political and executive departments, and extend to all actions of a state denying equal protection of the laws, through whatever agency or whatever guise is taken.<br><br>It, however, does not require the universal application of the laws to all persons or things without distinction. What it simply requires is equality among equals as determined according to a valid classification. Indeed, the equal protection clause permits classification. <b>Such classification, however, to be valid must pass the test of reasonableness. The test has four requisites: (1) The classification rests on substantial distinctions; (2) It is germane to the purpose of the law; (3) It is not limited to existing conditions only; and (4) It applies equally to all members of the same class</b>. "Superficial differences do not make for a valid classification."<br><br>For a classification to meet the requirements of constitutionality, it must include or embrace all persons who naturally belong to the class....<br><br>The classification must not be based on existing circumstances only, or so constituted as to preclude addition to the number included in the class. It must be of such a nature as to embrace all those who may thereafter be in similar circumstances and conditions. It must not leave out or "under include" those that should otherwise fall into a certain classification....<br><br><b>Applying these precepts to this case, Executive Order No. 1 should be struck down as violative of the equal protection clause. The clear mandate of the envisioned truth commission is to investigate and find out the truth "concerning the reported cases of graft and corruption during the previous administration" only. The intent to single out the previous administration is plain, patent and manifest.</b><br><br>Mention of it has been made in at least three portions of the questioned executive order. Specifically, these are....<br><br><b>In this regard, it must be borne in mind that the Arroyo administration is but just a member of a class, that is, a class of past administrations. It is not a class of its own. </b>Not to include past administrations similarly situated constitutes arbitrariness which the equal protection clause cannot sanction.<b> Such discriminating differentiation clearly reverberates to label the commission as a vehicle for vindictiveness and selective retribution.</b><br><br>To reiterate, in order <b>for a classification to meet the requirements of constitutionality, it must include or embrace all persons who naturally belong to the class. "Such a classification must not be</b> based on existing circumstances only, or <b>so constituted as to preclude additions to the number included within a class, but must be of such a nature as to embrace all those who may thereafter be in similar circumstances</b> and conditions. Furthermore, all who are in situations and circumstances which are relative to the discriminatory legislation and which are indistinguishable from those of the members of the class must be brought under the influence of the law and treated by it in the same way as are the members of the class."</blockquote>Here, Sections 10 and 17 are directed <b>only </b>against respondent <b>PECO</b>. While the language of these provisions may be construed to refer to property owners other than <b>PECO</b>, the congressional deliberations made it very clear and categorical that<b> the take-over is solely with regard to PECO and its properties</b>. The <b>overriding intent</b> is the <b><i><u>legislated</u> </i>taking, condemnation of expropriation of PECO's assets and no other entity's properties, because this is petitioner MORE's business plan</b> as it has<b> none of the facilities</b> to establish and operate the distribution of electricity within its franchise area. This is the same <b>evil </b>that <i><b>Biraogo </b></i>has railed against, the <b>singling out</b> of a person for the <b>imposition of burdens</b> that and whenever<b> the singled out person is not willing to accept.</b><br><br>Indeed, what <b>differentiates </b>respondent <b>PECO </b>from other property owners? <b>PECO </b>is<b> not the only entity</b> that has "<i>poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment.</i> " As admitted by petitioner <b>MORE</b>,<br><br><blockquote>Well, the other option is definitely MORE Power is ready to build its own distribution assets, 'no. We can provide our own personnel and, well, again, as also mentioned during the last, I think, during the last two hearings, 'no, we were saying that personnel is not really that difficult to source, 'no, since it is readily available in the market.<br><br>... since I think capital is not a problem for us, if let's say, we're given at least a year, I mean I think we can ... we can actually come up with the system. Because like, let's say, substations, there are mobile standby substations that we can use immediately, deploy immediately while, let's say, building the permanent substations, 'no. So, I guess, again, I mean, since capital is not a problem for us then, I think at least a year would be more or less right...</blockquote><br>Hence, there is <b>no basis</b> for Sections 10 and 17 to <b>single out</b> PECO for the <b>take-over</b> and <b>condemnation </b>of its properties and to drive it altogether from doing <b>other legitimate businesses</b> as regards its assets.<br><i><b><br>III. Response to Key Points in the Ponencia.</b></i><br><br>With the kind indulgence of my friend, the revered <i>ponente</i>, Justice Reyes, Jr., may I politely reply.<br><br><blockquote>The <i>ponencia </i>admits:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>At the same time, Section 17 expressly provides that, even as PECO is operating the distribution system, this interim arrangement shall not prevent MORE from acquiring the system through the exercise of the right of eminent domain. Thus, after R.A. No. 11212 took effect on March 9, 2019, MORE filed on March 11, 2019 a Complaint for Expropriation with the Regional Trial Court of Iloilo City, Branch 37 (Iloilo RTC), over the distribution system of PECO in Iloilo City.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>xxxx Ownership was co-existent with the franchise, xxxx</blockquote>The reference to an expropriation proceeding now before the trial court strengthens the view that <b>MORE </b>has been true to its business plan of <b>merely taking over PECO's properties</b> to establish, operate and maintain its franchise. The ponencia's statement that "[ojwnership was co-existent with the franchise" further proves that the <b>confiscation of PECO's properties</b> is the <b>Congress' primordial means</b> of supporting <b>MORE's</b> franchise.<br><blockquote>Expropriation by MORE of the distribution system of PECO is for a genuine public purpose<br><br>The next legal issue is whether expropriation by MORE of PECO's distribution asset under Section 10 and Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 is for a genuine public purpose. To reiterate, while it is Congress that defines public necessity or purpose, the Court has the power to review whether such necessity is genuine and public in character, by applying as standards the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection.<br><br>In its assailed decision, the RTC held that while R.A. No. 11212 authorizes MORE to expropriate the private property of PECO and to apply the same to the public purpose of power distribution, such identified public purpose is not genuine for ultimately it is the private interest of MORE that will be served by the expropriation. In other words, the expropriation is an ill-disguised corporate takeover.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Even without these developments in Western jurisprudence, the genuineness of the public purpose of the expropriation of the distribution system of PECO can be determined from R.A. No. 11212 itself.<br><br>Expropriation under Section 10 and Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 is not only for the general purpose of electricity distribution. A more distinct public purpose is emphasized: the protection of the public interest by ensuring the uninterrupted supply of electricity in the city during the transition from the old franchise to the new franchise. This distinct purpose has arisen because MORE is the new franchise holder in a city whose public space is already burdened by an existing distribution system, and that distribution system cannot continue to serve a public use for it is owned by the old franchise holder.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The public necessity of ensuring uninterrupted electricity is implicit in Section 10, which authorizes MORE to expropriate the existing distribution system to enable itself to efficiently establish its service. This distinct public necessity is reiterated in Section 17 under which MORE may initiate expropriation proceedings even as PECO is provisionally operating the distribution system. In fact, this distinct public necessity of ensuring uninterrupted electricity is the very rationale of the ERC in granting PECO a provisional CPCN. The provisional CPCN is the legal basis of PECO's continued operation of the distribution system. PECO cannot deny that such distinct necessity to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply is public and genuine.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x x In sum, expropriation by MORE of the distribution system of PECO under Sections 10 and 17 serves both the general public interest of conveying power and electricity in Iloilo City and the peculiar public interest and security of ensuring the interrupted supply of electricity. The RTC erred in declaring these provisions unconstitutional.</blockquote>The discussion in the ponencia <b>validates </b>what I have been saying all along that <b>Congress</b> through Sections 10 and 17 has already <b>determined </b>and settled the issues inherent in an <b>otherwise judicial </b>expropriation proceeding. The court expropriation case has become and will be a <i><b>fait accompli,</b></i> a <b>ceremonial figurehead.</b><br><br>Additionally, the <b>public purpose</b> for the expropriation <b>did not arise</b> because, to quote the <i>ponencia</i>, "MORE is the new franchise holder in a city whose public space is already burdened by an existing distribution system, and that distribution system cannot continue to serve a public use for it is owned by the old franchise holder."<br><br><b>Rather</b>, the <b>public use <i>came about</i></b> because MORE <b>has had none of the facilities and the people</b> to establish, operate and maintain the franchise. The fact that PECO has its facilities in the franchise area <b>does not justify</b> the expropriation, because there <b>would have been no use for these facilities <i>if only MORE has been equipped</i></b> and <b><i>skilled </i></b>to <i><b>perform </b></i>the <b>franchise it sought and was awarded.</b><br><br>It is <b>unfair </b>and <b>out-of-line</b> to turn the tables on <b>PECO </b>when it is <b>MORE </b>that has no equipment and people to make its franchise useful to the people it is intended to serve.<br><br>The <i>ponencia </i>claims that:<br><blockquote>In her Dissenting Opinion, Justice Javier extends the concept of bill of attainder to cover Sec. 10 and Sec. 17 in that these legislations purportedly single out PECO and subject the latter to punishment without the benefit of trial.<b> This conception bills of attainder is problematic for, as correctly pointed out by Justice Leonen in his dissent, a legislative franchise is not a right but a special privilege the grant, amendment, repeal or termination of which is granted to Congress by no less than the Constitution</b>. Consequently, the termination of a franchise by its expiration is not a deprivation of a right or property that amounts to punishment. There is no question that the franchise of PECO was allowed to lapse because of its failure to render competent public service. No prior judicial trial of the performance of PECO is required before Congress may decide not to renew PECO's franchise. The power of this Court to subject to judicial review the constitutionality of a franchise legislation does not include the power to choose the franchise holder. That is not our place in the constitutional scheme of things.</blockquote>With due respect, it is indeed problematic that the ponencia has completely <b>misconstrued </b>and <b>misappreciated </b>the point of my dissent. What I claim to be bills of attainder are Section 10 and Section 17 of MORE's franchise, and <b>certainly not</b> the denial of <b>PECO's</b> franchise. The latter is <b>not </b>the subject matter of this case and therefore I cannot have assailed or challenged it in my dissent. In any event, the grant or denial of a franchise begins and ends with Congress - that is a given.<br><br>What I point out as <b>bills of attainder are Section 10 and Section 17 RA 11212</b>, which have <b>burdened PECO</b> with the <b>fait accompli expropriation or taking </b>of its property in a manner that <b>dispenses with the judicial trial</b> on whether public use and public necessity are present in the take-over of PECO properties. Here, it was Congress itself that has become<b> no only the initial but also the final arbiter of what essentially has always been a judicial function.<br></b><br>To be sure, the denial of PECO's franchise and the grant of franchise to MORE <b>did not have</b> to come with the <b>added burden to PECO</b> of a <b>legislatively determined</b> expropriation of PECO's assets. The <b>two actions</b> are actually separable from each other, and hence, a challenge on the latter <b>does not amount</b> to an attack on the former.<br><br>The <i>ponencia </i>also holds:<br><blockquote>Justice Javier argues that Sec. 10 and Sec. 17 virtually enable MORE to piggyback on PECO in order to establish and operate its franchise. Every legislative franchise enables the franchise holder to expropriate with the view of building its distribution system. Even PECO obtained the franchise from De La Rama along with the authority to use public spaces for the installation of its distribution system. MORE is authorized to acquire the assets of PECO and any other assets of any other entity that might be available as these are be necessary for the discharge of its public franchise.</blockquote>There is a huge difference between a consensual acquisition of another's property and a forcible or coercive take-over thereof. The latter is an exercise of State power that the <i>Constitution</i> restrains. While a legislation may authorize its exercise and <b>initially </b>determines the propriety of its exercise, it is a <b>court decree</b> that <b>makes the ultimate lawfully binding determination</b> on the basis of the existence of public use and public necessity and the payment of just compensation. In the case at bar,<b> the process has been skewed</b> because Section 10 and Section 17 of RA 11212 themselves, as confirmed by the legislative deliberations, <b>have adjudged with finality</b> the existence of the elements that should have been the court's prerogative to adjudicate. Even the Court, though it is <b>not </b>the expropriation court,<b> has already found </b>in the present case and on the basis or upon the lead of Section 10 and Section 17, that the take-over is for a public use and publicly necessary.<br><br>Thus, while I sincerely appreciate the ponencicCs discussion on the points I have raised,<b> I still cannot find myself</b> to agree with both the rationale and the conclusion it has reached. I maintain my dissent.<br><br><i><b>IV. Thoughts on Justice Caguioa's Opinion.</b></i><br><br>As always, my friend and senior colleague's thoughts have sharpened the points of discussion.<br><br><b>One</b>. I agree with Justice Caguioa that "the power of expropriation is by no means absolute." But the power of eminent domain is <b>not only limited</b> by <i>public use </i>and <i>just compensation</i>; <b>genuine public necessity</b> and the <b>proscription against bills of attainder</b> similarly restrict the exercise of this State power.<br><br><b>Two</b>. I disagree with the thought that "the Constitution does not sanction the taking of a private [property]" only if "the <b>sole </b>purpose" thereof is to transfer it to another private party. Sole means only, one and only, single, solitary, lone, unique. But, as the Opinion itself cites, <b>even </b>the <b>confluence </b>of <b>private and public</b> benefits, <b>not solely</b> the conferment of private benefits, may destroy the public use claim of an expropriation "when the purported public use is merely incidental or pretextual, thereby serving as a guise to favor private interests." <b>Clearly</b>, the fact that there is a <b>gloss of public use</b> to a taking <b>does not end</b> the debate simply because it is <b>not the sol</b>e purpose of the taking to benefit a private party. The <b>incidental or pretextual public use defense</b> has been explained in this manner:<br><blockquote>When determining the limits of the government's right to take private property, we will defer to the General [***36] Assembly's exercise of those powers. Id. at 543; SWIDA, 199 111. 2d at 236 ("Great deference should be afforded the legislature and its granting of eminent domain authority."). Under SWIDA,<b> that deference evaporates when the public purpose behind the taking is a pretext, when a municipality uses eminent domain as a weapon to forcibly transfer property from one private owner to another.</b> See SWIDA, 199 111. 2d at 240 ("While [SWIDA's] activities here were undertaken in the guise of carrying out its legislated mission, SWIDA's true intentions were not clothed in an independent, legitimate governmental decision to further a planned public use."); <i>Kelo v. City of New London, Connecticut, </i>545 U.S. 469, 478, 125 S. Ct. 2655, 162 L. Ed. 2d 439 (2005) (noting government would not be allowed "to take property under the mere pretext of a public purpose, w<b>hen its actual purpose was to bestow private benefit</b>."); cf. <i>Franco v. National Capital Revitalization Corp.</i>, 930 A.2d 160, 169 (D.C. 2007) (finding "<b>pretext" to be valid affirmative defense to condemnation</b> for economic redevelopment).<br><br>Recognizing the difference between a valid public use and a sham can be challenging. But <b>a telling feature of sound public use in the context of economic redevelopment is the existence of a well-developed, publicly vetted, and thoughtful economic development plan. Such a plan was present in Kelo</b>,545 U.S. at 483-84, and Gutknecht, 3 111. 2d at 542-43, <b>but absent in SWIDA</b>, 199 111. 2d at 240 ("SWIDA did not conduct or commission [***37] a thorough study of the parking situation at [the racetrack]. Nor did it formulate any economic plan requiring additional parking at the racetrack "). <b>A taking will likely pass constitutional muster where done in furtherance of a sound economic development plan, rather than [****432] 1**522] the plan retroactively justifying the taking</b>. Cf. <i>Romeo v. Cranston Redevelopment Agency</i>, 105 R.I. 651, 254 A.2d 426, 433 (R.I. 1969) ("governing bodies must either plan for the development or redevelopment of urban areas or permit them to become more congested, deteriorated, obsolescent, unhealthy, stagnant, inefficient and costly" (internal quotation marks omitted)).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote>As has been copiously quoted and also explained at length, <b>MORE's business plan</b> from the beginning has been to <b>take over PECO's</b> properties. There was <b>no </b>well-developed, publicly vetted, and thoughtful plan as<b> the idea was simply to take</b> and<b> justify this taking by retroactively referring to MORE's business plan</b> of simply taking over PECO's properties.<br><br>In <b><i>Southwestern III. Dev. Auth. v. Nat'I City Envtl, L.L.C</i></b>.,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[34]</sup></font> a government agency sought to expropriate private parcels of land to be conveyed to a private race track which would then build additional parking spaces for its clientele. The court ruled that the public benefits arising from the parking spaces were merely incidental and pretextual to the profit motivation of the private race track. Thus:<br><blockquote>If this taking were allowed to stand, it may be true that spectators at Gateway would benefit greatly. <b>Developing additional parking could benefit the members of the public who choose to attend events at the racetrack, as spectators may often have to wait in long lines of traffic to park their vehicles and again to depart the facility.

Eden Cemetery Ass'n</i>, 16 111. 2d 539, 158 N.E.2d 766 (1959). The public is allowed to park on the property in exchange for the payment of a fee. <b>Gateway's racetrack may be open to the public, but not "by right."</b> Gaylord, 204 111. at 584. It is <b>a private venture designed to [*239] result not in a public use, but in private profits</b>. If this taking were permitted,<b> lines to enter parking lots might be shortened and pedestrians might [***21] be able to cross from parking areas to event areas in a safer manner. However,</b> we are <b>unpersuaded </b>that these facts alone are sufficient to satisfy the public use requirement, especially in light of evidence that <b>Gateway could have built a parking garage structure on its existing property.</b><br><br>We have also recognized that <b>economic development is an important public purpose</b>. See <i>People ex Pel. City of Canton v. Crouch</i>, 79 111. 2d 356, 38 111. Dec. 154, 403 N.E.2d 242 (1980); <i>People ex rel. City of Urbana v. Paley</i>, 68 111. 2d 62, 11 111.

SWIDA presented extensive testimony that <b>expanding Gateway's facilities through the taking of NCE's property would allow it to grow and prosper and contribute to positive economic growth in the region. However, "incidentally, every lawful business does this.</b>" Gaylord, 204 111. at 586. Moreover, nearly a century ago, Gaylord expressed the long­standing rule that "<b>to constitute a public use, something more than a mere benefit to the public must flow from the contemplated improvement.</b> [***22] " Gaylord, 204 111. at 584.<br><br>This case is strikingly similar to our earlier decision in <i>Limits Industrial R.R. Co. v. American Spiral Pipe Works</i>, 321 111. 101, 151 N.E. 567 (1926). In Limits Industrial, this court held that a railroad could not exercise eminent domain authority to acquire property for the purpose of expanding its facilities. Despite a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Illinois Commerce Commission, we found the proposed spur track and public [**10] [****250] freight house provided <b>minimal public benefit and principally benefitted the railroad itself and a few other business entities</b>. Limits Industrial, 321 111. at 109-10. Similarly, it is incumbent upon us to question SWIDA's findings as to the parking situation at Gateway and <b>determine whether [*240] the true beneficiaries of this taking are private businesses and not the public.</b><br><br><b>We do not require a bright-line test to find that this taking bestows a purely private benefit and lacks a showing of a supporting legislative purpose</b>. As was the case in Limits Industrial, <b>members of the public are not the primary intended beneficiaries of this taking.</b> Limits Industrial, 321 111. at 109-10. [***23]<b> This condemnation clearly was intended to assist Gateway in accomplishing their goals in a swift, economical, and profitable manner.</b><br><br><b>Entities such as SWIDA must always be mindful of expediency, cost efficiency, and profitability while accepting the legislature's charge to promote development</b> within their defined parameters. However, <b>these goals must not be allowed to overshadow the constitutional principles</b> that lie at the heart of the power with which SWIDA and similar entities have been entrusted. As Justice Kuehn stated in dissent in the appellate court, "If property ownership is to remain what our forefathers intended it to be, if it is to remain a part of the liberty we cherish, <b>the economic by­products of a private capitalist's ability to develop land cannot justify a surrender of ownership to eminent domain</b>." 304 111. App. 3d at 556 (Kuehn, J., specially concurring).<br><br>While the activities here were undertaken in the guise of carrying out its legislated mission, <b>SWIDA's true intentions were not clothed in an independent, legitimate governmental decision to further a planned public use. SWIDA did not conduct or commission a thorough study of the parking situation</b> [***24] at Gateway. <b>Nor did it formulate any economic plan requiring additional parking at the racetrack. SWIDA advertised that, for a fee, it would condemn land at the request of "private developers" for the "private use"</b> of developers. In addition, SWIDA entered into <b>a contract</b> with Gateway <b>to condemn whatever land "may be desired</b> *** by Gateway." Clearly, [*241] the <b>foundation of this taking is rooted not in the economic and planning process</b> with which SWIDA has been charged. <b>Rather, this action was undertaken solely in response to Gateway's expansion goals and its failure to accomplish those goals through purchasing</b> NCE's land at an acceptable negotiated price. <b>It appears SWIDA's true intentions were to act as a default broker of land for Gateway's proposed parking plan.</b><br><br>This point is further emphasized by the fact that <b>other options were available to Gateway that could have addressed many of the problems</b> testified to by Pritchett, Ortbals and others. Gateway could have built a parking garage structure on its existing property rather than develop the land owned by NCE. <b>However, when Gateway discovered that the cost of constructing a garage on land it already owned was substantially higher than [***25] using SWIDA as its agent to take NCE's property for open-field parking, Gateway chose the easier and less expensive avenue.</b><br><br>As a result of the acquisition of NCE's property, Gateway could realize an estimated increase of $ 13 to $ 14 million in projected revenue per year. While we do not deny that this expansion in revenue could potentially trickle down and bring corresponding revenue increases to the region, revenue expansion alone does not justify an improper and unacceptable expansion [* * 11 ] [* * * *251 ] of the eminent domain power of the government. Using the power of the government for purely private purposes to allow Gateway to avoid the open real estate market and expand its facilities in a more cost-efficient manner, and thus maximizing corporate profits, is a misuse of the power entrusted by the public.<br><br>The legislature intended that SWIDA actively foster economic development and expansion in Madison and St. Clair Counties. 70 ILCS 520/2(g), 5 (West 1998). However, the actions of SWIDA in this case blur the lines between [*242] a public use and a private purpose. A highway toll authority may justify the use of eminent domain to ensure that motorists have reasonable access [***26] to gas stations. Illinois Toll Highway Comm'n, 16 111. 2d at 546.<b> Does the highway authority's power include the ability to use eminent domain authority to take additional land for a car wash, and then a lube shop? Could the authority then use its power to facilitate additional expansions for a motel, small retail shops, and entertainment centers? The initial, legitimate development of a public project does not justify condemnation for any and all related business expansions.</b><br><br>SWIDA contends that the "wisdom *** of the legislation and 'the means of executing the project' are beyond judicial scrutiny 'once the public purpose has been established.' It is that purpose which controls and not the 'means' or 'mechanics' of how the purpose is carried out." We disagree. The Constitution and the essential liberties we are sworn to protect control. In its wisdom, the legislature has given SWIDA the authority to use eminent domain power to encourage private enterprise and become involved in commercial projects that may benefit a specific region of this state. While we do not question the legislature's discretion in allowing for the exercise of eminent domain power, "the government [***27] does not have unlimited power to redefine property rights." <i>Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.,</i> 458 U.S. 419, 439, 73 L. Ed. 2d 868, 885, 102 S. Ct. 3164, 3178 (1982).

The trial judge and all the members of the Supreme Court of Connecticut agreed that there was no evidence of an illegitimate purpose in this case. Therefore, as was true of the statute challenged in Midkiff, 467 U.S., at 245, 81 L. Ed. 2d 186, 104 S.

On pages 4 to 5 of his Opinion, Justice Caguioa <b>confirms </b>that the <b>expropriation of PECO's properties</b> has its <b>roots </b>in the perceived shortfalls in PECO's services.

With this determination, <b>what else are</b> <b>we to expect from the lower court hearing the expropriation proceedings?</b> This confirms what I have been saying all along that <b>PECO has been singled out</b> and <b>punished for its alleged poor services</b> through the take-over of its properties whose <b>validity and legitimacy</b> have been <b>settled by legislative fiat</b> through Sections 10 and 17.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY, </b>I vote to <b>DISMISS </b>the petitions and <b>AFFIRM </b>the trial court's Judgment dated July 1, 2019, declaring Sections 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. 11212 <b>UNCONSTITUTIONAL </b>for being bills of attainder and for being violative of the equal protection clause.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="left"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> This epigraph is from the title of a law journal article authored by Prof. Carol L.
