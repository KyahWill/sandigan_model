CEB-SP No. 10946 which upheld the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated January 30, 2017 and the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated March 23, 2017 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC Case No. VAC-01-000024-2017 which held, <i>inter alia</i>, that: (a) petitioners Heirs of Reynaldo A. Andag (Reynaldo), namely Veneranda B. Andag, Jaymark B. Andag, Honey Grace B. Andag, <i>et al'</i>s (petitioners) claim for damages against respondent DMC Construction Equipment Resources, Inc. (DMCI) is a claim based on torts which is cognizable by the regular courts; and (<i>b</i>) petitioners are not entitled to the monetary reliefs sought.<br><b><center><br>The Facts<br></center></b><br>Petitioners alleged that on July 16, 2012, respondent DMC Construction Equipment Resources Inc. (DMCI) employed Reynaldo as Second Mate on its tugboat, the MIT Alexander Paul. On October 18, 2013, as the tugboat was towing an overloaded barge, a recoiling rope accidentally struck Reynaldo causing him to be thrown towards the ship's iron bars. Reynaldo was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Months after, DMCI contacted petitioners and told them that it would give them the amount of P200,000.00 as compensation for Reynaldo's death under the condition that they would execute a waiver and quitclaim in its favor. After refusing the offer, petitioners no longer heard from DMCI, prompting them to send a formal demand letter, which the latter ignored.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Thus, they were constrained to file the instant complaint against respondent before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), Regional Arbitration Branch No. VI of Iloilo City seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, the payment of: (<i>a</i>) death compensation/benefits; (<i>b</i>) actual damages, moral damages, exemplary damages, and attorney's fees for the latter's alleged negligence resulting in the death of Reynaldo; and (<i>c</i>) other monetary claims due to Reynaldo, <i>e.g</i>, holiday pay, service incentive leave pay, and 13<sup>th</sup> month pay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In its defense, DMCI maintained that: (<i>a</i>) petitioners should recover death benefits not from it as Reynaldo's employer, but from the State Insurance Fund, <i>i.e</i>., the Social Security System (SSS); (<i>b</i>) the amount of P200,000.00 it offered to petitioners represents the proceeds of the accidental death insurance policy it voluntarily secured in favor of its employees which the latter, unfortunately, refused to accept; and (<i>c</i>) it had already paid Reynaldo's monetary benefits as evidenced by various documents such as the latter's payslips.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><b><center><br>The LA Ruling<br></center></b><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated September 28, 2016, the Labor Arbiter (LA) dismissed the complaint for lack of cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The LA agreed with DMCI that petitioners' claim for death benefits should have been made before the State Insurance Fund. It also pointed out that petitioners failed to present evidence of DMCI's liability for Reynaldo's death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Further, it denied their claim for moral and exemplary damages for lack of merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Finally, the LA found that DMCI had already paid all the wages and monetary benefits due to Reynaldo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioners appealed to the NLRC.<br><b><center><br>The NLRC Ruling<br></center></b><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated January 30, 2017, the NLRC affirmed the LA ruling with modification, ordering DMCI to turn over to petitioners the P200,000.00 accidental death insurance proceeds without any condition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It ruled that: <b><i><u>first</u></i></b>, as to the death benefits, since it was shown that Reynaldo was an inter-island seaman, <i>i.e</i>., working within Philippine waters, and in the absence of any contractual provision showing that DMCI is liable for death benefits, petitioners should seek payment of such death benefits not from DMCI, but from the State Insurance Fund, particularly the SSS.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <b><i><u>Second</u></i></b>, as for the claim of damages arising from DMCI's alleged negligence resulting in the death of Reynaldo, the NLRC held that the Labor Tribunals have no jurisdiction to hear this cause of action, as it is a claim based on torts which is cognizable by the regular courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <b><i><u>Third</u></i></b>, as for the additional death insurance proceeds, the same should be released to petitioners without any condition considering that the same had already been released to DMCI, albeit the latter was unable to turn-over the same to petitioners because it unduly conditioned it on petitioners signing a waiver and quitclaim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Finally, while the NLRC was silent as to petitioners' other monetary claims due to Reynaldo, the ruling implied that it was upholding the LA's findings on this regard, <i>i.e</i>. , that the same had already been paid by DMCI.<br><br>Dissatisfied, petitioners moved for partial reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> but were denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated March 23, 2017. Hence, they filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> before the CA, principally assailing the NLRC's findings that: (<i>a</i>) petitioners' claim for damages against DMCI is a claim based on torts which is cognizable by the regular courts; and (<i>b</i>) petitioners are not entitled to the monetary reliefs sought.<br><b><center><br>The CA Ruling<br></center></b><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated February 28, 2018, the CA upheld the assailed NLRC rulings. It held that the NLRC did not gravely abuse its discretion in holding that: (<i>a</i>) petitioners' claim for damages against DMCI is a claim based on torts which is cognizable by the regular courts; and (<i>b</i>) petitioners are not entitled to the monetary reliefs sought as it was shown that DMCI had already paid the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, petitioners moved for reconsideration which the CA denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated December 12, 2018. Hence, this petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><b><center><br>The Issue Before the Court<br></center></b><br>The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA correctly ruled that the NLRC did not gravely abuse its discretion in issuing its assailed rulings.<br><b><center><br>The Court's Ruling<br></center><br></b><br>The petition is without merit.<br><br>"Preliminarily, the Court stresses the distinct approach in reviewing a CA's ruling in a labor case. In a Rule 45 review, the Court examines the correctness of the CA's Decision in contrast with the review of jurisdictional errors under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits the review to questions of law. In ruling for legal correctness, the Court views the CA Decision in the same context that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> was presented to the CA. Hence, the Court has to examine the CA's Decision from the prism of whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>"Case law states that grave abuse of discretion connotes a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment, done in a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, the character of which being so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><blockquote>"In labor cases, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed to the NLRC when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, which refers to that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. Thus, if the NLRC's ruling has basis in the evidence and the applicable law and jurisprudence, then no grave abuse of discretion exists and the CA should so declare and, accordingly, dismiss the petition."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>Guided by the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the CA correctly found no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in issuing its assailed rulings, as the same is in accord with the evidence on record, as well as settled principles of labor law.<br><br>At this juncture, the Court deems it worthy to point out that petitioners seek the following: (<i>a</i>) death compensation/benefits for Reynaldo; (<i>b</i>) damages arising from DMCI's purported negligence which resulted in Reynaldo's death; (<i>c</i>) additional death benefits; and (<i>d</i>) other monetary claims due to Reynaldo, <i>e.g</i>., holiday pay, service incentive leave pay, and 13<sup>th</sup> month pay.<br><br>Anent the death compensation/benefits, the NLRC aptly noted that while Reynaldo was indeed employed by DMCI as a seafarer, it must nevertheless be pointed out that he was merely deployed in an inter-island vessel sailing domestic waters. This being the case, his employment was not covered by any POEA-Standard Employment Contract typical to employment contracts involving seafarers sailing in international waters – a contract which specifically contains provisions which make an employer liable should a seafarer perish while on duty. Absent any specific provision in his employment contract with DMCI, Reynaldo's death on duty is governed by the Labor Code, particularly, Articles 174, 178, 179, and 200 (a) [formerly Articles 168, 172, 173, and 194 (a)]<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[29]</sup></font> thereof. In this regard, case law instructs that "[t]he clear intent of the law is that the employer should be relieved of the obligation of directly paying his employees compensation for work-connected illness or injury o n the theory that this is part of the cost of production or business activity; and that no longer would there be need for adversarial proceedings between an employer and hi s employee in which there were specific legal presumptions operating in favor of the employee and statutorily specified defenses available to an employer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Hence, "[o]nce the employer pays his share to the fund, all obligation on his part to his employees is ended."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Given the foregoing, the Labor Tribunals correctly ruled that DMCI is not liable for Reynaldo's death benefits as it is the State Insurance Fund, more particularly the SSS, which is liable therefor.<br><br>Anent petitioner's claim for damages arising from DMCI's purported negligence which resulted in Reynaldo's death, the NLRC correctly ruled that petitioners' allegations in their Position Paper<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> before the LA make out a cause of action for a tort, which is cognizable not by the labor tribunals, but by the regular courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> On this note, while the maintenance of a safe and healthy workplace is ordinarily a subject of labor cases, case law nevertheless clarifies that a claim <b><i><u>specifically grounded on the employer's negligence</u></i></b> to provide a safe, healthy and workable environment for its employees is no longer a labor issue, but rather, is a case for <i>quasi-delict</i> which is under the jurisdiction of the regular courts,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> as in this case. Hence, should petitioners wish to pursue this cause of action against DMCI, it should file the proper case therefor before the regular courts.<br><br>As for the claim for additional death benefits, the Court notes that the NLRC already ruled that petitioners are entitled to the amount of P200,000.00 representing the accidental death insurance proceeds which DMCI voluntarily procured for its employees, such as Reynaldo; and that DMCI should turn-over said amount to petitioners <i>sans</i> any condition.<br><br>Finally, as for the other monetary claims purportedly still due to Reynaldo, the Labor Tribunals had correctly found that the same had already been paid for by DMCI, as such finding was substantiated by evidence on record, <i>e.g</i>, payslips. Verily, factual findings of labor tribunals, especially when affirmed by the CA, are generally accorded not only with respect, but even with finality, and are thus binding on the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In conclusion, no grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed in the assailed NLRC rulings. Hence, the CA correctly affirmed the same.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
