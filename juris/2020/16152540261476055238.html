On the contrary, the records showed that the petitioners have been residing in the subject property long before the respondents purchased the same on March 9, 1997.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Thus, it was improbable for the petitioners to ask permission from the respondents to construct their houses sometime in 1997.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> As such, the RTC opined that the respondents should avail of a different remedy to obtain possession of the subject property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the RTC ruling reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is GRANTED.

As such, it cannot form part of the reclaimed area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the CA opined that even assuming that Lot No. 635 forms part of the reclaimed area, the petitioners failed to prove that their entry into the subject land preceded respondents' acquisition thereof.

However, ownership by itself, does not grant the owner an unbridled authority to wrest possession from the lawful occupant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Rather, to recover possession, the owner must avail of the proper judicial remedy and satisfy all the conditions necessary for the chosen action to prosper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> These remedies can be an <i>accion reivindicatoria, action publiciana</i>, or <i>accion interdictal</i>.<br><br>Particularly, an <i>accion reivindicatoria</i> is a suit to recover possession of a parcel of land as an element of ownership.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It is filed before the proper Regional Trial Court. The judgment in said case determines the ownership of the property and awards possession to the lawful owner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, an <i>accion publiciana</i> is a plenary action to recover the right of possession, and is brought before the proper RTC when the dispossession has lasted for more than one year. It is an ordinary civil proceeding to determine the better right of possession independent of title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Finally, an <i>accion interdictal</i> is a summary action that determines the right to physical possession, independent of ownership. It is cognizable by the proper Municipal or Metropolitan Trial Court. An <i>accion interdictal</i> comprises two distinct causes of action - forcible entry and unlawful detainer. They are distinguished mainly by the nature of the deforciant's entry into the property. Specifically, in forcible entry, possession is illegal at the outset, as entry was effected through force, intimidation, strategy, threats, or stealth. On the other hand, in unlawful detainer, possession is initially lawful as it stems from an express or implied contract, but subsequently becomes illegal when the deforciant withholds possession after the expiration or termination of his/her right. Both actions for forcible entry and unlawful detainer must be brought within one year from the date of actual entry on the land, or from the date of last demand, as the case may be.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>On various occasions, the Court stressed that the owner of real property may not conveniently usurp possession from the lawful possessor through the simple expedient of filing an <i>accion interdictal</i>. This was the Court's warning in <i>Quijano v. Amante</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> <i>Muñoz v. CA</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and <i>Javelosa v. Tapus</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In <i>Muñoz</i>, the Court refused to grant the owner possession notwithstanding the latter's presentation of a Torrens title. Rather, the Court ruled that to obtain possession, the owner must ventilate his claim by filing the proper action before the RTC:<br><blockquote><b>If the private respondent is indeed the owner of the premises and that possession thereof was deprived from him for more than twelve years, he should present his claim before the Regional Trial Court in an <i>accion publiciana</i> or an <i>accion reinvindicatoria</i> and not before the Municipal Trial Court in a summary proceeding of unlawful detainer or forcible entry.</b> For even if he is the owner, possession of the property cannot be wrested from another who had been in possession thereof for more than twelve (12) years through a summary action for ejectment.<br><br><b>Although admittedly petitioner may validly claim ownership based on the muniments of title it presented, such evidence does not responsibly address the issue of prior actual possession raised in a forcible entry case. It must be stated that regardless of actual condition of the title to the property, the party in peaceable quiet possession shall not be turned out by a strong hand, violence or terror. Thus, a party who can prove prior possession can recover such possession even against the owner himself.</b> Whatever may be the character of his prior possession, if he has in his favor priority in time, he has the security that entitles him to remain on the property <i>until he is lawfully ejected by a person having a better right by accion publiciana</i> or <i>accion reivindicatoria</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In the same vein, in <i>Javelosa</i>, the Court favored the possessors who have been residing in the property for 70 years over the owner who failed to prove the fact of tolerance in the unlawful detainer case. The Court cautioned that an owner cannot conveniently usurp possession of the property without availing of the proper remedy to regain possession:<br><blockquote>As a final note, an important caveat must be laid down. The Court's ruling should not in any way be misconstrued as coddling the occupant of the property, at the expense of the lawful owner. Rather, what this resolution seeks to impress is that even the legal owner of the property cannot conveniently usurp possession against a possessor, through a summary action for ejectment, without proving the essential requisites thereof. Accordingly, should the owner choose to file an action for unlawful detainer, it is imperative for him/her to first and foremost prove that the occupation was based on his/her permission or tolerance. Absent which, the owner would be in a better position by pursuing other more appropriate legal remedies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>In the case at bar, the respondents filed an action for unlawful detainer to recover possession of the subject property. In making this choice, they bore the correlative burden to sufficiently allege and prove by a preponderance of evidence all the jurisdictional facts for such action to prosper.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="20%"><div align="justify"><strong><em>In An Action for Unlawful Detainer, Tolerance or Permission Must Be Present From the Beginning of the Possession and Must Be Proven Clearly and Distinctly</em></strong></div></td><td width="80%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>In all actions for unlawful detainer, the fact of permission or tolerance serves as a key jurisdictional element. Thus, for the action to prosper, the claimant must allege and prove that:&nbsp; <br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(i)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> initially, possession of property by the defendant was by contract with or by tolerance of the plaintiff;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(ii)</div></td><td><div align="justify">eventually, such possession became illegal upon notice by plaintiff to defendant of the termination of the latter's right of possession;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(iii) </div></td><td><div align="justify">thereafter, the defendant remained in possession of the property and deprived the plaintiff of the enjoyment thereof; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(iv) </div></td><td><div align="justify">within one year from the last demand on defendant to vacate the property, the plaintiff instituted the complaint for ejectment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>A perusal of the Complaint filed by the respondents before the MCTC reveals that their action for unlawful detainer was premised on their tolerance of the petitioners' stay therein. As alleged in the Complaint:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>4. That the plaintiffs are the lawful owner[s] and possessor[s] of the [subject property], having acquired the same through purchase by virtue of a <i>cuerpo cierto</i> sale from its owners Julieta Pinar and Generoso Pinar as evidenced by [a] <i>Deed of Sale</i> executed on March 9, 1997, and <i>Affidavit of Non-Improvement</i> executed on April 7, 1997 x x x;<br><br>5.

That out of compassion, plaintiffs tolerated the aforesaid defendants to occupy on that condition, without paying any rental;</b><br><br>7. That in the process, said defendants Teresita Dayandayan and Clara Talle, let their respective children stay with them; thus defendants Yolly D. Laguna, daughter of Teresita Dayandayan, and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Rodrigo Rios and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Reden Bignay, children of Clara Talle, are occupying the house that their parents built on the portion of plaintiffs' property;<br><br>8.

That to give them another chance, on February 8, 2009, plaintiffs demanded from defendants to vacate the premises, but despite receipt of the demand letter, they refused and still refuse such valid and legal demand. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Significantly, in the 1968 landmark case of <i>Sarona, et al. v. Villegas, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> "tolerance" was defined, thus:<br><blockquote>Professor Arturo M. Tolentino states that acts merely tolerated are "those which by reason of neighborliness or familiarity, the owner of property <i>allows</i> his neighbor or another person to do on the property; they are generally those particular services or benefits which one's property can give to another without material injury or prejudice to the owner, who <i>permits</i> them out of friendship or courtesy." He adds that: "[t]hey are acts of little disturbances which a person, in the interest of neighborliness or friendly relations, <i>permits</i> others to do on his property, such as passing over the land, tying a horse therein, or getting some water from a well." And, Tolentino continues, even though "this is <i>continued</i> for a long time, no right will be acquired by prescription." Further expounding on the concept, Tolentino writes: <b>There is tacit consent of the possessor to the acts which are merely tolerated. Thus, <i>not every case of knowledge and silence</i> on the part of the possessor <i>can be considered mere tolerance</i>. By virtue of tolerance that is considered as an authorization, permission or license, acts of possession are realized or performed. The question reduces itself to the existence or non-existence of the permission.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In the same vein, <i>Sarona</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> further impressed the rule that tolerance must be present at the outset of the possession:<br><blockquote>A close assessment of the law and the concept of the word "tolerance" confirms our view heretofore expressed that such tolerance must be present right from the start of possession sought to be recovered, to categorize a cause of action as one of unlawful detainer — not of forcible entry. Indeed, to hold otherwise would espouse a dangerous doctrine. And for two reasons: <i>First</i> Forcible entry into the land is an open challenge to the right of the possessor. Violation of that right authorizes the speedy redress — in the inferior court — provided for in the rules. If one year from the forcible entry is allowed to lapse before suit is filed, then the remedy ceases to be speedy; and the possessor is deemed to have waived his right to seek relief in the inferior court. <i>Second</i>. If a forcible entry action <i>in the inferior court</i> is allowed after the lapse of a number of years, then the result may well be that no action of forcible entry can really prescribe. No matter how long such defendant is in physical possession, plaintiff will merely make a demand, bring suit in the inferior court — upon a plea of tolerance to prevent prescription to set in — and summarily throw him out of the land. Such a conclusion is unreasonable. Especially if we bear in mind the postulates that proceedings of forcible entry and unlawful detainer are summary in nature, and that the one year time-bar to the suit is but in pursuance of the summary nature of the action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Over the years, the tenets laid down in Sarona have been consistently affirmed in subsequent rulings. As echoed in <i>Dr. Carbonilla v. Abiera, et al.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and <i>Javelosa</i>, "tolerance always carries with it 'permission' and not merely silence or inaction for silence or inaction is negligence, not tolerance."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> In <i>Javelosa</i>, the Court emphasized that tolerance cannot be confused with indifference or neglect to file an action in court. This doctrine was further reinforced in <i>Lozano v. Fernandez</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> where the Court characterized "tolerance [as] more than mere passivity,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and clarified that "inaction should not be confused with tolerance as the latter transcends silence and connotes permission to possess the property subject of an unlawful detainer case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, in an action for unlawful detainer, the complainant must prove through a preponderance of evidence that he/she consented to the possession of the property through positive acts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> There should be supporting evidence on record that would show how and when the respondents entered the property, and who granted them permission to enter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> As cautioned in <i>Padre v. Malabanan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and <i>De Guzman-Fuerte v. Estomo</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> a bare claim of tolerance will not suffice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Consequently, an action for unlawful detainer must be dismissed if the complainant fails to advert to a clear and overt act proving his/her tolerance prior to the questioned occupancy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Equally important, tolerance must precede the deforciant's entry into the property. Notably, in <i>Jose v. Alfuerto, et. al., Dr. Carbonilla</i>, and <i>Zacarias v. Anacay</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> the Court required that tolerance or permission must be present at the outset. Otherwise, if the possession was unlawful from the start, an action for unlawful detainer should be dismissed for being an improper remedy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Corollary thereto, in <i>Amante</i>, the Court laid the burden on the plaintiff to prove that the occupant's possession was initially lawful and further, to establish the basis of such lawful possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Based on the foregoing tenets, it becomes all too apparent that an action for unlawful detainer fails in the absence of clear proof of an overt act signifying permission or tolerance, coupled with evidence of how and when the occupation was effected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="20%"><div align="justify"><em><strong>The Failure To Raise the Issue of Tolerance Shall Not Bar The Court From Ruling on the Matter</strong></em></div></td><td width="80%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>Strangely, the respondents bewail that the issue of tolerance was not raised before the MCTC but was belatedly asserted for the first time on appeal. According to the respondents, to consider such issue at this stage will violate the basic tenets of fair play and due process.<br><br>It must be noted at the outset that the Court rejected the same flawed argument in <i>Jose v. Alfuerto, et al.</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><blockquote>The petitioner alleges that the respondents had never questioned before the MeTC the fact that their occupancy was by tolerance. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Regardless of the defenses raised by the respondents, the petitioner was required to properly allege and prove when the respondents entered the property and that it was the petitioner or his predecessors, not any other persons, who granted the respondents permission to enter and occupy the property. Furthermore, it was not the respondents' defense that proved fatal to the case but the petitioner's contradictory statements in his amended complaint which he even reiterated in his other pleadings.<br><br>Although the respondents did not use the word "tolerance" before the MeTC, they have always questioned the existence of the petitioner's tolerance. In their Answer to Amended Complaint, the respondents negated the possibility of their possession of the property under the petitioner and his lessor's tolerance when the respondents alleged to have occupied the premises even before the lessor acquired the property in 1991. They said as much in their Position Paper[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br></blockquote>Moreover, it is bizarre that the respondents backpedaled, suddenly alleging that the issue regarding tolerance "is a new issue, [which the] petitioners raised for the first time on appeal."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> A simple perusal of the respondents' Complaint before the MCTC reveals that they introduced and alleged the fact of tolerance. They categorically and clearly stated "[t]hat out of compassion, [they] <b>tolerated</b> the aforesaid defendants [petitioners] to occupy on that condition, without paying any rental."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> In view of their very own assertion, the MCTC included the matter of tolerance as among the disputed issues in the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Obviously, it was the respondents who first broached the subject of tolerance. They cannot dodge an issue which they themselves introduced.<br><br>At any rate, tolerance is a key jurisdictional fact in an action for unlawful detainer, such that the case may not be resolved without passing upon the fact of tolerance or permission.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="20%"><div align="justify"><em><strong>Respondents Failed to Prove An Overt Act Signifying their Tolerance of Petitioners' Stay in the Subject Property</strong><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></div></td><td width="80%">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>The respondents' action for unlawful detainer hinges on their alleged "tolerance" of the petitioners' stay in the subject property. Unfortunately however, they failed to adduce evidence to establish their claim.<br><br>To begin with, the respondents' tale of tolerance was merely based on vague, self-serving statements. They failed to prove how and when the petitioners entered the subject lot, as well as how and when the permission to occupy was purportedly given. They were unable to point to a specific overt act showing their purported acquiescence. In fact, they were conspicuously silent about the details, save for their vague assertion that the petitioners approached them for permission to construct a house, and that they "tolerated" the latter's stay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Certainly, the failure to provide specific details engenders doubt on the respondents' purported claim of tolerance.<br><br>Ironically, no less than the respondents' own documents cast doubt on their purported claim of permission or tolerance. The Deed of Sale confirms that the respondents acquired the subject property on March 9, 1997, years after the petitioners had begun to reside in the area. Likewise, the Commissioner's Report noting that the houses of the petitioners are within the subject area, and the Tax Declarations classifying the property as residential, do not shed light on the circumstances of the petitioners' entry into the subject property. Relatedly, in <i>Sabellina v. Buray, et. al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> which likewise involved an action for unlawful detainer, the Court rejected the plaintiffs' tax declarations which had no bearing whatsoever in showing how the defendants entered the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>In contrast, the petitioners' evidence affirms that they have been residing in the subject property prior to the respondents' purchase of the same. The Affidavits of petitioners Talle<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> and Dayandayan<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> indicate that they have been residing in the area since 1983 and 1984, respectively. Although they asserted that the lot was a reclaimed area, this still places them in the property prior to the respondents' acquisition thereof.<br><br>In addition, the Affidavits of disinterested persons confirm the petitioners' presence in the area prior to March 9, 1997. Salvador Sipaco<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> related that in 1990, the municipal government of Leyte undertook a reclamation project, wherein Dayandayan and Talle were called to participate in the meeting. Likewise, Rogelio Nuñez<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> confirms that the petitioners have been residing in the area prior to the respondents' acquisition. This fact was further bolstered by the Certification of the Municipal Treasurer<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> which likewise places Dayandayan and Talle in the subject premises in as early as 1990.<br><br>It bears noting that the petitioners were able to establish prior possession independent of any express or implied contract with the respondents or their predecessors-in-interest. The fact that the petitioners have been staying in the subject property prior to the respondents' acquisition is essential in the resolution of the instant case. For one, this destroys the respondents' claim that the petitioners approached them for permission to construct a house. It is indeed strange asking that the petitioners would approach the respondents and ask permission to build a house, when the former have already been residing therein years prior to the latter's entry. Worse, the absence of specific details regarding how and when permission was initially granted is especially troubling considering that the petitioners have been occupying the subject property for more than 20 years.<br><br>The issue regarding the nature of the subject lot — whether it is a reclaimed area or part of Lot 635, is immaterial in resolving the matter of possession. For all intents and purposes, the evidence proves that the petitioners were in the subject area prior to the respondents' acquisition thereof. In effect, this negates respondents' contentions that the petitioners asked permission to build a house; that they (respondents) "tolerated" petitioners' stay; and that an express or implied contract to occupy the premises existed between the parties. This disavowal is important considering that said allegations served as the backbone of the respondents' action for unlawful detainer.<br><br>It cannot be gainsaid that as the plaintiffs in the action for unlawful detainer, the respondents bore the brunt of proving all the essential requisites for their case to prosper. In doing so, they are reminded of the age-old rule that allegations are not proof. Rather, they must establish their case by a preponderance of evidence, "<i>i.e.</i> by evidence that is of greater weight, or more convincing, than that which is offered in opposition to it,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> which they failed to do.<br><br>Similar to the case at bar, in <i>Sabellina</i>, the Court rejected the complainant's general and self-serving averments of tolerance:<br><blockquote>This evidentiary situation only leaves us with the petitioner's affidavit. The affidavit only makes the sweeping statement that the respondents entered the subject lot with her consent and occupied it by mere tolerance. The petitioner failed to present convincing proof of her allegation of tolerance. There is no competent evidence to support her claim other than her own self-serving affidavit repeating her allegations in the complaint. <b>Allegations are not evidence and without evidence, bare allegations do not prove facts.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (Citations omitted and emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>All told, the action for unlawful detainer must be dismissed due to the respondents' failure to establish the necessary averments for their action to prosper. However, the respondents are not left without a remedy in law. They may avail of other more appropriate legal remedies to obtain possession of the subject property before the proper regional trial court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
