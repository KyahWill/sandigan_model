				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS OF BOY FRANCO Y MANGAOANG, JOINED BY HIS WIFE WILFREDA R. FRANCO, PETITIONERS, VS.  THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS OR REPRESENTATIVES, RESPONDENT.<BR><BR>RESOLUTION</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REYES, J. JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In this petition for the issuance of a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> filed directly before the Court, Boy Franco y Mangaoang (petitioner), who is detained at the National Bilibid Prison, is seeking his immediate release from prison on the basis of the automatic reduction of his sentence in view of the colonist status grant by the Director of Prisons and the retroactive application of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10592.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Petitioner was sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> following his conviction for the crime of kidnapping with ransom by the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 66.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Petitioner alleged that he had been under detention since July 17, 1993<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> until his commitment to the National Bilibid Prison on October 12, 1995 to commence the service of his sentence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On April 21, 2009, petitioner was granted the status as a colonist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Among the privileges granted upon a colonist are the automatic reduction of the life sentence imposed on the colonist to a sentence of 30 years and the credit of an additional Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) of 10 days for each calendar month while retaining said classification.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Allegedly, petitioner served 34 years, 11 months, and 18 days of his sentence of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, as well as his credit for preventive imprisonment of eight years more or less. Thus, applying the privileges of a colonist and the ruling of the Court in <i>Cruz III v. Go</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> petitioner insists that he should be released from confinement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In his Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the Director of Prisons (respondent) counters that the application of the privileges of a colonist necessitates an executive approval under Section 5<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> of Act No. 2489 and Section 19, Article VII<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of the 1987 Constitution. Verily, these laws provide that only the President can commute the service of sentences of convicted persons. Moreover, the respondent asserts that the ruling of the Court in Cruz III is not a binding precedent as it was not a decision, but a mere resolution.<br><br>Said Comment was adopted by the Office of the Solicitor General in its manifestation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In his Reply,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> petitioner insists that the executive approval for the reduction of sentence of a colonist may be delegated by the President to his alter egos since the Act No. 2489 requires only an "Executive" approval, and not the approval of the "Chief Executive."<br><br>In his Manifestation, petitioner seeks the retroactive application of R.A. No. 10592 as discussed in the case of <i>Inmates of the New Bilibid Prison, Muntinlupa City v. Secretary De Lima</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The Court resolves.<br><br>Colonist is a prisoner who is: (1) at least a first class inmate;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (2) has served one year immediately preceding the completion of the period specified in the following qualifications; and (3) has served imprisonment with good conduct for a period equivalent to one-fifth of the maximum term of his prison sentence, or seven years in the case of a life sentence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The classification of a prisoner as a colonist lies within the sound discretion of the Director of Prisons, upon recommendation of the Classification Board.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Provided that the colonist retains his status as such, he is entitled to the following benefits:<br><blockquote>SEC. 7. <i>Privileges of a Colonist.</i> â€” A colonist shall have the following privileges:<br><ol type="a"><li>credit of an additional GCTA of five (5) days for each calendar month while he retains said classification aside from the regular GCTA authorized under Article 97 of the Revised Penal Code;<br><br></li><li> automatic reduction of the life sentence imposed on the colonist to a sentence of thirty (30) years;<br><br></li><li> subject to the approval of the Director, to have his wife and children, or the woman he desires to marry, live with him in the prison and penal farm. Transportation expenses of the family going to and the discharge of the colonist from the prison and penal farm shall be for the account of the government. The family may avail of all prison facilities such as hospital, church and school free of charge. All the members of the family of a colonist shall be subject to the rules governing the prison and penal farm;<br><br></li><li> as a special reward to a deserving colonist, the issuance of a reasonable amount of clothing and ordinarily household supplies from the government commissary in addition to free subsistence; and<br><br></li><li> to wear civilian clothes on such special occasions as may be designated by the Superintendent.</li></ol></blockquote>Section 7(b) provides for the privilege of an automatic reduction of sentence. However, the word "automatic" does not imply that the reduction of sentence occurs as a natural consequence by the mere conferral of a "colonist" status. Act No. 2489<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> specifically requires an executive approval before such kind of benefit may be allowed:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. Prisoners serving sentences of life imprisonment receiving and retaining the classification of penal colonists or trusties will automatically have the sentence of life imprisonment modified to a sentence of thirty years when receiving the <b>executive approval</b> for this classification upon which the regular credit now authorized by law and special credit authorized in the preceding paragraph, for good conduct, may be made. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>In the case of <i>Tiu v. Dizon</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the Court expounded on such requirement, which is posterior to the act of classifying a prisoner as a colonist:<br><blockquote><b><u>The wording of the law is such that the act of classification as a penal colonist or trustie is separate from and necessarily precedes the act of approval by the Executive.</u></b> Under Section 6, Chapter 3, Part II, Book I of the BuCor-OM quoted earlier, the Director of Corrections may, upon the recommendation of the Classification the Bureau of Corrections, classify an inmate as a colonist. It is crucial, however, that the prisoner not only receives, but retains such classification, because the grant of a colonist status may, for cause, be revoked at any time by the Superintendent with the approval of the Director of Corrections pursuant to Section 946 of the same Chapter. It is the classification of the penal colonist and trustie of the Director of Corrections which subsequently receives executive approval. (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)</blockquote>The indispensability of an executive approval is further highlighted by the 1987 Constitution, expressly vesting upon the President the exclusive prerogative to grant acts of clemency.<br><br>In <i>Tiu</i>, the Court elucidated that the reduction of a prisoner's sentence is a form of partial pardon, which entails the exercise of the President's constitutionally-vested authority. Contrary to petitioner's assertion, the Constitution requires the President to act on such matter <i>personally</i>; thus, he may not delegate the same in the guise of doctrine of qualified political agency.<br><br>In this case, nowhere in the records does it show that the President signified his approval to the release of petitioner in view of his status as a colonist. Thus, at this point, there is no reason to allow the release of petitioner based on such ground.<br><br>Moreover, petitioner's reliance in the case of <i>Cruz III</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> does not hold water. As explained by the Court, Go was released from prison not because of the automatic reduction privilege as a colonist, but because of the application of the provisions of Articles 70<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and 97<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, which allow the reduction or commutation of sentences based on the computation of GCTA.<br><br>Nevertheless, petitioner's entitlement to the benefits of R.A. No. 10592, which has been given retroactive effect in the case of<i> Inmates of the New Bilibid Prison, Muntinlupa City</i>, must be examined in view of the attendant factual circumstances.<br><br>Among the amendments introduced by R.A. No. 10592 are the increase in the number of days which may be credited for GCTA; expansion of the application of GCTA for prisoners even during preventive imprisonment; and deduction of 15 days for each month of study, teaching, or mentoring service.<br><br>Section 3, Rule V and Section 1, Rule VIII of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 10592 reposed upon the Director of Prisons, the Chief of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology and the wardens the grant of allowances for good conduct to deserving prisoners, upon recommendation of the Management, Screening and Evaluation Committee. The Director, the Chief, or the warden may either approve or disapprove the recommendation or order the return of the same for correction.<br><br>Relevantly, Sections 3 and 4, Rule V of the same law mandates the Bureau of Corrections to assess and compute the time allowance due to the prisoners:<br><blockquote>SEC. 3. Management, Screening and Evaluation Committee (MSEC). â€” a. The Director of the BUCOR, Chief of the BJMP and Wardens of various provinces, cities, districts and municipalities are mandated to assess, evaluate and grant time deduction to a deserving prisoner, whether detained or convicted by final judgment, in the form of GCTA, STAL and TASTM as prescribed by these Rules through the creation of the MSEC.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>SEC. 4. Procedures for the Grant of Good Conduct Time Allowance.â€” The following procedures shall be followed in the grant of GCTA:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>e. The appropriate official concerned shall ensure that GCTAs are processed each month and that there is proper recording of a prisoner's good behavior in the jail or prison records.</blockquote>In fact, Section 5, Rule V of said law requires the use of computer- generated template, capable of incorporating time allowances that may be granted to detainees and prisoners alike, to monitor their progress.<br><br>Based on petitioner's Prison Records,<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[24]</sup></font> it appears that he earned regular GCTA; time allowance for study, teaching and mentoring; and credit for preventive imprisonment under R.A. No. 6127. Moreover, based on respondent's Comment, petitioner's time served with GCTA in prison is 32 years, 10 months, and 7 days. However, these were all computed prior the promulgation of the <i>Inmates of the New Bilibid Prison, Muntinlupa City</i> case.<br><br>The determination of the legality of petitioner's confinement based on R.A. No. 10592 necessitates the recomputation of the time allowances due for petitioner.<br><br>In the case of<i> In Re: Correction/Adjustment of Penalty Pursuant to [R.A.] No. 10951, in relation to Hernan v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court recognized the competency of trial courts to ascertain both findings of fact and law such as the actual length of time that the convict has actually been in confinement and whether time allowance for good conduct in determining the propriety of his immediate release from confinement on account of full service of the recomputed sentence. Hence, matters relating thereto must be referred to the trial courts as they are relatively more equipped to act on such matters.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition for the issuance of a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>. The case is referred to the Regional Trial Court of Muntinlupa for the receipt of records for the determination of: (1) the length of time that petitioner Boy Franco y Mangaoang has been in actual confinement; (2) his earned Good Conduct Time Allowance and other privileges granted to him under Republic Act No. 10592 and their computation; and (3) whether he is entitled to immediate release from confinement on account of the full service of his sentence based on the recomputed sentence, as modified.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Peralta, C.J., (Chairperson), Caguioa, Lazaro-Javier</i>, and <i>Lopez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> AN ACT AMENDING ARTICLES 29,94,97,98 and 99 of Act No. 3815, as AMENDED, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE REVISED PENAL CODE.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 11.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 12. <br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Supra note 2.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id. at 4.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Bureau of Corrections Operating Manual, Book 1, Part II, Chapter 3, Sec. 7. <br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> GR.
