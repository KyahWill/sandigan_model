follows:<br><br><blockquote><i>Version of the Prosecution</i><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) presents the prosecution's version of facts as follows:<br><br>Sometime in February 2013, the National Bureau of Investigation - Central Luzon Regional Office (NB1CELRO) received a report from the International Justice Mission (IJM), a non-governmental organization involved in anti-trafficking in person project, that appellant Esmeraldo T. Amurao was involved in prostituting women in Balibago, Angeles City, Pampanga, some of whom are minors.<br><br>On February 19, 2013 at around 8:30 in the evening, two NBI agents went to Fields Avenue in Angeles City to verify the report. As poseur customers, they went to Natalia Hotel where they met hotel security guard Jeffrey Papauran, who called on appellant Esmeraldo Amurao, who was selling cigarette and Viagra in the area. The NBI agents talked to appellant and inquired from him regarding the minor girls he was selling to customers. Appellant told the NBI agents that he could provide them with girls at P1,500.00 each. The agents then asked appellant to provide them with six (6) girls the following night.<br><br>Thereafter, the NBI agents returned to their office and informed their superior about the result of their operation. Special Investigator (SI) III Henry C. Roxas, Jr. organized a team for a possible rescue and entrapment operations. The team also coordinated with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Region III and requested them to form part of the support group. Since the NBI failed to secure an arrest warrant for appellant, they decided to proceed with the entrapment operation and prepared the entrapment money worth P9,000.00 which were all in P1,000.00 denomination.<br><br>In the evening of February 20, 2013, SI Henry Roxas and another NBI agent returned to Natalia Hotel in Fields Avenue, Angeles City. When they arrived at the area, appellant offered them some girls but they insisted that they be given minor girls.<br><br>Minutes later, appellant, together with co-accused Marlyn D. Valencia, arrived with six minor girls in tow. Realizing that the girls brought by appellant and accused Marlyn D. Valencia were indeed minors, the undercover NBI agents requested the girls to go inside their van. Accused Valencia also boarded the van as she was acting as their "<i>mamasan</i>" as she was chaperoning the girls.<br><br>SI Henry Roxas then handed to appellant the marked money worth P9,000.00, and the latter deducted P1,000.00 from the amount as his commission. Appellant gave the rest of the money to BBB, who was acting as the leader of the girls.<br><br>Once the girls were all inside the van, SI Henry Roxas signaled the rest of the team through a missed call and proceeded with the rescue operation. Appellant was subsequently arrested and the marked money was recovered from him and BBB.<br><br>After the operation, the team brought the six (6) girls to the DSWD Region III Office, while appellant and accused Marlyn D. Valencia were brought to NBI-CELRO for fingerprinting and photograph taking. At the DSWD, the girls executed sworn statements narrating the circumstances that transpired prior to their rescue, particularly the fact that appellant and accused Marlyn D. Valencia recruited and promised them P1,500.00 in exchange for sex with a customer, They likewise declared that they were still minors at the time of their rescue.<br><br>Appellant and accused Marlyn D. Valencia were subjected to Inquest Proceedings on February 22, 2013. in its Resolution of even date, Prosecutor Modesto A. Cendana found probable cause and recommended the filing of several Information for Violation of RA 9208 and RA 7610, respectively.<br><br><i>Version of the defense</i><br><br>On 19 February 2013, accused-appellant was in front of Natalia Hotel vending cigarettes and viagra. The security guard of Natalia Hotel introduced the NBI agents to him. Accused-appellant claims that the agents gave him P500.00 to look for girls, but, when he failed to provide the girls, the agents still gave him a tip of P500.00 since the said agents won in the casino.<br><br>On 20 February 2013, accused-appellant passed by Natalia Hotel and saw the agents again. The said agents asked him to look for girls and even told him "huwag mo naman kami ipahiya." Since the agents promised to give him a tip, he took his chance to look for six girls. Accused-appellant then contacted his co-accused Marlyn to look for girls. Later on, they were able to bring only four girls to the agents. While in front of Natalia Hotel, two other girls passed by and w[ere] invited by one of the girls they brought to the agents. When they introduced the girls to the agents, the girls and Marlyn boarded the van of the agents. The agents handed P9,000.00 to accused-appellant who took P1,000.00 as his tip and handed the remaining P8,000.00 to the girls. Thereafter, the agents declared that they were NBI agents and immediately arrested accused-appellant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote><i><b>Ruling of the RTC</b></i><br><br>In its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated November 8, 2013, the RTC convicted accused-appellant Amurao in Criminal Cases Nos. 13-9736, 13-9737, and 13-9738.

The testimonies of AAA, BBB, and CCC were direct,&nbsp; straightforward,&nbsp; and&nbsp; consistent.&nbsp; They&nbsp; all&nbsp; similarly testified that<br><br>Amurao recruited them for the purpose of prostitution on the night of February 20, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The minority of BBB and CCC were duly proven by their Birth Certificates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The testimonies of AAA, BBB, and CCC also corroborated the testimony of the arresting officer from the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Special Investigator III (SI) Henry Roxas, who detailed the conduct of the entrapment operation which led to the arrest of Amurao and Valencia.<br><br>Amurao himself corroborated the testimony of the prosecution witnesses. He admitted that on February 19, 2013, he was at the Natalia Hotel where he met two NBI agents acting as poseur-buyers who inquired about minor girls. Amurao likewise did not deny that he brought the female victims to Natalia Hotel on February 20, 2013 for the purpose of prostituting them. Amurao merely interposed the defense of instigation, alleging that he was forced by the NBI agents to commit the crime.<br><br>Such defense deserves scant consideration. The use of entrapment by law enforcement officers as a means to arrest wrongdoers is an accepted practice. In <i>People v. Hirang</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the accused similarly interposed the defense of instigation in the offense of Trafficking against Persons. The Court rejected his defense and held:<br><blockquote>Instigation is the means by which the accused is lured into the commission of the offense charged in order to prosecute him. On the other hand, entrapment is the employment of such ways and means for the purpose of trapping or capturing a lawbreaker. Thus, in instigation, officers of the law or their agents incite, induce, instigate or lure an accused into committing an offense which he or she would otherwise not commit and has no intention of committing. But in entrapment, the criminal intent or design to commit the offense charged originates in the mind of the accused, and law enforcement officials merely facilitate the apprehension of the criminal by employing ruses and schemes; thus, the accused cannot justify his or her conduct. In instigation, where law enforcers act as co-principals, the accused will have to be acquitted. But entrapment cannot bar prosecution and conviction. As has been said, instigation is a "trap for the unwary innocent" while entrapment is a "trap for the unwary criminal."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote>As correctly held by the CA, it was established that Amurao is a known pimp who recruits women into prostitution, as testified to by AAA:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" valign="top"><div align="left">[<i>Direct Examination of AAA - Atty.

His defense is belied by his own actions in readily agreeing to procure girls for the NBI agents/poseur-buyers and in his active recruitment of the victims. Thus, Amurao's defense of instigation has no merit. Acting on the report from the International Justice Mission, the NBI agents conducted a valid entrapment. They merely devised a scheme to facilitate Amurao's illegal activities in order to arrest him.<br><br>Given the foregoing, the Court affirms Amurao's conviction for one count of simple Trafficking in Persons as defined under Section 4(a) of RA 9208 in Criminal Case No. 13-9736 in connection with the trafficking of AAA. Amurao's convictions for two separate counts of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 4(a) in relation to Section 6(a) of RA 9208, in Criminal Cases Nos. 13-9737 and 13-9738 involving minor victims BBB and CCC are also affirmed.<br><br>The penalties imposed by the RTC and affirmed by the CA are likewise upheld. Section 10 of RA 9208 provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 10. <i>Penalties and Sanctions</i>. - The following penalties and sanctions are hereby established for the offenses enumerated in this Act:<br><br>(a) Any person found guilty of committing any of the acts enumerated in Section 4 shall suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twenty (20) years and a fine of not less than One million pesos (P1,000,000.00) but not more than Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00);<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(c) Any person found guilty of qualified trafficking under Section 6 shall suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00) but not more than Five million pesos (P5,000,000.00)[.]</blockquote>Hence, the penalty imposed on Amurao in Criminal Case No. 13-9736 of imprisonment of twenty (20) years and a fine of One million pesos (P1,000,000.00); and life imprisonment and a fine of Two million pesos (P2,000,000.00) in Criminal Cases Nos. 13-9737 and 13-9738, respectively, are correct.<br><br>Anent the award of damages, the CA correctly modified the nature and amount of the damages in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.

Following <i>Lalli</i>, the CA correctly awarded moral damages of P500,000.00 and exemplary damages of P100,000.00 each to AAA, BBB and CCC. The CA's imposition of six percent (6%) interest <i>per annum</i> on the award from finality of judgment until full payment was likewise appropriate in line with the Court's ruling in <i>Nacar v.
