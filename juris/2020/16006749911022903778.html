Republic</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> citing <em>Apo Fruus Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines,</em><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Court explained that "the rationale for imposing interest on just compensation is to compensate the property owners for the income that they would have made if they had been properly compensated — meaning if they had been paid the full amount of just compensation — at the time of taking when they were deprived of their property."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p> In the instant case, however, it is not disputed whatsoever that the respondents received the amount determined by the RTC as the just, fair, and equitable compensation for the subject property,<i> i.e.,</i> P2,100.00 per sq. m. or P457,800.00, before petitioner Republic took possession of the subject property. Otherwise stated, there was full and prompt payment of just compensation at the time of taking. </p><p> Hence, with the respondents having acknowledged the receipt of the full amount of just compensation even prior to the time of taking, petition Republic is not liable for the payment of legal interest. The award of legal interest of 6% <i>per annum</i> must be deleted. </p><p><i>The respondents are not entitled to<br> consequential damages. </i> </p><p> In the assailed Decision, the RTC deemed it fair and equitable to award consequential damages in favor of the respondents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The consequential damages awarded by the RTC include the value of the transfer taxes necessary to transfer the subject property to the name of petitioner Republic. </p><p> Rule 67 of the Rules of Court governs expropriation proceedings. With respect to consequential damages, Section 6 of Rule 67 states: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 6.<i> Proceedings by commissioners</i>. — Before entering upon the performance of their duties, the commissioners shall take and subscribe an oath that they will faithfully perform their duties as commissioners, which oath shall be filed in court with the other proceedings in the case. Evidence may be introduced by either party before the commissioners who are authorized to administer oaths on hearings before them, and the commissioners shall, unless the parties consent to the contrary, after due notice to the parties to attend, view and examine the property sought to be expropriated and its surroundings, and may measure the same, after which either party may, by himself or counsel, argue the case. <b>The commissioners shall assess the consequential damages to the property not taken and deduct from such consequential damages the consequential benefits to be derived by the owner from the public use or purpose of the property taken, the operation of its franchise by the corporation or the carrying on of the business of the corporation or person taking the property. </b>But in no case shall the consequential benefits assessed exceed the consequential damages assessed, or the owner be deprived of the actual value of his property so taken. (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> In <i>Republic v. Soriano</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Court deemed the award of consequential damages improper because "the subject property is being expropriated in its entirety, there is no remaining portion which may suffer an impairment or decrease in value as a result of the expropriation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Petitioner Republic chimes in by asserting that the award of consequential damages is inapplicable because "the entire area of respondents' property was expropriated."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p> <p> Petitioner Republic's position is wrong. Only a portion, and not the entire area, of the respondents' property was expropriated. </p><p> As borne out by a perusal of the subject TCT, which was attached by petitioner Republic to the Expropriation Complaint, the subject property is registered in the name of "JULIANA SAN MIGUEL VDA. DE RAMOS, 121 sq. m; GREGORIA RAMOS m/to Alejandro Sanchez, 56 sq. m.; JOSEFINA DE LEON, DIONISIO DE LEON, FELICITAS DE LEON, VICTORINO DE LEON and PATROCINIA DE LEON, all single (<em>sic</em>); and ANAMARIA C. DE LEON m/to Jaime de Guzman and EUGENIA DE LEON m/to Oscar Magalang, Filipinos, &amp; SPS. CON[D]RADO DE LEON &amp; BENITA CORPUZ, 203 sq. m."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> From the foregoing, it is clear that the total area of the subject property is <u>380 sq. m</u>. </p><p> This is confirmed by Tax Declaration No. C-018-06873 covering the subject property, which was likewise attached by petitioner Republic to the Expropriation Complaint. According to the said Tax Declaration, the total area of the subject property is "380.00."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p> As readily admitted by petitioner Republic, however, the affected area of the expropriation undertaken was only "218 sq. m."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> out of the total area of 380 sq. m. Hence, petitioner Republic's position that the entire area of the subject property was expropriated is not correct. </p><p> Be that as it may, the Court deems the award of consequential damages in favor of the respondents erroneous. </p><p> The sheer fact that there is a remaining portion of real property after the expropriation is not enough, by and of itself, to be basis for the award of consequential damages. To be sure, it must still be proven by sufficient evidence that the remaining portion suffers from an impairment or decrease in value. </p><p>In <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Spouses Salvador</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court ordered the deletion of the award of consequential damages because of the lack of evidence presented proving any impairment or decrease in value of the remaining lot: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x consequential damages are only awarded<i> if as a result of the expropriation, the remaining property of the owner suffers from an impairment or decrease in value.</i> In this case, no evidence was submitted to prove any impairment or decrease in value of the subject property as a result of the expropriation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> A careful review of the records of the instant case reveals that the RTC's award of consequential damages is not supported by any evidence establishing that the remaining 162 sq. m. of the subject property suffered from any impairment or decrease in value. Therefore, the award of consequential damages must be deleted. </p> <p> While the Court considers the payment of transfer taxes as not forming part of the consequential damages allowed under the Rules of Court, it must be clarified, however, that the courts are not precluded from considering the value of capital gains tax (CGT) and other transfer taxes in determining the amount of just compensation to be awarded to the affected owner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p>As explained by the Court in the recent case of <em>Republic of the Philippines v. Spouses Bunsay</em>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Section 5 of RA 8974 sets forth the standards in the determination of just compensation. It states: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 5. <i>Standards for the Assessment of the Value of the Land Subject of Expropriation Proceedings or Negotiated Sale.</i> — In order to facilitate the determination of just compensation, the court may consider, among other well-established factors, the following relevant standards:</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="4%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td> <td width="96%"><div align="justify">The classification and use for which the property is suited;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">The developmental costs for improving the land; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(c)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>The value declared by the owners</b>;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">The current selling price of similar lands in the vicinity;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(e)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">The reasonable disturbance compensation for the removal and/or demolition of certain improvements on the land and for the value of improvements thereon; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(f)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">The size, shape or location, tax declaration and zonal valuation of the land;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(g)</div></td> <td><div align="justify">The price of the land as manifested in the ocular findings, oral as well as documentary evidence presented; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><br></td> <td><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">(h)</div></td> <td><div align="justify"><b>Such facts and events as to enable the affected property owners to have sufficient funds to acquire similarly-situated lands of approximate areas as those required from them by the government, and thereby rehabilitate themselves as early as possible.</b> (Emphasis supplied) </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>As further explained by the Court, CGT, being a tax on passive income, is imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code on the seller as a consequence of the latter's presumed income from the sale or exchange of real property. Notably, however, the transfer of real property by way of expropriation is<i> not </i>an ordinary sale contemplated under Article 1458<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of the Civil Code. Rather, it is akin to a "forced sale" or one which arises<i> not</i> from the consensual agreement of the vendor and vendee, but by compulsion of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Unlike in an ordinary sale wherein the vendor sets the selling price, the compensation paid to the affected owner in an expropriation proceeding comes in the form of just compensation determined by the court. </p> <p> In turn, just compensation is defined as the fair and full equivalent of the loss incurred by the affected owner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> More specifically: </p><blockquote> <p> x x x [J]ust compensation in expropriation cases is defined "as the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator. The Court repeatedly stressed that the true measure is not the taker's gain but the owner's loss. <b>The word 'just' is used to modify the meaning of the word 'compensation' to convey the idea that the equivalent to be given for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full and ample</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</p> </blockquote> <p> The loss incurred by the affected owner necessarily includes all incidental costs to facilitate the transfer of the expropriated property to the expropriating authority, <i>including</i> the CGT due on the forced sale and other transfer taxes. These costs must be taken into consideration in determining just compensation in the same way these costs are factored into the selling price of real property in an arm's length transaction. Notably, the value of the expropriated property, as declared by the affected owner, is one of the factors listed under Section 5 of RA 8974.</p><p> Here, the respondents received, as just compensation, an amount equal to the sum of the subject property's current BIR zonal valuation. Evidently, the value of CGT and transfer taxes due on the transfer of the subject property were <i>not </i>factored into the amount paid to the respondents, but instead, separately awarded as consequential damages. </p><p> While the award of consequential damages equivalent to the value of CGT and transfer taxes must be struck down for being without legal basis, the Court deems it just and equitable to direct petitioner Republic to shoulder such taxes to preserve the compensation awarded to the respondents as a consequence of the expropriation. To stress, compensation, to be just, it must be of such value as to fully rehabilitate the affected owner; it must be sufficient to make the affected owner <i>whole.</i> </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
