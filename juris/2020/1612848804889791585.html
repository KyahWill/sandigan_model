SP No. 121883. The CA 1) dismissed First Philippine Holdings Corporation's (petitioner) petition for review and upheld the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to impose a registration fee amounting to P24,000,000.00 for the extension of petitioner's corporate term,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and 2) denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><b><center>The Facts and Antecedent Proceedings</center></b><br>The dispute hinges on the reasonableness of the filing fee imposed by the SEC's Company Registration and Monitoring Department (CRMD). Petitioner was charged a substantial amount of P24,000,000.00 for the amendment of its articles of incorporation to extend its term of corporate existence as a filing fee under SEC Memorandum Circular No. 9, Series of 2004 (SEC M.C. No. 9, S. 2004).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The facts were summarized by the SEC <i>en banc</i> as follows:<br><blockquote>[Petitioner] is a domestic stock corporation registered with the [SEC] on 30 June 1961 with SEC Registration Number 19073. Its term was set to expire on 30 June 2011. On 01 March 2007, its Amended Articles of Incorporation ("AOI") was approved by the majority vote of the Board of Directors and ratified on 21 May 2007 by the vote of the stockholders owning or representing at least two-thirds of the outstanding capital stock, particularly, Articles II (Primary Purpose), IV (Extension of Corporate Term) and VI (Number of Directors).<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The amendment which caused the subject of this appeal is Article IV, which provides:<br><blockquote>"That the term for which the Corporation is to exist shall be [1)] fifty (50) years, from and after the date of incorporation, and 2) fifty (50) more years from and after the expiration of the said original term of fifty (50) years, or fifty (50) years more from and after June 30, 2011."</blockquote>Upon filing of the amended AOI, [petitioner] was assessed the filing fee for the extension of its corporate existence, based on paragraph 11 of [SEC M.C. No. 9, S. 2004]. <b>It states that the filing fee for the application of amended articles of incorporation where [the] amendment consists of extending the term of corporate existence, shall be 1/5 of 1% of the authorized capital stock, but not less than P2,000.00.</b><br><br><u>Thus, based on [petitioner's] authorized capital stock (ACS) of TWELVE BILLION ONE HUNDRED MILLION PESOS (P12,100.000,000,00), [ petitioner] , on 21 June 2007, was assessed the amount of TWENTY[-]FOUR MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P24.200.000.00) for the amendment] of [its] articles of incorporation to extend its corporate term, which it paid on the same day.</u><br><br>Also on 21 June 2007. [petitioner] filed a letter dated 20 June 2007 expressing [its] "surprise and dismay" to find that it was required to pay filing tees in the amount of TWENTY[-]FOUR MILLION PESOS (P24,000,000.00) under [SEC M.C. No. 9, S. 2004], recalling that <b><i>ten years ago</i></b>, under SEC Memorandum] Circular No. 02 s. 1994 [(SEC M.C. No. 2, S. 1994)], the examining and filing fee for amended articles of incorporation of both stock and non-stock corporations was only TWO HUNDRED PESOS (P200.00). <u>[Petitioner] questioned the reasonableness and necessity of the fee of P24.000.000.00 (P24million, as stated by [petitioner] in its documents, disregarding the amount of P200 thousand), and paid the fee under protest, "without prejudice to filing the appropriate position paper, among other things."</u><br><br>It was only four months later [or] on 17 October 2007, when [petitioner] filed its Position Paper, dated 2 October 2007, claiming that [SEC M.C. No. 9, S. 2004] that imposes the filing fee of 1/5 of 1% of the authorized capital stock for the extension of corporate term is not a valid exercise of its authority to promulgate administrative regulations, for not being reasonably necessary. [Petitioner] thus prayed that the amount of P24 million be reduced to TWO HUNDRED PESOS (P200.00) per [SEC M.C. No. 2, S. 1994] and that the amount in excess be promptly refunded to the corporation.<br><br>In November of the same year, a few months after its application for extending its corporate term ha[d] been granted, <u>[petitioner] filed its application for the amendment of Article VII of its API by increasing its authorized capital stock to THIRTY-TWO BILLION ONE HUNDRED MILLION PESOS (P32,100,000.000.00). and the Certificate of Filing of the Amended API was granted by the Commission on 23 November 2007. For this, it was assessed and it paid the amount of FORTY MILLION PESOS (P40,000.000.00) as filing fee, based on paragraph fourteen also of [SEC M.C. No. 9. S. 2004]. which provides that the filing fee for [the] increase of capital stock for corporations with par value is, 1/5 of 1% of the increase in capital stock or the subscription price of the subscribed capital stock whichever is higher[,] but not less that P1,000.00.</u><br><br>On 07 January 2009, the Commission Secretary issued an Order, informing [petitioner] that the <b><i>02 October 2007 Position Paper is treated as an Appeal, from the assessment of the CRMD</i></b> of the filing fee for extension of corporate term, approved on 25 June 2007. [Petitioner] was asked to pay the docket fee in the total amount of TWO THOUSAND TWENTY PESOS (P2,020.00), which was assessed on 21 January 2009 and paid on the same day.<br><br>On 28 January 2009, the Commission Secretary issued an Order addressed to Atty. Benito Cataran, Director of CRMD, to file a Reply Memorandum within TEN (10) days upon receipt of the Order.<br><br>On 26 February 2009, CRMD filed its Reply Memorandum by way of Comment ("CRMD Comment"), declaring that the imposition of the filing fee of 1/5 of 1% of the authorized capital stock for the extension of corporate term under [SEC M.C. No. 9, S. 2004] is a valid exercise of the Commission's authority to promulgate administrative regulation. CRMD also indicated that the fifteen[-]day period within which to file the Petition for Review should be reckoned from the actual receipt by [petitioner] of the certificate and in the instant case, more than fifteen days have transpired before the filing of the petition.<br><br>In response, [petitioner] filed a Request for Time to File Reply to Comment on 18 March 2009, and acknowledged therein that it received the CRMD Comment on 11 March 2009 but prayed that it be granted until 26 March 2009 within which to file its Reply. Again, on 26 March 2009, [petitioner] filed a Request for Time to File Reply to Comment and prayed that it be given until 31 March 2009 to submit its Reply. It was only on 31 March 2009 when it filed its Reply, way beyond the [10-]day period required by the 2006 Rules of Procedure of the Commission ("2006 Rules"). In its Reply, [petitioner] basically reiterated the contents of its 02 October 2007 Position Paper.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><b><center>The Ruling of the SEC <i>En Banc</i><br></center></b><br>In its October 13, 2011 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the SEC en bane held that pursuant to the Corporation Code, Republic Act No. (R.A.) 3531,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the Securities Regulations Code (SRC), the Civil Code, and the Constitution, the imposition of the filing fee for the extension of a corporation's term, in the amount of 1/5 of 1% of the authorized capital stock, is a valid exercise of the SEC's authority to promulgate administrative regulations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Under the Corporation Code<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and the SRC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the SEC has the power and authority to promulgate rules and regulations reasonably necessary to enable it to perform its duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The SEC <i>en banc</i> reasoned that this authority includes the power to prescribe the fees necessary for the SEC to carry out its functions and mandates,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which entail a lot of expenditure on the part of the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Given that petitioner is a publicly listed company burdened with various reportorial requirements, the SEC <i>en banc</i> held that it is duty-bound to monitor petitioner's compliance for the protection of the investing public.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Contrary to petitioner's claim therefore, the fee imposed is not merely for the processing of its application.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Rather, the approval of petitioner's application triggers the renewal of the regulatory functions of the SEC that will last for the next 50 years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The SEC <i>en banc</i> held that petitioner, as a grantee of a mere privilege, should contribute to the expenses for its regulation for the next 50 years of its existence.

Said law likewise authorized the SEC to recommend to the President the revision and adjustment of the charges and fees it is authorized by law to collect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In 1980, the Corporation Code of the Philippines<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> was enacted. Under said law, the SEC was authorized to collect and receive fees as prescribed by law or by its rules and regulations. Sections 139 and 143 of the Corporation Code provided:<br><blockquote><b>Section 139</b>. <i>Incorporation and other fees</i>. - The Securities and Exchange Commission is hereby authorized to collect and receive fees as authorized by law or by rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission, (n)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><b>Section 143.</b> <i>Ride-making power of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</i> - The Securities and Exchange Commission shall have the power and authority to implement the provisions of this Code, and to promulgate rules and regulations reasonably necessary to enable it to perform its duties hereunder, particularly in the prevention of fraud and abuses on the part of the controlling stockholders, members, directors, trustees or officers, (n)</blockquote>In addition, the Corporation Code included a repealing clause, which stated:<br><blockquote><b>Section 146.</b><i> Repealing clause.</i> - Except as expressly provided by this Code, all laws or parts thereof inconsistent with any provision of this Code shall be deemed repealed, (n)</blockquote>The foregoing provisions naturally give rise to the question of whether the Corporation Code impliedly repealed the specific fees prescribed under R.A. 944 and R.A. 3531, and if so, to what extent.<br><br>In <i>Bank of Commerce v. Planters Development Bank,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the Court discussed the rules of statutory construction involving implied repeals, as follows:<br><blockquote><u>An implied repeal transpires when a substantial conflict exists between the new and the prior laws.</u> In the absence of an express repeal, a subsequent law cannot be construed as repealing a prior law unless an irreconcilable inconsistency and repugnancy exist in the terms of the new and the old laws. Repeal by implication is not favored, unless manifestly intended by the legislature, or unless it is convincingly and unambiguously demonstrated, that the laws or orders are clearly repugnant and patently inconsistent with one another so that they cannot co-exist; the legislature is presumed to know the existing law and would express a repeal if one is intended.<br><br>There are two instances of implied repeal. One takes place when the provisions in the two acts on the same subject matter are irreconcilably contradictory, in which case, the later act, to the extent of the conflict, constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one. The other occurs when the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute; thus, it will operate to repeal the earlier law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote>A perusal of the three laws reveals that the first instance of implied repeal is present in this case.<br><br>R.A. 944 specifically prescribed fees for the "<u>examining and filing of articles of incorporation</u>," among other fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> On the other hand, Section 139 of the Corporation Code embraced " <u>Incorporation</u> and other fees."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Both provisions indisputably cover the same subject matter, <i>i.e.</i>, the prescribed fee for incorporating corporations and other related fees.<br><br>It is likewise apparent that a substantial inconsistency exists between the terms of the three laws. R.A. 944 prescribed a <u>specific rate</u> of 1/10 of 1% of the authorized capital stock, but in no case less than -P25.00 nor more than P1,000.00,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and R.A. 3531 pegged the fee collectible for an amendment extending the term of a corporation's existence to the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> On the other hand, Section 139 of the Corporation Code authorized the SEC to "collect and receive fees as authorized by law <u><i>or</i> by rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission</u>." The use of the term "or" is significant. In statutory construction, the term "or" "is a disjunctive [conjunction] indicating an alternative. It often connects a series of words or propositions indicating a choice of either."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Undoubtedly therefore, Congress, by using the term "or", intended to authorize the SEC to choose to either collect and receive the fees already "authorized by law" <i>or</i> to promulgate rules and regulations prescribing the rates and fees it will collect and receive.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In other words, while the rates for the filing of articles of incorporation and other fees were previously specifically provided by law, Section 139 in relation to Section 143 of the Corporation Code impliedly repealed the same by delegating to the SEC the power to also promulgate rules prescribing different rates to be collected.<br><br>The Court finds that such a construction is more consistent with the declared intent to infuse the SEC with the power and authority to determine and promulgate such rules and regulations it deems reasonably necessary for the performance of its duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> More importantly, any other construction would not only render the phrase "collect and receive fees as authorized by law" superfluous in light of the existing laws on the matter, but would also render the additional phrase, "authorized x x x by rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission" worthless.<br><br>However, while administrative agencies may be authorized by law to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to carry out their mandates under a statute, due process requires that said authority always be exercised within the bounds of the ever-elusive concept of "reasonableness."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br><b><i>The rate prescribed was <br>unreasonable.</i></b><br><br>Petitioner claims that the prescribed fee amounting to P24,000,000.00 for the mere examination of an amendment of a single paragraph in a corporation's articles of incorporation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> is unreasonable, oppressive, confiscatory and amounts to a tax.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The SEC argues that the fee imposed is not merely for the processing of its application.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Rather, it is a license fee that is reasonably necessary to enable it to perform its regulatory functions for the next 50 years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The Court finds both claims to be partially meritorious. The fee was imposed primarily for regulation and thus cannot be considered a tax.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Nevertheless, the Court finds the license fee imposed to be unreasonable and exorbitant.<br><br>Pursuant to the SEC's authority to prescribe fees under Section 139 in relation to Section 143 of the Corporation Code, the SEC, through SEC M.C.

When an activity, occupation or profession is of such a character that inspection or supervision by public officials is reasonably necessary for the safeguarding and furtherance of public health, morals and safety, or the general welfare, the legislature may provide that such inspection or supervision or other form of regulation shall be carried out at the expense of the persons engaged in such occupation or performing such activity, and that no one shall engage in the occupation or carry out the activity until a fee or charge sufficient to cover the cost of the inspection or supervision has been paid. Accordingly, a charge of a fixed sum which bears no relation at all to the cost of inspection and regulation may be held to be a tax rather than an exercise of the police power.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>The Court, in <i>Morcoin Co., Ltd. v. City of Manila,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> likewise held:<br><br>x x x The power to regulate and impose license fee for the operations of slot machines - which include juke box machines, pinball machines and other coin-operated contrivances - should not, however, be construed as including the power to impose license taxes for revenue purposes. Indeed, a cursory reading of the legislative powers of the Municipal Board enumerated in Section 18 of the City's Revised Charter shows that the power to tax is given where it was intended to be exercised and is not given where it was not so designed. As the authority was withheld, it must logically result that the power granted under the above-quoted provision of the City's Charter is purely regulatory for police purposes. ([<i>Pacific Commercial Co. v. Romualdez and Alfonso, 49 Phil. 917; Hercules Lumber v. Municipality of Zamboanga</i>, 55 Phil. 653.]) <u>Such being the case, the amount of license fees that may be imposed upon juke box machines and other coin-operated contrivances cannot be prohibitive, extortionate, confiscatory or in an unlawful restraint of trade, but <b>should be approximately commensurate</b></u> with and sufficient to cover all the necessary or probable expenses of issuing the license and of such inspection, regulation and supervision as may be lawful. ([<i>Cu Unjieng v. Patstone</i>, 42 Phil. 818; <i>City of Iloilo v. Villanueva</i>, 105 Phil., 337]; 33 Am. Jur. 367; 53 C.J.S. 517]; See also the cases cited therein.) <b><u>Any ordinance which imposes a license fee which is substantially in excess of the reasonable expense of issuing the license and regulating the occupation to which it pertains, is invalid</u></b>.

No. 2, S. 1994 sought to prescribe 1) the fee for the filing of articles of incorporation at the rate of 1/10 of 1% of the authorized capital stock plus 20% thereof but not less than P500.00, without any maximum filing fee<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> and 2) the fee of P200.00 for examining and filing amended articles of incorporation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> said Circular was declared invalid in <i>Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Tuvera.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Thus, it was only in the instant SEC M.C. No. 9, S. 2004 that the fee cap or ceiling was altogether abandoned, giving rise to the exaction of significantly huge regulatory fees.<br><br>Even assuming arguendo that the SEC is correct in holding that a corporation with more authorized capital stock requires more regulation and supervision, the Court has not been shown how such additional effort on the part of the SEC can reasonably amount to P24,000,000.00 or 12,000 times more than the minimum amount of P2,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Likewise, no justification has been demonstrated to the Court for imposing the huge amount of P24,000,000.00 on herein petitioner simply because it also happens to be a public company.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> While a public company may be subject to stringent regulations and to periodic reportorial requirements under the SRC, the instant fee is being imposed on a corporation's authorized capital stock, regardless of whether or not the corporation falls within the definition of a "public company."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> In other words, SEC M.C. No. 9, S. 2004 would also apply to a non-public company with the same authorized capital stock as herein petitioner. Evidently therefore, any additional surveillance and regulation that may be needed for public companies and the additional costs associated therewith are <b><u>not remotely related to the instant fee.</u></b> This only further shows that the fee is not only exorbitant, it is also quite arbitrary.<br><br>To further illustrate the arbitrariness of the cap-less and therefore limitless formula prescribed under SEC M.C. No. 9, S. 2004, the Court notes that petitioner likewise paid a "filing fee" in the amount of P40,000,000.00 for the increase of its authorized capital stock.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Curiously, had the increase in its authorized capital stock from P12.1 billion to P32.1 billion been undertaken <i><u>before</u></i> petitioner sought an extension of its corporate life, petitioner would have paid P40,000,000.00 for the increase in its authorized capital stock and thereafter, P64,200,000.00 (instead of the current P24,000,000.00) for the extension of its term. In this scenario, what additional regulatory cost could possibly justify the outrageous P40,200,000.00 leap in petitioner's license fees?<br><br>It also bears emphasis that the SEC presumably examined petitioner's corporate records and its compliance with various reportorial requirements each time it increased its authorized capital stock or sought SEC approval for other corporate acts undertaken prior to the extension of its corporate term.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Thus, when petitioner filed for the extension of its corporate term in 2007, the SEC only needed to determine petitioner's compliance as regards the reportorial requirements due after the approval or monitoring of the corporate act immediately preceding the extension under examination. As the SEC already charged significant fees for previous corporate acts requiring SEC approval, especially increases in capital stock, the incremental work involved in extending petitioner's corporate life could not justifiably amount to P24,000,000.00.<br><br>The unreasonableness of the instant fee is bolstered by the fact that R.A. 11232 or the Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines, which took effect on February 23, 2019, now grants all corporations perpetual existence, unless its articles of incorporation otherwise provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 11. <i>Corporate Term.</i> - A corporation shall have perpetual existence unless its articles of incorporation provides otherwise.<br><br>Corporations with certificates of incorporation issued prior to the effectivity of this Code, and which continue to exist, shall have perpetual existence, unless the corporation, upon a vote of its stockholders representing a majority of its outstanding capital stock, notifies the Commission that it elects to retain its specific corporate term pursuant to its articles of incorporation: <i>Provided</i>, That any change in the corporate term under this section is without prejudice to the appraisal right of dissenting stockholders in accordance with the provisions of this Code.<br><br>A corporate term for a specific period may be extended or shortened by amending the articles of incorporation: Provided, That no extension may be made earlier than three (3) years prior to the original or subsequent expiry date(s) unless there are justifiable reasons for an earlier extension as may be determined by the Commission: <i>Provided, further</i>, That such extension of the corporate term shall take effect only on the day following the original or subsequent expiry date(s).<br><br>A corporation whose term has expired may apply for a revival of its corporate existence, together with all the rights and privileges under its certificate of incorporation and subject to all of its duties, debts and liabilities existing prior to its revival.

Quezon City,</i> G.R. No. L-36081, April 24, 1989, 172 SCRA 729, 635, the Court explained: "The term "tax" frequently applies to all kinds of exactions of monies which become public funds. It is often loosely used to include levies for revenue as well as levies for regulatory purposes such that <i>license fees are frequently called taxes although license fee is a legal concept distinguishable from tax:</i> the former is imposed in the exercise of police power primarily for purposes of regulation, while the latter is imposed under the taxing power primarily for purposes of raising revenues. Thus, if the generating of revenue is the primary purpose and regulation is merely incidental, the imposition is a tax; but if regulation is the primary purpose, the fact that incidentally revenue is also obtained does not make the imposition a tax."<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><i>Quezon City PTCA Federation, Inc. v.
