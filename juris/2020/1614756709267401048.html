Thereafter, trial on merits ensued.<br><br><i><center><b>Version of the Prosecution</b></center></i><br>On September 2, 2011, around 10:00 a.m., a confidential informant reported that Serojales known as "Tatay," was selling illegal drugs in Laguindingan and other neighboring municipalities in Misamis Oriental. Consequently,&nbsp; a&nbsp; team&nbsp; of&nbsp; Philippine&nbsp; Drug&nbsp; Enforcement&nbsp; Agency&nbsp; (<i>PDEA</i>) agents was formed to conduct a buy-bust operation. The buy-bust team was composed of IO-3 Rubietania L. Aguilar who was designated as poseur-buyer, while 1A-1 Rodolfo S. De La Cerna was tasked as the arresting officer. Thereafter, IO-3 Aguilar&nbsp; was&nbsp; provided&nbsp; with&nbsp; one P500.00 bill&nbsp; with serial number TM336888 to be used as buy-bust money.<br><br>On the same day, at 12:00 noon, the team, together with the confidential informant, proceeded to Laguindingan, Misamis Oriental to pursue the buy­ bust&nbsp; operation.&nbsp; At&nbsp; the&nbsp; time&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; team's arrival,&nbsp; IO3 Aguilar&nbsp; and&nbsp; the confidential informant alighted from their vehicle and waited for "<i>Tatay</i>" in a waiting shed&nbsp; along&nbsp; the&nbsp; national&nbsp; highway.&nbsp; After&nbsp; a&nbsp; few&nbsp; moments,&nbsp; accused "<i>Tatay</i>"&nbsp; and accused-appellant Goyenoche arrived. Subsequently, IO3 Aguilar was introduced by the confidential informant as buyer. Serojales then asked IO3&nbsp; Aguilar for his money.&nbsp; IO3 Aguilar handed the marked money to the accused.&nbsp; After that, Serojales asked Goyenoche&nbsp; to give IO3&nbsp; Aguilar a sachet of shabu.&nbsp; IO3&nbsp; Aguilar examined the contents of the sachet. At that point, IO3 Aguilar executed the pre-arranged&nbsp; signal by dialing the number of IA1 De La Cerna.&nbsp; Following that, IA1&nbsp; De La Cerna came together with the rest of the team and introduced himself as a PDEA Agent.&nbsp; Accused were then informed of the violation they had committed and apprised them of their constitutional rights.<br><br>The&nbsp; team&nbsp; conducted&nbsp; a&nbsp; search&nbsp; on&nbsp; the&nbsp; persons&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; accused&nbsp; and recovered&nbsp; 7&nbsp; pieces&nbsp; of&nbsp; transparent&nbsp; plastic&nbsp; sachets,&nbsp; all&nbsp; containing&nbsp; white crystalline substance&nbsp; believed to be <i>shabu</i> in the possession of Goyenoche. While the buy-bust money and one (1) transparent&nbsp; plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance believed to be <i>shabu </i>was found in the possession of Serojales.<br><br>IO3&nbsp; Aguilar then turned over to IA1&nbsp; De La Cerna the sachet of <i>shabu</i> that she bought from the accused for inventory, which was marked with BB­LRA. The inventory and marking of evidence were conducted in the presence of Barangay Councilor Lyn K. Denham and Sheila Joy Labrador from ABS­CBN, as the representative from media.&nbsp; Serojales and Goyenoche were then brought to the PDEA office for proper disposition and legal documentation. Thereafter, all the confiscated items were forwarded to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.<br><br><center><i><b>Version of the Defense</b></i><br></center><br>Accused&nbsp; Serojales&nbsp; and&nbsp; Goyenoche&nbsp; vehemently&nbsp; denied&nbsp; the&nbsp; charge against them. They alleged that they were waiting for a jeepney at the afore­mentioned waiting shed, when a vehicle stopped in front of them and its passengers jumped out from it and shouted "<i>dapal</i>" (lie on the ground). After which they were frisked while on the ground. When nothing was found on their persons, Serojales heard a PDEA agent's call wherein he heard the other person on the line saying "<i>pangita mog idea</i>" (Find another way).&nbsp; After that, another PDEA agent brought to the scene a sachet of <i>shabu</i>, the ownership of which was imputed to Serojales and Goyenoche. They denied the imputation against them. Nevertheless,&nbsp; they were photographed&nbsp; with it and were then taken to the Police Station of Laguindingan.<br><br>The accused argued that the prosecution failed to establish the chain of custody requirement&nbsp; under the law.&nbsp; They maintained that there was a break in the very first link of the chain of custody when IAI De La Cerna failed to mark the sachets of shabu immediately upon seizing them from the accused. They further contended that the marking after the seizure is the starting point of&nbsp; the&nbsp; custodial link;&nbsp; hence,&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; vital&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; seized contraband be immediately marked to prevent contamination, planting or switching of evidence.&nbsp; Thus, for the failure of the certificate of inventory to reveal the marks on the items enumerated therein, the accused alleged that it created a reasonable doubt to the factuality of the marking.<br><br><center><i><b>RTC Ruling</b></i></center><br>After trial, the RTC handed a guilty verdict on both accused Serojales and Goyenoche for violation of Sections 5 (Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs) and 11 (<i>Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs</i>), Article II of R.A No. 9165. The dispositive portion of the August 7, 2017 Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment&nbsp; is hereby rendered as follows:<br><blockquote><ol><li>In Criminal Case No. 2011-2064: FINDING both accused ROGELIO SEROJALES y CARABALLA a.k.a.

Thus, Serojales and Goyenoche were lawfully arrested.&nbsp; Moreover, the RTC gave credence to the testimonies of the arresting officers as to what happened during the buy-bust operation, stating that the testimonies were expressed in a candid and straightforward manner and finding absence of any improper motive. Further,&nbsp; the RTC ruled that the prosecution was able to establish all the elements for the prosecution of illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs. Lastly, the RTC is of the opinion&nbsp; that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved.<br><br><center><i><b>CA Ruling</b></i></center><br>On appeal, the CA affirmed the RTC Decision.&nbsp; The CA ruled that all the elements for the illegal sale and possession of <i>shabu</i> were established by the prosecution.&nbsp; The CA agreed with the findings of the trial court that the prosecution duly established the identity of accused as drug sellers and IO3 Aguilar as the poseur-buyer.&nbsp; The appellate court was in the position that there is no question that Serojales and Goyenoche were caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i> by the police officers in a valid entrapment or "buy-bust" operation.&nbsp; In ruling that the testimonies of the apprehending officers deserve full faith and credit, the CA opined that accused-appellants bear the burden of showing that the evidence was tampered or meddled with in order to overcome the presumption of regularity in the handling of exhibits by public officers and the presumption that public officers&nbsp; properly discharged their duties. Further, the appellate court, concluded&nbsp; that evidence clearly show an unbroken&nbsp; chain of custody with respect to the seized illegal drugs; thus, ruling that the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized drugs were sufficiently maintained.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; dated March 14, 2018, the CA resolved to dismiss the case against Serojales in view of his death on September 4, 2017, to wit:<br><blockquote>Consequently,&nbsp; Serojales'&nbsp; death&nbsp; on 4 September&nbsp; 2017&nbsp; renders&nbsp; the Court's&nbsp; 30 January 2018 Resolution iuelevant&nbsp; and ineffectual as to him, and is therefore set aside. Accordingly, the criminal case against Serojales is dismissed. The appeal of Rogelio Serojales culminating in the extinguishment&nbsp; of his criminal liability does not have any effect on his co­accused-appellant Juanita Goyenoche. The extinguishment&nbsp; of Rogelio Serojales' criminal and pecuniary liabilities is predicated on his death and not on his acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>Before us, the People and the accused-appellant Goyenoche, manifested that they would no longer file a Supplemental&nbsp; Brief, taking into account&nbsp; the&nbsp; thorough&nbsp; and&nbsp; substantial&nbsp; discussions&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; issues&nbsp; in&nbsp; their respective appeal briefs before the CA.<br><br><center><i><b>Our Ruling</b></i></center><br>We find the appeal meritorious.&nbsp; The judgment of conviction is reversed and set aside, and Serojales and Goyenoche should be acquitted based on reasonable doubt.<br><br>Under Section 5, Article II of R.A.

Marking after seizure is the starting point in the custodial link, thus, it&nbsp; is&nbsp; vital&nbsp; that&nbsp; the seized&nbsp; contraband&nbsp; are&nbsp; immediately marked&nbsp; because succeeding&nbsp; handlers&nbsp; of the specimens&nbsp; will&nbsp; use the markings&nbsp; as reference. The marking of the evidence serves to separate the marked evidence from the corpus of all other similar&nbsp; or related evidence from the time they are seized from the accused until they are disposed of at the end of criminal proceedings, obviating&nbsp; switching, "planting," or contamination of evidence.<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[15]</sup></font><br><br>The chain of custody rule&nbsp; requires that&nbsp; the&nbsp; marking of&nbsp; the&nbsp; seized contraband&nbsp; be done "(1) in the presence of the apprehended violator,&nbsp; and (2) immediately upon confiscation.<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[16]</sup></font><br><br>Here,&nbsp; there&nbsp; is no showing&nbsp; that the seized&nbsp; items were&nbsp; marked&nbsp; in the presence&nbsp; of Serojales&nbsp; and Goyenoche.

Hence, there is already reasonable doubt as to whether&nbsp; the seized&nbsp; drugs were exactly&nbsp; the same drugs presented in court as evidence.<br><br>The prosecution failed to secure the required witnesses under Sec. 21 of R.A. No. 9165<br><br>In <i>People&nbsp; v. Federico&nbsp; Señeres,&nbsp; Jr.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;"><font color="#FF0000">[19]</font></sup> the Court&nbsp; was instructive&nbsp; on the number&nbsp; of witnesses&nbsp; required in prosecutions for illegal sale or possession&nbsp; of dangerous&nbsp; drugs, to ensure&nbsp; the integrity&nbsp; and evidentiary value of the seized drugs:<br><blockquote>Under the original&nbsp; provision of Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165, after seizure and confiscation of the drugs, the apprehending&nbsp; team is required to immediately conduct a physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of (1) the accused or the person's from whom such items were confiscated and/or&nbsp; seized,&nbsp; or&nbsp; his/her&nbsp; representative or&nbsp; counsel;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; a representative from&nbsp; the media <b><u>and</u></b>&nbsp; (3) from&nbsp; the&nbsp; DOJ;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (4) any elected public official&nbsp; who shall&nbsp; be required&nbsp; to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof. It is assumed that the presence&nbsp; of these persons will guarantee&nbsp; "against planting of&nbsp; evidence&nbsp; and frame up," <i>i.e</i>.,&nbsp; they&nbsp; are "necessary to insulate&nbsp; the apprehension and incrimination proceedings from any taint of illegitimacy or irregularity." Now, the amendatory law mandates that&nbsp; the conduct&nbsp; of physical&nbsp; inventory&nbsp; and photograph of the seized&nbsp; items must be in the presence of (1) the accused&nbsp; or the person/s from&nbsp; whom such items&nbsp; were confiscated and/or&nbsp; seized,&nbsp; or his/her&nbsp; representative or counsel; (2)&nbsp; an&nbsp; elected public&nbsp; official;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (3) a&nbsp; representative of&nbsp; the&nbsp; National Prosecution Service&nbsp; or the media who shall sign the copies of the inventory and&nbsp; be given&nbsp; a copy&nbsp; thereof. <b><u>In&nbsp; the&nbsp; present case,&nbsp; the&nbsp; old&nbsp; provisions of Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 and&nbsp; its IRR shall apply since the&nbsp; alleged crime was committed before the amendment.</u></b></blockquote>In the present&nbsp; case, the Informations filed against&nbsp; Serojales&nbsp; and Goyenoche show&nbsp; that the crime charged&nbsp; against&nbsp; them was committed&nbsp; on or about September 2, 2011, while the amendatory&nbsp; law took effect much later, or only on&nbsp; July 15, 2014. Hence,&nbsp; the original&nbsp; provision&nbsp; of Section&nbsp; 21(1)&nbsp; and its IRR as quoted above applies.<br><br>It is&nbsp; undisputed that&nbsp; the&nbsp; inventory&nbsp; and&nbsp; marking of&nbsp; evidence were conducted&nbsp; only&nbsp; in the presence&nbsp; of Barangay&nbsp; Councilor Lyn K.

The&nbsp; buy-bust&nbsp; operation, by its nature,&nbsp; was arranged&nbsp; and scheduled&nbsp; in advance – the police officers&nbsp; formed an&nbsp; apprehending team,&nbsp; coordinated&nbsp; with&nbsp; the Philippine Drug&nbsp; Enforcement Agency, prepared&nbsp; the buy-bust money, and held a briefing.&nbsp; Simply&nbsp; put, the buy-bust team had enough time and opportunity to bring with them said witnesses.<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[21]</sup></font> Yet, the prosecution&nbsp; failed to ensure&nbsp; that a representative from the DOJ would be present during the physical inventory and the taking of photographs of&nbsp; the&nbsp; seized&nbsp; drugs.

No. 9165, the Court is constrained to rule that the integrity and the evidentiary&nbsp; value of the seized drugs have been compromised.<br><br>It&nbsp; cannot&nbsp; be&nbsp; overemphasized that&nbsp; it&nbsp; is the&nbsp; prosecution who&nbsp; has&nbsp; the positive duty to establish that earnest efforts were employed in contacting&nbsp; the representatives enumerated under Section&nbsp; 21(1)&nbsp; of R.A. 9165,&nbsp; or that there was a justifiable ground&nbsp; for failing to do so.<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[22]</sup></font>&nbsp; The rules require that the apprehending officers&nbsp; do not simply&nbsp; mention&nbsp; a justifiable&nbsp; ground,&nbsp; but also clearly state this ground&nbsp; in their sworn affidavit, coupled&nbsp; with a statement&nbsp; on the steps they took to preserve the integrity of the seized item.<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[23]</sup></font>&nbsp; In the instant case, all the prosecution has done is to assert a self-serving claim that the integrity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; seized pack&nbsp; has&nbsp; been&nbsp; preserved despite&nbsp; the&nbsp; numerous procedural lapses it has committed.&nbsp; The fatal errors of the apprehending team can only lead this Court to seriously doubt the integrity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.<br><br>Thus, in <i>People v. Ernesto Silayan</i>,<font color="#FF0000"><sup style="COLOR: RGB255, 0, 0;">[24]</sup></font>&nbsp; the Court acquitted the accused for the prosecution's failure to secure the attendance of the required witnesses. The Court held:<br><blockquote>To repeat, the burden to prove that there were justifiable grounds for the non-compliance with the procedure laid down in Section 21 (1), Article II of RA 9165 and its IRR lies with the prosecution. It must show that the apprehending&nbsp; team exerted earnest efforts to secure&nbsp; the attendance&nbsp; of the necessary witnesses.<br><br>However, in this case, there was not even an attempt to explain why the required witnesses were not present during the inventory. No evidence was adduced to prove that earnest efforts were exerted to comply with the requirements of Section 21 (1), Article II of RA 9165 and its IRR. As this was a buy-bust operation, it is by its nature a planned activity — the police officers had every chance to comply with the procedural requirements of the law. The prosecution offered no explanation for the failure of the buy-bust team to secure the required witnesses under the law. The total failure of the prosecution to explain the non-compliance with the procedural requirements of&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 21 (1),&nbsp; Article II&nbsp; of RA 9165 and&nbsp; its IRR creates&nbsp; doubt&nbsp; on whether the buy-bust team was able to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the items seized from Silayan.</blockquote>Considering that&nbsp; the&nbsp; prosecution failed&nbsp; to:&nbsp; (1) prove&nbsp; the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime; (2) establish an unbroken chain of custody of the seized drugs;&nbsp; and&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; provide&nbsp; justifiable&nbsp; grounds&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; apprehending team's deviation from the rules laid down in Section 21 of RA 9165, it follows that the&nbsp; integrity&nbsp; and&nbsp; evidentiary&nbsp; value&nbsp; of&nbsp; the <i>corpus&nbsp; delicti</i> have&nbsp; thus&nbsp; been compromised. In light of this, Serojales and Goyenoche must perforce be acquitted.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the September 4, 2018 Decision of the&nbsp; Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 01772-MIN, which affirmed the August 7, 2017 Consolidated Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 44, Initao, Misamis Oriental West, in Criminal Cases No. 2011-2064, 2011-2065 and 2011-2066, finding accused Rogelio Serojales y Caraballa a.k.a.
