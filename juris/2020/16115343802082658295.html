The so called SSC Resolution No. 183 which supposedly authorized the grant and release of the CNA incentives was found to be inexistent by both the COA Regional Office and the COA-CP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> It was not found in the official records in petitioner's own office. Notably, petitioner has never produced its copy then and even now notwithstanding that the same has been its main anchor of defense since day one and despite both COA tribunals' persistent finding that it truly did not exist. Since petitioner inexplicably cannot produce the supposed document, the logical conclusion is there was no such document to speak of in the first place. We, therefore, quote with concurrence the relevant findings of the COA Regional Office and Commission Proper on the inexistent Resolution No. 183, thus:<br><blockquote><b><u>Decision No. 2013-29 of the COA Regional Office:</u></b><br><br>The contention by SSS that there was indeed a supplemental CAN approved in a form of SSC Resolution No. 183 dated April 2, 2003 which provides for the grant of P20,000.00 to each employee payable in two (2) tranches covering those within the collective negotiating unit as of December 31, 2014 <b><u>was negated by the COA-SSS Head Office as per verification, no such supplemental CNA existed.</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br><br><b><u>Decision No. 2018-305 of the COA-CP:</u></b><br><br>Contrary to the assertion of the petitioner, the incentive was not validly granted under the Supplemental CAN in the form of Social Security Commission (SSC) Resolution No. 183 dated April 2, 2003. As verified by the COA-SSS Head Office, <b><u>no such Supplemental CNA existed</u></b>. Thus, this Commission sustains the determination of the RD that the Supplemental CNA invoked by the petitioner to have been allegedly used as basis in the grant of said incentive, was not even attached to the Petition for Review dated January 17, 2014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><b><i>Second</i></b>. There is no showing, as none was shown that the grant of the CNA incentives formed part of a duly executed CNA for years 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 between the SSS management and the employees' representative the Alert and Concerned Employees for Better SSS (ACCES)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> in violation of<b> Section 5.1 of DBM BC No. 2006-1</b>. Both COA Regional Office and COA-CP aptly discussed how this infirmity likewise led to the disallowance, thus:<br><blockquote><b><u>Decision No. 2013-29 of COA Regional Office:</u></b><br><br>Records show that the <b>main reason why the various payment of CNA Incentives were disallowed</b> was because <b>there is nowhere in the CNA executed</b> between the representatives of the management - SSS and the employees' organization - ACCESS <b>which provides for such case incentive</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br><br><b><u>Decision of No. 2018-305 of COA-CP:</u></b><br><br><b>ND No. 2012-03 was issued primarily on the ground that there was no authority</b> allowing payment of CNA Incentives to the employees of SSS-WMD considering that <b>such form of incentive was not provided in the CNA for CYs 2005-2008.</b> Thus, the payment of the same without an authority <b>violates Section 5.1 of DBM BC No. 2006-1</b> xxx.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><b><i>Third</i></b>. Petitioner's <b>grant of P20,000.00</b> to each of the employees infringed Section 5.6.1 of DBM BC No. 2006-1 which <b>prohibits GOCCs or GFIs from making a pre-determination of the amount or rate</b> of each CNA incentive to be given to the employees. Petitioner likewise breached Section 5.7<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of DBM BC No. 2006-1 when it used up 80% of its savings for years 2005, 2006, and 2007 for the employees' CNA incentives notwithstanding that this grant was not even covered by a duly existing CNA executed between management and the employees' organization for the three (3) fiscal years in question. Not only that. There was also a breach of the prescribed apportionment of savings under Section 6.1.3<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> of DBM BC No. 2006-1, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>50% for CNA Incentives;<br>30% for improvement of working conditions and/or to be added as part of the CNA Incentive, as may be agreed upon in the CNA; and 20% is to be retained and to be used for the operations of the agency to include among others, purchase of equipment critical to the operations and productivity improvement programs.</blockquote>We keenly note as well the unrefuted finding below that during the four (4) years in question, the employees here were also granted other benefits by petitioner over and above the disputed CNA incentives which all the more made the use of 80% of petitioner's savings for that purpose excessive.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><b><i>Fourth</i></b>. Petitioner failed to adduce evidence that the amounts given as CNA incentives actually came from savings generated from its identified cost-cutting measures as mandated by Section 7.1.1 of DBM BC No. 2006-1 and Section 8 of PSLMC Resolution No. 2. Series of 2003.<br><br><b><i>Fifth</i></b>. Petitioner further failed to show compliance with the conditions under Section 3 of PSLMC Resolution No. 2, series of 2003, thus: a) the actual operating income should meet the targeted income in the Corporate Operating Budget (COB) approved by the DBM; b) there should be sufficient source of funds for payment of CNA incentives; and c) dividends amounting to at least 50% of the agency's actual earnings should have been remitted to the National Treasury. In fact, records reveal that for fiscal years 2005 and 2007, petitioner's actual operating income did not even meet the targeted operating income in the COB approved by the DBM.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Petitioner was silent on this point.<br><br>Verily, therefore, the disallowance of the CNA incentives here cannot be faulted, nay, tainted with grave abuse of discretion. On this score, petitioner's claim that there were consultations and negotiations which took place among the stakeholders such as the SSS Employees Union Panels, DBM, and PSLMC prior to the approval of the disallowed incentives<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and that SSC had actually authorized similar grants in the past<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> is a bare allegation devoid of any probative weight.

For errant approving and certifying officers, the law justifies holding them solidarity liable for amounts they may or may not have received considering that the payees would not have received the disallowed amounts if it were not for the officers' irregular discharge of their duties, x x x x This treatment contrasts with that of individual payees who x x x x can only be liable to return the full amount they were paid, or they received pursuant to the principles of <i>solutio indebiti</i> and unjust enrichment.<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>x x x x the Court adopts Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F.

The presence of any of these factors in a case may tend to uphold the presumption of good faith in the performance of official functions accorded to the officers involved, which must always be examined relative to the circumstances attending therein.<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br></center>x x x x the evolution of the "good faith rule" that excused the passive recipients in good faith from return began in <i>Blaquera</i> (1998) and <i>NEA</i> (2002), where the good faith of both officers and payees were determinative of their liability to return the disallowed benefits - the good faith of all parties resulted in excusing the return altogether in <i>Blaquera</i>, and the bad faith of officers resulted in the return by all recipients in <i>NEA</i>. The rule morphed in <i>Casal</i> (2006) to distinguish the liability of the payees and the approving and/or certifying officers for the return of the disallowed amounts. In <i>MIAA</i> (2012) and <i>TESDA</i> (2014), the rule was further nuanced to determine the extent of what must be returned by the approving and/or certifying officers as the government absorbs what has been paid to payees in good faith. This was the state of jurisprudence then which led to the ruling in <i>Silang</i> (2015) which followed the rule in <i>Casal</i> that payees, as passive recipients, should not be held liable to refund what they had unwittingly received in good faith, while relying on the cases of <i>Lumayna</i> and <i>Querubin</i>.<br><br>The history of the rule as shown evinces that the original formulation of the "good faith rule" excusing the return by payees based on good faith<u> was <b>not intended</b> to be <b>at the expense of</b> approving and/or certifying officers</u>. The application of this judge made rule of excusing the payees and then placing upon the officers the responsibility to refund amounts they did not personally receive, commits an inadvertent injustice.<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>The COA similarly applies the principle of <i>solutio indebiti</i> to require the return from payees regardless of good faith, x x x x<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>x x x x Notably, in situations where officers are covered by Section 38 of the Administrative Code either by presumption or by proof of having acted in good faith, in the regular performance of their official duties, and with the diligence of a good father of a family, payees remain liable for the disallowed amount unless the Court excuses the return. For the same reason, any amounts allowed to be retained by payees shall reduce the solidary liability of officers found to have acted in bad faith, malice, and gross negligence. In this regard, Justice Bernabe coins the term "net disallowed amount" to refer to the total disallowed amount minus the amounts excused to be returned by the payees. Likewise, Justice Leonen is of the same view that the officers held liable have a solidary obligation only to the extent of what should be refunded and this does not include the amounts received by those absolved of liability. In short, the net disallowed amount shall be solidarity shared by the approving/authorizing officers who were clearly shown to have acted in bad faith, with malice, or were grossly negligent.<br><br>Consistent with the foregoing, the Court shares the keen observation of Associate Justice Henri Jean Paul B. Inting that payees generally have no participation in the grant and disbursement of employee benefits, but their liability to return is based on <i>solutio indebiti</i> as a result of the mistake in payment. Save for collective negotiation agreement incentives carved out in the sense that employees are not considered passive recipients on account of their participation in the negotiated incentives x x x x payees are generally held in good faith for lack of participation, with participation limited to "accepting] the same with gratitude, confident that they richly deserve such benefits".<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>To recount, x x x x, retention by passive payees of disallowed amounts received in good faith has been justified on payee's "lack of participation in the disbursement." However, this justification is unwarranted because a payee's mere receipt of funds not being part of the performance of his official functions still equates to him unduly benefiting from the disallowed transaction; this gives rise to his liability to return, <br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>x x x x To a certain extent, therefore, payees always do have an indirect "involvement" and "participation" in the transaction where the benefits they received are disallowed <u>because the accounting recognition of the release of funds and their mere receipt thereof results in the debit against government funds in the agency's account and a credit in the payee's favor</u>.<br><br>Notably, when the COA includes payees as persons liable in an ND, the nature of their participation is stated as "received payment."<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>In the ultimate analysis, the Court, through these new precedents, has returned to the basic premise that the responsibility to return is a civil obligation to which fundamental civil law principles, such as unjust enrichment and <i>solutio indebiti</i> apply regardless of the good faith of passive recipients. <b><u>This, as well, is the foundation of the rules of return that the Court now promulgates.</u></b></blockquote>In the same case, the Court summarized the rules regarding the liability of the certifying and approving officers and recipient employees, thus:<br><blockquote><i>E. The Rules on Return</i><br><br>In view of the foregoing discussion, the Court pronounces:<br><br>1.

Liability of certifying and approving officers</i></b><br><br>Section 38, Chapter 9, Book I of the Administrative Code expressly states that the civil liability of a public officer for acts done in the performance of his or her official duty arises only upon a clear showing that he or she performed such duty with bad faith, malice, or gross negligence. This is because of the presumption that official duty is regularly performed.<br><br>Malice or bad faith implies a conscious and intentional design to do a wrongful act for a dishonest purpose or moral obliquity.58 Gross neglect of duty or gross negligence, on the other hand, refers to negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, or by acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to the consequences, insofar as other persons may be affected. It is the omission of that care that even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to give to their own property. It denotes a flagrant and culpable refusal or unwillingness of a person to perform a duty. In cases involving public officials, gross negligence occurs when a breach of duty is flagrant and palpable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>In contrast, "good faith" is ordinarily used to describe a state of mind denoting "<b><u>honesty</u></b> and <b>freedom from knowledge</b> of circumstances which ought to put the holder upon inquiry; an honest intention to abstain from taking any unconscientious advantage of another, even through technicalities of law, together with <b>absence of all information</b>, notice, or benefit or belief of facts which render <b>transaction unconscientious</b>."

Under the principle of <i>solutio indebiti</i>, if something is received when there is no right to demand it, and it was unduly delivered through mistake, the obligation to return it arises. Meanwhile, there is unjust enrichment when a person unjustly retains a benefit to the loss of another, or when a person retains money or property of another against the fundamental principles of justice, equity and good conscience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>Notably, in <b><i>Dubongco v. Commission on Audit,</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> the Court affirmed the disallowance of CNA incentives sourced out of CARP funds. More, it held that although the payees committed no fraud in obtaining the disallowed CNA benefits, they are considered trustees of the disallowed amounts. The Court, thus, <b>directed the payees to return the CNA benefits they obtained as it is against equity and good conscience to continue holding on to them.</b> The Court instructed, thus:<br><blockquote>Finally, the payees received the disallowed benefits with the mistaken belief that they were entitled to the same. <b>If property is acquired through mistake or fraud, the person obtaining it is, by force of law, considered a trustee of an implied trust for the benefit of the person from whom the property comes.</b> A constructive trust is substantially an <b>appropriate remedy against unjust enrichment.</b> It is raised by equity in respect of property, which has been acquired by fraud, <i>or where, although acquired originally without fraud,</i> it is against equity that it should be retained by the person holding it. In fine, the payees are considered as trustees of the disallowed amounts, as although they committed no fraud in obtaining these benefits, <b>it is against equity and good conscience for them to continue holding on to them.</b> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Here, it was not proven that the employees had a hand in the execution of the CNA covering the years 2005 to 2008 which would have alerted them that the CNA did not provide for the grants under consideration. They were merely passive recipients of the subject CNA incentives. Nevertheless, <b>it is evident that such incentives were granted to the employees despite its absolute lack of legal basis and breach of auditing rules and regulations.</b> Consequently, the employees had no valid claim to the benefits they received.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> More, the employees received subject benefits at the expense of another, specifically, the Government. <b>Applying the principle of unjust enrichment and <i>solutio indebiti</i>, the employees must return the incentives they unduly received.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br><b>Madera</b> decreed, however, that restitution may be excused in the following instances:<br><blockquote>x x x x the jurisprudential standard for the exception to apply is that the amounts received by the payees constitute disallowed benefits that were genuinely <b>given in consideration of services rendered</b> (or to be rendered)" negating the application of unjust enrichment and the <i>solutio indebiti</i> principle. As examples, Justice Bernabe explains that these disallowed benefits may be in the nature of <b>performance incentives, productivity pay, or merit increases</b> that have not been authorized by the Department of Budget and Management as an exception to the rule on standardized salaries. In addition to this proposed exception standard, Justice Bernabe states that the Court may also determine in the proper case <i>bona fide</i> exceptions, depending on the purpose and nature of the amount disallowed. These proposals are well-taken.<br><br>Moreover, the Court may also determine in a proper case other circumstances that warrant excusing the return despite the application of <i>solutio indebiti</i>, such as when <b>undue prejudice</b> will result from requiring payees to return or where social justice or humanitarian considerations are attendant. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Unfortunately for the SSS-WMD employees, <b>none of the exceptions are present in this case</b>. The disallowed CNA incentives were not given in relation to the employees' functions, nor were they given as part of performance incentives, productivity pay, or merit increases as in fact the CNA covering the years 2005 to 2008 did not provide for such kind of incentives. Also, it cannot be said that undue prejudice will result in requiring the recipient employees to return the disallowed amount. On the contrary, it is the Government that would be prejudiced if the recipients will not return what they unduly received.<br><br>Verily, therefore, <b>the employees must be held liable to return the amounts that they respectively received.
