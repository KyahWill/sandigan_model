Neither did his name appear on its list of personnel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Hence, appellant was not entitled to the <i>honorarium</i>. He clearly acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence when he requested and accepted the <i>honorarium</i> over the Municipal Accountant's reservation.

Owing to his exercise of control and supervision over the Municipal Health Office and its personnel, he honestly believed he was entitled to the five percent (5%) <i>honorarium</i> for non-health personnel. In fact, the Commission on Audit (COA) did not even issue a Notice of Disallowance on the release of the subject <i>honorarium</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Lastly, the prosecution failed to adduce evidence that the PhilHealth suffered injury as a result thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The defense formally offered the following exhibits: the Committee Report Re: Administrative Complaint dated April 5, 2017 of Mary Jojie P.

Appellant was then Municipal Mayor of Sibonga, Cebu when he approved and received PI7,512.50 as <i>honorarium</i> despite the fact that he was ineligible to receive it. The Sandiganbayan rejected appellant's defense of good faith and held that his receipt of the <i>honorarium</i> deprived other personnel of the Municipal Health Office of the benefit and caused undue injury to the government.<br><br>Appellant's Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration was denied by Resolution dated July 12, 2019.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><b><center>The Present Appeal</center></b><br>Appellant now seeks affirmative relief from the Court and prays anew for his acquittal. In his Supplemental Brief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> appellant essentially argues:<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, the Sandiganbayan had no jurisdiction over the case. He allegedly caused undue injury to the government in the amount of P17,512.50 which is within jurisdictional threshold of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) under RA 10660.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Too, the summary payroll is unclear as to the date of actual payment which is crucial in determining whether RA 10660 would apply to the present case. At any rate, the assailed decision was based on pure speculation and conjectures.<br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, the Office of the Special Prosecutor failed to prove that he received P17,512.50 because it failed to indicate from which PFPR fund (2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015) appellant's <i>honorarium</i> was sourced. The Obligation Request merely stated that he approved the release of P280,l 87.00 while the summary payroll enumerated its recipients. Approval of the release of payment is not the same as receiving the amount of P17,512.50 in 2015. The Office of the Special Prosecutor likewise failed to prove that he received P17,512.50 in February 2015 since the corresponding disbursement voucher was dated March 2, 2015.<br><br><b><i>Third</i></b>, he never admitted having received P17,512.50 from the PFPR as <i>honorarium</i>. In the Pre-Trial Order dated November 26, 2018, what he admitted on February 2015 he certified the Obligation Request for payment of the PhilHealth <i>honoraria</i>.<br><br><b><i>Fourth</i></b>, he was deprived of his right to due process of law when the Sandiganbayan directed him to submit his memorandum after the termination of the pre-trial. This was clearly an involuntary waiver of his right to present evidence. The Sandiganbayan brushed aside his defense of good faith and decided in such a way that mere presentation of the pertinent documents was sufficient to declare him to have acted with manifest partiality and evident bad faith.<br><br><b><i>Lastly</i></b>, he immediately refunded subject amount upon his receipt of the COA's notice of disallowance.<br><br>On the other hand, the People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Ombudsman-Office of the Special Prosecutor defends the Sandiganbayan's verdict of conviction. In its Supplemental Brief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the People counters:<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>. The Sandiganbayan had jurisdiction since the crime charged was committed before the effectivity of RA 10660. Contrary to appellant's claim that the prosecution failed to prove the exact time he received the <i>honorarium</i>, appellant himself admitted in his memorandum that he received P17,512.50 in February 2015.<br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>. All the elements of the crime of violation of Sec 3(e) of RA 3019 were sufficiently established. Appellant was then Municipal Mayor of Sibonga, Cebu when he, with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence, accepted <i>honoraria</i> from the PhilHealth's Capitation Fund despite the fact that he was not qualified to receive it. His unwarranted receipt thereof caused undue injury to the government.<br><br><b><i>Third</i></b>. Appellant was not deprived of his right to present evidence. The Sandiganbayan merely adhered to the Revised Guidelines for Continuous Trial of Criminal Cases when it narrowed down the issues based on the parties' stipulations during the pre-trial. Thereafter, the Sandiganbayan deemed it proper to simply require the parties to submit their respective memoranda, to which the parties did not object.<br><br><b><i>Lastly</i></b>. Restitution or refund of the <i>honorarium</i> does not exonerate appellant from criminal liability.<br><br><b><center>Threshold Issues</center></b><blockquote>1. Did the Sandiganbayan have jurisdiction over the case?<br>2. Was appellant's right to due process violated?<br>3. Is appellant guilty of violation of Sec 3(e) of RA 3019?</blockquote><b><center>Ruling</center></b><br><b><i>The Sandiganbayan correctly assumed <br>jurisdiction over the case</i></b><br><br>The jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan is outlined in Section 4 of PD 1606, as amended by Section 2 of RA 10660,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. <b><i>Jurisdiction</i></b>. - The Sandiganbayan shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases involving:<br><br>a. Violations of Republic Act <u>No. 3019</u>. as amended, otherwise known as the <u>Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices</u> Act, Republic Act <u>No. 1379</u>, and Chapter II, Section <u>2</u>, Title VII, Book II of the <u>Revised Penal Code</u>, where one or more of the accused are officials occupying the following positions in the government, whether in a permanent, acting or interim capacity, at the time of the commission of the offense:<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>(b) <b>City mayors,</b> vice-mayors, members of the <i>sangguniang panlungsod</i>, city treasurers, assessors, engineers, and other city department heads;<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br><b><i>Provided</i>, That the Regional Trial Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction where the information:</b> (a) does not allege any damage to the government or any bribery; or <b>(b) alleges damage to the government</b> or bribery arising from the same or closely related transactions or acts <b>in an amount not exceeding One million pesos (P1,000,000.00)</b>. (<i>Emphases supplied</i>)</blockquote>Prior to its amendment, Section 4 of PD 1606 did not set a threshold amount of damage or damages allegedly suffered by the government which would vest the Sandiganbayan with jurisdiction over the offense. The amendment was introduced in RA 10660 which took effect on May 5, 2015.<br><br>Generally, the jurisdiction of a court to try a criminal case is determined at the time it was filed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> By way of exception, however, Section 5 of RA 10660 ordains:<br><blockquote><b>SECTION 5. <i>Transitory Provision</i>.</b> - This Act shall apply to all cases pending in the Sandiganbayan over which trial has not begun: <i>Provided</i>, That: <b>(a) Section 2, amending Section 4 of <u>Presidential Decree No. 1606</u>, as amended, on "Jurisdiction";</b> and (b) Section 3, amending Section 5 of Presidential Decree No. 1606, as amended, on "Proceedings, How Conducted; Decision by Majority Vote" <b>shall apply to cases arising from offenses <u>committed after</u> the effectivity of this Act.</b> (<i>Emphases added</i>)</blockquote>Verily, the amended jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan only covers offenses committed only after RA 10660 took effect on May 5, 2015. This has already been settled in <b><i>Ampongan v. Sandiganbayan</i></b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> viz.:<br><blockquote>It is clear from the transitory provision of <u>R.A. No. 10660</u> that the amendment introduced regarding the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan shall apply to cases arising from offenses committed after the effectivity of the law. Consequently, the new paragraph added by <u>R.A. No. 10660</u> to Section 4 of <u>Presidential Decree (P.P.) No. 1606</u>, as amended, transferring the exclusive original jurisdiction to the RTC of cases where the information: (a) does not allege any damage to the government or any bribery; or (b) alleges damage to the government or bribery arising from the same or closely related transactions or acts in an amount not exceeding One million pesos, applies to cases which arose from offenses committed after the effectivity of <u>R.A. No. 10660</u>.</blockquote>Here, the Information charged appellant with violating Section 3(e) of RA 3019 around February 2015. Appellant himself categorically admitted in his memorandum<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> that he received <i>honoraria</i> of P17,512.50 in February 2015. Thus, when the alleged crime was committed, RA 10660 had yet to take effect, hence, the same is inapplicable here.<br><br><b><i>Appellant was afforded his <br>right to due process of law.</i></b><br><br>Too, appellant was afforded his right to due process of law. The following circumstances negate appellant's claim of due process violation:<br><br><b>First</b>, appellant waived his right to question the proceedings before the Sandiganbayan. He did not raise this issue before the court below. In fact, by his own deliberate act, appellant voluntarily waived his right to present evidence. Per the minutes<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of the session held by the Sandiganbayan Fourth Division dated August 31, 2018, the parties manifested they were no longer presenting their respective evidence, thus:<br><blockquote>The parties upon conferring on their joint stipulation of facts manifested that they are ready to submit their joint stipulation/narration of facts, thus the pre-trial was declared terminated without prejudice to the issuance of a Pre-Trial Order by the Court. <b><i>Upon manifestation of the parties that they are no longer presenting their respective evidence,</i></b> the parties were given 15 days, 1) from date for the prosecution to file its offer of exhibits; 2) the defense, from receipt of its copy of the prosecution's offer., to file its comment/opposition thereto, and upon resolution of the prosecution's offer by the Court; 3) for the defense to file its offer of exhibits, and lastly, 4) from receipt of copy, for the prosecution to file its comment or opposition thereto. The parties upon receipt of the Court's resolution on the accused's offer of exhibits were given 30 days within which to file their respective Memorandum. Thereafter, the case will be submitted for decision. By agreement of the parties, the promulgation of judgment was set on FEBRUARY 22, 2019&nbsp; at 1:30 P.M. (<i>Emphases added</i>).</blockquote>At any rate, appellant still was able to formally offer his documentary exhibits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><b>Second</b>, appellant actively participated in the proceedings before the Sandiganbayan as in fact he entered a plea of not guilty, entered into joint stipulation of facts, filed his memorandum, and formally offered his documentary exhibits. <b><i>SSK Parts Corporation v. Camas</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> held that active participation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> in the proceedings <i>a quo</i> are all part and parcel of right to due process. As appellant had all the opportunities to be heard, he may not complain that he was denied due process.<br><br><b>Finally</b>, Section 4, Rule 118 decrees that trial shall be limited to matters not disposed of during the pre-trial:<br><blockquote><b>SECTION 4. <i>Pre-trial Order</i>.</b> - After the pre-trial conference, the court shall issue an order reciting the actions taken, the facts stipulated, and evidence marked. Such order shall bind the parties, <b><i>limit the trial to matters not disposed of</i></b>, and control the course of the action during the trial, unless modified by the court to prevent manifest injustice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (<i>Emphasis supplied</i>)</blockquote>The Revised Guidelines for Continuous Trial of Criminal Cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> ordains that proposals for stipulations shall be done with the active participation of the court itself and shall not be left alone to the counsel. Thus, the Sandiganbayan here endeavored to facilitate a joint stipulation of facts between the prosecution and the defense. As a result, the only remaining question left to be resolved was one of law - whether appellant was entitled to <i>honorarium</i> from the PhilHealth's Capitation Fund.<br><br><b><i>Appellant did not act with manifest <br>partiality, evident bad faith, and or <br>inexcusable negligence when <br>he received the honorarium</i></b><br><br>Appellant was charged with violation of Sec.&nbsp; 3(e) of RA 3019 otherwise known as the <i>Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3. <i>Corrupt practices of public officers. </i>- In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>(<i>e</i>) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.

Sandiganbayan</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> expounded on the different modes of committing the offense penalized under Section 3(e), <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>"<b><i>Partiality</i></b>" is synonymous with "bias" which "excites a disposition to see and report matters as they are wished for rather than as they are." "<b><i>Bad faith</i></b> does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud." "<b><i>Gross negligence</i></b> has been so defined as negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but wilfully and intentionally with a conscious indifference to consequences in so far as other persons may be affected. It is the omission of that care which even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to take on their own property." These definitions prove all too well that the three modes are distinct and different from each other. Proof of the existence of <i>any</i> of these modes in connection with the prohibited acts under Section 3(e) should suffice to warrant conviction. (<i>Emphases supplied</i>).</blockquote>Here, appellant allegedly violated Section 3(e) when he, with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, and/or gross inexcusable negligence, received P17,512.50 from the PhilHealth Capitation Fund as <i>honorarium</i> despite his alleged non-entitlement thereto.<br><br>Section V (G) of PhilHealth Circular No. 010 s. 2012 provides the disposition and allocation of the PhilHealth <i>honoraria</i> as follows:<br><blockquote>2. The remaining twenty percent (20%) shall be exclusively utilized as honoraria of the staff of the PCB facility and for the improvement of their capabilities as would enable them to provide better health services:<br><br>a. Ten percent (10%) for the physician;<br>b. Five percent (5%) for other health professional staff of the facility; and<br>c. <b><i>Five percent&nbsp; (5%) for&nbsp; non-health professionals/staff,</i></b> including volunteers and community members of health teams (e.g., Women's Health Team, Community Health Team). (<i>Emphases added</i>)</blockquote>Hence, five percent (5%) of the total PhilHealth <i>honoraria</i> was allocated to the non - health professionals OR staff of the PCB Provider. As to who these non-health or professionals mentioned, they were not specifically identified. The rule does not expressly indicate whether they need be part of the official roll of employees of the Municipal Health Office.<br><br>Non-health professionals include the rank and file employees or administrative staff of the Municipal Health Office who are not among the front liners providing access to health care. It also covers volunteers and community members of health teams. This led appellant to honestly believed, albeit mistakenly, that the office of the municipal mayor which exercises control and supervision over the Municipal Health Office and its personnel, may likewise be covered by the term "non-health professional." Consequently, he acted in good faith when he received the P17,512.50 honorarium, anchored as it was on the honest belief that he was legally entitled to the benefit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Otherwise stated, appellant did not act in bad faith when he mistakenly interpreted Section V (G) of PhilHealth Circular No. 010 s. 2012.<br><br>At any rate, bad faith <i>per se</i> is not enough for one to be held criminally liable for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019; bad faith must be evident.

It only gave a few examples and left the rest open to interpretation.<br><br>When a law or circular leaves room for interpretation, misinterpretation is inevitable. While learned members of the bench and bar can easily discern that a municipal mayor is not covered by the said provision, an ordinary layman like Bacaltos cannot be faulted for incorrectly interpreting the ambiguous category of "non-health professionals" in the PhilHealth Circular. Even the municipal accountant was not certain how to interpret the subject provision as evidenced by his annotation in the payroll summary. Indeed, as the municipal mayor, Bacaltos is a non-health professional who exercises control and supervision over the Municipal Health Office. If volunteers and community members of health teams are entitled to <i>honoraria</i>, it is not farfetched to believe that a mayor who controls and supervises the operations of the entire Municipal Health Office and its personnel would likewise be considered a non-health professional. In fact, even PhilHealth Regional Vice President Chavez recognized the authority of Bacaltos over the Municipal Health Office when he sent a letter to Bacaltos, prescribing the allocation and distribution of the PFPR. Thus, when Bacaltos included himself in the category of non-health professionals entitled to five percent <i>honoraria</i>, this action cannot be considered as having been done without basis.<br><br>Bacaltos's genuine belief that he was entitled to an <i>honorarium</i> negates <i>dolo</i> or wrongful or malicious intent. To stress, when the accused is alleged to have acted with evident bad faith under Section 3(e) of RA 3019, which is the case here, the crime alleged is a crime of <b><i>dolo</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> - an offense committed with <i>wrongful or malicious intent</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The same cannot be said of Bacaltos who believed in good faith, albeit erroneously, that he was covered by the PhilHealth circular.<br><br><b><i>The element of manifest partiality was absent</i></b><br><br>There is manifest partiality when there is a clear, notorious, or plain inclination or predilection to favor one side or person rather than another. "Partiality" is synonymous with "bias" which "excites a disposition to see and report matters as they are wished for rather than as they are."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> <b><u>Similar to the modality of evident bad faith, mere partiality is not sufficient - the same must be manifest.</u></b><br><br>Here, there is no ground to support a finding that Bacaltos acted with manifest partiality. As discussed, Bacaltos cannot be faulted for misinterpreting the ambiguous provision in the PhilHealth Circular. His interpretation is not entirely baseless as to amount to a deliberate misapplication of the said circular. Furthermore, Bacaltos knew that his entitlement to the <i>honorarium</i> was still contingent on PhilHealth's approval in view of the reservation expressed by the Municipal Accountant with respect to his receipt of the <i>honorarium</i>. <b><u>Thus, even without a Notice of Disallowance from the Commission on Audit (COA), he returned P33,478.12,</u></b><u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></u><b><u> representing all the moneys he received pursuant to the PhilHealth Circular, which amount is P15,965.62 more than the <i>honorarium</i> subject of this case.</u></b> To my mind, these are badges of good faith proving that Bacaltos honestly believed that he was entitled to an <i>honorarium</i>.<br><br>Based on the foregoing, no manifest partiality can be imputed to Bacaltos. When the language of the law or regulation is not clear, as in this case, there is all the more basis to give the accused the benefit of the doubt for his erroneous interpretation and acquit him of the charge for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.<br><br><b><i>The element of gross inexcusable negligence was absent</i></b><br><br>While the Sandiganbayan did not premise its conviction on this ground, it may nonetheless be apropos to discuss this element.<br><br>Neither is the element of gross negligence present in this case. Gross negligence has been defined as negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but willfully and intentionally with a conscious indifference to consequences in so far as other persons may be affected. It is the omission of that care which even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to take on their own property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In <i>Yapyuco v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court stated that "[i]n criminal negligence, the injury caused to another <b><u>should be unintentional</u>, it being the incident of another act performed without malice</b>," and "that a deliberate intent to do an unlawful act is essentially inconsistent with the idea of reckless imprudence"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> which is a form of negligence.<br><br>Bacaltos's act of receiving an <i>honorarium</i> under the mistaken belief that he is entitled thereto is one of <i>dolo</i>, not <i>culpa</i>. He is charged with "willfully, unlawfully, criminally,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> causing undue injury to the government. A crime alleged to be <i>willfully</i> committed is contrary to an act predicated on negligence or <i>culpa</i>. Hence, there could not have been gross inexcusable negligence or <i>culpa</i> in this case.<br><br>To stress, Bacaltos's violation of a provision in a PhilHealth Circular that is not penal in nature, does not, as it should not, <b><i>automatically</i></b> translate into evident bad faith, manifest partiality, or gross inexcusable negligence that makes one guilty of a violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019. For it to amount to a violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 through the modality of evident bad faith, established jurisprudence demands that <b><i>the prosecution must prove the existence of factual circumstances that point to fraudulent intent.</i></b><br><br><b><i>The prosecution was not able to prove beyond <br></i></b></div><div align="JUSTIFY"><b><i>reasonable doubt the element of causing undue <br>injury</i></b><br><br>The element of causing undue injury to the government is likewise absent in the present case.<br><br>RA 3019 was crafted as an anti-graft and corruption measure. The crux of the acts punishable under RA 3019 is corruption. As explained by one of the sponsors of the law, Senator Arturo M. Tolentino, "[w]hile we are trying to penalize, <u>the main idea of the bill is graft and corrupt practices, x x x Well, the idea of graft is the one emphasized</u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Graft entails the acquisition of gain in <i>dishonest</i> ways.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Thus, in charging a public officer of "causing undue injury," it is not enough that damage was actually inflicted in violation of laws, rules, and regulations. The damage must have been effected with <i>corrupt intent, a dishonest design, or some unethical interest.</i> This is in keeping with the purpose of RA 3019, at the heart of which is the concept of graft.<br><br>I realize that this is not the understanding under the current state of jurisprudence. In <i>Guadines v. Sandiganbayan,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Court defined undue injury this way:<br><blockquote>The term "undue injury" in the context of Section 3 (e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act punishing the act of "causing undue injury to any party," has a meaning akin to that civil law concept of "actual damage." The Court said so in <i>Llorente vs. Sandiganbayan</i>, thus:<br><blockquote>In jurisprudence, "undue injury" is consistently interpreted as "actual damage." Undue has been defined as "more than necessary, not proper, [or] illegal;" and injury as "any wrong or damage done to another, either in his person, rights, reputation or property [; that is, the] invasion of any legally protected interest of another." Actual damage, in the context of these definitions, is akin to that in civil law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>Under current jurisprudence, in order to be found guilty of causing undue injury, it is enough that the public officer has inflicted damage to another.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Proof of the extent or quantum of damage is not essential, it being sufficient that the injury suffered or benefit received could be perceived to be substantial enough and not merely negligible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>I respectfully submit that this line of reasoning should no longer be followed.<br><br>The aforementioned understanding of "undue injury" is too broad that every single misstep committed by public officers that result in injury to any party falls under the definition and would thus possibly be criminally punishable. Every error - no matter how minor - would satisfy the fourth element as the threshold is simply that an injury be inflicted on another. For instance, an allowance withheld in good faith based on an interpretation of the law that is subsequently judicially declared incorrect would be sufficient basis for affirming the existence of the fourth element, which may lead to the incarceration of a public officer simply because he misunderstood a provision that is only later on revealed to be clear and unambiguous by members of the bench who are well-versed in principles of statutory construction and the law.<br><br>Granted that the maxims "ignorance of the law excuses no one" and "public office is a public trust" are true, the Court should refrain from interpreting laws without heed to its practical consequences. By maintaining the threshold for the fourth element at the bare minimum of inflicting damage to another, the Court will effectively discourage individuals from joining public service. <b><i><u>It is simply unreasonable to criminally punish every little mistake that incidentally caused damage to another even when these acts were not done with corrupt intent.</u></i></b><br><br>In the instant case, for example, Bacaltos's act of receiving an <i>honorarium</i> was motivated not by any corrupt intent to cause injury to the government or to unduly receive any illegal pecuniary benefit. Based on the evidence, his actuations were simply founded on his honest belief that he was a non-health professional exercising control and supervision over the Municipal Health Office and its personnel, that therefore entitled him to receive an honorarium. Hence, no graft and corruption actually transpired. <b>There was no showing that Bacaltos had fraudulent, much less corrupt, intent to cause damage to the Government. Again, he even returned more than what he actually received.</b><br><br>I reiterate my position in <i>Villarosa v. People</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> that not all violations of a law or regulation are equivalent to evident bad faith, manifest partiality, or gross inexcusable negligence even if they cause undue injury to any party. For <b>an act to fall under Section 3(e) of RA 3019, the same must be done with fraudulent and corrupt intent.</b> Such is the purpose of RA 3019 which this Court is mandated to uphold.<br><br>Based on the foregoing, I vote to ACQUIT accused-appellant Lionel Echavez Bacaltos of the crime of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.<br><br><br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>Emphasis supplied. <i>See</i> Records, p. 188.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>See <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 5-6.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>Records, p. 1.
