Unito (PDEA/FC Unito). The laboratoiy tests confirmed that the seized plastic bags contained methamphetamine hydrochloride or <i>shabu</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b><br><br>Yusop, on the other hand, averred that he claimed the subject package for a certain Nasser Datu Mama who promised to pay him P15,000.00 and vehemently denied any knowledge that the subject package contained <i>shabu</i>.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the RTC</b></center><br>In its Judgment dated February 9, 2012, the RTC found Yusop guilty as charged and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00 for violating Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165. The RTC opined that on account of the urgency of the operation, the PDEA agents were justified in not procuring a search warrant beforehand and that there was probable cause to confront Yusop. Moreover, for the RTC, the prosecution was able to establish that, indeed, Yusop was caught transporting <i>shabu</i> deliberately placed in the picture tube of a television set consigned to the latter through the LBC, and that the identity, integrity, and probative value of the sequestered drugs were preserved and kept intact from the time of confiscation up to its presentation in court pursuant to the chain of custody rule laid down in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the CA</b></center><br>In the herein assailed Decision, the CA denied the appeal and affirmed the judgment of the RTC, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, [w]e <b>DISMISS</b> the appeal.

The CA likewise found Yusop's defense of denial as incredible given the fact that upon confrontation with the PDEA agents, instead of standing his ground like an innocent person, Yusop threw away the subject package and attempted to escape.<br><br>Yusop filed a Motion for Reconsideration but the same was denied in a Resolution dated February 11,2016.<br><br>On July 7, 2016, this Court required<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the parties to submit their respective supplemental briefs; however, they manifested that they would merely adopt their briefs before the CA.<br><br>In his Brief, Yusop essentially argues that the dangerous drugs allegedly seized were inadmissible in evidence for being the fruit of a poisonous tree, and that the crime charged was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the Court</b></center><br>The appeal is partly meritorious.<br><br>The Court finds that while the warrantless arrest was valid, Yusop must nevertheless be acquitted for non-compliance with the three-witness rule laid down in Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165.<br><br><b><i>The warrantless arrest was valid as the<br>PDEA agents had probable cause to<br>believe based on personal knowledge<br>that the person to be arrested has<br>committed an offense i.e. illegal<br>transport of dangerous drugs</i></b><br><br>Generally, and as guaranteed by our Constitution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> an arrest, search or seizure without a warrant issued by a competent judicial authority is invalid. However, there are certain recognized exceptions listed under Section 5, Rule 113 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> viz.:<br><blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>Arrest without warrant; when lawful.</i> — A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top">(a) </td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense;</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(b) </td><td><div align="justify">When an offense has just been committed and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(c) </td><td><div align="justify">When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In the case at bench, both the RTC and the CA concluded that, based on the established facts, the present case falls within paragraph (b) of the above-quoted provision. We agree.<br><br>Jurisprudence<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> tells us that the following must be present for a valid warrantless arrest under paragraph (b): i) an offense has just been committed; and ii) the arresting officer has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it. In <i>Pestilos v. Generoso,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> we said that in connection with Section 5, paragraph (b), Rule 113 of the Rules of Court, the arresting officer's exercise of discretion is limited by the standard of probable cause to be determined from the facts and circumstances within Ms personal knowledge and that the requirement of the existence of probable cause objectifies the reasonableness of the warrantless arrest for purposes of compliance with the Constitutional mandate against unreasonable arrests. Moreover, we enunciated in <i>Vaporoso v. People</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> that the element of personal knowledge must be coupled with the element of immediacy; otherwise, the arrest may be nullified, and resultantly, the items yielded through the search incidental thereto will be rendered inadmissible.<br><br>The evidence on record clearly shows that the police officers had personal knowledge of facts or circumstances upon which they had properly determined probable cause in effecting a warrantless arrest against Yusop. Here, the PDEA agents immediately acted on a tip received from a confidential informant that a substantial amount of <i>shabu</i> will be shipped from Las Pinas to CDO. The details regarding the shipment such as the names of the shipper and consignee, contents of the subject package, and the courier service were all accurate upon verification. The PDEA agents then conducted surveillance operations at the LBC branch where the package will be claimed. The subject package was without a doubt retrieved a day later by Yusop - who acted like a guilty person and attempted to run when confronted by the authorities. The foregoing pieces of information qualify as the PDEA agents' personal observation, perception and evaluation, which are necessarily within their personal knowledge, prompting them to make the warrantless arrest. The Court is, thus, convinced that the PDEA agents had personal knowledge of facts or circumstances justifying Yusop's warrantless arrest.<br><br>Besides, on the procurement of a search warrant, Intelligence Officer 2 Vincent Cecil M. Orcales (IO2 Orcales) testified that:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="5%" valign="top">Q :</td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">Now, before conducting the operation, did it not occur to your mind to secure a search warrant?</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">x x x x </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A :</td><td> <div align="justify">We had a plan to apply for a Search Warrant, [b]ut, because of the exigency and emergency circumstances, we cannot also afford the safety of our agents.

In the past, the Court said that we should not expect too much of an ordinaiy policeman considering that oftentimes, he has no opportunity to make proper investigation but must act in haste on his own belief to prevent the escape of the criminal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Hence, the Court concurs with the common findings of the courts <i>a quo</i> that the PDEA agents were justified in dispensing with the procurement of a warrant due to the exigency, the risks, and the quantity of the dangerous drugs involved in the operation.<br><br><b><i>The search and seizure which followed<br>the warrantless arrest was likewise valid</i></b><br><br>No less than Section 2, Article III of the Constitution mandates that a search and seizure must be carried out through or on the strength of a judicial warrant predicated upon the existence of probable cause, absent which, such search and seizure becomes "unreasonable" within the meaning of said constitutional provision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, warrantless search or seizure is allowed if it is incidental to a lawful arrest and such instance is governed by Section 13, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, which provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 13. <i>Search incident to a lawful arrest.</i> — A person lawfully arrested may be searched for dangerous weapons or anything which may have been used or constitute proof in the commission of an offense without a search warrant.</blockquote>Here, as previously discussed, the warrantless arrest of Yusop was valid. It follows, therefore, that the search and seizure that followed Yusop's arrest which yielded more than one kilogram of <i>shabu</i> was likewise valid and admissible as evidence.<br><br><i><b>Nevertheless, non-compliance with the<br>requirements of Section 21 of</b> R.A. No.<br><b>9165 casts doubt on the integrity of the<br>seized items and suffices as a ground for<br>acquittal based on reasonable doubt.</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Yusop was caught illegally transporting dangerous drugs in 2011. The law applicable then was Section 21, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 before its amendment by RA 10164, and it states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 21. <i>Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment.</i> — The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>(l)The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice [DOJ], and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventoiy and be given a copy thereof.<br><br>(2) Within twenty-four (24) hours upon confiscation/seizure of dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment, the same shall be submitted to the PDEA Forensic Laboratoiy for a qualitative and quantitative examination.<br><br>(3) A certification of the forensic laboratory examination results, which shall be done under oath by the forensic laboratory examiner, shall be issued within twenty-four (24) hours after the receipt of the subject item/s: Provided, That when the volume of the dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, and controlled precursors and essential chemicals does not allow the completion of testing within the time frame, a partial laboratory examination report shall be provisionally issued stating therein the quantities of dangerous daigs still to be examined by the forensic laboratory: <i>Provided, however,</i> That a final certification shall be issued on the completed forensic laboratory examination on the same within the next twenty-four (24) hours.</blockquote>In simpler terms, the prevailing law then requires that: (1) the seized items be inventoried and photographed immediately after seizure or confiscation; and (2) the physical inventoiy and photographing must be done in the presence of <b>(a) the accused or his/her representative or counsel, (b) an elected public official, (c) a representative from the media, and (d) a representative from the DOJ,</b> all of whom shall be requii'ed to sign the copies of the inventoiy and be given a copy of the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In the case of <i>Lescano v.
