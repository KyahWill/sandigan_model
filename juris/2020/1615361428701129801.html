The case proceeded to pre-trial and, thereafter, to joint trial on the merits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> During trial, AAA's direct testimony was stricken off the record<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> for her repeated failure to appear for cross-examination despite due notice. The RTC, in its Decision, therefore <b><u>dismissed the cases involving AAA</u></b> (Criminal Case Nos. 2011-13349-MK to 13353-MK), <b><u>leaving only the cases of BBB</u></b> (Criminal Cases Nos. 2011-13354-MK to 13355-MK) as the subject of the instant appeal. </p><p> <b>Evidence for the Prosecution</b></p><p> The prosecution presented the testimonies of AAA, BBB, CCC (BBB's mother), Police Officer 3 Mark Dennis Sanchez (PO3 Sanchez), and Dr. Bonnie Chua (Dr. Chua), the EPD Crime Laboratory Medico-Legal Officer. </p><p> BBB testified that she was born on February 25, 1998. She was introduced to Lopez by her distant cousin, Ate Rose. She and AAA "stowed away" from home at the time and stayed at Lopez' house in Calumpang, Marikina City, upon the latter's invitation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p><p> On the evening of August 30, 2011, Lopez brought BBB to the McDonald's restaurant beside the Marikina Sports Center. BBB saw Lopez approach a man and speak with him. After their conversation, the man called a taxi. Lopez told BBB to board it and go with the man.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> The taxi brought BBB and the man to the Grand Polo Motel in Masinag, Antipolo City. When they were inside the motel room, BBB was surprised when the man told her they were going to have sex. She initially resisted but the man told her that he had already given her payment to Lopez. Eventually, they had sex and, thereafter, left the motel and went their separate ways. When BBB arrived at Lopez' house, he handed her P1,000.00 without saying anything, and then hurriedly left.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p> On September 9, 2011, Lopez and BBB were again at the same McDonald's restaurant. Lopez told BBB that she would again have sex with another man. BBB told him that she did not want to do it anymore, but he said that it would be a wasted opportunity to make money (<i>sayang daw po iyon</i>). BBB saw Lopez meet with another man who handed him some money. BBB eventually agreed to what Lopez wanted her to do and boarded a taxi with the man to the Grand Polo Motel and had sex. After parting ways, BBB returned to Lopez' house and where he, again, gave her P1,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p> BBB was eventually found by her mother, CCC, in a bar at Fernando Avenue, Barangay Calumpang, Marikina City. After CCC came to know of the sexual incidents after talking to BBB, she promptly reported it to the Barangay Office; AAA was also present at the time. BBB's mother was summoned to the barangay office to discuss the incidents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p><p> PO3 Sanchez, an officer from the Police Community Precinct in Calumpang, Marikina City, testified that at around 3:00 a.m. on September 12, 2011, he received a phone call from the Women's Desk regarding a complaint for trafficking or <i>pambubugaw</i> against Lopez. He and his fellow police officer, PO1 Jayson Mones, as well as some barangay tanods, accompanied AAA, BBB, and their parents to Lopez' residence. When they arrived, AAA and BBB positively identified Lopez and the latter was arrested.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p> Dr. Chua testified that he received a Request for Genital Examination, dated September 12, 2011, from the Marikina City Police Station. He conducted the examination of AAA and BBB and prepared the Initial Medico-Legal Report and Final Medico Legal Report No. R-092-11E for BBB which both resulted in the following conclusion – <i>clear evidence of penetrative trauma/force to the hymen</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p><p> <b>Evidence for the Defense</b></p><p> The defense presented Lopez testimony as its sole evidence. He denied all the allegations against him. </p><p> Lopez alleged that he had just transferred to his residence in Calumpang, Marikina City, around the month of August 2011. He resided in a boarding house with his boyfriend, his boyfriend's older brother Kuya Marlon, and the latter's girlfriend. He worked as a waiter, earning between P500.00 to P1,000.00 a day depending on customers' tips. He also earned extra income of P150.00 to P300.00 per month as a make-up artist. His boyfriend, Aris Aguila (Aris), worked in a family-owned welding shop.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p> Lopez admitted that he knew BBB because they used to be neighbors at Barangay Sto. Niño, Marikina City. He also admitted that he knew AAA because their mothers were friends. However, he denied that the girls stayed in his house in Calumpang, Marikina City, on August 30, 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p><p> He further claimed that BBB lied, having an ill motive against Lopez because she was the ex-girlfriend of Lopez' current boyfriend, Aris. Lopez also denied bringing BBB to McDonald's on August 30, 2011 and September 9, 2011, and making her go with men to the Grand Polo Motel to have sex for a fee. Lopez denied giving BBB P1,000.00 or any money at all. He even said that it would not have been possible to communicate with her because he did not have a cellphone back then.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>The RTC Ruling</b> </p><p> In its Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated September 24,2014, the RTC convicted Lopez for two counts of qualified trafficking in persons against BBB. The dispositive portion reads: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, in <u>Criminal Case No. 2011-13354-MK</u>, the court finds the accused, JOHN PAUL LOPEZ y MAYAO a.k.a. "APPLE,"<strong> GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT</strong> of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 4(e) in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act [No.] 9208. The accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of LIFE IMPRISONMENT and PAY a FINE of Two Million Pesos (Php2,000,000.00). The accused is also ORDERED to [pay] moral damages in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php500,000.00), and exemplary damages in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php100,000.00). </p> <p> In <u>Criminal Case NO. 2011-13355-MK</u>, the court finds the accused, JOHN PAUL LOPEZ y MAYAO a.k.a. "APPLE," <strong>GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT</strong> of Qualified Trafficking in Persons under Section 4(e) in relation to Section 6(a) of Republic Act [No.] 9208. The accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of LIFE IMPRISONMENT and PAY a FINE of Two Million Pesos (Php2,000,000.00). The accused is also ORDERED to pay moral damages in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php500,000.00), and exemplary damages in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (Phpl00,000.00). </p> <p> In <u>Criminal Cases Nos. 2011-13349-MK, 2011-13350-MK, 201113351-MK, 2011-13352-MK, 2011-13353-MK</u>, the accused is hereby <b>ACQUITTED</b>, for insufficiency of evidence. </p> <p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The RTC found BBB's testimony credible and convincing, being unmoved and unshaken by the rigid cross-examination of the prosecution. It held that apart from Lopez' bare claim that his boyfriend was BBB's former boyfriend, he failed to attribute or prove any ill motive on the part of BBB to testify falsely against him. Consequently, Lopez' inherently weak defense of denial could not prevail over BBB's affirmative testimony. </p><p align="center"> <b>The CA Ruling</b> </p><p> In its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated March 30, 2017, the CA affirmed the RTC Ruling with modification by imposing legal interest on the monetary award of damages: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is DENIED. The assailed Decision dated September 24, 2014 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 192, Marikina City, in Criminal Cases Nos. 2011-13354-MK and 201113355-MK, is AFFIRMED with modification in that a six percent (6%) per annum interest is imposed on the monetary awards for damages from finality of this Decision until full satisfaction thereof. </p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The CA affirmed that BBB clearly and credibly testified that Lopez gave her money to have sex with men on two occasions. It likewise disregarded Lopez' additional argument that BBB voluntarily boarded the taxi and went with the men because Section 3(a) of R.A. No. 9208 is explicit that the crime of trafficking in persons can exist even with the victim's consent or knowledge. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Petition</b> </p><p> Lopez timely filed a Notice of Appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated November 27, 2017, the Court ordered the elevation of the records and directed the parties to file supplemental briefs. Both parties, thereafter, manifested that they would no longer file supplemental briefs having exhaustively argued their issues in their respective appeal briefs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p> In his appeal, Lopez claims that: (1) the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt; (2) the court gravely erred in giving foil credence to BBB's testimony who had an ill motive to testify; and (3) the prosecution failed to prove that BBB is a minor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b>Issue</b> </p><p> Whether or not the CA erred in affirming the conviction of Lopez for two counts of qualified trafficking in persons. </p><p align="center"> <b>The Ruling of the Court</b> </p><p> The petition is denied. We affirm the CA ruling convicting Lopez of two counts of qualified trafficking in persons. </p><p> The crime of qualified trafficking in persons against a child is penalized under Section 4(e) in relation to Sections 3(b) and 6(a) of R.A. No. 9208: </p><blockquote> <p> Section 4. <em>Acts of Trafficking in Persons</em>. – It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts: </p> <p> x x x x</p> <p> (e) To maintain or hire a person to engage in prostitution or pornography; x x x</p> <p> Section 6. <em>Qualified Trafficking in Persons</em>. – The following are considered as qualified trafficking: </p> <p> (a) When the trafficked person is a child; </p> <p> Section 3. Definition of Terms. – As used in this Act: </p> <p>x x x x</p> <p> (b) <em>Child</em> - refers to a person below eighteen (18) years of age or one who is over eighteen (18) but is unable to fully take care of or protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition. </p> </blockquote> <p> Based on the foregoing, the elements of the crime of trafficking in persons are the following: </p><blockquote> <p> 1. The <em>act </em>of "<u>recruitment</u>, <u>transportation</u>, transfer or harbouring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders;" </p> <p> 2. The <i>means</i> used which may include "threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another"; and</p> <p> 3. The purpose of trafficking which includes "exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Underscoring supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> The crime is then qualified when the trafficked person is a child below 18 years of age or one over 18 but is unable to fully take care or protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition. </p><p> In this case, We affirm the CA and RTC Decisions that all the elements of qualified trafficking in persons required under R.A. No. 9208 were established. </p><p> The testimony of BBB quoted below shows that Lopez was responsible for recruiting her and facilitating her transportation to engage in prostitution and sexual exploitation with the promise of financial gain: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">PROS.

Lopez facilitated BBB's involvement in the sexual incidents on August 30, 2011 and September 9, 2011. He brought her to McDonald's to meet the male clients on both dates and instructed her to board the taxi and to go with them to the Grand Polo Motel to have sex. Lopez himself negotiated with the male clients to finalize the deal and accepted their payments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p> <p> The second element is also established, that the means used by Lopez involved taking advantage of BBB's vulnerability and enticing her with payments and benefits. In both the August 30, 2011 and September 9, 2011 incidents, Lopez took advantage of BBB's vulnerable state as a minor who had stowed away, and paid her P1,000.00 for each sexual incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></p><p> Notably, it was held in <i>People v. Villanueva</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> that a conviction for qualified trafficking in persons may stand even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the first paragraph of Sec. 3(a) of R.A. No. 9208. If the person trafficked is a child, we may do away with discussions on whether or not the second element was actually proven. It has been recognized that even without the perpetrator's use of coercive, abusive, or deceptive means, a minor's consent is not given out of his or her own free will.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> The third element is present since the purpose of the trafficking was for BBB's prostitution and sexual exploitation. It was clear BBB went with the male client, upon Lopez' instruction, to the Grand Polo Motel to have sex.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p> With all the elements established, the CA correctly affirmed Lopez' conviction for two counts of qualified trafficking in persons. This conviction stands based on the testimonies and positive identification by the victims of minor age. This is further corroborated by the testimonies of other prosecution witnesses and documentary evidence. </p><p> Lopez' bare defense of denial was unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence and cannot prevail over the victims' categorical and consistently positive identification which is not accompanied by ill motive.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> An affirmative testimony is stronger than a negative testimony especially when the former comes from a credible witness. The defenses of alibi and denial, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are inherently weak, self-serving, and undeserving of weight in law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </p><p> This Court also cannot give credence to Lopez' defense that BBB's testimony was allegedly impelled by her ill motive against him. The assessment of the credibility of witnesses lies within the province and competence of trial courts. A trial court judge is in the best position to weigh the testimonies of witnesses in the light of the declarant's demeanor, conduct, and attitude during trial, and is therefore placed in a more competent position to discriminate between truth and falsehood.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Absent any such finding by the trial court or evidence to show that BBB was biased and actuated by improper motive, her testimony should be given full faith and credit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> Thus, this Court finds no reason to overturn the judgment of conviction rendered by the RTC, and affirmed by the CA. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court <b>ADOPTS and AFFIRMS</b> the factual findings and conclusions of law in the Court of Appeals Decision, dated 30 March 2017 in CA-G.R.

Furthermore, for each count, he is <b>ORDERED</b> to pay BBB moral damages in the amount of P500,000.00, and exemplary damages in the amount of P100,000.00. </p><p> All damages awarded shall earn interest at the rate of 6% <i>per annum</i> from the time of finality of this Decision until fully paid. </p><p> <b>SO ORDERED. </b></p><p> <i>Leonen (Chairperson), Gesmundo, Carandang</i>, and <i>Zalameda, JJ.,</i> concur. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="center"> <blockquote> <p align="right"><strong><u><br>February 23, 2021</u></strong></p> </blockquote> <p align="center"><strong> NOTICE OF JUDGMENT</strong></p> <p> Sirs / Mesdames:</p> <p> Please take notice that on <b><u>July 15, 2020</u></b> a Decision, copy attached hereto, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on February 23, 2021 at 1:55 p.m. </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="49%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="51%"><p align="center">Very truly yours,</p> <p align="center"> <strong>(SGD.)
