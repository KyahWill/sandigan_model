Income Tax -- The amounts paid in as dues or fees by members and tenants of a condominium corporation form part of the gross income of the latter subject to income tax. This is because a condominium corporation furnishes its members and tenants with benefits, advantages, and privileges in return for such payments. For tax purposes, the association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges collected by a condominium corporation constitute income payments or compensation for beneficial services it provides to its members and tenants. The previous interpretation that the assessment dues are funds which are merely held in trust by a condominium corporation lacks legal basis and is hereby abandoned. <br><br>Moreover, since a condominium corporation is subject to income tax, income payments made to it are subject to applicable withholding taxes under existing regulations. <br><br>II. Value-Added Tax (VAT) -Association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges collected by a condominium corporation are subject to VAT since they constitute income payment or compensation for the beneficial services it provides to its members and tenants. <br><br>Section 105 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, provides:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 105. Persons Liable. -Any person who, in the course of trade or business, sells, barters, exchanges, leases goods or properties, renders services, and any person who imports goods shall be subject to the value-added tax (VAT) imposed in Sections 106 to 108 of this Code. <br><br>xxx <br><br>The phrase 'in the course of trade or business' means the regular conduct or pursuit of a commercial or an economic activity, including transactions incidental thereto, b<b>y any person regardless of whether or not the person engaged therein is a nonstock, nonprofit private organization (irrespective of the disposition of its net income and whether or not it sells exclusively to members or their guests)</b>, or government entity." (Emphasis supplied) <br></blockquote>The above provision is clear -- even a non-stock, non-profit organization or government entity is liable to pay VAT on the sale of goods or services. This conclusion was affirmed by the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court of Appeals and Commonwealth Management and Services Corporation, G.R. No. 125355, March 30, 2000. In this case, the Supreme Court held:<br><blockquote>"(E)ven a non-stock, non-profit organization or government entity, is liable to pay VAT on the sale of goods or services. VAT is a tax on transactions, imposed at every stage of the distribution process on the sale, barter, exchange of goods or property, and on the performance of services, even in the absence of profit attributable thereto. The term "in the course of trade or business" requires the regular conduct or pursuit of a commercial or an economic activity, regardless of whether or not the entity is profit- oriented. <br><br>The definition of the term "in the course of trade or business" incorporated in the present law applies to all transactions even to those made prior to its enactment. Executive Order No. 273 stated that any person who, in the course of trade or business, sells, barters or exchanges goods and services, was already liable to pay VAT. The present law merely stresses that even a nonstock, nonprofit organization or government entity is liable to pay VAT for the sale of goods and services. <br><br>Section 108 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 defines the phrase "sale of services" as the "performance of all kinds of services for others for a fee, remuneration or consideration. " It includes "the supply of technical advice, assistance or services rendered in connection with technical management or administration of any scientific, industrial or commercial undertaking or project." <br><br>On February 5, 1998, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued BIR Ruling No. 010-98 emphasizing that a domestic corporation that provided technical, research, management and technical assistance to its affiliated companies and received payments on a reimbursemen-of-cost basis, without any intention of realizing profit, was subject to VAT on services rendered. In fact, even if such corporation was organized without any intention of realizing profit, any income or profit generated by the entity in the conduct of its activities was subject to income tax. <br><br>Hence, it is immaterial whether the primary purpose of a corporation indicates that it receives payments for services rendered to its affiliates on a reimbursement-on-cost basis only, without realizing profit, for purposes of determining liability for VAT on services rendered. As long as the entity provides service for a fee, remuneration or consideration, then the service rendered is subject to VAT." <br><br>Accordingly, the gross receipts of condominium corporations including association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges are subject to VAT, income tax and income payments made to it are subject to applicable withholding taxes under existing regulations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><center><br>&nbsp;x x x<br></center><br></blockquote></blockquote><b><i>The First E-Bank's Allegation</i><i>s</i></b><br><br>In its Petition dated December 20, 2012, the First E-Bank essentially alleged: It was a non-stock non-profit condominium corporation. It owned and possessed, through its members, a condominium office building. RMC No. 65-2012 imposed on it two (2) tax liabilities: 1) value-added tax (VAT) of P118,971. 53 to be paid on December 2012 and every month thereafter; and b) income tax ofP665,904.12 to be paid on or before April 15, 2013 and every year thereafter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <br><br>RMC No. 65-2012 burdened the owners of the condominium units with income tax and VAT on their own money which they exclusively used for the maintenance and preservation of the building and its premises. RMC No. 65-2012 was oppressive and confiscatory because it required condominium unit owners to produce additional amounts for the thirty-two percent (32%) income tax and twelve percent (12%) VAT.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <br><br>Through the Makati Commercial Estate Association, Inc., it sent a Letter dated December 5, 2012 to the BIR Commissioner requesting deferment of RMC No. 65-2012. A Letter dated December 19, 2012 was likewise sent to Makati City Revenue District Officer Ricardo B. Espiritu informing him of the continuous judicial consignation of the income tax and VAT payments due under RMC No. 65-2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <br><br> <i><b>The BIR et al .'s Comments</b></i><br><br>Under Comment dated February 11, 2013, the BIR and RDO Espiritu through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) riposted that declaratory relief was no longer proper here considering that RMC No. 65-2012 already took effect on October 31, 2012. The alleged injury which the First E-Bank sought to prevent had already arisen as of that date.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <br><br>By its separate comment,* the BIR's Litigation Division argued that the petition should be dismissed for violation of the principle of primary jurisdiction. Several condominium corporations had already referred the issue to the BIR Law Division for further clarification. Ultimately, only the Secretary of Finance had primary jurisdiction over the issue raised here. Too, a petition for declaratory relief will not prosper if the questioned statute had already been breached, as in this case. RMC No. 65-2012 was only a clarificatory issuance on pertinent laws, specifically the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC). It was merely a restatement of the BIR's prevailing position on the issue of taxation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <br><br> <i><b>The First E-Bank's Reply</b></i><br><br>The First E-Bank replied that judicial consignation of its tax payments under protest was necessary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <br><br><center><br><b> The Trial Court's Ruling</b></center><br>By Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated September 5, 2013, the trial court ruled that the First E-Bank correctly resorted to a petition for declaratory relief for the purpose of invalidating RMC No. 65-2012. On this score, the trial court declared as invalid RMC No. 65-2012 for it purportedly expanded the law, created an additional tax burden on condominium corporations, and was issued without the requisite notice and hearing, thus:<br><blockquote>As to the validity of the Memorandum Circular issued, it is respondent's contention that it merely clarified and was simply issued to restate and clarify the prevailing position and ruling of the BIR. It was a mere interpretation of an existing law which has already been in effect and which was not set to be amended. However, the same appears to be not true as it goes beyond its objective to clarify the existing statute. The assailed Revenue Memorandum Circular not merely interpreted or clarified the existing BIR Ruling but in fact legislated or introduced a new legislation under the mantle of its quasi-legislative authority. The BIR Commissioner, under the guise of clarifying income tax on association dues, made Revenue Memorandum Circular effective immediately. In so doing, the passage contravenes the constitutional mandate of due process of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><center><br>&nbsp;x x x<br></center><br>The above cited portion of the Memorandum Circular failed to show what particular law it clarified. Instead it shows that it merely departed from the several rulings of the Bureau exempting from income tax the assessments/charges collected by condominium corporations from its members, on the ground that the collection of association dues and other assessments/charges are merely held in trust to be used solely for administrative expenses in implementing its purpose. The new circular in effect made its own legislation abandoning the previous rulings of the BIR which became the practice of the condominium corporations including herein petitioner. The Revenue Circular changed and departed from the long standing ruling of the BIR that association dues and other fees and charges collected from members are tax exempt. In so doing, it abruptly charges from taxpayer an imposition which was then not existing, and worse made it immediately effective which is prejudicial to the rights of the petitioner. It did not merely interpret or clarify but changed altogether the long standing rules of the Bureau of Internal revenue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><center><br>&nbsp;x x x </center><br>Moreover, it is already the common business practice of petitioner that the association dues, membership fees and the like are not included as part of its income and therefore of the VAT. The advent of the Memorandum Circular 65-2012 issued by the Commissioner changes the tax liability of petitioner in the sense that it is now subject to tax. It created a new tax burden upon petitioner. Petitioner then could not be faulted to consign judicially as they claim, the [VAT) amount pending resolution of the petition for declaratory relief herein filed. Respondent BIR Commissioner should have accorded petitioner the opportunity to be heard, which was the bone of contention of the letter sent to the Honorable Commissioner which was not acted upon. <br><br>The Revenue Memorandum Circular did not only clarify an existing law, but changes its import and interpretation that in so doing it prejudices the right of the petitioner as a tax payer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><center><br>&nbsp;x x x</center> <br>Since the BIR in passing the subject memorandum circular failed to accord respondent or those similarly situated as a tax payer due notice and opportunity to be heard, before issuing said circular it is this court's opinion that the issuance was arbitrarily and in violation of the due process clause of the constitution. The respondent in imposing additional tax burden on petitioner violated the latter's constitutional right to due notice and hearing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center>&nbsp;x x x </center><br>In another vein, the trial court noted the absence of proof that the First E-Bank actually made a judicial consignation of its purported tax payments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The BIR et al. moved for reconsideration. It argued that the petition was premature, RMC No. 65-2012 was valid, and the petition for declaratory relief should be dismissed for violating the principle of primary jurisdiction. For its part, the First E-Bank moved for partial reconsideration, praying that the consignated funds be released.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <br><br>By Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated December 18,2013, the trial court denied the parties' respective motions for reconsideration. It reiterated that the First E-Bank properly resorted to a petition for declaratory relief for the purpose of invalidating RMC No. 65-2012. It also noted that the First E-Bank appeared to have judicially consignated the funds only on November 17, 2013, following the resolution of the case on September 5, 2013. For sure, this judicial consignation, which was belatedly done, cannot justify a modification of the aforesaid resolution. The trial court, nonetheless, pronounced that the First E-Bank was not precluded from filing the proper motion to withdraw the consignated amounts upon the finality of the ruling on the validity of RMC <br>65-2012. <br><br><div align="center"><b> The Proceedings before the Court of Appeals</b><br></div><br>Aggrieved, both parties appealed to the Court of Appeals. On one hand, the BIR et al. challenged the trial court's ruling insofar as it: a) decreed that the First E-Bank correctly availed of the petition for declaratory relief when it sought to nullify RMC No. 65-2012; and b) declared the same as invalid. On the other hand, the First E-Bank assailed the trial court's ruling insofar as it declined to order the release of the judicially consignated amounts. <br><center><br><b> The Court of Appeals' Dispositions</b><br></center><br>By its first assailed Resolution dated June 26, 2014, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal of the First E-Bank and the joint appeal of the BIR et al. on ground of lack of jurisdiction. It emphasized that jurisdiction over the case was exclusively vested in the Court of Tax Appeals since the trial court's impugned resolution involved a tax matter. <br><br>Both the First E-Bank and the BIR et al., moved for reconsideration. They commonly asserted that the Court of Appeals had appellate jurisdiction over their respective appeals emanating from a petition for declaratory relief which sought to invalidate RMC No. 65-2012.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> <br><br>By its second assailed Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated November 27, 2014, the Court of Appeals denied the motions for reconsideration and stressed anew that the Court of Tax Appeals had exclusive jurisdiction over the appeals. <br><br><div align="center"><b> The Present Petitions</b><br></div><br>In G.R. No. 218924, the First E-Bank initiated, on alleged ground of grave abuse of discretion, a Special Civil Action for Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> to nullify the assailed dispositions of the Court of Appeals. According to the First E-Bank, the Court of Appeals, not the Court of Tax Appeals, has jurisdiction over its appeal since the subject matter of the case is not local tax or taxes <i>per se</i> but a petition to declare as invalid RMC No. 65-2012. The Court of Appeals purportedly based its rulings on conjectures and surmises, not on established facts and law. <br><br>In G.R. No. 215801,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the BIR et al. availed ofRu1e 45 of the Revised Rules of Court.

Who may file petition. Any person interested under a deed, will, contract or other written instrument, or whose rights are affected by a statute, executive order or regulation, ordinance, or any other governmental regulation may, before breach or violation thereof bring an action in the appropriate Regional Trial Court to determine any question of construction or validity arising, and for a declaration of his rights or duties, thereunder. <br><br>Declaratory relief requires the following elements: (1) the subject matter of the controversy must be a deed, will, contract or other written instrument, statute, executive order or regulation, or ordinance; (2) the terms of said documents and the validity thereof are doubtful and require judicial construction; (3) there must have been no breach of the documents in question; (4) there must be an actual justiciable controversy or the "ripening seeds" of one between persons whose interests are adverse; (5) the issue must be ripe for judicial determination; and (6) adequate relief is not available through other means or other forms of action or proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <br><br>The Court rules that certiorari or prohibition, not declaratory relief, is the proper remedy to assail the validity or constitutionality of executive issuances. <i> <b>DOTR v. PPSTA</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> is apropos:<br><blockquote><b><center>The Petition for Declaratory Relief is not the proper remedy </center></b><br>One of the requisites for an action for declaratory relief is that it must be filed before any breach or violation of an obligation. Section 1, Rule <br>63 of the Rules of Court states, thus: <br><center><br>&nbsp;x x x<br></center><br><b>Thus, there is no actual case involved in a Petition for Declaratory Relief . It cannot, therefore, be the proper vehicle to invoke the judicial review powers to declare a statute unconstitutional. </b><br><br>It is elementary that before this Court can rule on a constitutional issue, there must first be a justiciable controversy. A justiciable controversy refers to an existing case or controversy that is appropriate or ripe for judicial determination, not one that is conjectural or merely anticipatory. As We emphasized in Angara v. Electoral Commission, any attempt at abstraction could only lead to dialectics and barren legal questions and to sterile conclusions unrelated to actualities. <br><br><b>To question the constitutionality of the subject issuances, respondents should have invoked the expanded certiorari jurisdiction under Section 1 of Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution . The adverted section defines judicial power as the power not only "to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable," but also "to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government."</b> <br><br>There is a grave abuse of discretion when there is patent violation of the Constitution, the law, or existing jurisprudence. On this score, it has been ruled that "the remedies of certiorari and prohibition are necessarily broader in scope and reach, and the writ of certiorari or prohibition may be issued to correct errors of jurisdiction committed not only by a tribunal, corporation, board or officer exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, but also to set right, undo[,] and restrain any act of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any branch or instrumentality of the Government, even if the latter does not exercise judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions." <b>Thus, petitions for certiorari and prohibition are the proper remedies where an action of the legislative branch is seriously alleged to have infringed the Constitution</b>. (Emphasis supplied &nbsp;<br></blockquote>In <i><b>Diaz v. The Secretary of Finance, et al</b></i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court, nonetheless, held that a petition for declaratory relief may be treated as one for prohibition if the case has far-reaching implications and raises questions that need to be resolved for the public good; or if the assailed act or acts of executive officials are alleged to have usurped legislative authority, thus:<br><blockquote>On August 24, 2010 the Court issued a resolution, treating the petition as one for prohibition rather than one for declaratory relief, the characterization that petitioners Diaz and Timbol gave their action. The government has sought reconsideration of the Court's resolution, however, arguing that petitioners' allegations clearly made out a case for declaratory relief: an action over which the Court has no original jurisdiction. The government adds, moreover, that the petition does not meet the requirements of Rule 65 for actions for prohibition since the BIR did not exercise judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial functions when it sought to impose VAT on toll fees. Besides, petitioners Diaz and Timbo !has a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law against the BIR action in the form of an appeal to the Secretary of Finance. <br><br><b>But there are precedents for treating a petition for declaratory relief as one for prohibition if the case has far-reaching implications and raises questions that need to be resolved for the public good. The Court has also held that a petition for prohibition is a proper remedy to prohibit or nullify acts of executive officials that amount to usurpation of legislative authority.</b> <br><br>Here, the imposition of VAT on toll fees has far-reaching implications. Its imposition would impact, not only on the more than half a million motorists who use the tollways everyday, but more so on the government's effort to raise revenue for funding various projects and for reducing budgetary deficits. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Here, RMC No. 65-2012 has far-reaching ramifications among condominium corporations which have proliferated throughout the country. For numerous Filipino families, professionals, and students have, for quite sometime now, opted for condominium living as their new way of life. The matter of whether indeed the contributions of unit owners solely intended for maintenance and upkeep of the common areas of the condominium building are taxable is imbued with public interest. Suffice it to state that taxes, being the lifeblood of the government, occupy a high place in the hierarchy of State priorities, hence, all questions pertaining to their validity must be promptly addressed with the least procedural obstruction. <br><br>Notably, the issue at hand has already pended for six (6) years now, first with the trial court, then with the Court of Appeals, and now with this Court. Hence, to forestall any further delay, instead of remanding the cases to the Court of Appeals, we here and now write <i> finis </i> to these cases once and for all, Diaz&nbsp; enunciated:<br><blockquote>To dismiss the petition and resolve the issues later, after the challenged VAT has been imposed, could cause more mischief both to the tax-paying public and the government. A belated declaration of nullity of the BIR action would make any attempt to refund to the motorists what they paid an administrative nightmare with no solution. Consequently, it is not only the right, but the duty of the Court to take cognizance of and resolve the issues that the petition raises. <br><br>Although the petition does not strictly comply with the requirements of Rule 65, the Court has ample power to waive such technical requirements when the legal questions to be resolved are of great importance to the public. The same may be said of the requirement of <i> locus standi </i> which is a mere procedural requisite.<br></blockquote><br><b> <u>G.R. No. 218924</u></b><br><br>The First E-Bank faults the Court of Appeals with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when the latter dismissed the former's appeal from the trial court's Resolution dated September 5, 2013 and Order dated December 18, 2013. <br><br>A petition for certiorari is proper where the impugned dispositions, as in this case, are tainted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess ofjurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> More so where a petition for review on certiorari does not appear to be a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy to address the First E­ Bank's urgent concerns on its accumulated supposed tax liabilities which will never get halted until the validity of RMC No. 65-2012 is finally resolved, and considerations of public welfare and public policy compel the speedy resolution of the cases through the extraordinary remedy of certiorari. <br><br>The Court, in some instances, allowed a petition for certiorari to prosper notwithstanding the availability of appeal. <i><b>Mallari v. Banco Filipino Savings &amp; Mortgage Bank</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; enumerates these instances, <i> viz.:</i><br><blockquote>Indeed, the Court in some instances has allowed a petition for certiorari to prosper notwithstanding the availability of an appeal, such as, (a) when public welfare and the advancement of public policy dictate it; (b) when the broader interest of justice so requires; (c) when the writs issued are null; and (d) when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority. <br></blockquote>So must it be. <br><br><b> <u>G.R.

The determination of whether a specific rule or set of rules issued by an administrative agency contravenes the law or the constitution is within the jurisdiction of the regular courts. Indeed, the Constitution vests the power of judicial review or the power to declare a law, treaty, international or executive agreement, presidential decree, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation in the courts, including the regional trial courts</b>. This is within the scope of judicial power, which includes the authority of the courts to determine in an appropriate action the validity of the acts of the political departments. Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. (Emphasis supplied )<br></blockquote><br>The prevailing <i>dictum </i> then was only regular courts had jurisdiction to pass upon the constitutionality or validity of tax laws and regulations. <br><br>On February 4, 2014, the Court <i>en bane </i>recognized that the Court of Tax Appeals possessed all such implied, inherent, and incidental powers necessary to the full and effective exercise of its appellate jurisdiction over tax cases. <i><b>City of Manila v. Judge Grecia-Cuerdo</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; is relevant, thus:<br><blockquote>A grant of appellate jurisdiction implies that there is included in it the power necessary to exercise it effectively, to make all orders that will preserve the subject of the action, and to give effect to the final determination of the appeal. It carries with it the power to protect that jurisdiction and to make the decisions of the court thereunder effective. The court, in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, has authority to control all auxiliary and incidental matters necessary to the efficient and proper exercise of that jurisdiction. For this purpose, it may, when necessary, prohibit or restrain the performance of any act which might interfere with the proper exercise of its rightful jurisdiction in cases pending before it. <br><br>Lastly, it would not be amiss to point out that a court which is endowed with a particular jurisdiction should have powers which are necessary to enable it to act effectively within such jurisdiction. These should be regarded as powers which are inherent in its jurisdiction and the court must possess them in order to enforce its rules of practice and to suppress any abuses of its process and to defeat any attempted thwarting of such process. <br><br><b>In this regard, Section 1 of RA 9282 states that the CTA shall be of the same level as the CA and shall possess all the inherent powers of a court of justice. <br><br>Indeed, courts possess certain inherent powers which may be said to be implied from a general grant of jurisdiction, in addition to those expressly conferred on them. These inherent powers are such powers as are necessary for the ordinary and efficient exercise of jurisdiction; or are essential to the existence, dignity and functions of the courts, as well as to the due administration of justice; or are directly appropriate, convenient and suitable to the execution of their granted powers; and include the power to maintain the court's jurisdiction and render it effective in behalf of the litigants. <br><br>Thus, this Court has held that "while a court may be expressly granted the incidental powers necessary to effectuate its jurisdiction, a grant of jurisdiction, in the absence of prohibitive legislation, implies the necessary and usual incidental powers essential to effectuate it, and, subject to existing laws and constitutional provisions, every regularly constituted court has power to do all things that are reasonably necessary for the administration of justice within the scope of its jurisdiction and for the enforcement of its judgments and mandates." Hence, demands, matters or questions ancillary or incidental to, or growing out of, the main action, and coming within the above principles, may be tal{en cognizance of by the court and determined, since such jurisdiction is in aid of its authority over the principal matter, even though the court may thus be called on to consider and decide matters which, as original causes of action, would not be within its cognizance.</b> (Emphasis supplied) <br></blockquote><br>Consequently, the Court held that the authority of the Court of Tax Appeals to take cognizance of petitions for certiorari against interlocutory orders of the RTC in local tax cases was deemed included in the authority or jurisdiction granted it by law. <br><br>The Court underscored that the grant of appellate jurisdiction to the Court of Tax Appeals included such power necessary to exercise it effectively. Besides, a split-jurisdiction between the Court of Tax Appeals and the Court of Appeals is anathema to the orderly administration of justice. <i>"The Court cannot accept that such was the legislative motive, especially considering that the law expressly confers on the CTA, the tribunal with the specialized competence over tax and tariff matters, the role of judicial review over local tax cases without mention of any other court that may exercise such power."</i> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>On August 16, 2016, in <i><b>Banco de Oro v.

Tax rulings, on the other hand, are official positions of the Bureau on inquiries of taxpayers who request clarification on certain provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code, other tax laws, or their implementing regulations. Hence, the determination of the validity of these issuances clearly falls within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals under Section 7 (1) of Republic Act No. 1125, as amended, subject to prior review by the Secretary of Finance, as required under Republic Act No. 8424.

Even though the Corporation is empowered to levy assessments or dues from the unit owners, these amounts collected are not intended for the incurrence of profit by the Corporation or its members, but to shoulder the multitude of necessary expenses that arise from the maintenance of the Condominium Project. Just as much is confirmed by Section 1, Article V of the Amended By-Laws, which enumerate the particular expenses to be defrayed by the regular assessments collected from the unit owners. These would include the salaries of the employees of the Corporation, and the cost of maintenance and ordinary repairs of the common areas. </b><br><br>The City Treasurer nonetheless contends that the collection of these assessments and dues are "with the end view of getting fu11 appreciative living values" for the condominium units, and as a result, profit is obtained once these units are sold at higher prices. The Court cites with approval the two counterpoints raised by the Court of Appeals in rejecting this contention. First, if any profit is obtained by the sale of the units, it accrues not to the corporation but to the unit owner. Second, if the unit owner does obtain profit from the sale of the corporation, the owner is already required to pay capital gains tax on the appreciated value of the condominium unit. <br><br>Moreover, the logic on this point of the City Treasurer is baffling. By this rationale, every Makati City car owner may be considered as being engaged in business, since the repairs or improvements on the car may be deemed oriented towards appreciating the value of the car upon resale. <b>There is an evident distinction between persons who spend on repairs and improvements on their personal and real property for the purpose of increasing its resale value, and those who defray such expenses for the purpose of preserving the property. The vast majority of persons fall under the second category, and it would be highly specious to subject these persons to local business taxes .The profit motive in such cases is hardly the driving factor behind such improvements, if it were contemplated at all. Any profit that would be derived under such circumstances would merely be incidental, if not accidental. </b><br><br>Besides, we shudder at the thought of upholding tax liability on the basis of the standard of "full appreciative living values," a phrase that defies statutory explication, commonsensical meaning, the English language, or even definition from Google." Full appreciative living values" is nothing but blather in search of meaning, and to impose a tax hinged on that standard is both arbitrary and oppressive. <br><center><br>&nbsp;x x x </center><br><b>Again, whatever capacity the Corporation may have pursuant to its power to exercise acts of ownership over personal and real property is limited by its stated corporate purposes, which are by themselves further limited by the Condominium Act .A condominium corporation, while enjoying such powers of ownership, is prohibited by law from transacting its properties for the purpose of gainful profit</b>.

A discussion on the nature of a condominium corporation is, indubitably, in order. <br><br>The creation of the condominium corporation is sanctioned by Republic Act No. 4726 (RA 4726 )<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (The Condominium Act). Under the law, a condominium is an interest in real property consisting of a separate interest in a unit in a residential, industrial or commercial building and an undivided interest in common, directly or indirectly, in the land on which it is located and in other common areas of the building. To enable the orderly administration over these common areas which the unit owners jointly own, RA 4726 permits the creation of a condominium corporation for the purpose of holding title to the common areas. The unit owners shall in proportion to the appurtenant interests of their respective units automatically be members or shareholders of the condominium corporation to the exclusion of others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <br><br>Sections 10 and 22 of RA 4726 focus on the non-profit purpose of a condominium corporation. Under Section 10,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the corporate purposes of a condominium corporation are limited to holding the common areas, either in ownership or any other interest in real property recognized by law; management of the project; and to such other purposes necessary, incidental, or convenient to the accomplishment of these purposes. Additionally, Section 10 prohibits the articles of incorporation or by-laws of the condominium corporation from containing any provisions contrary to the provisions of RA 4726, the enabling or master deed, or the declaration of restrictions of the condominium project.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> <br><br>Also, under Section 22,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the condominium corporation, as the management body, may only act for the benefit of the condominium owners in disposing tangible and intangible personal property by sale or otherwise in proportion to the condominium owners' respective interests in the common areas. <br><br>Further, Section 9<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> allows a condominium corporation to provide for the means by which it should be managed. Specifically, it authorizes a condominium corporation to collect association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges for: a) maintenance of insurance policies; b) maintenance, utility, gardening and other services benefiting the common areas, for the employment of personnel necessary for the operation of the building, and legal, accounting and other professional and technical services; c) purchase of materials, supplies and the like needed by the common areas; d) reconstruction of any portion or portions of any damage to or destruction of the project; and e) reasonable assessments to meet authorized expenditures. <br><br>In fine, the collection of association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges is purely for the benefit of the condominium owners. It is a necessary incident to the purpose to effectively oversee, maintain, or even improve the common areas of the condominium as well as its governance. <br><br>As held in <b><i> Yamane</i></b><i> "[t]he profit motive in such cases is hardly the driving factor behind such improvements,&nbsp; if&nbsp; it were contemplated at all. Any profit that would be derived under such circumstances would merely be incidental, if&nbsp; not accidental." </i> More, a condominium corporation is especially formed for the purpose of holding title to the common area and exists only for the benefit of the condominium owners. Nothing more. <br><br>RMC No. 65-2012, sharply departs from <b><i> Yamane</i></b>&nbsp; and the law on condominium corporations. It invalidly declares that the amounts paid as dues or fees by members and tenants of a condominium corporation form part of the gross income of the latter, thus, subject to income tax, value-added tax, and withholding tax. The reason given --- a condominium corporation furnishes its members and tenants with benefits, advantages, and privileges in return for such payments, consequently, these payments constitute taxable income or compensation for beneficial services it provides to its members and tenants, hence, subject to income tax, value-added tax, and withholding tax. <br><br>We cannot agree. <br><br><b> <table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="5%" valign="TOP"><div align="CENTER"><b>b)</b></div></td> <td width="95%" valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges are not subject to income tax, value-added tax and withholding tax</b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></b><br><b><i>First.</i></b>&nbsp; Capital is a fund or property existing at one distinct point in time while income denotes a flow of wealth during a definite period of time.

They represent funds "held in trust" by these clubs to defray their operating and general costs and hence, only constitute infusion of capital.</b> <br><br>Case law provides that in order to constitute "income," there must be realized "gain." Clearly, because of the nature of membership fees and assessment dues as funds inherently dedicated for the maintenance, preservation, and upkeep of the clubs' general operations and facilities, nothing is to be gained from their collection. This stands in contrast to the tees received by recreational clubs coming from their income-generating facilities, such as bars, restaurants, and food concessionaires, or from income-generating activities, like the renting out of sports equipment, services, and other accommodations: In these latter examples, regardless of the purpose of the fees' eventual use, gain is already realized fi:om the moment they are collected because capital maintenance, preservation. or upkeep is not their pre-determined purpose. As such, recreational clubs are generally free to use these fees for whatever purpose they desire and thus, considered as unencumbered "fruits" coming from a business transaction. <br><br><b>Further, given these recreational clubs' non-profit nature, membership fees and assessment dues cannot be considered as funds that would represent these clubs' interest or profit from any investment. In fact, these fees are paid by the clubs' members without any expectation of any yield or gain (unlil{e in stock subscriptions), but only for the above-stated purposes and in order to retain their membership therein. <br><br>In fine, for as long as these membership fees, assessment dues, and the like are treated as collections by recreational clubs from their members as an inherent consequence of their membership, and are, by nature, intended for the maintenance, preservation, and upkeep of the clubs' general operations and facilities, then these fees cannot be classified as "the income of recreational clubs from whatever source" that are "subject to income tax. Instead, they only form part of capital from which no income tax may be collected or imposed.</b> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Similarly, therefore, assocmtwn dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges are not subject to income tax because they do not constitute profit or gain.

Association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges form part of a pool from which a condominium corporation must draw funds in order to bear the costs for maintenance, repair, improvement, reconstruction expenses and other administrative expenses. <br><br>Indisputably, the nature and purpose of a condominium corporation negates the <i> carte blanche </i> application of our value-added tax provisions on its transactions and activities. <i>CIR v. Magsaysay Lines, Inc.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> stated:<br><blockquote>Yet VAT is not a singular-minded tax on every transactional level. Its assessment bears direct relevance to the taxpayer's role or link in the production chain. Hence, as affirmed by Section 99 of the Tax Code and its subsequent incarnations, <b>the tax is levied only on the sale, barter or exchange of goods or services by persons who engage in such activities, in the course of trade or business. These transactions outside the course of trade or business may invariably contribute to the production chain, but they do so only as a matter of accident or incident. As the sales of goods or services do not occur within the course of trade or business, the providers of such goods or services would hardly, if at all, have the opportunity to appropriately credit any VAT liability as against their own accumulated VAT collections since the accumulation of output VAT arises in the first place only through the ordinary course of trade or business</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Too, <i> <b>ANPC</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> held that membership fees, assessment dues, and the like collected by recreational clubs are not subject to value-added tax <i> "because in collecting such fees, the club is not selling its service to the members. Conversely, the members are not buying services from the club when dues are</i><i> paid; hence, there is no economic or commercial activity to speak of as these dues are devoted for the operations/maintenance of the facilities of the organization. As such, there could be no 'sale, barter or exchange o.f goods or properties, or sale of a service' to speak of, which would then be subject to VAT under the 1997 NIRC." </i> This principle equally applies to condominium corporations which are similarly situated with recreational clubs insofar as membership fees, assessment dues, and other fees of similar nature collected from condominium owners are devoted to the operations and maintenance of the facilities of the condominium. In sum, RMC No. 65-2012 illegally imposes value-added tax on association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges collected and received by condominium corporations. <br><br> <b><i>Third</i></b>.&nbsp; The withholding tax system was devised for three (3) primary reasons, i.e. --- (1) to provide taxpayers a convenient manner to meet their probable income tax liability; (2) to ensure the collection of income tax which can otherwise be lost or substantially reduced through failure to file the corresponding returns; and (3) to improve the government's cash flow. This results in administrative savings, prompt and efficient collection of taxes, prevention of delinquencies and reduction of governmental effort to collect taxes through more complicated means and remedies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; Succinctly put, withholding tax is intended to facilitate the collection of income tax. And if there is no income tax, withholding tax cannot be collected. <br><br>Section 57 of RA 8424 directs that only income, be it active or passive, earned by a payor-corporation can be subject to withholding tax, <i> viz.</i> : <br><br>Section 57. Withholding of Tax at Source.-<br><blockquote>(A) Withholding of Final Tax on Certain Incomes.- Subject to rules and regulations the Secretary of Finance may promulgate, upon the recommendation of the Commissioner, requiring the filing of income tax return by certain income payees, the tax imposed or prescribed by Sections 24(8)(1), 24(8)(2), 24(C), 24(D)(l); 25(A)(2), 25(A)(3), 25(8), 25(C), 25(D), 25(E), 27(D)(l), 27(D)(2), 27(D)(3), 27(D)(5), 28 (A)(4), 28(A)(5), 28(A)(7)(a), 28(A)(7)( b), 28(A)(7) (c), 28(8)(1), 28(8)(2), 28(8)(3), 28(8)(4), 28(B)(5)(a), 28(B)(5)(b), 28(B)(5)(c); 33; and 282 of this Code on specified items of income shall be withheld by payor-corporation and/or person and paid in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as provided in Section 58 ofthis Code. <br><br>(B) Withholding of Creditable Tax at Source.- The Secretary ofFinance may, upon the recommendation of the Commissioner, require the withholding of a tax on the items of income payable to natural or juridical persons, residing in the Philippines, by payor-corporation/persons as provided for by law, at the rate of not less than one percent (l%) but not more than thirty-two percent (32%) thereof, which shall be credited against the income tax liability of the taxpayer for the taxable year. <br><center><br>&nbsp;x x x<br></center><br></blockquote>Although Section 57 (B) was later amended by the TRAIN Law, it still decrees that the withholding of tax covers only the income payable to natural or juridical persons, thus: <br><br><blockquote>Sec. 57. Withholding ofTax at Source.-<br></blockquote><blockquote>(A) x x-<br><br>(B) Withholding of Creditable Tax at Source. - The Secretary of Finance may, upon the recommendation of the Commissioner, require the withholding of a tax on the items of income payable to natural or juridical persons, residing in the Philippines, by payor-corporation/persons as provided for by law, at the rate of not less than one percent (1%) but not more than thirty-two percent (32%) thereof, which shall be credited against the income tax liability of the taxpayer for the taxable year: Provided, That, beginning January 1, 2019, the rate of withholding shall not be less than one percent (1%) but not more than fifteen percent (15%) of the income payment. <br><br><div align="center">&nbsp;x x x </div></blockquote><br><b><i> Yamane</i></b>&nbsp; aptly stated <i> "[e]ven though the Corporation is empowered to levy assessments or dues from the unit owners, these amounts collected are not intended for the incurrence of profit by the Corporation or its members, but to shoulder the multitude of necessary expenses that arise from the maintenance of the Condominium Project. </i> " <br><br><b><i> Fourth.</i></b>&nbsp; Section 4 of RA 8424 empowers the BIR Commissioner to interpret tax laws and to decide tax cases: <br><blockquote><br>SEC. 4. Power of the Commissioner to Interpret Tax Laws and to Decide Tax Cases- The power to interpret the provisions of this Code and other tax laws shall be under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Commissioner, subject to review by the Secretary of Finance. <br><br>The power to decide disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under this Code or other laws or portions thereof administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue is vested in the Commissioner, subject to the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Tax Appeals.<br></blockquote>But the BIR Commissioner cannot, in the exercise of such power, issue administrative rulings or circulars inconsistent with the law to be implemented. Administrative issuances must not override, supplant, or modify the law, they must remain consistent with the law intended to carry out. Surely, courts will not countenance administrative issuances that override, instead of remaining consistent and in harmony with the law they seek to apply and implement .<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> <br><br>As shown, the BIR Commissioner expanded or modified the law when she declared that association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges are subject to income tax, value-added tax, and withholding tax. In doing so, she committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. As to what constitutes 'grave abuse of discretion' and when a government branch, agency, or instrumentality is deemed to have committed it, <i> <b>Kilusang Mayo Uno v. Aquino III</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> instructs:<br><blockquote>Grave abuse of discretion denotes a "capricious, arbitrary[,] and whimsical exercise of power. The abuse of discretion must be patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, as not to act at all in contemplation of law, or where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or hostility." <br><br>Any act of a government branch, agency, or instrumentality that violates a statute or a treaty is grave abuse of discretion. However, <b>grave abuse of discretion pertains to acts of discretion exercised in areas outside an agency's granted authority and, thus, abusing the power granted to it</b>. Moreover, it is the agency's exercise of its power that is examined and adjudged, not whether its application of the law is correct. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In sum, the BIR Commissioner is empowered to interpret our tax laws but not expand or alter them. In the case ofRMC No. 65-2012, however, the BIR Commissioner went beyond, if not, gravely abused such authority. <br><br><b><i> If&nbsp; proper,&nbsp; the First E-Bank may<br>recover the consignated amounts, <br>through a separate action or <br>proceeding</i></b><br><br>The general rule is that a void law or administrative act cannot be the source of legal rights or duties. Article 7 of the Civil Code enunciates this general rule, as well as its exception: <i>"Laws are repealed only by subsequent ones, and their violation or non-observance shall not be excused by disuse, or custom or practice to the contrary. When the courts declared a law to be inconsistent with the Constitution, the former shall be void and the latter shall govern.
