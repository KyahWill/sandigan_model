Sanchez (Dr. Sanchez). The prosecution also presented rebuttal evidence wherein they presented two more witnesses, namely: Estrellita A. Laguimin and Maria Concepcion B. Alawaddin. As could be gathered from the RTC Decision, the relevant testimonies could be summarized, as follows: </p><p> On October 17, 2004, at around 7:00 p.m., Crisanto was at home watching television<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> when he heard his cousin, Lorico, shouting. He immediately went outside to see what was happening. He saw Lorico outside of 190-D 21st Avenue, Barangay East Rembo, Makati City engaged in a heated verbal exchange with a man,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> later identified to be Apolinario.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> He then approached Lorico to pacify him. But as soon as he approached, three drunk persons, who appear to be Apolinario's companions, blocked his path.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Apolinario then went up his house, apparently to get his gun. While inside his house, the man was being pacified by his wife, later identified to be PO2 Jessica T. Bayle (Jessica). However, Jessica's efforts failed as Apolinario went down again.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> Meanwhile, Ricardo was watching television inside his house when one of his sons, Reynaldo Lampa (Reynaldo), called him out and told him that his other son, Lorico, was outside having an altercation with Apolinario.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thus, Ricardo went outside to look for Lorico. Outside, Ricardo was beside Lorico when he noticed Apolinario descending from the stairs. Apolinario stopped at the middle of the stairs and pointed his gun at Crisanto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Scared, Crisanto ran away, but Apolinario still shot him hitting him at the left side of his back. Immediately after, Apolinario shot Lorico hitting the latter at his upper left chest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> After shooting Lorico, Apolinario poked his gun at Ricardo and told him "<i>ikaw, gusto mo sumunod?</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Thereafter, Jessica descended from the stairs and told Apolinario to get inside their house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p> Ricardo then shouted for help and sought the assistance of the people nearby.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Ricardo, Daniel, and a certain Neil Garlan carried Lorico beside the road.

The defense presented eight witnesses, namely: Apolinario himself, his wife Jessica, Loreto P. Flores (Loreto), Redentor M. Orpiano (Redentor), Lolita delos Reyes (Lolita), Dr. Ma. Cristina B. Freyra<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (Dr. Freyra), Dr. Sanchez, and Police Senior Inspector Armin A. Guerrero (PSI Guerrero). As could be gleaned from the RTC Decision, the defense's version of the incident could be summarized, as follows: </p><p> On September 20, 2004, Apolinario and Jessica, both police officers, rented from Redentor an apartment unit located at the second floor of 190-D 21st Avenue, East Rembo, Makati City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> At that time, Jessica was almost eight months pregnant, as in fact, she gave birth on November 15, 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> On October 17, 2004, they were at the rented un it together with two friends, Loreto and one Benjamin Reinedo (Benjamin).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Meanwhile, there was a party at the compound owned by the Lampas, which was located in front of their apartment, apparently to celebrate a baptismal and also because of the arrival of a certain <i>balikbayan</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> There were also men having a drinking spree inside the Lampa compound.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><p> Inside the apartment, Apolinario and their friends were chatting and laughing while waiting for Jessica's brother Christopher Tupas (Christopher),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> when Lorico shouted outside of their apartment uttering the following: "<i>mga walang hiya kayo, ang yayabang ninyo, kabago-bago pa lang ninyo dito ang iingay ninyo, pagpapatayin ko kaya kayo diyan</i>." Apolinario retorted with a curse. Jessica then tried to pacify her husband.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> A few minutes later, however, someone from the Lampa compound shouted again and hurled curses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Jessica then went to the door and told the man who was shouting "<i>pasensya na po, bukas na natin pag-usapan kung ano man yan</i>." As Jessica was about to close the door, however, the door swung open causing her to fall down with her nose hitting the floor. Then, Crisanto and a certain Allan Lampa (Allan), both armed with bladed weapons, entered the house. Crisanto attacked Jessica, but Apolinario jumped over him,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> while Allan attacked Benjamin and Loreto. Benjamin was grappling with Allan for the knife while Loreto was repeatedly kicking Allan. Because of the kicks, Allan fell down the stairs together with Benjamin who did not let go of the knife.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p> Meanwhile, Crisanto and Apolinario wrestled with each other, the former even injuring the latter's neck when the tip of the knife grazed his neck.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> However, Apolinario was able to successfully free himself from Crisanto and even disarmed him. Apolinario then proceeded to their room to get his gun. Crisanto tried to follow Apolinario, but Jessica grabbed and took hold of his leg. At that moment, Apolinario came out of their room and saw Crisanto strangling his wife. Thus, Apolinario shot Crisanto to prevent further danger to the lives of his wife and unborn child.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> After getting shot, Crisanto fled. Apolinario tried to stop him, but Crisanto was able to jump out of the door, going out of the house and running past Loreto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Apolinario then tried to help Jessica, but before she could even stand up, Lorico, armed with a knife, came running towards them, shouting and with eyes blazing. Apolinario shouted "<i>tigil, pulis ako,</i>" but Lorico did not stop, prompting Apolinario to shoot him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Jessica recounted that Lorico was shot when the latter was one step away from the door;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> while Apolinario recalled that he shot Lorico when the latter was already two arm's-length from them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> After being hit, Lorico fell down from the stairs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> After that, Christopher arrived and pleaded to Jessica to let him in.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> After letting her brother inside, Jessica closed the door of their apartment before going with Apolinario and Redentor inside the latter's own apartment downstairs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Benjamin and Loreto were already at Redentor's apartment when they came in.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> A few minutes later, several policemen arrived. Apolinario and Jessica peacefully went with the policemen to the police precinct.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Afterwards, as Jessica's nose was bleeding and due to the injury sustained by Apolinario, the police officers brought them to the Ospital ng Makati.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></p><p> Dr. Freyra testified that she was the medico-legal officer who conducted the autopsy on Lorico's cadaver.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Her findings were recorded in the Anatomical Sketch<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> and Medico-Legal Report No. M-399-04 dated October 17, 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> She testified that the bullet which caused Lorico's death entered the left infra lobecular region which is the left side of the body just below the collarbone, while the bullet was recovered at the vertebra region at the back or at the center of the body at the back of the spinal cord.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Dr. Freyra further confirmed that the bullet that killed Lorico traveled in a downward trajectory. She clarified, however, that there are two possibilities for this downward trajectory: either the assailant was positioned on a higher ground than the victim, or they are on the same level, but the victim was stooping down or that the upper part of his body was slightly bending.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> </p><p> Dr. Sanchez, who was also presented as an expert witness for the prosecution, testified that Apolinario and Jessica have also been examined at the Ospital ng Makati on October 17, 2004,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> and that the findings on them have been reduced to writing in separate Medico-Legal Reports which she prepared.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Dr. Sanchez testified that based on hospital records, Apolinario suffered abrasions on his neck and right hand, which may have been caused by a blunt or sharp object.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> On the other hand, Jessica suffered contusion or hematoma at the bridge of her nose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></p><p> In further support of the claim that there was unlawful aggression on the part of Lorico and Crisanto, the defense also presented photographs showing the injuries sustained by Apolinario on his neck and hands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> They also attached photographs of the apartment where the incident happened. The photographs showed an outdoor seven-step concrete staircase leading to the apartment rented by the Bayles, with the seventh step directly connected to the unit's doorway.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the RTC</b> </p><p> In its Decision dated September 30, 2008, the RTC found Apolinario guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of Homicide, for the killing of Lorico, and Frustrated Homicide, for the injuries sustained by Crisanto. The trial court stressed that whenever the justifying circumstance of self-defense is invoked, the burden of evidence shifts to the accused to show that the killing was legally justified. The trial court ruled that Apolinario failed to establish the elements of self-defense. </p><p> With respect to Crisanto, the trial court opined that while he was the aggressor in the beginning, his aggression towards Apolinario ceased to exist when he turned his attention towards Jessica. Thus, self-defense could not be appreciated. The trial court also continued that while Jessica may have been exposed to danger, the same was not life-threatening. It reasoned that Crisanto's shift of attention to Jessica, no matter how brief, could have given Apolinario an opportunity to deliberate on what action to take.</p><p> Likewise, the trial court ruled that no justifying circumstance attended the killing of Lorico. It emphasized that unlawful aggression, as an element of self-defense, is not merely a threatening or intimidating attitude. It held that while Lorico may have been rash, bold and visibly irate when he barged into the unit of the Bayles armed with a knife, there was no imminent danger on their lives or limbs especially considering that, as police officers, a firearm was available in their dwelling for their defense. The dispositive portion of the decision reads: </p><blockquote> WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused PO1 Apolinario Bayle GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Homicide in Criminal Case No. 04-3391 and he is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate prison term of eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>Prision Mayor</i> as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <i>Reclusion Temporal</i>, as maximum. He is likewise ordered to pay the heirs of the victim Lorico Lampa the sum of Php 50,000.00 as civil indemnity <i>ex-delicto</i> and loss of earning capacity in the sum of Six Million Forty-nine Thousand Eight Hundred Seventy-two Pesos (Php6,049,872.00), and to pay the costs.<p> Judgment is likewise rendered in Criminal Case No. 04-3392 finding accused PO1 Apolinario Bayle GUILTY of the crime of Frustrated Homicide and he is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate prison term of six (6) months and one (1) day of [<i>Prision Correccional</i>] as minimum, to six (6) years and one (1) day of [<i>Prision Mayor</i>] as maximum. He is likewise ordered to indemnify Crisanto Lozano the sum of Thirty-nine thousand Six Hundred Forty Pesos (Php 39,640.00) representing actual damages, and to pay the costs. </p><p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> </p></blockquote> Apolinario moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the RTC in its Order dated February 24, 2009.<p> Aggrieved, Apolinario elevated an appeal to the CA. </p><p align="center"> <b>Ruling of the CA</b> </p><p> In its Decision dated June 14, 2013, the CA affirmed the conviction of Apolinario. The appellate court ruled that there was no unlawful aggression on the part of Crisanto. It noted that Apolinario only sustained scratches on his neck and hands which, according to Dr. Sanchez, may have been caused by contact with a rough surface. The appellate court found these scratches to be inconclusive to support the existence of a struggle between Apolinario and Crisanto. It also noted that the allegation of strangulation by Crisanto was not supported by physical evidence considering that the defense failed to show that Jessica sustained injuries on her throat or inside her mouth. It further pointed out that the defense failed to present in evidence the knife allegedly used by Crisanto in his unlawful assault. For the appellate court, without the presentation of the said weapon, the claim of self-defense could not be believed. </p><p> The appellate court likewise ruled that Apolinario shot Lorico without the attendance of any justifying circumstance. It stated that Apolinario's claim that Lorico attempted to stab him and his wife from the stairs is highly unbelievable considering the difficulty of mounting such an attack considering the steepness and narrowness of the stairs. The appellate court emphasized that based on the medical findings, the bullet which killed Lorico struck him at his shoulder and to the middle of his back trajecting "<i>posteriorwards, downwards and medialwards</i>." According to the appellate court, this only shows that Lorico was shot at a very steep angle and the person who shot him was standing on a much higher ground, which is consistent with the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. It also pointed out the apparent inconsistencies between the physical evidence and the testimonies of the defense witnesses. The appellate court also stated that it was highly unlikely for the victims to deliberately attack Apolinario and Jessica considering the fact that the spouses are police officers who are necessarily armed with service pistols. It opined that no person in his right mind would deliberately create an altercation with them. The dispositive portion of the decision states: </p><blockquote> WHEREFORE, the instant Appeal is hereby DISMISSED. The assailed Decision of the Regional Trial Court dated 30 September 2008 is hereby AFFIRMED<i> in toto</i>. <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> </p></blockquote> Apolinario moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the CA in its Resolution dated January 22, 2014. <p> Hence, this petition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>The Issue</b> </p><blockquote> <p> WHETHER THE TRIAL AND [THE] APPELLATE COURTS ERRED WHEN THEY RULED THAT PETITIONER APOLINARIO BAYLE FAILED TO ESTABLISH THE EXISTENCE OF THE JUSTIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES OF SELF-DEFENSE AND DEFENSE OF A RELATIVE. </p> </blockquote> <p align="center"> <b>The Court's Ruling</b> </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>The version of the defense was more consistent with the evidence.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>It is settled that findings of facts and assessment of credibility of witnesses are matters best left to the trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> As such, it is also the trial court which could best address the issue of the determination of the identity of the unlawful aggressor considering that it is also a factual matter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> While the trial court adjudged Apolinario guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the criminal charges against him, the trial court nevertheless considered the defense's version of the incident to be more believable. </p><p> In its September 30, 2008 Decision, the trial court has this to say, thus: </p><blockquote> It is clear from the foregoing that at the time the accused saw his wife Jessica being strangled by Crisanto, the attention of the latter was focused on what he was doing at that precise moment. There was no showing that Crisanto was armed all the time; neither was there a showing that while strangling Jessica, the former was still armed. In fact, accused admitted having grabbed the knife from Crisanto. While Crisanto was inceptually the aggressor, the aggression against the accused ceased to exist when the former turned his ire to Jessica. Aggression, if not continuous, does not constitute aggression warranting self-defense. Also, this momentary shift of attention to Jessica could have given the accused also an opportunity, no matter how brief, to deliberate on what action to take. While his wife was certainly exposed to danger at that point, the danger, to a certain extent, was not life-threatening. And certainly, there was no immediate or imminent danger to the person of the accused at that precise point by reason of Crisanto's momentary focus on Jessica. And more, Crisanto was shot at the left side of his back; which only indicates that the latter at that point was no longer the aggressor of the accused. Shooting Crisanto with a .45 caliber revolver firearm at a considerably close distance, even on the stretched assumption that there was indeed unlawful aggression on his part does not satisfy the requirement of "reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel that unlawful aggression." <p> x x x The Court takes note that the accused recounted that Lorico came fast ascending the stairs with his eyes blazing ("<i>nanlilisik</i>" ) with a knife in hand. The deceased allegedly shouted "ahhhhhhh ..." and still rushed towards the accused and his wife despite warning from the accused. This Court opines that even if the deceased at that point was poised to inflict a deadly blow, the accused could still have repelled him in a manner that may not cost his (Lorico's) life, "such as disabling the latter by shooting his arm or leg." After all, the accused was, and still is, a policeman who from his own account, was trained in the handling and firing of a firearm.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> </p></blockquote> A thorough review of the records of the case gives more light on why the trial court found the version of the defense more credible. The records of the case confirm that the findings of facts by the trial court are sufficiently supported by the evidence and testimonies presented by the defense. <p> The testimonies of the defense witnesses are consistent with the physical evidence. The Court observes that Apolinario, Jessica, and Loreto all testified that as Jessica was closing the door of their apartment unit, two men suddenly forced the door open hitting her and slamming her nose to the floor in the process. That Jessica sustained injuries on her nose was confirmed by the Medico-Legal Report which was prepared by Dr. Sanchez based on the records of the Ospital ng Makati. Moreover, Apolinario and Jessica testified that the former wrestled with Crisanto for the possession of a knife. During the struggle, Crisanto was able to injure Apolinario's neck with the tip of the knife. Again, that Apolinario sustained injury on his neck is supported by the Medico-Legal Report which was prepared by Dr. Sanchez based on the records of the Ospital ng Makati. </p><p> During her cross-examination when she was presented as an expert witness for the defense, Dr. Sanchez even corrected the prosecution when the latter tried to imply that Apolinario's abrasions on the neck and hand were caused only by a blunt object, thus: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

It must be recalled that in the prosecution's version of the incident, there was no such physical confrontation. According to the prosecution, Apolinario shot Crisanto and then Lorico after a heated verbal exchange. This version, however, fails to explain how Apolinario, Jessica, and Crisanto sustained their respective wounds. </p> <p> Considering that the trial court discussed only the defense's version of the incident in its final analysis of the facts of the case, and considering further that the version of the defense is more consistent with the physical evidence presented in court, the Court opines that what was upheld by the trial court was indeed the defense's version of the facts. </p><p> Nevertheless, the CA, in its June 14, 2013 Decision, casted doubt on the narration of the incident by the defense. It declared that the claim that Crisanto attacked them with a knife is seriously doubtful. It noted that while Apolinario claimed that he was able to disarm Crisanto, the knife allegedly used by the latter was not presented in evidence. The appellate court also belittled the wounds on the neck and hands of Apolinario stating that such injuries were only scratches which are insufficient to prove that he was subjected to any unlawful aggression. </p><p> It also observed that the defense's claim that Lorico, armed with a knife, attempted to attack Apolinario and Jessica from the stairs was highly unbelievable due to the difficulty of mounting such attack. It stressed that the physical evidence shows that Apolinario was on a much higher ground when he shot Lorico. Lastly, the appellate court claimed that it was highly unlikely that the victims could have deliberately attacked the Bayles in their apartment unit considering that they were police officers who are often armed with pistols. </p><p> The Court opines that the submissions made by the appellate court did not necessarily destroy the credibility of the evidence presented by the defense. </p><p> <i>First</i>, the case of <i>Rugas v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> the authority cited by the appellate court when it ruled that Apolinario should have presented the knives allegedly used by Crisanto and Lorico, should not be strictly applied in this case. The failure of the accused in <i>Rugas</i> to present the knife allegedly used by the victim in his unlawful aggression was only one of the considerations which impelled the Court to rule for his conviction. It must be noted that in <i>Rugas</i>, the accused failed to offer sufficient corroborating evidence in support of his factual proposition. It must further be noted that in the same case, the accused did not allege nor show proof that he suffered any injury as a result of the victim's unlawful aggression. More importantly, in the said case, the trial court found that the accused was indeed the unlawful aggressor.</p><p> The same could not be said in this case. As already stated, the defense's testimonial evidence and the physical evidence from both the prosecution and the defense sufficiently established the presence of a physical confrontation between Apolinario and Jessica, and Crisanto. Again, that Apolinario was subjected to an attack with a knife has been sufficiently shown by the Medico-Legal Report prepared by Dr. Sanchez and the photographs of his injuries. Moreover, the trial court itself recognized the unlawful aggression by Crisanto, although it ruled that such aggression ceased. </p><p> <i>Second</i>, the appellate court's statement that the injuries sustained by Apolinario were "only scratches" contradicts the evidence presented. Indeed, the Medico-Legal Report prepared by Dr. Sanchez noted that the injuries sustained by Apolinario were abrasions, which term could be synonymous to scratches. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that Dr. Sanchez clarified and was consistent in her testimony that these abrasions may have been caused not only by a blunt object, but also by a sharp object. Thus, it is possible that a knife caused Apolinario's injuries.</p><p> <i>Third</i>, while the CA is correct that it may be difficult for a person to mount an attack from the stairs, it is not impossible. This is especially true in this case which involves a staircase consisting of seven steps only. Further, the fact that the bullet which killed Lorico had a downward trajectory is not inconsistent with the theory of the defense. It must be recalled that Jessica testified that Lorico was one step away from their door when Apolinario shot him. On the other hand, Apolinario testified that Lorico was then at a distance of two arm's-length from them when he pulled the trigger. Taking these testimonies into consideration together with the photograph of the staircase and the apartment unit, it is safe to conclude that Lorico, at the time he was shot, was at the sixth step of the subject staircase. This is definitely at a lower level from the floor of the apartment unit which directly adjoins the seventh step of the staircase. Again, this is still consistent with the physical evidence of the prosecution. </p><p> <i>Lastly</i>, the CA's statement that it was highly unlikely for the victims to attack the Bayles as they were police officers is obviously fallacious. Police officers are definitely not immune from the felonious acts of the vile elements of society. Furthermore, it has not been shown that the Lampas knew the Bayles to be police officers at the time of the incident. In fact, Ricardo testified that they were not aware that the Bayles were police officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> </p><p> From the foregoing, the Court reiterates that although it convicted Apolinario, the trial court appears to have adopted the defense's version of the incident as its factual findings, which findings have not been sufficiently contradicted by the appellate court. As such, the said findings subsist. Thus, the Court will determine the presence or absence of the justifying circumstances claimed by Apolinario on the basis of such findings by the trial court. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>The defense was able to show that Apolinario acted in self-defense and in defense of a relative.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>It is settled that to prove the justifying circumstance of self-defense, the accused must establish the following requisites, to wit: (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it, and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person claiming self-defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Similarly, to prove defense of a relative, the following requisites must concur, namely: (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the aggression; and (3) in case the provocation was given by the person attacked, that the person making the defense took no part in the provocation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> </p><p> As already stated, the Court is convinced that the defense was able to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, the requisites of self-defense and defense of a relative. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>The justifying circumstance of defense of a relative was present when Apolinario shot Crisanto.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The Court holds that the requisites for the justifying circumstance of defense of a relative were present when Apolinario shot Crisanto. </p><p> There was unlawful aggression on the part of Crisanto without any provocation on the part of Jessica. Unlawful aggression is an actual physical assault, or at least a threat to inflict real imminent injury, upon a person.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> In this case, unlawful aggression was present when Crisanto was strangling Jessica — there was an actual physical assault by Crisanto against Jessica. </p><p> As already pointed above, this fact has been recognized by the trial court in its decision, albeit with a different conclusion, thus: </p><blockquote> <b>It is clear from the foregoing that at the time the accused saw his wife Jessica being strangled by Crisanto</b>, the attention of the latter was focused on what he was doing at that precise moment. x x x <b>While Crisanto was inceptually the aggressor, the aggression against the accused ceased to exist when the former turned his ire to Jessica. x x x Also, this momentary shift of attention to Jessica could have given the accused also an opportunity, no matter how brief, to deliberate on what action to take</b>. While his wife was certainly exposed to danger at that point, the danger, to a certain extent, was not life-threatening. And certainly, there was no immediate or imminent danger to the person of the accused at that precise point by reason of Crisanto's momentary focus on Jessica.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> (Emphases supplied) </blockquote> At this juncture, the Court expresses its dismay on how the trial court did not consider that Apolinario was acting in defense of his wife, or that there was clearly an aggression against Jessica at that time. It must be readily observed that the trial court only discussed how there was no longer any aggression against Apolinario; there was no discussion whatsoever on the presence or absence of the circumstance of defense of a relative. Despite recognition that Crisanto strangled Jessica and that she was exposed to danger, the trial court merely dismissed the same and even contradicted itself when it stated that the strangling exposed Jessica to danger, but the danger was "not life-threatening" to "a certain extent." Perhaps the trial court was not aware that preventing a person from breathing by blocking or restricting air from flowing into the lungs through the throat could be fatal to any person. It must also be considered that Jessica was eight months pregnant at that time which would make her condition even more delicate. In any case, it is clear that there was clear and imminent danger to Jessica and the child in her womb due to Crisanto's unlawful aggression. <p> Further, the means employed by Apolinario to repel Crisanto's unlawful aggression against Jessica was reasonably necessary. </p><p> It is settled that reasonable necessity does not mean absolute necessity. It is not the indispensable need, but the rational necessity which the law requires.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Thus, reasonable necessity is satisfied when the one making the defense or repelling the attack used the weapon available to him, even if the said weapon is technically disproportionate to the weapon of the unlawful aggressor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> </p><p> Here, Apolinario already had his service pistol in his hand when he saw his wife being strangled! by Crisanto. The gun, therefore, was already available to him at that time, and he could use it to repel the danger to his wife and unborn child, as he did. It was instinct which impelled Apolinario to fire his gun in order to save his wife and to prevent further harm to their unborn child. Thus, Apolinario could not be faulted when he failed to consider other means to ward off Crisanto's assault. </p><table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody><tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>The justifying circumstance of self-defense and defense of a relative were present when Apolinario shot Lorico. </i></b></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> The Court also rules that the requisites of the justifying circumstances of self-defense and defense of a relative were present in the killing of Lorico. </p><p> Unlawful aggression is present, not only when there is actual physical assault, but also when there is a threat to inflict real imminent injury. In case of threat, it must be offensive and strong, positively showing the wrongful intent to cause injury.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup></p><p> In this case, there was unlawful aggression when Lorico, knife in hand, with eyes blazing, and shouting, rushed towards Apolinario and Jessica. It must be stressed that Lorico's threat to inflict harm came just moments after Apolinario was able to repel Crisanto's unlawful aggression. In fact, Jessica was then still lying on the floor and was in no position to defend herself from further unlawful assault. Thus, when Lorico appeared and was about to attack them, even ignoring his command to stop his advance, Apolinario had no reason to believe that the former was only threatening them. To his mind, the threat posed by Lorico is real and serious and he had to act swiftly in order to repel it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Clearly, there was unlawful aggression on the part of Lorico. </p><p> Likewise, contrary to the position of the trial court, Apolinario, in shooting Lorico, did not exceed the necessary force to repel the former's attack. </p><p> The determination of whether the accused exceeded the reasonable necessity of the means employed to repel unlawful aggression depends on various factors such as the nature and quality of the weapons used, the physical condition and size of the aggressor and the person defending himself, as well as other circumstances surrounding the particular case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> The means employed by the person invoking self-defense contemplates a rational equivalence between the means of attack and the defense. This is a matter that depends on the circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup></p><p> It must be reiterated that Apolinario and Jessica have just been through a life-threatening situation when Lorico suddenly appeared and was ready to deliver fatal blows. Jessica was in no condition to defend herself. As such, it was up to Apolinario to fend off the sudden aggression. Again, the weapon which was available to Apolinario at that time was his service pistol. In such a scenario, to insist that Apolinario could have disabled Lorico by shooting the latter's arm or leg would certainly be excessive. Such suggestion would entail for Apolinario to shoot with accuracy and good concentration, which the Court does not believe he was capable to or was in condition to do at that time. In any case, Apolinario declared that he was a police officer and ordered Lorico to stop, yet the latter still proceeded with his assault. </p><p> Lastly, there was no sufficient provocation on the part of Apolinario. It has been held that provocation is sufficient when it is proportionate to the aggression, that is, adequate enough to impel one to attack the person claiming self-defense.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Apolinario admitted that he cursed back at Lorico. Nevertheless, the Court is not convinced that such curses are sufficient enough for Lorico and Crisanto to invade a home and harm the people therein. Apolinario's expletives may have been offensive, but it certainly could not be considered a sufficient inducement for its recipient to act violently and attack with bladed weapons. </p><p> In any case, it must be stressed that the defense is not required to prove, with absolute certainty, the facts constituting its defense. The accused is required only to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, the justifying circumstances he has invoked.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Clear and convincing evidence has been described as more than mere preponderance, but the proof required is less than that required of proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> In this regard, the Court holds that the defense was able to demonstrate that Apolinario acted in defense of a relative when he shot Crisanto. He also acted in self-defense and defense of a relative when he shot Lorico, which unfortunately resulted in the latter's death. </p><p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the present Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is <b>GRANTED</b>.

The <i>ponencia </i>correctly ruled that the defense was able to establish the existence of the justifying circumstances of self-defense and defense of a relative.</p> <p> <b><i>Brief review of the facts</i></b> </p> <p> On September 20, 2004, there was a party at the compound owned by the Lampas, which was located in front of the apartment of Apolinario. There were also men having a drinking spree inside the Lampa compound. </p> <p> Meanwhile, Apolinario and his wife, PO2 Jessica T. Bayle (Jessica) were chatting and laughing with their friends inside their apartment while waiting for Jessica's brother, Christopher Tupas (Christopher) when Lorico R. Lampa (Lorico) shouted from outside of their apartment uttering the following:"<i>mga walang hiya kayo, ang yayabang ninyo, kabagobago pa lang ninyo dito ang iingay ninyo, pagpapatayin ko kaya kayo diyan</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Apolinario retorted with a curse.

Jessica then opened the door and told the man who was shouting, "<i>pasensya na po, bukas na lang natin pag-usapan kung ano man yan</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> As Jessica was about to close the door, the door swung open causing her to fall down with her nose hitting the floor. Then, Crisanto L. Lozano (Crisanto) and Allan Lampa (Allan), both armed with bladed weapons, entered the house. Crisanto attacked Jessica, but Apolinario jumped over Crisanto, while Allan attacked Benjamin Reinedo (Benjamin) and Loreto Flores (Loreto). Crisanto and Apolinario wrestled with each other. However, Apolinario was able to successfully free himself from Crisanto and even disarmed him. Apolinario then proceeded to their bedroom to get his gun. Crisanto tried to follow Apolinario, but Jessica grabbed and took hold of Crisanto's leg. At that moment, Apolinario came out of their room and saw Crisanto strangling his wife. Thus, Apolinario shot Crisanto to prevent further danger to the lives of his pregnant wife and unborn child. After getting shot, Crisanto fled. Apolinario tried to stop him, but Crisanto was able to jump out of the door, going out of the house and running past Loreto. Apolinario then tried to help Jessica, but before she could even stand up, Lorico, armed with a knife, came running towards them, shouting and with eyes blazing. Apolinario shouted, "<i>tigil pulis ako</i>,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> but Lorico did not stop, prompting Apolinario to shoot him. Jessica recounted that Lorico was shot when the latter was one step away from the door, while Apolinario recalled that he shot Lorico when the latter was already two arm's length from them. After being hit, Lorico fell down from the stairs. </p> <p> The Regional Trial Court (RTC) and Court of Appeals (CA) found Apolinario guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of Homicide and Frustrated Homicide. The RTC and CA held that the defense was not able to prove the elements of self-defense and defense of a relative. </p> <p> The <i>ponencia</i> now rules that Apolinario should be acquitted of the crimes charged. </p> <p> I concur with the <em>ponencia</em>. </p> <table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>All the elements of the justifying circumstance of defense of a relative were proven by the defense in the shooting of Crisanto.</i></b> </div></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>For defense of a relative to prosper, the following requisites must concur, namely: (1) unlawful aggression by the victim; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the aggression; and (3) in case the provocation was given by the person attacked, that the person making the defense took no part in the provocation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p> <p> I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that all of the abovementioned requisites for defense of a relative were present in the shooting of Crisanto by Apolinario. </p> <p> <i>First</i>, there was unlawful aggression by the victim, Crisanto. Unlawful aggression is equivalent to assault or at least threatened assault of an immediate and imminent kind.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> There is unlawful aggression when the peril to one's life, limb or right is either actual or imminent. There must be actual physical force or actual use of weapon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In the instant case, it cannot be denied that Crisanto's act of strangling Jessica is an actual physical assault that posed a clear and imminent danger to the life of Jessica and her unborn child. </p> <p> <i>Second</i>, the question as to the "reasonable necessity" for the use of the means employed is one of the facts to be determined in accordance with the particular facts proven in each case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Although Apolinario used a gun, while Crisanto was unarmed, looking into the totality of the situation, I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the means employed by Apolinario to repel Crisanto's attack was reasonably necessary. That Apolinario used his service pistol while Crisanto was unarmed at the time Apolinario shot the latter is of no consequence. </p> <p> In <i>People v. Encomienda</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Court held: </p> <blockquote> x x x "Reasonable necessity of the means employed does not imply material commensurability between the means of attack and defense. What the law requires is rational equivalence, in the consideration of which will enter as principal factors the emergency, the imminent danger to which the person attacked is exposed, and the instinct, more than the reason, that moves or impels the defense, and the proportionateness thereof does not depend upon the harm done, but rests upon the imminent danger of such injury x x x"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </blockquote> In addition, the ancient common law rule in homicide was denominated "<i>retreat to the wall.</i>" This doctrine makes it the duty of a person assailed to retreat as far as he can before he is justified in meeting force with force. However, this principle has now given way in the United States to the "<i>stand ground when in the right</i>" rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> This rule was further explained in <i>Erwin v. State</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <blockquote> "The defendant was where he had the right to be, when the deceased advanced upon him in a threatening manner, and with a deadly weapon; and if the accused did not provoke the assault and had at the time reasonable grounds to believe and in good faith believed, that the deceased intended to take his life or do him great bodily harm, he was not obliged to retreat, nor consider whether he could safely retreat, <b>but was entitled to stand his ground and meet any attack made upon him with a deadly weapon, in such way and with such force as, under all the circumstances, he, at the moment, honestly believed, and had reasonable grounds to believe, was necessary to save his own life or to protect himself from great bodily injury</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote> <p>Thus, the trial court's ruling that Apolinario could have carefully deliberated on what action to take due to the fact that Crisanto's attention was momentarily shifted to Jessica is quite absurd.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Apolinario was clearly in the right when he used his service gun to shoot Crisanto. Given that Apolinario's pregnant wife was being strangled to death and the only weapon Apolinario had within his reach and in his possession was his service gun, the reasonable and natural thing for him to do under the circumstances was to fire at Crisanto, and thus make sure that his wife and unborn baby were kept safe. In predicaments like this, human nature does not act upon the processes of formal reason, but in obedience to the instinct of self-preservation. When it is apparent that a person has reasonably acted upon this instinct, it is the duty of the courts to sanction that act or to mitigate his liability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p> <table width="40%" border="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td><div align="justify"><b><i>All the elements of the justifying circumstances of self-defense and defense of a relative were proven by the defense in the killing of Lorico. </i></b></div></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>I likewise agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the defense was able to prove all the elements of self-defense and defense of a relative as to the killing of Lorico by Apolinario. </p> <p> Article 11 (1) of the Revised Penal Code provides the elements of self-defense as a justifying circumstance, thus: Anyone who acts in defense of his person or rights, provided that the following circumstances concur: <i>First</i>, unlawful aggression; <i>Second</i>, reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; <i>Third,</i> lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself. </p> <p> It cannot be disputed that there was unlawful aggression when Lorico, armed with a knife, ran towards Jessica and Apolinario. There was a real and imminent danger to the life and limb of Jessica and Apolinario. The determination of Lorico to harm Apolinario and Jessica is bolstered by the fact that although Apolinario shouted, "<i>tigil pulis ako</i>," Lorico simply ignored him and continued charging towards them. Thus, Apolinario was cornered into a position wherein he had no other choice but to shoot Lorico. </p> <p> The second element of self-defense and defense of a relative is also present. The trial court insists that Apolinario could have repelled the attack of Lorico in a manner that would not have caused the latter's life, such as by disabling the latter by shooting his arm or leg.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> However, this theory is hardly acceptable. As stressed by the <i>ponencia</i>, at the time that Lorico rushed towards Apolinario and his wife, Apolinario was helping Jessica stand up from the floor after just having been attacked by Crisanto. Thus, Apolinario and Jessica were not in the position to defend themselves. Given that Lorico was rushing towards Apolinario and his wife and the chaotic situation they were in, Apolinario could not have been expected to still reflect coolly as to which part of the body of Lorico to shoot. In this relation, the Court, in a number of cases, has held that the person defending is not expected to control his blow. </p> <p> In <i>United States v. Mojica</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the Court ruled: </p> <blockquote> x x x And if it was necessary for the appellant to use his revolver, he could hardly, under the circumstances, be expected to take deliberate and careful aim so as to strike a point less vulnerable than the body of his adversary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </blockquote> Similarly, in <i>United States v. Macasaet</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Court held: <blockquote> "The fact that the accused struck one more blow than once was absolutely necessary to save his own life, or that he failed to hold his hand so as to avoid inflicting a fatal wound where a less severe stroke might have served the purpose, would not negative self-defense, because the accused, in the heat of an encounter at close quarters, was not in a position to reflect coolly or to wait after each blow to determine the effects therof."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </blockquote> Thus, Apolinario cannot be faulted for inflicting a mortal wound on Lorico. <p> The last element of self-defense and defense of a relative was also sufficiently proven by the defense. Although Apolinario cursed back at Lorico, this is not the sufficient provocation that is contemplated by law. The provocation, in the language of the law, must be "sufficient," that is, it should be proportionate to the act of aggression and adequate to stir the aggressor to its commission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> In the present case, it can hardly be said that the shouting of expletives by Apolinario at Lorico constitute a sufficient cause for the latter to attack Apolinario and his wife. </p> <p> Since the defense was able to prove all the elements of self-defense and defense of a relative, the shooting by Apolinario of Crisanto and the killing of Lorico is justified. Thus, Apolinario must perforce be acquitted of the crimes charged. </p> <p> Based on these premises, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the Petition. <br><br></p> <hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <em>Rollo</em>, p. 87. <p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id.</p> <p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id. at 89.</p> <p> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Medina, Jr. v.
