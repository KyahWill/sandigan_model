				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Nationalism is not a mindless ideal. It should not unreasonably exclude people of a different citizenship from participating in our economy. If it were so, nationalism will not foster social justice; rather, it will sponsor a kind of racism quite like what our ancestors had suffered from in our colonial past.<br><br>While the Constitution does not bar foreign investors from setting up shop in the Philippines, neither does it encourage their unbridled entry. Thus, it has empowered Congress to determine which areas of investment to reserve to Filipinos and which areas may be opened to foreign investors.<br><br>The constitutional line demarcating privileges for our citizens over foreigners is a delicate one. We must adjudicate where such line is drawn only with a grounded consciousness of the facts of an actual case rather than through fiery passions of general advocacy. We will not evade the responsibility to adjudicate when that case comes. Sadly, this is not the case.<br><br>This Petition should be dismissed. Not only is it not justiciable, but this Court also does not have original jurisdiction over it. The grounds raised reveal that the invocation of grave abuse of discretion is mere subterfuge to a claimed "irregular or illegal" grant of an application for registration under Book I, Chapter III of Executive Order No. 226, or the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987.<br><br>This Court resolves the Petition for Certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by members of the agribusiness industry, assailing the February 28, 2012, April 24, 2012, and November 6, 2012 Resolutions<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> issued by the Board of Governors of the Board of Investments, which granted the applications for registration filed by Charoen Pokphand Foods Philippines Corporation (Charoen). <br><br>On May 24, 2007, Charoen, a 100% foreign-owned company from Thailand, was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On three (3) different occasions, Charoen submitted to the Board of Investments its applications for registration as a new producer of different products and services.

They mainly claim that the three (3) Board Resolutions of public respondent Board of Investments, which granted private respondent Charoen's applications for registration, were issued with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Petitioners allege that the assailed Board Resolutions violated their constitutional right to be protected against unfair foreign competition and trade practices.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> They accuse public respondent of deliberately depriving them of the chance to appeal by refusing to provide them with copies of the pe1iinent resolutions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Petitioners maintain that the assailed Board Resolutions were issued without prior consultation with the Department of Agriculture, as required by Executive Order No. 226,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and were contrary to public policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Petitioners also assert that public respondent wrongly classified private respondent as a new producer when it had been operating in the Philippines as early as 2009, raising shrimps and hogs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Finally, petitioners stress that they will sustain injury as they do not enjoy incentives similar to what the issued Board Resolutions have provided.

Additionally, petitioners were instructed to provide copies of the assailed Board Resolutions.<br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> public respondent argues that the Petition is dismissible for petitioners' failure to exhaust all administrative remedies before going to this Court. It points out that they should have first appealed to the Office of the President, which is the available remedy from its decisions on applications for registration under Article 36 of Executive Order No. 226.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It further faults petitioners for filing the Petition directly before this Court, instead of the Court of Appeals, as required under Rules 43 and 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Public respondent also claims that petitioners were not properly authorized to file the Petition, as the special powers of attorney issued to them did not include filing an original action before this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Additionally, it contends that its Executive Directors Lucita P. Reyes, Felicitas Agoncilio-Reyes, Efren V. Leaño, and Raul V.

It avers that petitioners only asked for copies of the supporting documents of private respondent's applications and not the copies of the resolutions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Public respondent emphasizes that it issued the assailed Board Resolutions within its powers under Executive Order No. 226 and the Investment Priorities Plan then in effect<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> which was formulated through a series of consultations with the Department of Agriculture and other stakeholders.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It stresses that private respondent's applications for registration were approved to bridge the gap between local production and local demand for aqua feeds, pork, and poultry.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Public respondent then belies petitioners' claim that private respondent was mistakenly classified as a "New Project" under the Investment Priorities Plan. It explains that registration is made per project; thus, even if a company is already existing, its new projects can qualify for registration if its activity is included in the current Investment Priorities Plan. Hence, the projects of private respondent, which had only begun its commercial operations in aqua feeds, breeder and slaughter hogs, and integrated broiler chickens, qualified as New Projects.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Public respondent underscores that the Constitution does not bestow "an automatic mantle of protection"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> against foreign competition. It asserts that agribusiness is not one of the areas of investments that require at least a 60% Filipino capitalization. It points out that 100% foreign equity participation is allowed in agribusiness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Finally, public respondent asserts that petitioners failed to show a clear and unmistakable right, or that they would suffer undue injury, that would merit an injunctive writ against the assailed Board Resolutions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> private respondent asserts that while the Constitution is guided by economic nationalism, "Filipino monopoly of the economy is proscribed"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and foreign investments are encouraged to boost the Philippine economy,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> as evidenced by the numerous laws<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> enacted to attract foreign investments. Private respondent likewise points out that this Court has repeatedly declared as constitutional the various statutes that liberalized entry of foreign investors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Similar to public respondent, private respondent also adverts to petitioners' procedural mistakes in, among others, filing an original petition before this Court instead of an appeal to the Office of the President<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and failing to exhaust the available administrative remedies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It also maintains that the assailed Board Resolutions have long attained finality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Private respondent posits that public respondent did not gravely abuse its discretion in approving the applications for registration. It maintains that public respondent carefully assessed that these applications adhered to existing rules and regulations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Finally, private respondent avers that the findings of fact of public respondent, as a "specialized government agency tasked with the preparation and formulation of the annual Investment Priorities Plan as well as the registration of pioneer new products[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> should be respected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In their Reply,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> petitioners reiterate that public respondent thwarted their chance at an appeal before the Office of the President when it failed to provide copies of the Board Resolutions despite their request for "Letters/Orders informing [private respondent] of [public respondent]'s action on its application."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Furthermore, petitioners point out that public respondent's delay in responding to their request made a timely appeal to the Office of the President impossible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, petitioners insist that this Petition for Certiorari is the appropriate remedy to void the assailed Board Resolutions, which were allegedly issued by public respondent with grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Petitioners claim that public respondent gravely abused its discretion in granting private respondent's applications for registration despite the latter's violation of law. According to them, private respondent went against Rule III, Section 4 of Executive Order No. 226's Implementing Rules and Regulations because the date of publication preceded public respondent's official acceptance of private respondent's application.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Petitioners likewise point out that private respondent committed misrepresentations in its applications. They point out how the company alleged that it spent P2,330,892,000.00 for construction works in its three (3) new projects for 2011, yet its financial statement that year showed that the value of its property and equipment only amounted to P334,014,644.00.<br><br>They argue that public respondent turned a blind eye to these glaring misrepresentations and approved the applications for registration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Further, petitioners maintain that private respondent's swine and chicken projects were not new projects, as its audited financial statements reveal that it had been selling such products even before it applied for registration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Moreover, contrary to public respondent's stand that inter-agency consultation is only needed in formulating the Investment Priorities Plan, petitioners insist that it must be made for every application for registration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>They then assert that public respondent had no technical knowledge or expertise over the agricultural industry; hence, it should have consulted with the Department of Agriculture before granting the applications.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>On this point, petitioners stress that the Department of Agriculture opined that private respondent's entry will have a negative impact on the agribusiness industry, as echoed by academic experts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Finally, petitioners contend that because public respondent gravely abused its discretion, the assailed Board Resolutions are void, making this case an exception to the general rule of immutability of judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>On October 1, 2013,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> this Court gave due course to the Petition and directed the parties to file their respective memoranda.<br><br>In their Memorandum,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> petitioners reiterate their right to be protected against unfair competition and trade practices.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> They emphasize that the local players in the agricultural industry already satisfy local demand; thus, there is no need for private respondent's entry. Additionally, they warn that private respondent, a Thai company, had already killed the local poultry industry in Vietnam.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>In its Memorandum,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> public respondent repeats that petitioners never requested copies of the assailed Board Resolutions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Additionally, it stresses that petitioners have known of the resolutions as early as December 4, 2012, and could have appealed by then. It discusses that during the Joint Congressional Hearings attended by petitioners Angelo Palmones (Palmones) and Nicanor Briones, as members of the House of Representatives, public respondent Lucita P. Reyes informed the House Committee about the assailed Board Resolutions and their dates of issuance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>In the alternative, public respondent posits that the Petition was belatedly filed. It claims that the 60-day period for filing a petition for certiorari should be counted from December 4, 2012, which meant petitioners only had until February 2, 2013 to do so.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Public respondent likewise repeats that there is no "automatic mantle of protection"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> afforded to local businesses or industries against foreign competition. It maintains that the Constitution recognizes the contribution of the private sector and private enterprises to economic growth, hence the grant of incentives to drive investments towards sectors that need them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Public respondent asserts that the applications for registration underwent the usual process,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> and that it used "an array of criteria"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> to evaluate the applications. It likewise denies that it did not have the expertise over the agricultural industry, noting that it had a pool of experts from both public and private sectors which it could readily consult.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Public respondent points out the benefits that private respondent will bring to the economy on several areas: technology acquisition, employment generation, lesser importation of feeds, increase in chicken meat supply that will lead to a price decrease, and the potential to import chicken meat.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Finally, public respondent emphasizes that private respondent's entry into the local market will not threaten the local industry; rather, it will stir competition, create efficiency, and stabilize market prices for chicken, pork, and feeds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>In its Memorandum,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> private respondent notes how the government has historically neglected the swine, poultry, and aqua feeds industries, giving little support to the industry players since most of its attention was focused on the rice industry.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Private respondent then refutes petitioners' dire prediction that its entry into the local market will doom the local players. It cites statistics showing an overall improvement in the poultry subsector during the first semester of 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Finally, private respondent echoes public respondent's claim that petitioners only had themselves to blame for failing to timely appeal to the Office of the President. It adds that on November 28, 2012, petitioner Palmones filed House Resolution No. 2921<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> which called for an investigation of the fiscal incentives public respondent granted to private respondent. Moreover, Representative Agapito Guanlao (Representative Guanlao), in his privilege speech delivered on the same date, urged for an inquiry into the grant of incentives. These events, private respondent stresses, show that petitioners had known of the assailed Board Resolutions, and should have moved for their reconsideration or appealed them to the Office of the President, exhausting the administrative remedies instead of directly filing the Petition before this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>The two (2) issues for this Court's resolution are:<br><br>First, whether or not the Petition for Certiorari filed directly before this Court is the correct remedy; and<br><br>Second, whether or not public respondent Board of Investments committed grave abuse of discretion when it approved the applications for registration of private respondent Charoen Pokphand Foods Philippines Corporation.<br><center><br>I<br></center><br>This Court's power of judicial review finds basis in Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<br><br>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether pr not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government.</blockquote>On the other hand, jurisdiction over a subject matter, or the power to hear and determine cases, is conferred by law, which may either be the Constitution or by statute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> This Court's original and appellate jurisdiction, as part of its constitutionally mandated powers, is provided in Article VIII, Section 5(1) and (2):<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 5.

In carrying out their quasi-judicial functions, the administrative officers or bodies are required to investigate facts or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, weigh evidence, and draw conclusions from them as basis for their official action and exercise of discretion in a judicial nature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote>It is necessary to identify whether the type of administrative action under review is quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial.

The Petition, therefore, is ultimately premature.<br><br>The claim of unfair competition is primarily factual in nature. In a separate opinion concurring with the well-expounded ponencia of Justice Alexander Gesmundo in <i>Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings, Ltd. v. Paperone, Inc.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> it was explained:<br><blockquote>There should be objective, scientific, and economic standards to determine whether goods or services offered by two parties are so related that there is a likelihood of confusion. In a market, the relatedness of goods or services may be determined by consumer preferences. When two goods are proved to be perfect substitutes, where the marginal rate of substitution, or the "consumer's willingness to substitute one good for another while maintaining the same level of satisfaction" is constant, then it may be concluded that the goods are related for the purposes of determining likelihood of confusion. Even goods or services, which superficially appear unrelated, may be proved related if evidence is presented showing that these have significant cross-elasticity of demand, such that changes of price in one party's goods or services change the price of the other party's goods and services. Should it be proved that goods or services belong to the same relevant market, they may be found related even if their classes, physical attributes, or purposes are different<br><br>While not binding on this Court, jurisprudence from the United States of America on the determination of related goods or services provide clues to this approach. In <i>Worthington Foods, Inc. v. Kellogg Co.</i>, both "reasonable interchangeability" of goods and consumer response through cross-elasticity were factors in the court's assessment on whether the goods were in the same relevant market:<br><blockquote>One analogous body of law sheds light on the issue of direct competition between goods, namely market definition under section 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2 (1982). Professor McCarthy, in his seminal trademark treatise, states that products which are "competitive" for purposes of trademark analysis are "goods which are reasonably interchangeable by buyers for the same purposes." Determining whether products are "reasonably interchangeable" is the analysis which the Court must undertake when defining the relevant product market in an action under section 2 of the Sherman.Act The Court holds that the same analysis is helpful for determining whether the parties' goods are "directly competing" for purposes of assessing palming off liability.<br><br>A relevant product market includes all products that are either identical or available substitutes for each other. To determine whether products are "available substitutes" or "reasonably interchangeable," the Court must first scrutinize the uses of the product. It must assess whether the products can perform the same function. The second factor to weigh is consumer response, or more specifically, cross-elasticity. That is, the Court must assess to what extent consumers will choose substitutes for the parties' goods in response to price increases.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The second market factor to be considered is consumer response or cross-elasticity. Unfortunately, the parties did not present evidence concerning any tendency or lack of tendency of consumers to switch from the plaintiff's products to the defendant's if Worthington were to raise its prices or vice versa. Therefore, the Court cannot conclude that the plaintiff has demonstrated cross-elasticity of the parties' products indicating that their goods are in the same relevant market.<br><br>In short, on an examination of the current record, the Court, finds that Worthington's goods are not in the same relevant market as Kellogg's cereal. The parties' products have different uses or functions. Also, the Court has no evidence of any degree of cross-elasticity between the plaintiffs foods and the defendant's cereal ...<br></blockquote>The lack of evidence that the parties directly competed in the same marketplace led to a finding that no likelihood of confusion would ensue in <i>Exxon Corporation v. Exxon Corporation</i>. In <i>Amstar Corp v. Domino's Pizza, Inc.</i>, among the factors used to determine that the parties' goods were unrelated were: (1) the distribution channels by which their goods were sold; and (2) the demographics of the predominant purchasers of the goods. In <i>AMF, Inc. v Sleekcraft Boats</i>, competition between the parties' lines of boats was found negligible despite the potential market overlap, since the respective lines catered to different kinds of activities. Similarly, in<i> Thompson Tank Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Thompson</i>, the contested goods represented only one percent (1%) of complainant's business, while ninety percent (90%) of the defendant's business were in fields that complainant did not engage m. This also disproves the claim of likelihood of confusion.<br><br>We can build on past jurisprudence of this Court. In <i>Shell Co. of the Philippines, Ltd v. In[s]. Petroleum Refining Co., Ltd and CA</i>, this Court did not give credence to a complainant's claim that the entry into the market of the defendant's products, which were allegedly sold in complainant's drums, caused a decrease in complainant's sales. Thus, no unfair competition could be imputed to the defendant:<br><blockquote>Petitioner contends that there had been a marked decrease in the volume of sales of low-grade oil of the company, for which reason it argues that the sale of respondent's low-grade oil in Shell containers was the cause. We are reluctant to share the logic of the argument. We are more inclined to believe that several factors contributed to the decrease of such sales. But let us assume, for purposes of argument, that the presence of respondent's low-grade oil in the market contributed to such decrease. May such eventuality make respondent liable for unfair competition? There is no prohibition for respondent to sell its goods, even in places where the goods of petitioner had long been sold or extensively advertised. Respondent should not be blamed if some of petitioner's dealers buy Insoil oil, as long as respondent does not deceive said dealers. If petitioner's dealers pass off Insoil oil as Shell oil, that is their responsibility. If there was any such effort to deceive the public, the dealers to whom the defendant (respondent) sold its products and not the latter, were legally responsible for such deception. The passing of said oil, therefore, as product of Shell was not performed by the respondent or its agent, but petitioner's dealers, which act respondent had no control whatsoever.</blockquote>These cases illustrate the many ways by which specialized agencies and courts may objectively evaluate the relatedness of allegedly competing goods and services. An analysis that ends in a mere finding of confusing similarity in the general appearance of the goods should not suffice.<br><br>After determining the relevant market, the purpose of prosecuting unfair competition is to prohibit and restrict deception of the consuming public whenever persons or firms attempt to pass off their goods or services for another's. Underlying the prohibition against unfair competition is that business competitors cannot do acts which deceive, or which are designed to deceive the public into buying their goods or availing their services instead.<br><br>Even if products are found to be in the same market, in all cases of unfair competition, competition should be presumed. Courts should take care not to interfere in a free and fair market, or to foster monopolistic practices. Instead, they should confine themselves to prevent fraud and misrepresentation on the public. In <i>Alhambra Cigmetc., Co. v. Mojica</i>:<br><blockquote>Protection against unfair competition is not intended to create or foster a monopoly and the court should always be careful not to interfere with free and fair competition, but should confine itself, rather, to preventing fraud and imposition resulting from some real resemblance in name or dress of goods. Nothing less than conduct tending to pass off one man's goods or business as that of another will constitute unfair competition. Actual or probable deception and confusion on the part of customers by reason of defendant's practices must always appear.</blockquote>Thus, complainants bear the burden of objectively proving that the deception or fraud has actually or has probably taken place, or that the defendant had the actual or probable intent to deceive the public. This will require, in a future case, measurable standards to show that: (1) the goods or services belong to the same market; and (2) the likelihood of confusion or doubt is adequately and empirically demonstrated, not merely left to the subjective judgment of an administrative body or this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>Then, in <i>Gios-Samar, Inc. v. Department of Transportation</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> even claims of monopolization or abuse of dominant positions in competition law were not treated as fact, and had to be substantiated. In a separate opinion:<br><blockquote>Indeed, the claims made by petitioner GIOS-SAMAR, Inc. require a more contextual appreciation of the evidence that it may present to support its claims. The nature of its various allegations requires the presentation of evidence and inferences, which should, at first instance, be done by a trial court.<br><br>Monopolization should not be lightly inferred especially since efficient business organizations are rewarded by the market with growth. Due to the high barriers to economic entry and long gestation periods, it is reasonable for the government to bundle infrastructure projects. There is, indeed, a difference between abuse of dominant position in a relevant market and combinations in restraint of trade. The Petition seems to have confused these two (2) competition law concepts and it has not made clear which concept it wished to apply.<br><br>Further, broad allegations amounting to a generalization that certain corporations allow themselves to serve as dummies for cartels or foreigners cannot hold ground in this Court. These constitute criminal acts. The Constitution requires that judicial action proceed carefully and always from a presumption of innocence. Tall tales of conspiratorial actions — though they may be salacious, make for interesting fiction, and are fodder for social media — do not deserve any judicial action. Broad generalizations of facts without corresponding evidence border on the contemptuous.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote>To reiterate, petitioners' alleged injury, which was purportedly caused by unfair competition and the entry of new players in the market, still requires a factual finding.

Addressing the petitioners' argument, this Court ruled that Article II, Section 19 of the Constitution, which embodied the policy of economic independence, is not a self-executing provision.

In other words, the Constitution did not intend to pursue an isolationist policy. It did not shut out foreign investments, goods and services in the development of the Philippine economy. While the Constitution does not encourage the unlimited entry of foreign goods, services and investments into the country, it does not prohibit them either.

Thus, Congress can determine what policy to pass and when to pass it depending on the economic exigencies. It can enact laws allowing the entry of foreigners into certain industries not reserved by the Constitution to Filipino citizens.
