At the time the rape incident took place, AAA was living with accused-appellant together with her stepsister, CCC, and brother, DDD, while AAA's stepmother was working abroad.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>AAA testified that accused-appellant had been molesting her since she was eight years old.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> On June 12, 2009, accused-appellant was on day off from work. AAA and CCC, who was then nine years old, had lunch with accused-appellant, while DDD went out. Accused-appellant instructed AAA and CCC to go to sleep after lunch, both did. Shortly thereafter, accused-appellant entered the room. When CCC was already asleep, accused-appellant ordered AAA to watch pornographic videos. He told AAA to undress and lie down. He then inserted his penis into AAA's vagina. Fearful, AAA only managed to cry because accused-appellant threatened to hurt and send her out of their house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Later on the same day, AAA told her friend, EEE, what accused-appellant did to her. EEE narrated the incident to her mother. EEE's mother reported the rape incident to the <i>barangay</i>. Thereafter, the <i>barangay</i> officials went to AAA's house and accosted accused-appellant; they likewise summoned AAA to the <i>barangay</i> where she gave her statements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Department of Social Welfare and Development caused AAA to be subjected to Genital Examination at the PNP Crime Laboratory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Police Chief Inspector Dean C. Cabrera, MD (PCI Cabrera) conducted the examination on AAA and found that her hymen had "shallow healed lacerations" at 6 and 7 o'clock positions which means that the injury could have been sustained at least three to seven days prior to the examination. Moreover, the injury was caused by a penetration of a blunt and hard.object, such as an erect penis, and AAA was possibly a victim of sexual abuse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><center><i>Version of the Defense</i></center><br>Accused-appellant denied the charge against him. He described AAA as a hard-headed child.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> He often scolded AAA for frequently hanging out with her friends late at night and for having boyfriends, one after the other.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Prior to the alleged incident, accused-appellant scolded and hit AAA for stealing his ATM card. On June 11, 2009, he talked to the mother of AAA's friend, EEE, and the mother of AAA's boyfriend; he told them to avoid AAA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On June 12, 2009, accused-appellant brought his children to the mall, but AAA did not want to go with them. On June 13, 2009, he told his children that they would buy school supplies, but AAA again refused to go with them. On June 17, 2009, accused-appellant was resting when the barangay officials came to his house and invited him to go to the <i>barangay</i>. When he refused, the <i>barangay</i> tanods dragged him to the <i>barangav</i> hall and informed him that he would be jailed for raping AAA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><center><i>Ruling of the RTC</i></center><br>On September 2, 2013, the RTC ruled that AAA's testimony was straightforward and in a manner typical of young victims of rape. It also held that when the victim's testimony is candid and corroborated by the physician's findings, there is sufficient evidence of the existence of carnal knowledge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The dispositive part of the Judgment of the RTC reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused [XXX], GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape penalized under Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Accordingly, said accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and to indemnify private complainant [AAA] the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>On September 17, 2013, accused-appellant through counsel, filed a Motion for New Trial<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> anchored on the Sinumpaang Salaysay<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> purportedly executed by AAA recanting her previous statements made against accused-appellant.<br><br>On October 22, 2013, the RTC issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> denying the Motion for New Trial.<br><br>Aggrieved, accused-appellant elevated the case to the CA arguing that the RTC erred in relying on AAA's testimony which is incredible and far from common human experience; that AAA had a motive to concoct a lie against him because she bore grudges against him; that there was no evidence of sexual abuse; and that the RTC erred in not considering the affidavit of recantation executed by AAA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><center><i>Ruling of the CA</i></center><br>On November 24, 2017, the CA affirmed accused-appellant's conviction. It found that all the elements of the crime charged are present as established by the clear and straight forward testimony of AAA and corroborated by the physician's testimony. The CA also held that a recantation of a vital witness is viewed with disfavor because it is exceedingly unreliable. There is also the possibility that intimidation or monetary considerations may have caused the recantation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The CA affirmed the penalty imposed, but modified the damages awarded. The CA disposed of the case as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The decision of the Regional Trial Court of <span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> dated September 2, 2013 in Criminal Case No. Q-09-159438 finding accused-appellant [XXX] guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape under Art. 266-A in relation to Art. 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and imposing upon him the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole in Criminal Case No. Q-09-159438 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION as to the award of damages. Accused-appellant shall pay the victim AAA P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages, with legal interest on all the damages awarded at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this decision until fully paid.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote>Insisting on his innocence, accused-appellant interposed the present appeal.<br><br>The People of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), filed a manifestation stating that they are adopting the Appellee's Brief filed before the CA in lieu of a Supplemental Brief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> On the other hand, accused-appellant filed his Supplemental Brief<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> in support of the appeal.</div><div align="JUSTIFY"><br><i><center>The Issues<br></center></i><blockquote><center>I</center><br>WHETHER ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE OF THE CRIME OF RAPE.<br><br><center>II</center><br>"WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS CORRECTLY AFFIRMED THE RTC IN DENYING THE MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL.</blockquote>Accused-appellant mainly ascribes fault to the CA for upholding the RTC Order that denied his Motion for New Trial. He argues that the CA overlooked that the RTC did not set for hearing his Motion for New Trial. He further avers that the case was decided on the basis of AAA's testimony; thus, AAA's affidavit of recantation confirms his innocence of the crime charged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><i><center>The Court's Ruling </center></i><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br>At the onset, every appeal of a criminal conviction opens the entire record to the reviewing court which should itself determine whether or not the findings adverse to the accused should be upheld against him or struck, down in his favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The burden of the reviewing court is really to see to it that no man is punished unless the proof of his guilt be beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant is charged with the crime of Rape under Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of the RPC, as amended. Article 266-A defines the crime of Rape by sexual intercourse as follows:<br><blockquote>ART. 266-A. <i>Rape, When and How Commuted. - Rape is committed</i> -<br><br>1. By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><blockquote>a. Through force, threat or intimidation;<br>b. When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious;<br>c. By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and<br>d. When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of&nbsp; age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.</blockquote></blockquote>In this jurisdiction, the Court is guided by the well-established principles laid down in the disposition and review of rape cases, to wit: (1) the prosecution has to show the guilt of the accused by proof beyond reasonable doubt or that degree of proof that, to an unprejudiced mind, produces conviction; (2) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merit: and cannot draw strength from the weakness of the evidence of the defense; (3) unless there are special reasons, the findings of trial courts, especially regarding the credibility of witnesses, are entitled to great respect and will not be disturbed on. appeal; (4) an accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; and (5) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Time and again, the Court has held that when the decision hinges on the credibility of witnesses and their respective testimonies, the trial court's observations and conclusions deserve great respect and are often accorded finality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The reason therefor is that the trial judge enjoys the peculiar advantage of observing first-hand the deportment of the witnesses while testifying and is, therefore, in a better position to form accurate impressions and conclusions on the basis thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The trial judge can better determine if witnesses are telling the truth, being in the ideal position to weigh conflicting testimonies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In rape cases particularly, the conviction or acquittal of the accused most often depends almost entirely on the credibility of the complainant's testimony.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> By the very nature of this crime, it is generally unwitnessed and usually the victim is left to testify for herself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Her testimony is most vital and must be received with the utmost caution. Once found credible, her lone testimony is sufficient to sustain a conviction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>After a careful scrutiny of the respective testimonies of AAA and accused-appellant, the. Court finds AAA's testimony to be credible, truthful, and logical as opposed to the testimony of accused-appellant. AAA recounted the circumstances surrounding the rape incident that occurred on June 12, 2009; it is not flawed with inconsistencies or contradictions in its material points and unshaken by the tedious and grading cross-examination. Her declaration revealed the logical circumstances and gave no impression whatsoever that her testimony was a mere fabrication. She was able to candidly testify at the witness stand, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On direct examination:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td><td width="95%"><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Q: </td><td><div align="justify">You said that your father started abusing you since you were in Grade I.

It is spontaneous and does not show any sign of fabrication. Even after questions propounded towards her were asked repeatedly during cross-examination, AAA proved to be very consistent in narrating her ordeal. When the offended party is of tender age and immature, courts are inclined to give credit to her account of what transpired, considering not only her relative vulnerability, but also the shame to which she would be exposed if the matter to which she testified is not true. Youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> A young girl's revelation that she had been raped, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her dignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as mere concoction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, the testimony of AAA was corroborated by the findings of PCI Cabrera that AAA's hymen had lacerations which could have been sustained at least three to seven days prior to the examination on June 18, 2009. The findings support AAA's testimony that the carnal knowledge happened on June 12, 2009. It is well settled that when a rape victim's testimony on the manner she was defiled is straightforward and candid, and is corroborated by the medical findings of the examining physician as in this case, it is sufficient to support a conviction for rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The foregoing discussion shows that the elements of Rape under Article 266-A of the RPC have been duly established. The prosecution, through AAA's testimony, corroborated by the doctor's medical findings, has ably proved that accused-appellant had carnal knowledge of AAA with the use of threat and intimidation and grave abuse of authority considering that accused-appellant is the father of AAA.<br><br>Accused-appellant's defenses of denial and alibi cannot overcome the candid and straightforward testimony of AAA. Judicial experience has taught the Court that denial and alibi are the common defenses in rape cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Denial and alibi are viewed with disfavor considering these are inherently weak defenses, especially in light of AAA's positive and straightforward declarations identifying accused-appellant as the one who committed the bastardly act against her as well as her convincing testimony detailing the circumstances and events leading to the rape incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Further, the important dictum laid by the Court in <i>People v. Adriano</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and <i>People v. Las Piñas</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> An denial and alibi will not prevail if corroborated not by credible witnesses, but by the accused's relatives and friends. In the present case, the only witness who corroborated accused-appellant's alibi was his daughter CCC.<br><br>In an attempt to exculpate himself from criminal liability, accused-appellant filed a Motion for New Trial before the RTC anchored on the affidavit executed by AAA that she is recanting all the allegations she made against her father. Accused-appellant vehemently argues that both the RTC and the CA gravely erred in not considering AAA's affidavit of recantation. According to him, AAA's recantation casts reasonable doubt on his guilt.<br><br>The Court disagrees.<br><br>It must be emphasized that the affidavit of recantation was submitted with the RTC after the judgment of. conviction was promulgated.<br><br>It is well settled that the Court frowns upon affidavits of desistance or recantation made after conviction.of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> These affidavits deserve scant&nbsp; consideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In the case&nbsp; of <i>Santos v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Court held that:<br><blockquote>x x x It is settled that an affidavit of desistance made by a witness after conviction of the accused is not reliable, and deserves only scant attention. The affidavits of desistance filed by the private, complainant and her witness were executed twelve (12) days after the promulgation of judgment of conviction, and are clearly mere afterthoughts. Hence, they cannot have the effect of negating a previous credible declaration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></blockquote>In the instant case, AAA's affidavit of recantation was executed fifteen days after the judgment of conviction. Thus, it can be viewed as a mere afterthought and unreliable. More importantly, a careful perusal thereof reveals that AAA's purported signature is different from that of her signature in her Sinumpaang Salaysay and consent for the medical examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The signatures on the <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> and consent for the medical examination are similar, but the signature on the purported affidavit of desistance is different. In People v. Antonio,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> the Court found doubtful the authenticity of the affidavit of desistance because the signatures appearing thereon were different from that on the complaint affidavit.<br><br>The circumstances obtaining here show that the affidavit of desistance purportedly executed by AAA is doubtful for the reasons cited above. Hence, the RTC and the CA are correct in not considering it.<br><br>In sum, accused-appellant's guilt for the crime of Rape has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. In view of the clear and convincing testimony of AAA, the denial and alibi interposed by accused-appellant which are both inherently weak, failed to convince the Court that he did not commit the defilement of AAA. Thus, the Court finds no reversible error on the part of the CA in affirming accused-appellant's conviction.<br><br>However, the penalty to be imposed should be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole. AAA's age and the accused-appellant's relation with AAA qualified the crime of Rape which warrants the imposition of the death penalty under Article 266-B (I)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> of the RPC. But considering RA 9346 that prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, the correct penalty to be imposed is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Finally, as for accused-appellant's civil liability, the award of P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and P100,000.00 as exemplary damages should be awarded to the victim in conformity with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
