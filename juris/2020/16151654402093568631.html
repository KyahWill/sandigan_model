DOLE,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> this Court laid out the distinction between quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative acts and the requirements of judicial review for each one:<br><br><blockquote>Administrative actions reviewable by this Court, therefore, may either be quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial. As the name implies, quasi-legislative or rule-making power is the power of an administrative agency to make rules and regulations that have the force and effect of law so long as they are issued "within the confines of the granting statute." The enabling law must be complete, with sufficient standards to guide the administrative agency in exercising its rule-making power. As an exception to the rule on non-delegation of legislative power, administrative rules and regulations must be "germane to the objects and purposes of the law, and be not in contradiction to, but in conformity with, the standards prescribed by law." In<i> Pangasinan Transportation Co., Inc. v. The Public Service Commission,</i> this Court recognized the constitutional permissibility of the grant of quasi-legislative powers to administrative agencies, thus:<br><br><blockquote>One thing, however, is apparent in the development of the principle of separation of powers and that is that the maxim of<i> delegatus non potest delegari</i> or<i> delegata potestas non potest delegari,</i> attributed to Bracton (De Legibus et Consuetedinious Angliae, edited by G .E. Woodbine, Yale University Press, 1922, vol. 2, p. 167) but which is also recognized in principle in the Roman Law (D. 17.18.3), has been made to adapt itself to the complexities of modern governments, giving rise to the adoption, within certain limits, of the principle of "subordinate legislation," not only in the United States and England but in practically all modem governments. (<i>People vs. Rosenthal and Osmeña,</i> G. R. Nos. 46076 and 46077, promulgated June 12, 1939.) Accordingly, with the growing complexity of modern life, the multiplication of the subjects of governmental regulation, and the increased difficulty of administering the laws, there is a constantly growing tendency toward the delegation of greater powers by the legislature, and toward the approval of the practice by the courts. (<i>Dillon Catfish Drainage Dist. v. Bank of Dillon, </i>141 S. E. 274, 275, 143 S. Ct. 178;<i> State v. Knox County, </i>54 S. W. 2d. 973, 976, 165 Tenn. 319.) In harmony with such growing tendency, this Court, since the decision in the case of Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas vs. Board of Public Utility Commissioners (34 Phil., 136), relied upon by the petitioner, has, in instances, extended its seal of approval to the "delegation of greater powers by the legislature." (<i>Inchausti Steamship Co.</i> vs.<i> Public Utility Commissioner,</i> 44 Phil., 366;<i> Alegre vs. Collector of Customs,</i> 53 Phil., 394;<i> Cebu Autobus Co. vs. De Jesus,</i> 56 Phil., 446;<i> People vs. Fernandez &amp; Trinidad</i>, G. R. No. 45655, promulgated June 15, 1938;<i> People vs. Rosenthal &amp; Osmeña,</i> G. R. Nos. 46076, 46077, promulgated June 12, 1939; and<i> Robb and Hilscher vs. People</i>, G.R. No. 45866, promulgated June 12, 1939.)</blockquote><br><br>On the other hand, quasi-judicial or administrative adjudicatory power is "the power to hear and determine questions of fact to which the legislative policy is to apply and to decide in accordance with the standards laid down by the law itself in enforcing and administering the same law." The constitutional permissibility of the grant of quasi-judicial powers to administrative agencies has been likewise recognized by this Court. In the 1931 case of<i> The Municipal Council of Lemery, Batangas v. The Provincial Board of Batangas,</i> this Court declared that the power of the Municipal Board of Lemery to approve or disapprove a municipal resolution or ordinance is quasi-judicial in nature and, consequently, may be the subject of a<i> certiorari</i> proceeding.<br><br>Determining whether the act under review is quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial is necessary in determining<i> when</i> judicial remedies may properly be availed of. Rules issued in the exercise of an administrative agency's quasi-legislative power may be taken cognizance of by courts<i> on the first instance</i> as part of their judicial power, thus:<br><br>....<br><br>However, in cases involving quasi-judicial acts, Congress may require certain quasi-judicial agencies to first take cognizance of the case before resort to judicial remedies may be allowed. This is to take advantage of the special technical expertise possessed by administrative agencies.<i> Pambujan Sur United Mine Workers v. Samar Mining Company, Inc.</i> explained the doctrine of primary administrative jurisdiction, thus:<br><br><blockquote>That the courts cannot or will not determine a controversy involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal prior to the decision of that question by the administrative tribunal, where the question demands the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special knowledge, experience, and services of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate matters of fact, and a uniformity of ruling is essential to comply with the purposes of the regulatory statute administered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote></blockquote><br><br>It is also settled that petitions for certiorari and prohibition are proper remedies to correct acts tainted with grave abuse of discretion:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In<i> Araullo</i> v.<i> Aquino III,</i> it was held that petitions for<i> certiorari</i> and prohibition filed before the Court "are the remedies by which the grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government may be determined under the Constitution." It was explained that "[w]ith respect to the Court, the remedies of<i> certiorari</i> and prohibition are necessarily broader in scope and reach, and the writ of<i> certiorari</i> or prohibition may be issued to correct errors of jurisdiction committed not only by a tribunal, corporation, board or officer exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, but<b> also to set right, undo[,] and restrain any act of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any branch or instrumentality of the Government,</b><i><b> even if the latter does not exercise judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions.</b></i> This application is expressly authorized by the text of the second paragraph of Section 1, [Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution cited above]."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Intervenor GSIS alleges that petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies because it should have given DOTC the opportunity to reconsider its own issuance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>However, it is settled that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies finds no application when a questioned act was done in the exercise of quasi-legislative powers:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In questioning the validity or constitutionality of a rule or regulation issued by an administrative agency, a party need not exhaust administrative remedies before going to court. This principle applies only where the act of the administrative agency concerned was performed pursuant to its quasi-judicial function, and not when the assailed act pertained to its rule-making or quasi-legislative power. In<i> Association of Philippine Coconut Desiccators v. Philippine Coconut Authority,</i> it was held:<br><br><blockquote>The rule of requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies before a party may seek judicial review, so strenuously urged by the Solicitor General on behalf of respondent, has obviously no application here. The resolution in question was issued by the PCA in the exercise of its rule-making or legislative power. However, only judicial review of decisions of administrative agencies made in the exercise of their quasi-judicial function is subject to the exhaustion doctrine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote></blockquote><br><br>The pertinent powers of the DOTC are enumerated under Section 5 of Executive Order No. 125 as amended:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 5.<i> Powers and Functions.</i> — To accomplish its mandate, the Department shall have the following powers and functions:<br><br>(a) Formulate and recommend national policies and guidelines for the preparation and implementation of integrated and comprehensive transportation and communications systems at the national, regional and local levels;<br><br>(b) Establish and administer comprehensive and integrated programs for transportation and communications, and for this purpose, may call on any agency, corporation, or organization, whether public or private, whose development programs include transportation and communications as an integral part thereof, to participate and assist in the preparation and implementation of such program;<br><br>(c) Assess, review and provide direction to transportation and communications research and development programs of the government in coordination with other institutions concerned;<br><br>(d) Administer and enforce all laws, rules and regulations in the field of transportation and communications;<br><br>....<br><br>(m) Establish and prescribe rules and regulations for the inspection and registration of air and land transportation facilities, such as motor vehicles, trimobiles, railways and aircrafts;<br><br>....<br><br>(o) Establish and prescribe the corresponding rules and regulations for the enforcement of laws governing land transportation, air transportation and postal services, including the penalties for violations thereof, and for the deputation of appropriate law enforcement agencies in pursuance thereof;<br><br>....<br><br>(s) Perform such other powers and functions as may be prescribed by law, or as may be necessary, incidental, or proper to its mandate or as may be assigned from time to time by the President of the Republic of the Philippines.</blockquote><br><br>DO No. 2007-28 was issued pursuant to DOTC's exercise of its delegated legislative power under the foregoing provision. Its issuance was done pursuant to its quasi-legislative powers. Thus, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply in this case.<br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br><br>Even if the correct remedy has been availed, the Petition must be dismissed, there being no justiciable controversy involved since petitioners do not have legal standing to bring the case on behalf of their members.<br><br>In<i> Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines v.

A case is justiciable if the issues presented are "definite and concrete, touching on the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests." The conflict must be ripe for judicial determination, not conjectural or anticipatory; otherwise, this Court's decision will amount to an advisory opinion concerning legislative or executive action. In the classic words of<i> Angara v. Electoral Commission:</i><br><br><blockquote>[T]his power of judicial review is limited to actual cases and controversies to be exercised after full opportunity of argument by the parties, and limited further to the constitutional question raised or the very<i> lis mota </i>presented. Any attempt at abstraction could only lead to dialectics and barren legal questions and to sterile conclusions unrelated to actualities. Narrowed as its function is in this manner, the judiciary does not pass upon questions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation. More than that, courts accord the presumption of constitutionality to legislative enactments, not only because the legislature is presumed to abide by the Constitution but also because the judiciary in the determination of actual cases and controversies must reflect the wisdom and justice of the people as expressed through their representatives in the executive and legislative departments of the governments.</blockquote><br>Even the expanded jurisdiction of this Court under Article VIII, Section 1 does not provide license to provide advisory opinions. An advisory opinion is one where the factual setting is conjectural or hypothetical. In such cases, the conflict will not have sufficient concreteness or adversariness so as to constrain the discretion of this Court. After all, legal arguments from concretely lived facts are chosen narrowly by the parties. Those who bring theoretical cases will have no such limits. They can argue up to the level of absurdity. They will bind the future parties who may have more motives to choose specific legal arguments.

"[A]n association," this Court said, "has the legal personality to represent its members because the results of the case will affect their vital interests." In granting the Pharmaceutical and Health Care Association legal standing, this Court considered the amended articles of incorporation of the association and found that it was formed "to represent directly or through approved representatives the pharmaceutical and health care industry before the Philippine Government and any of its agencies, the medical professions and the general public." Citing<i> Executive Secretary v. Court of Appeals,</i> this Court declared that "the modern view is that an association has standing to complain of injuries to its members." This Court continued:<br><br><blockquote>[This modern] view fuses the legal identity of an association with that of its members. An association has standing to file suit for its workers despite its lack of direct interest if its members are affected by the action. An organization has standing to assert the concerns of its constituents.<br><br><center>xxx xxx xxx</center><br>. . . We note that, under its Articles of incorporation, the respondent was organized. . . to act as the representative of any individual, company, entity or association on matters related to the manpower recruitment industry, and to perform other acts and activities necessary to accomplish the purposes embodied therein.

The respondent [association] is but the medium through which its individual members seek to make more effective the expression of their voices and the redress of their grievances.</blockquote><br>In<i> Holy Spirit Homeowners Association, Inc. v.

The association argued that the implementing rules went beyond the provisions of Republic Act No. 9207, unduly limiting the area disposable to the beneficiaries.<br><br>The National Government Center Administration Committee questioned the legal standing of the Holy Spirit Homeowners Association, Inc., contending that the association "is not the duly recognized people's organization in the [National Government Center]."<br><br>Rejecting the National Government Center Administration Committee's argument, this Court declared that the Holy Spirit Homeowners Association, Inc. "ha[d] the legal standing to institute the [petition for prohibition] whether or not it is the duly recognized association of homeowners in the [National Government Center]." This Court noted that the individual members of the association were residents of the National Government Center. Therefore, "they are covered and stand to be either benefited or injured by the enforcement of the [implementing rules], particularly as regards the selection process of beneficiaries and lot allocation to qualified beneficiaries."<br><br>In<i> The Executive Secretary v.

The association sued on behalf of its members who were recruitment agencies.<br><br>This Court took cognizance of the associations' petition and said that an association "is but the medium through which its individual members seek to make more effective the expression of their voices and the redress of their grievances." It noted that the board resolutions of the individual members of the Asian Recruitment Council Philippine Chapter, Inc. were attached to the petition, thus, proving that the individual members authorized the association to sue on their behalf.<br><br>The associations in<i> Pharmaceutical and Health Care Association of the Philippines, Holy Spirit Homeowners Association, Inc.,</i> and<i> The Executive Secretary</i> were allowed to sue on behalf of their members because they sufficiently established who their members were, that their members authorized the associations to sue on their behalf, and that the members would be directly injured by the challenged governmental acts.<br><br>The liberality of this Court to grant standing for associations or corporations whose members are those who suffer direct and substantial injury depends on a few factors.<br><br>In all these cases, there must be an actual controversy. Furthermore, there should also be a clear and convincing demonstration of special reasons why the truly injured parties may not be able to sue.<br><br>Alternatively, there must be a similarly clear and convincing demonstration that the representation of the association is more efficient for the petitioners to bring. They must further show that it is more efficient for this Court to hear only one voice from the association. In other words, the association should show special reasons for bringing the action themselves rather than as a class suit, allowed when the subject matter of the controversy is one of common or general interest to many persons. In a class suit, a number of the members of the class are permitted to sue and to defend for the benefit of all the members so long as they are sufficiently numerous and representative of the class to which they belong.<br><br>In some circumstances similar to those in<i> While Light,</i> the third parties represented by the petitioner would have special and legitimate reasons why they may not bring the action themselves. Understandably, the cost to patrons in the<i> White Light</i> case to bring the action themselves — i.e., the amount they would pay for the lease of the motels — will be too small compared with the cost of the suit. But viewed in another way, whoever among the patrons files the case even for its transcendental interest endows benefits on a substantial number of interested parties without recovering their costs. This is the free rider problem in economics. It is a negative externality which operates as a disincentive to sue and assert a transcendental right.<br><br>In addition to an actual controversy, special reasons to represent, and disincentives for the injured party to bring the suit themselves, there must be a showing of the transcendent nature of the right involved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In that case, Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines, representing public utility bus operators, filed a petition for certiorari assailing DOLE'S Department Order No. 118-12 which requires certificates of labor standards compliance as a prerequisite of issuance and renewal of their certificates of public convenience.

He must also prove that he has sufficient interest in preventing the illegal expenditure of money raised by taxation and that he will sustain a direct injury because of the enforcement of the questioned statute or contract. In other words, for a taxpayer's suit to prosper, two requisites must be met: <b>(1) public funds derived from taxation are disbursed by a political subdivision or instrumentality and in doing so, a law is violated or some irregularity is committed and (2) the petitioner is directly affected by the alleged act.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The present case is not a taxpayer's suit.

It is certainly not an express repealing clause because it fails to identify or designate the act or acts that are intended to be repealed. Rather, it is an example of a general repealing provision, as stated in Opinion No. 73, S. 1991.<i> It is a clause which predicates the intended repeal under the condition that a substantial conflict must be found in existing and prior acts.</i> The failure to add a specific repealing clause indicates that the intent was not to repeal any existing law, unless an irreconcilable inconsistency and repugnancy exist in the terms of the new and old laws. This latter situation falls under the category of an implied repeal.<br><br>Repeal by implication proceeds on the premise that where a statute of later date clearly reveals an intention on the part of the legislature to abrogate a prior act on the subject, that intention must be given effect. Hence, before there can be a repeal, there must be a clear showing on the part of the lawmaker that the intent in enacting the new law was to abrogate the old one. The intention to repeal must be clear and manifest; otherwise, at least, as a general rule, the later act is to be construed as a continuation of, and not a substitute for, the first act and will continue so far as the two acts are the same from the time of the first enactment.<br><br><i>There are two categories of repeal by implication. The first is where provisions in the two acts on the same subject matter are in an irreconcilable conflict,</i> the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one.<i> The second is if the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute, it will operate to repeal the earlier law.</i><br><br>Implied repeal by irreconcilable inconsistency takes place when the two statutes cover the same subject matter; they are so clearly inconsistent and incompatible with each other that they cannot be reconciled or harmonized; and both cannot be given effect, that is, that one law cannot he enforced without nullifying the other.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Implied repeals are not favored, because it is presumed that a law-making body considers all existing laws, and thus could not have made conflicting rules:<br><br><blockquote>It is a well-settled rule of statutory construction that repeals by implication are not favored. The rationale behind the rule is explained as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Repeal of laws should be made clear and expressed. Repeals by implication are not favored as laws are presumed to be passed with deliberation and full knowledge of all laws existing on the subject. Such repeals are not favored for a law cannot be deemed repealed unless it is clearly manifest that the legislature so intended it. The failure to add a specific repealing clause indicates that the intent was not to repeal any existing law, unless an irreconcilable inconsistency and repugnancy exist in the terms of the new and old laws.<br><br>Likewise, in another case, it was held:<br><br>Well-settled is the rule that repeals of laws by implication are not favored, and that courts must generally assume their congruent application. The two laws must be absolutely incompatible, and a clear finding thereof must surface, before the inference of implied repeal may be drawn. The rule is expressed in the maxim,<i> interpretare et concordare leqibus est optimus interpretendi, i.e.,</i> every statute must be so interpreted and brought into accord with other laws as to form a uniform system of jurisprudence. The fundament is that the legislature should be presumed to have known the existing laws on the subject and not have enacted conflicting statutes.

This is markedly different from what its predecessor, the DOTC, envisioned under Department Order No. 2007-28.<br><br>Moreover, the intention of the DOTr to repeal Department Order No. 2007-28 is evident in the preambulatory clause of Department Order No. 020-18:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREAS, in order to eradicate the foregoing unlawful practices, to remove the perception that LTO and LTFRB personnel are involved in illegal and corrupt activities, to finally rid the LTO and LTFRB from any form of proprietary interests arising from the issuance of the Insurance Policies, and to further serve the interest of public service, the Department of Transportation (DOTr)<i> deems it best to revamp the existing guidelines and decide that the determination of duly qualified insurers who can provide the Insurance Policies be placed under the sole and exclusive authority of the Insurance Commission</i> (the "Commission").

SP No. 99791:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREAS, on July 23, 2007, Alliance and BMIS filed a case of Certiorari with prayer for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against the Secretary of the Department of Transportation and Communication, et al. before the Court of Appeals, Manila docketed as CA-G.R. No. 99791 to restrain respondents from implementing DOTC Department Order No. 2007-28 dated July 5, 2007;<br><br>WHEREAS, on July 2007, the Philippine Insurers and Reinsurers Association (PIRA) also filed a case before the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 145 against the same respondents to the case filed by Alliance and BMIS seeking the same relief, docketed as SCA Case No. 673;<br><br><i><b>WHEREAS, a TRO has already been issued by the RTC of Makati while the case in the Court of Appeals is still to be heard and procedural problems may arise which may confuse the issues and might jeopardize the common interest of all who seeks the same relief;</b></i><br><br>WHEREAS, Alliance and BMIS realize the duplicity of the action it took and may pre-empt any decision of the Court of Appeals hence, it decided to withdraw the certiorari case before the Court of Appeals;<br><br>NOW THEREFORE, be it resolved as it is hereby resolved that the certiorari case docketed as CA G.R.

On August 13, 2007, the Court of Appeals dismissed it for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup><br><br>It is significant to note that petitioner MUNLI also admitted to the commonality of its interest with PIRA in SCA Case No. 673, in seeking to withdraw its petition docketed as CA G.R. SP No. 99992:<br><br><blockquote>1. Various petitions were filed in RTC and Court of Appeals of similar issues and remedies invoked of different, which fact was served notice to the Honorable Court on 13 August 2007.<br><br>2. It was resolved during the meeting of the various petitioners that a single case be pursued instead and to give way for the case to proceed that which is pending before RTC Brach 145, Makati City docketed under SCA Case No. 673.<br><br>3. Abiding with the consensus had, henceforth, the withdrawal of this case is effected<i> in the interest of justice for all concerned similarly situated</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> (Emphasis supplied) </blockquote><br><br>Thus, all petitioners in the instant case admitted to the commonality of their interests and similarity of the issues in their respective petitions in SCA Case No. 673.<br><br>It was only after the lifting of the injunction in the Makati Regional Trial Court in SCA Case No. 673, and the withdrawal of the Petitions in CA G.R. No. 99992 and CA G.R. No. 99791, that petitioners filed the precedent of the instant Petition before the Court of Appeals docketed as CA G.R. No. 104211 on July 7, 2008.<br><br>Petitioners cannot hide behind the seeming non-similarity of parties, considering they admitted to the commonality of interests and issues in SCA Case No. 673.<br><br>In<i> Grace Park International v. Eastwest Banking,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> this Court clarified that absolute identity is not crucial because the parties' shared identity of interests will suffice for determination of the existence of forum-shopping:<br><br><blockquote>Anent the first requisite of forum shopping, "[t]here is identity of parties where the parties in both actions are the same, or there is privity between them, or they are successors-in-interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity. Absolute identity of parties is not required, shared identity of interest is sufficient to invoke the coverage of this principle. Thus,<i> it is enough that there is a community of interest between a party in the first case and a party in the second case even if the latter was not impleaded in the first case."</i><br><br>With respect to the second and third requisites of forum shopping, "[h]ornbook is the rule that identity of causes of action does not mean absolute identity; otherwise, a party could easily escape the operation of res judicata by changing the form of the action or the relief sought. The test to determine whether the causes of action are identical is to ascertain whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action. <i>Hence, a party cannot, by varying the form of action or adopting a different method of presenting his case, escape the operation of the principle that one and the same cause of action shall not be twice litigated between the same parlies or their privies.</i> Among the several tests resorted to in ascertaining whether two suits relate to a single or common cause of action are: (1) whether the same evidence would support and sustain both the first and second causes of action; and (2) whether the defenses in one case may be used to substantiate the complaint in the other. Also fundamental is the test of determining whether the cause of action in the second case existed at the time of the filing of the first complaint."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>There is an identity of parties, and an established shared identity of interests. The petitions they filed and withdrawn have identical causes of action with the same reliefs that they filed in multiple<i> fora.</i><br><br>The judgments of the lower courts in SCA Case No. 673 and CA G.R. SP. No. 99992 operate as either<i> litis pendentia</i> or<i> res judicata</i> depending on their status. Even if petitioners are not impleaded before SCA Case No. 673, they expressly recognized the commonality of their interests with the petitioners in SCA Case No. 673. Thus, its resolution bars the filing of the present Petition. Necessarily, all the requisites of forum-shopping are present.<br><br>Petitioners' act of successively filing at least four (4) Petitions in various<i> fora</i> is the very act of forum-shopping:<br><br><blockquote>Forum shopping consists of filing multiple suits involving the same parties for the same cause of action, either simultaneously or successively for the purpose of obtaining a favorable judgment. It exists when, as a result of an adverse opinion in one forum, a party seeks a favorable opinion in another, or when he institutes two or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause, on the gamble that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition. There certainly is all the opportunity to accomplish the wrong intended by forum-shopping through the filing of two petitions for review with a collegiate court such as the Court of Appeals, as each petition would be docketed separately and assigned to a division of that court, thus allowing two different divisions to act independently as each considers and treats the petition. Thus, no petition for review on certiorari may be filed in the Court of Appeals if there is already a similar petition already filed or pending with that same court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup></blockquote><br><br>After trifling with court processes to secure a favourable judgment, petitioners have the audacity to invoke a non-fatal error committed by the Court of Appeals. The names of respondents were incorrectly placed in the caption of the Resolution denying petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> From this apparent error, petitioners conclude that the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts, which this Court should correct.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup><br><br>In<i> Oasis Park Hotel v. Navahina</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> the inclusion of the names of parties in the caption of a pleading is only a formal requirement. What is controlling are the allegations contained within:<br><br><blockquote>(c) The failure of petitioner to implead the complete names of all private respondents in the caption of the Petition did not warrant the dismissal of said Petition, especially when all the names and circumstances of the parties were stated in the body of the Petition, under "PARTIES. As the Court held in<i> Genato v. Viola:</i> "It is not the caption of the pleading but the allegations therein that are controlling. The inclusion of the<i> names of all the parties in the title of a complaint is a formal requirement under Section [1], Rule 7 of the Rules of Court.</i> However, the rules of pleadings require courts to pierce the form and go into the substance. The non-inclusion of one or some of the names of all the complainants in the title of a complaint, is not fatal to the case, provided there is a statement in the body of the complaint indicating that such complainant/s was/were made party to such action."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><br><br>This Court finds that the error within the title's caption in the Resolution dismissing petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration is not equivalent to misapprehension of facts. The body of the decision pertains to a May 24, 2012 Decision issued by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 10421. If at all, the confusion was brought about by the multiple petitions filed by petitioners before the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Finally, the act of deliberate and wilful forum shopping warrants the summary dismissal with prejudice of the instant Petition and all other cases pending in lower courts, if any. By abusing court processes, forum shopping constitutes direct contempt of this Court:<br><br><blockquote>Thus, the CA did not commit an error in outrightly dismissing petitioner's petition. It must be remembered that the acts of a party or his counsel, clearly constituting willful and deliberate forum shopping shall be ground for the summary dismissal of the case with prejudice, and shall constitute direct contempt, as well as be a cause for administrative sanctions against the lawyer. Also, SC Circular No. 28-91 states that the deliberate ling of multiple complaints by any party and his counsel to obtain favorable action constitutes forum shopping and shall be a ground for summary dismissal thereof and shall constitute direct contempt of court, without prejudice to disciplinary proceeding against the counsel and the ling of a criminal action against the guilty party. In<i> Spouses Arevalo v. Planters Development Bank</i>, this Court further reiterated that once there is a finding of forum shopping, the penalty is summary dismissal not only of the petition pending before this Court, but also of the other case that is pending in a lower court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Thus, petitioners and their respective counsels, Atty Raymundo L.
