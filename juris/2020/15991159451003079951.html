Bay-An (Rhoda) filed a Joint Affidavit-Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> against petitioner and Arsebino before the Office of Provincial Prosecutor Felix T. Cabading of La Trinidad, Benguet. After preliminary investigation, petitioner and Arsebino were charged with the crime of violation of Section 68 of PD 705 in an Information<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> that reads:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 4<sup>th</sup> day of December 2005, at Sinto Bangao, Municipality of Buguias, Province of Benguet, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually aiding one another without any lawful permit or authority whatsoever granted by competent authority to them, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly cut, collect and gather pine trees having a total volume of 3.1464 cu.m. with a market value of TWENTY[-]TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY[-]SIX PESOS AND SEVENTY[-]SIX CENTAVOS (P22,496.76), Philippine Currency, to the detriment and prejudice of the REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, in violation of the said law.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.</blockquote><br><br>The RTC thus proceeded with the arraignment of the accused who entered separate pleas of not guilty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br>The facts are not in dispute. In the morning of December 4, 2005, while Eric Lanta-an (Eric) and Raymundo Abuyog (Raymundo) were doing gardening work on the land of Leonora in Sinto, Upper Cotcot, Bangao, Buguias, Benguet, they heard the sound of a power chainsaw coming from the edge of the garden. From their vantage point, they saw four men cutting pine trees on the lower part of the land. In particular, they saw one man holding a power chainsaw, and another holding a bolo (who was later identified as Arsebino) while chopping off small branches of felled pine trees, both of whom were with two other men following them. Arsebino then informed Eric that he and his companions were cutting pine trees since they would need to do some work on the land where the said trees were planted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Upon arriving at her house at around noontime of the same day, Leonora and her husband, Galbones Edoc (Galbones), noticed that the pine trees planted at the edge of the garden were missing. Eric and Raymundo then informed Leonora and Galbones that four men were cutting pine trees with the use of a power chainsaw. From where she was standing near the cutting site, Leonora saw Arsebino and petitioner, together with two other male companions, cutting pine trees. She also saw herein petitioner directing the man holding a chainsaw, while Arsebino was pointing at certain trees to be cut.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Heeding the advice of Galbones, Leonora immediately went to the residence of Cesar Kitayan (Kitayan), a Forester and Reforestation Unit Head of the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office-Department of Environment and Natural Resources (CENRO-DENR). After reporting to Kitayan that petitioner and Arsebino were cutting pine trees at Cotcot, Buguias, both Leonora and Kitayan proceeded to the cutting site where they saw several felled pine trees. Standing near the felled trees were four men, two of whom were Arsebino and petitioner. Leonora then inquired from petitioner and Arsebino if they have a permit to cut from a competent authority but petitioner and Arsebino only smiled at Leonora without, however, offering a response to her query. Leonora further inquired from Arsebino why he and his companions were cutting pine trees without the required permit. In response thereto, Arsebino relayed to Leonora that he is the owner of the land where the pine trees were located. Leonora, however, insisted that the land belonged to her daughter, Rhoda. This led to a heated argument between Leonora and Arsebino.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Kitayan, on his part, counted a total of 18 felled Benguet pine trees lying on the cutting site. He then took pictures of the felled trees and submitted a report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to his superior at the CENRO-DENR. Kitayan instructed Forest Rangers Benny Pesnek, Elias Botangen, and Roland Yawan of Buguias CENRO-DENR to conduct an inventory, and scale and photograph the felled pine trees. In their Inventory and Scaled Report,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the Forest Rangers observed that the total volume of the cut pine trees measured 3.1464 cubic meters valued at Twenty-Two Thousand Four Hundred Ninety-Six Pesos And Seventy-Six Centavos (P22,496.76) in forest charges. As per Leonora's request, the CENRO-DENR issued a certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> stating that no permit or authority to cut was issued or granted to Arsebino and/or petitioner.<br><br><center><b><u>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</u></b></center><br><br>After trial on the merits, the RTC found petitioner and Arsebino guilty as charged. The dispositive portion of the Judgment reads: <br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Court finds both Accused Arsebino Talabis and Edwin Talabis, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt, for Violation of Sec. 68 of P.D. 705, as amended. Both are hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment of <u>14 years, 4 months and 1 day to 15 years</u> of <i>Reclusion Temporal, medium</i>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In reaching said conclusions, the RTC noted that:<br><br><blockquote>From the foregoing, the elements of the crime charged are:<br><br>(1) That Accused cuts, gathers, collects or removes timber or other forest products;<br><br>(2) That timber or other forest products are cut, gathered, collected or removed from the forest land;<br><br>(3) That the cutting, gathering, collecting or removing of timber or other forest products is without authority (Law on Illegal Logging by Penaflor and Perez, page 6, 1997 Edition).<br><br>x x x x<br><br>On this first element, the Court is of the opinion, that the prosecution was able to prove this element beyond reasonable doubt. As between the positive testimony of the prosecution witnesses, that Accused cut the subject trees, and the negative testimonies of Accused, denying the acts imputed to them, the Court is inclined to believe the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. Although it is to be admitted that Edoc has an ax to grind against Arsebino Talabis, because she accused him of land grabbing, to the mind of the Court, it is not sufficient to disregard the testimony of Leonora Edoc, which testimony was sufficiently corroborated by the other prosecution witnesses.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>On the second element, while the Information did not allege, whether or not the subject pine trees were cut from a forest land, this, however, can be inferred from the fact that the same Information did not allege that the subject trees were cut from a private land or alienable and disposable land. Besides, the cutting area is very near the Mt. Data Forest Reservation.<br><br>On the third element, it was testified by Sylvia Kitayan, the OIC Records Officer of the CENRO, Buguias, Benguet, that per records of their office, no cutting permits or authority were granted to Arsebino and Edwin TaJabis, to cut pine trees at Cotcot, Bangao, Buguias, Benguet, from the period of November to December 2005. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> filed by petitioner and Arsebino was denied by the RTC in its December 1, 2009 Order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><center><u><b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></u></center><br><br>Petitioner, in his Brief, although not raised as an assignment of error, discussed for the consideration of the CA that since the offended party under PD 705 is the government, the complaint against petitioner and Arsebino should have been filed by a DENR official, and not by Leonora and Rhoda who are merely private individuals.<br><br>Pending resolution of petitioner's and Asebino's appeal, <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> a Manifestation with Motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated November 5, 2010 was filed before the CA which informed the court that Arsebino died on September 30, 2010 as shown by a certified true copy of a Certificate of Death<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> issued by the Office of the Civil Registrar General of San Fernando City, La Union. In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated February 8, 2011, the CA dismissed the appeal insofar as Arsebino was concerned. The pertinent portion of the February 8, 2011 Resolution is as follows:<br><br><blockquote>In <i>People vs. Bayotas</i>, the Supreme Court held that the death of the accused pending appeal of his conviction extinguishes his criminal liability as well as the civil liability based solely thereon. Thus, We hold that the death of the accused-appellant Arsebino Talabis extinguished his criminal liability and the civil liability based solely on the act complaint of. Consequently, the appeal is hereby dismissed without qualification as regards accused-appellant Arsebino Talabis only.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Thereafter, the CA, in its January 16, 2014 Decision, affirmed the Judgment of the RTC with modifications. The CA held that the RTC erroneously fixed the minimum period of the penalty at fourteen (14) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium. In so ruling, the CA explained that since none of the qualifying circumstances in Article 310 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) was alleged in the Information, the penalty cannot be increased to two degrees higher. Thus, the proper imposable penalty is that which is prescribed under Article 309 of the RPC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the instant appeal is hereby DENIED. The assailed 09 September 2009 Decision and 01 December 2009 Order of Branch 64 of the Regional Trial Court in Abatan, Buguias, Benguet, are hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that appellant Edwin Talabis is hereby sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years of <i>prision correccional</i> as minimum, to ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i> as maximum.<br><br>The felled Baguio pine trees subject of the instant case are also hereby ordered <b>CONFISCATED</b> and <b>FORFEITED</b> in favor of the Government.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Petitioner thus sought reconsideration of the January 16, 2014 Decision of the CA. In his Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> petitioner imputed error on the CA for its failure to appreciate two mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender and old age in modifying and imposing the proper penalty against him.<br><br>In its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated September 2, 2014, the CA denied petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration racionating in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>An exhaustive review of the record and the Decision rendered by this Court revealed that x x x the two (2) mitigating circumstances mentioned in the instant motion were never raised by the appellant during his trial as part of his defense. There is, thus, no compelling reason to modify, reverse, or set aside the assailed Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br><br><center><b><u>Issues</u></b></center><br><br>Undeterred, petitioner filed the instant petition raising the following assignment of errors: <br><br><blockquote><center>I.</center> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, UNDER THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE CASE, THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN DENYING THE PETITIONER'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AS THE TRIAL [COURT] NEVER ACQUIRED JURISDICTION OVER THE INSTANT CASE SINCE THE COMPLAINT WAS FILED BY A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL AND NOT THE INVESTIGATING FOREST OFFICER.<br><br><center>II.</center> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, ASSUMING THAT THE TRIAL COURT ACQUIRED JURISDICTION OVER THE INSTANT CASE, THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT APPRECIATING THE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF OLD AGE AND VOLUNTARY SURRENDER IN FAVOR OF THE PETITIONER.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Simply put, the issues of the case are as follows: (1) Whether the RTC acquired jurisdiction over Criminal Case No. 464-CR-06 even though it was based on a complaint filed by Leonora and Rhoda, who are private individuals, and not by a DENR forest officer; and (2) Whether petitioner is entitled to the mitigating circumstances of old age and of voluntary surrender.<br><br><center><b><u>Our Ruling</u></b></center><br><br><b><i>The RTC acquired jurisdiction over<br>the criminal case</i></b><br><br>In his Petition, petitioner maintains that the instant case should be dismissed on the ground of lack of jurisdiction because the complaint against him was filed by private individuals and not by any forest officer as prescribed in Section 80<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> of PD 705, as amended. Section 80 of PD 705 provides, in part:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 80 [89]. Arrest: Institution of Criminal Actions. – A forest officer or employee of the Bureau or any personnel of the Philippine Constabulary/Integrated National Police shall arrest even without warrant any person who has committed or is committing in his presence any of the offenses defined in this Chapter. He shall also seize and confiscate, in favor of the Government, the tools and equipment used in committing the offense, and the forest products cut, gathered or taken by the offender in the process of committing the offense. The arresting forest officer or employee shall thereafter deliver within six (6) hours from the time of arrest and seizure, the offender and the confiscated forest products, tools and equipment, <b><u>and file the proper complaint with, the appropriate official designated by law to conduct preliminary investigation and file information in Court.</u></b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Reports and complaints regarding the commission of any of the offenses defined in this Chapter, not committed in the presence of any forest officer or employee, or any personnel of the Philippine Constabulary/Integrated National Police or any of the deputized officers or officials, shall immediately be investigated by the forest officer assigned in the area or any personnel of the Philippine Constabulary/Integrated National Police where the offense was allegedly committed, who shall thereupon receive the evidence supporting the report or complaint.<br><br>If there is a prima facie evidence to support the complaint or report, <b><u>the investigating forest officer and/or members of the Philippine Constabulary/Integrated National Police shall file the necessary complaint with the appropriate official authorized by law to conduct a preliminary investigation of criminal case and file an information in Court.</u></b> [As amended by PD No. 1775] (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br><br>Given the above recitals, petitioner insists that only the investigating forest officers have the exclusive authority to file the complaint for violation of any of the provisions of PD No. 705 and non-compliance therewith ousts the court of its jurisdiction.<br><br>In support of his defense, petitioner pleads this Court to re-evaluale its pronouncement in <i>Merida v. People</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> <i>(Merida)</i>, where it held that <i>Section 80 of PD 705 does not prohibit a private individual from filing a complaint before any qualified officer for violation of Section 68 of PD 705</i>. Notably, the issue raised in <i>Merida</i> is identical to the one at bar – whether the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the criminal case even though it was based on a complaint filed by a private individual and not by a DENR forest officer.<br><br>Respondent, on its part, argues that by actively participating in the court proceedings, petitioner is already estopped from assailing the jurisdiction of the RTC.<br><br>At the outset, the question of jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, even on appeal. Although this doctrine has been qualified by recent pronouncements which stemmed principally from the ruling in <i>Tijam v. Sibonghanoy</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> <i>(Sibonghanoy)</i>, this Court maintains that the ruling in <i>Sibonghanoy</i> is the exception rather than the general rule.<br><br>In <i>Calimlim v. Ramirez</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> we held that the ruling in <i>Sibonghanoy</i> is an exception to the general rule that the lack of jurisdiction of a court may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, even on appeal. The Court stated further that <i>Sibonghanoy</i> is an exceptional case because of the presence of laches. Estoppel by laches may be invoked to bar the issue of lack of jurisdiction only in cases in which the factual milieu is analogous to that in the cited case,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <i>i.e.</i>, where the issue of jurisdiction was only raised for the first time in a motion to dismiss filed almost 15 years after the questioned ruling had been rendered by the lower court. In applying the principle of estoppel by laches in <i>Sibonghanoy</i>, we considered the patent inequity and unfairness of "having the judgment creditors go up their Calvary once more after more or less 15 years."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In such controversy, laches was clearly present; that is, lack of jurisdiction was raised so belatedly as to warrant the presumption that the party entitled to assert it had abandoned or declined to assert it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The factual settings attendant in <i>Sibonghanoy</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> are not present in the case at bar. It bears noting that petitioner, in his Brief and during appeal before the CA, already raised the issue on Leonora's and Rhoda's authority to file the complaint against him and Arsebino for violating the provisions of PD 705. At that time, no considerable period had yet elapsed for laches to attach.<br><br>Having disposed of the procedural issue, this Court will now proceed with the issue of whether the RTC acquired jurisdiction over the criminal case based on a complaint filed by private individuals and not by a forest officer.<br><br>To be clear, Section 80 of PD 705 contemplates two instances when a forest officer<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> may commence a prosecution for violations of PD 705. The first instance, on one hand, contemplates a situation where a forest officer arrests without a warrant any person who has committed or is committing, <u>in his presence</u>, any of the offenses described in PD 705. On the other hand, the second instance contemplates a situation where an offense described in PD 705 is <u>not committed in the presence</u> of the forest officer and the commission is brought to his attention by a report or a complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Court of First Instance of Quezon</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> this Court held that "reports and complaints" cover only such reports and complaints as might be brought to the forest officer assigned to the area by other forest officers, or any deputized officers or officials, for violations of forest laws not committed in their presence, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The trial court erred in dismissing the case on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter because the information was filed not pursuant to the complaint of any forest officer as prescribed in Section 80 of P.D. 705. We agree with the observation of the Solicitor General that:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [T]he authority given to the forest officer to investigate reports and complaints regarding the commission of offenses defined in P.D. No. 705 by the said last and penultimate paragraphs of Section 80 may be considered as covering only such reports and complaints as might be brought to the forest officer assigned to the area by other forest officers or employees of the Bureau of Forest Development, or any of the deputized officers or officials, for violations of forest laws not committed in their presence. Such interpretation becomes cogent when we consider that the whole of Section 80 deals precisely with the authority of forest officers or employees to make arrests and institute criminal actions involving offenses defined in the Decree.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote></blockquote><br><br>In both cases, the forest officer shall investigate the offender and file a complaint with the appropriate official authorized by law to conduct a preliminary investigation and file the necessary information in court.<br><br>In other words, Section 80 of PD 705 contemplates situations where acts in violation of the law were committed in the presence of forest officers, or when reports or complaints of violations of PD 705, <i>albeit</i> not committed in their presence, are brought to the attention of forest officers by other forest officers or any deputized officers or officials. In such cases, PD 705 specifically recognizes the special authority of forest officers to file the necessary complaint with the appropriate official authorized by law to conduct a preliminary investigation of criminal cases after said forest officer has conducted a warrantless arrest, seizure or confiscation of property, or after his receipt of a complaint of report of violations of PD 705, as the case may be.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The factual milieus of the case readily show that none of the two situations or instances contemplated under Section 80 of PD 705 are present which would thereby trigger the application of its provisions relating to commencement of criminal prosecution by a forest officer. In this case, it was not a forest officer who reported to Kitayan the tree-cutting activities of petitioner and Arsebino in Cotcot, Bangao, Buguias, Benguet, but Leonora, a private individual, who had a land dispute with Arsebino over the land covering the cutting site. Hence, Section 80, particularly the second category thereof, will not apply in the instant case.<br><br>To further support his argument, petitioner cites Rule 110 of the Rules of Court which provides, among others, for certain crimes that may not be prosecuted unless the complaint has been filed by specific individuals. Petitioner maintains that cases involving violations of PD 705 fall within the contemplation of the said rule – that violations of PD 705 may not be prosecuted unless the complaint has been filed by the investigating forest officer. This contention deserves scant consideration.<br><br>Whether Section 80 of PD 705 contemplates complaints or reports coming from private individuals or by other forest officers or deputized officials, Leonora and/or Rhoda were not precluded by law from filing a complaint with the Provincial Prosecutor for petitioner's alleged violation of Section 68 of PD 705.<br><br>Section 3, Rule 110<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> of the Rules of Court enumerates the persons who are authorized to file a criminal complaint. The "complaint" mentioned in this provision, however, refers to one <u>filed in court</u> for the commencement of a criminal prosecution for violation of a crime. This does not refer to a complaint <u>filed with the Prosecutor's Office.</u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>As a rule, a criminal action contemplated under Rule 110 is commenced by a complaint or information, both of which are filed in court. Thus, if a complaint is filed directly in court, the same must be filed by those persons delineated in Sections 3 and 5 of the same rule, such as the offended party. In the case of an information, the same must be filed by the fiscal or prosecutor. However, a "complaint" filed with the fiscal or prosecutor from which he/she may initiate a preliminary investigation may be filed by any person.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In this regard, Section 80 of PD 705 clearly shows that a preliminary investigation is commenced after a complaint for violations of the law is filed with a fiscal or prosecutor. <i>People v. Court of First Instance of Quezon</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> is instructive:<br><br><blockquote>Likewise, the Solicitor General was correct in insisting that P.D. 705 did not repeal Section 1687 of the Administrative Code giving authority to the fiscal to conduct investigation into the matter of any crime or misdemeanor and have the necessary information or complaint prepared or made against persons charged with the commission of the crime.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b><u>With the exception of the so-called "private crimes" and in election offenses, prosecutions in Courts of First Instance may be commenced by an information signed by a fiscal after conducting a preliminary investigation.</u></b> Section 80 of P.D. 705 did not divest the fiscals of this general authority. Neither did the said decree grant forest officers the right of preliminary investigations. In both cases under said Sec. 80 namely, 1) after a forest officer had made the arrest (for offenses committed in his presence) or; 2) after conducting an investigation of reports or complaints of violations of the decree (for violations not committed in his presence) — <b><u>he is still required to file the proper complaint with the appropriate official designated by law to conduct preliminary investigations in court.</u></b> Said section should not be interpreted to vest exclusive authority upon forest officers to conduct investigations regarding offenses described in the decree rather, it should be construed as granting forest officers and employees special authority to arrest and investigate offenses described in P.D. 705, to reinforce the exercise of such authority by those upon whom it is vested by general law.</blockquote><br><br>Considering the foregoing, the complaint may thus be filed with the Provincial Prosecutor not only by a forest officer, but also by private individuals such as Leonora and Rhoda.<br><br>Petitioner, nonetheless, further argues that PD 705, being a special law, should prevail over the general rule provided in Rule 110 of the Rules of Court that anyone, whether a private individual or not, may initiate criminal proceedings through the filing of a complaint before officers authorized to conduct preliminary investigation.<br><br>We disagree. As already held by this Court in <i>Merida</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>:<br><br><blockquote>The Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure (Revised Rules) list the cases which must be initiated by a complaint filed by specified individuals, non-compliance of which ousts the trial court of jurisdiction from trying such cases. However, these cases concern only defamation and other crimes against chastity and not to cases concerning Section 68 of PD 705, as amended. x x x (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Hence, <i>a complaint for purposes of preliminary investigation by the fiscal need not be filed by the offended party. "The rule has been that, unless the offense subject thereof is one that cannot be prosecuted de oficio </i>[or is private in nature]<i>, the same may be filed, for preliminary investigation purposes, by any competent person."</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> <i>Proceeding from the forgoing discussion, the complaint thus filed by Leonora and Rhoda with the Provincial Prosecutor was valid.</i><br><br>While we are not unaware that prosecution for violation of special laws shall be governed by its provisions,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> this Court is not inclined to interpret Section 80 of PD 705 as to limit the authority to file criminal complaints to forest officers.<br><br><i>Admittedly, there are certain instances when an administrative body is vested exclusive authority to determine when to institute a criminal action for a violation of the law entrusted to it for administration or enforcement to the exclusion of the regular prosecution service of the government. Thus, in Mead v. Argel</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> <i>(Mead)</i>, this Court held that a prosecutor may only fie an information for violations of the Anti Pollution Law (Republic Act No. 3931) only after the National Water and Air Pollution Control Commission has determined that the offender indeed caused pollution. The filing of the information for violation of the law prior to such determination is premature and unauthorized. Thus, the court is without jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offense charged in the information.<br><br>Along the same lines, this Court, in <i>Yao Lit v. Geraldez,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> <b><i>upheld the authority of the Commissioner of Immigration to determine whether to impose an administrative fine or to prosecute criminally the offender before the court for committing acts in violation of the provisions of the Alien Registration Act of 1950 (Republic Act No. 751).

As in Mead,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the determination of the existence of "pollution" requires specialized knowledge of technical and scientific terms – matters which are not ordinarily within the competence of fiscals or of those sitting in a court of justice, more so on the part of ordinary private individuals.

Moreover, PD 705 was further amended precisely to "encourage and further expand the participation of the <i>private sector</i> in forest management, protection and development as well as in wood processing activities within the concept of joint or co-management of the forest resources."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>All told, Section 89 of PD 705 should not be interpreted to vest exclusive authority upon forest officers to conduct investigations and file criminal complaints regarding offenses described in PD 705. Rather, said provision should be construed as a recognition and reinforcement of their special authority to conduct warrantless arrests, seize and confiscate property, and proceeding therefrom, file the necessary complaints against forestry law offenders.<br><br><b><i>Petitioner is not entitled to the<br>mitigating circumstance of voluntary<br>surrender.</i></b><br><br>As earlier mentioned, petitioner filed his motion for reconsideration of the January 16, 2014 Decision of the CA where, for the first time, he brought to the attention of the CA the mitigating circumstances of voluntary surrender and old age for the purpose of modifying and imposing the proper penalty against him. As his motion for reconsideration was denied, petitioner now imputes fault on the CA for not appreciating the two mitigating circumstances in his favor.<br><br>The CA was correct in refusing to take cognizance of the belatedly raised issue of whether or not petitioner is entitled to the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.<br><br>It is well-settled that no question will be entertained on appeal unless it has been raised in the proceedings below. "Points of law, theories, issues and arguments not brought to the attention of the lower court x x x need not be considered by a reviewing court, as they cannot be raised for the first time at that late stage.

The essence of voluntary surrender is spontaneity and the intent of the accused to give himself up and submit himself to the authorities, either because he acknowledges his guilt or he wishes to save the authorities the trouble and expense that may be incurred for his search and capture."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Thus, if such mitigating circumstance was considered by the CA, or this Court for that matter, the prosecution would be denied due process as it would have been denied the opportunity to present evidence to disprove that petitioner did surrender spontaneously and voluntarily to the authorities.<br><br>In any event, issues raised for the first time on appeal is barred by estoppel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Failure to assert issues and arguments "within a reasonable time" warrants a presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned or declined to assert it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the supposed failure on the part of the CA to appreciate the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender in petitioner's favor cannot now be raised as an assignment of error in the present petition.<br><br>This Court, however, is aware that herein petitioner is 83 years old as of date as evidenced by his Certificate of Live Birth<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> issued by the Municipal Civil Registrar of Buguias, Benguet.

In so ruling, the CA explained that since none of the qualifying circumstances in Article 310 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) was alleged in the information, the penalty cannot be increased to two degrees higher. Thus, the proper imposable penalty is that which is prescribed under Article 309 of the RPC. As to the imposable penalty on the petitioner, the CA imposed an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years of <i>prision correccional</i> as minimum, to ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i> as maximum in accordance with the penalty prescribed under Article 309 of the RPC.<br><br><i>The Court does not agree.</i><br><br>Section 68 of PD 705,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> as amended, refers to Articles 309 and 310 of the RPC for the penalties to be imposed on violators.
