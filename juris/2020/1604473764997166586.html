In this light, and in order to avert any grave and irreparable injury to it, its employees, various stakeholders, and the public in general, ABS-CBN reiterated its prayer for the Court to immediately issue a TRO or WPI to, in the meantime, restrain the implementation of the CDO.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution dated May 19, 2020, the Court resolved to: (<i>a</i>) require the NTC to comment on the petition and urgent applications for the issuance of a TRO and/or WPI; (<i>b</i>) separately implead the House of Representatives and the Senate as parties to this case and require them to likewise comment on the petition and urgent applications for a TRO and/or WPI; and (<i>c</i>) require NTC to file a reply to the aforesaid comments of the House of Representatives and Senate.

NTC (Associated Communications)</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the Court defined a "franchise [as] the privilege granted by the State through its <u><b>legislative body</b></u> x x x subject to regulation by the State itself by virtue of its police power through its administrative agencies."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> On this score, Section 11, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution further states that "for the operation of a public utility," no "such franchise or right [shall] be granted except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal <u><b>by the Congress</b></u> when the common good so requires."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>With respect to the broadcast industry, Section 1 of Act No. 3846,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> as amended, clearly provides that "[n]o person, firm, company, association or corporation shall construct, install, establish, or operate a radio station within the Philippine Islands <b>without having first obtained a franchise therefor from the Philippine Legislature</b> x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> It has also been clarified in <i>Associated Communications</i> that a congressional franchise is required to operate radio, <u>as well as television stations</u>, in light of the subsequent issuance of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 576-A.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>In this relation, Section 6 of PD 576-A further imposes, as an additional requirement to operate a radio or television station, an "authority" coming from "the Board of Communications and the Secretary of Public Works and Communications or their successors [(<i>i.e.</i>, the NTC<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>)] who have the right and authority to assign to qualified parties frequencies, channels or other means of identifying broadcasting systems." In <i>Divinagracia v. Consolidated Broadcasting System, Inc.</i> (<i>Divinagracia</i>),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> citing <i>Associated Communications</i>, this Court ruled that the legislative franchise requirement under Act No. 3846, as amended, was not repealed by the additional requirement imposed in PD 576-A.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Instead, they co­exist. Thus, in <i>Divinagracia</i>, it was explained that:<br><blockquote><b>Broadcast and television stations are required to obtain a legislative franchise, a requirement imposed by the Radio Control Act and affirmed by our ruling in <i>Associated Broadcasting</i>.</b> After securing their legislative franchises, stations are required to obtain CPCs from the NTC before they can operate their radio or television broadcasting systems. Such requirement while traceable also to the Radio Control Act, currently finds its basis in E.O. No. 546, the law establishing the NTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In this case, ABS-CBN seeks that the Court annul and set aside the CDO issued by the NTC ordering it to cease and desist from operating its radio and television stations enumerated therein. The core of ABS-CBN's petition rests on its argument that <b>the NTC should not have pre-empted the will of Congress</b> by directing it (ABS-CBN) to halt its broadcasting operations through said stations <b>pending the determination of Congress on the renewal of its legislative franchise based on the bills specifically filed therefor</b>. In other words, ABS-CBN banks on the fact that since Congress has yet to act on these pending bills, there is still a possibility that its legislative franchise would be renewed; hence, the NTC should not have overtaken Congress' action on these pending bills by issuing the assailed CDO. In this regard, ABS-CBN claims that Congress has the "<u><b>corollary power</b></u>" to define and preserve rights and obligations <b>pending its final determination on the matter</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Notably, ABS-CBN's position is echoed in the "guidance" issued by the DOJ Secretary, which submits that the plenary power of Congress includes the <u><b>auxiliary power</b></u> to define and preserve the rights of the franchise applicant <b>pending final determination of the renewal of the franchise</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>However, the Court takes judicial notice of the fact that on July 10, 2020, the House Committee on Legislative Franchises had adopted the recommendation of the Technical Working Group (TWG) to "<b>deny the application of ABS-CBN Corporation for a franchise to construct, install, establish, operate and maintain radio and broadcasting stations in the Philippines</b>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> by an overwhelming 70 affirmative votes<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> from the 85 voting members present.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> While ABS-CBN states that there are two (2) pending bills for the renewal of its legislative franchise authored by members of the Senate,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> the Constitution provides that private bills,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> such as those pertaining to the grant or renewal of a franchise, <i>must exclusively originate from the lower house of Congress</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Accordingly, these pending Senate bills were referred to the Senate Committee on Rules,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> and now, the Senate Committee on Public Services.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Pursuant to existing jurisprudence, these "substitute" bills are nonetheless only prepared in anticipation of the corresponding bill from the lower House, and that the action of the Senate as a body is withheld pending receipt of the said House bill.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The anticipated House bills raised in the petition, however, had already been passed upon by the House Committee on Legislative Franchises, and as mentioned, had already been denied.

On the other hand, <i>should the Court grant the petition on the merits</i>, the nullification of the CDO will be of no practical consequence since based on our Constitution and laws, a legislative franchise is necessary for a broadcasting entity to legally operate its radio and television stations. <b>Thus, even if the CDO is annulled as prayed for, ABS-CBN cannot altogether resume its broadcast operations through its radio and television stations because its legislative franchise therefor bad already expired and that, considerh1g the denial of the House Committee on Legislative Franchises, has not been renewed.</b><br><br>While indeed Congress has the plenary power to grant or renew legislative franchises and that this power has no time limitation, it must be borne in mind that ABS-CBN's petition against the NTC is specifically anchored on the uncertainty that the then-pending franchise renewal bills may be granted by Congress and hence, in the meantime, should ·have precluded the NTC from issuing any interim CDO pending Congress' determination on the matter. However, since these bills had already been denied, ABS-CBN's position lost its foundation and more so, legitimizes the current state of affairs that ABS-CBN cannot legally operate its radio and television operations absent a legislative franchise therefor. Suffice it to say that any future favorable action upon a newly-filed franchise renewal bill goes beyond the scope of this case, which is anchored only on the franchise renewal bills pending in Congress at the time the NTC issued the assailed CDO. Besides, a broadcasting entity with an expired legislative franchise cannot simply bank on the speculation of any future favorable congressional action on its expired franchise since to do so would permit it to indefinitely circumvent the constitutional and statutory requirement of a valid and subsisting legislative franchise altogether.<br><br>At any rate, the Court finds that ABS-CBN failed to provide sufficient legal basis to support its theory on Congress' so-called "corollary/auxiliary" powers pending determination of the renewal of its expired franchise. On the contrary, what is sufficiently clear to the Court is that, under our present legal framework, a legislative franchise granting broadcasting entities the privilege to broadcast their programs through television and radio stations in the country must be in the form of a duly enacted law. <u><i>The congressional deliberations on pending bills are not equivalent and cannot take the place of a duly enacted law, which requires the entire constitutional process for legislation to take its full course.</i></u> Neither can it be inferred from our Constitution and our present statutes that temporary statutory privileges may be accorded to a franchise applicant pending deliberation of a franchise grant or renewal. Indeed, it is only upon the completion of the full law-making procedure in accordance with the parameters prescribed by the Constitution can it be said that Congress has granted a broadcasting entity the statutory privilege to so broadcast its programs through its television and radio stations. Absent a valid and subsisting legislative franchise embodied in a duly passed law, no such statutory privilege, even if temporary, can be enjoyed.<br><br>On this note, it is apt to explain that it was actually because of ABS­ CBN's argument on Congress' so-called "corollary/auxiliary" powers that the Court deemed it necessary to implead<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> the two (2) Houses of Congress as parties to this case if only to accord them the opportunity to be heard. Notably, the Court's directive to implead was made prior to the denial of the franchise renewal bills as above-mentioned. Nonetheless, both the Senate and the House of Representatives requested not to participate in the proceedings, considering that petitioner ABS-CBN has not, in fact, asked for any relief against them but only against the NTC which issued the assailed CDO. As the Court's only intention was to accord its co-equal branch of government due process because of the prospect of tackling a delicate constitutional issue, and considering now that the pertinent issue affecting them had already been rendered moot, the Court therefore grants the requests of both Houses to be discharged as parties to this case as prayed for in their submissions. "Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or on its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>Finally, the Court recognizes that ABS-CBN also raises grounds other than its theory on "corollary/auxiliary" powers. These are: (<i>a</i>) violation of the equal protection clause given that the NTC has in the past allowed broadcast entities to operate pending renewal of their franchises; (<i>b</i>) violation of due process as it was not given the opportunity to be heard before the CDO was issued; and (<i>c</i>) violation of freedom of the press and the right to public information because of its "significant role" in disseminating news during this public health emergency.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> All the same, however, the resolution of these issues cannot yield any actual practical relief in favor of ABS-CBN because, by force of our Constitution and laws, it cannot be allowed to legally operate the television and radio stations covered by the said CDO absent a legislative franchise for this purpose, and considering the fact that the pending bills for its renewal had already been denied through official congressional action.<br><br>In closing, while the Court understands the plight and concerns of ABS-CBN, its employees, and its supporters in general, it wishes to emphasize that the act of granting or renewing legislative franchises is beyond the Court's power. Congress has the <b>sole authority</b> to grant and renew legislative franchises for broadcasting entities, such as ABS-CBN, to legally broadcast their programs through allocated frequencies for the purpose. As it presently stands, the legislative branch of our government has yet to grant or renew ABS-CBN's legislative franchise, which decision - whether fortunate or unfortunate - this Court must impartially respect, else it violates the fundamental principle of separation of powers.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court resolves to: (1) <b>DROP</b> the House of Representatives and the Senate of the Philippines as parties to this case; and (2) <b>DISMISS</b> the petition on the ground of mootness.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Peralta, C.

This Petition became moot the moment the House Committee on Legislative Franchises denied petitioner ABS-CBN Corporation's application for franchise renewal.<br><br>The non-renewal was <b><i>not</i></b> made an issue in this case, and petitioner filed no supplemental pleading either. Thus, any resolution here would have been limited to issues originally raised, namely: (1) whether a <i>status quo ante</i> order should have been issued; and (2) under the special circumstances of this case, whether respondent National Telecommunications Commission gravely abused its discretion in issuing the Cease and Desist Order while the House was deliberating on the renewal.<br><br>However, even with the issues that constrain us, I find that this case is capable of repetition yet evading review. For one, this could happen again to any other media network. Its consequences affect the shaping of public opinion, since we deal here with the media and journalists, those who assist the electorate and the people, as sovereign, in exercising their right to freely express well-considered opinions.<br><br>Therefore, I deem it my duty to state my opinion on some of the fundamental issues raised in the Petition as guidance for the Bench and Bar. I would have voted to issue a <i>status quo ante</i> order and eventually declare that respondent gravely abused its discretion in its unprecedented issuance of the Cease and Desist Order-more so when viewed in the context of this case and the regulatory agency's policy.<br><br>Freedom of expression is a primordial right. Amid the ever complex digital means of communication now within the public's grasp, the media plays a large role to provide not only information, but information that is factual and true-that which is governed by the code of journalistic ethics, and which belies the irresponsible posts and rumors on social media.<br><br>Just the same, broadcast media remains one of the major channels of information today. Hence, to silence a network of such huge scale, one that has provided vital news to the country-now, more than ever, amid the pandemic-is not only <i>prima facie</i> censorship, but is an outright denial of information from the Filipino people who need it most.<br><br>Given that other media giants with expired franchises had been allowed to operate pending the renewal of their applications, and considering the House's documented delay in acting on petitioner's franchise, respondent's extraordinary action not only took the House by surprise, but also affected the sovereign discussion on matters related to the governance of the arts.<br><br><center><b>I</b><https: legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com="" private+bills=""><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="18&amp;q=SBN-981"><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="l8&amp;q=SBN-1403"></http:></http:></https:><br><https: legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com="" private+bills=""><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="18&amp;q=SBN-981"><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="l8&amp;q=SBN-1403"></http:></http:></https:></center><br>A <i>status quo</i> has been defined as "the last actual peaceful uncontested situation that precedes a controversy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In its ordinary meaning, "<i>status quo</i> is the existing state of affairs[,] while <i>status quo ante</i> refers to the state of affairs that existed previously."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Status quo ante</i> is a Latin term for "the way things were before."

As the long succession of cases will show, this Court has repeatedly restored the <i>status quo ante</i> for several compelling reasons that cater to the demands of justice and equity.<br><br><i>Status quo ante</i> first appeared in our jurisprudence in 1913.

In <i>Beltran v. Diaz</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> it was faced by a <i>fait accompli</i> after the People's Court had canceled the petitioner's bail and had him arrested despite lack of evidence to cancel the bail. This Court upheld its duty to "restore petitioner to his <i>status quo ante</i> as. far as is possible" by allowing his release upon the filing and approval of a new bail bond.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Reverting to the issue of execution pending appeal raised in <i>Molina</i>, this Court in the 1948 case of <i>Naredo v.

In the 1950 case of <i>Juan P. Pellicer &amp; Co., Inc. v.

Similarly, in the 1960 case of <i>Inco v.

It explained that "[t]he interests of society demand that bad faith and fraud be severely repressed, and the Courts cannot consent to their furtherance, directly or indirectly."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> This Court has also held that the <i>status quo ante</i> cannot be restored when the acts complained of have been done or executed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><i>Status quo ante</i> has also been applied in discussing moral damages. In 1964, Justice J.B.L. Reyes, in his concurring and dissenting opinion in <i>Pangasinan Transportation Company, Inc. v. Legaspi</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> coined the term "spiritual <i>status quo ante</i>" as the aim of an award of moral damages:<br><blockquote>Moral damages are emphatically not intended to enrich a complainant at the expense of a defendant; they are awarded only to enable the injured party to obtain means, diversions or amusements that will serve to alleviate the moral suffering he has undergone, by reason of the defendant's culpable action. . . . In other words, the award of moral damages is aimed at a restoration, within the limits of the possible, of the spiritual <i>status quo ante</i>: and, therefore, it must be proportionate to the suffering inflicted. The intensity of the pain experienced by the relatives of the victim is proportionate to the intensity of the affection for him and bears no relation whatever with the wealth or means of the offender. The death caused by a beggar is felt by the parents of the victim as intensely as that caused by the scion of a wealthy family.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote>This doctrine has been cited as early as 1979 in <i>Grand Union Supermarket, Inc. v.

That same year, this Court in <i>Banzon v.

In <i>Reyes v. Lim</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> this Court decided that rescission will not be ordered unless there can be restitution or the status quo ante is restored. In <i>Pryce Corporation v.

Also, <i>unlike a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, a <i>status quo</i> order is more in the nature of a cease and desist order</i>, since it neither directs the doing or undoing of acts as in the case of prohibitory or mandatory injunctive relief.

It is proper only when the plaintiff appears to be entitled to the relief demanded in the complaint. In particular, the existence of the right and the violation thereof must appear in the allegations of the complaint and must constitute at least a <i>prima facie</i> showing of a right to the final relief. Thus, there are two requisite conditions for the issuance of a preliminary injunction; namely, (1) the right to be protected exists <i>prima facie</i>, and (2) the acts sought to be enjoined are violative of that right. It must be proven that the violation sought to be prevented would cause an irreparable injustice.<br><br>Further, while a clear showing of the right is necessary, its existence need not be conclusively established. In fact, the evidence required to justify the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction in the hearing thereon need not be conclusive or complete. The evidence need only be a "sampling" intended merely to give the court an idea of the justification for the preliminary injunction, pending the decision of the case on the merits.

[T]he necessity of notice and hearing in an administrative proceeding depends on the character of the proceeding and the circumstances involved. In so far as generalization is possible in view of the great variety of administrative proceedings, it may be stated as a general rule that notice and hearing are not essential to the validity of administrative action where the administrative body acts in the exercise of executive, administrative, or legislative functions; but <i>where a public administrative body acts in a judicial or quasi-­judicial matter, and its acts are particular and immediate rather than general and prospective, the person whose rights or property may be affected by the action is entitled to notice and hearing</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote></http:></http:></https:><https: legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com="" private+bills=""><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="18&amp;q=SBN-981"><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="l8&amp;q=SBN-1403"></http:></http:></https:><https: legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com="" private+bills=""><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="18&amp;q=SBN-981"><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="l8&amp;q=SBN-1403">Moreover, in <i>Montoya v.

Unarguably, this rule, as it is stated, strips down administrative due process to its most fundamental nature and sufficiently justifies freeing administrative proceedings from the rigidity of procedural requirements. In particular, however, due process in administrative proceedings has also been recognized to include the following: (1) the right to actual or constructive notice of the institution of proceedings which may affect a respondent's legal rights; (2) a real opportunity to be heard personally or with the assistance of counsel, to present witnesses and evidence in one's favor, and to defend one's rights; (3) a tribunal vested with competent jurisdiction and so constituted as to afford a person charged administratively a reasonable guarantee of honesty as well as impartiality; and (4) a finding by said tribunal which is supported by substantial evidence submitted for consideration during the hearing or contained in the records or made known to the parties affected.<br><br>Hence, even if administrative tribunals exercising quasi-judicial powers are not strictly bound by procedural requirements, they are still bound by law and equity to observe the fundamental requirements of due process. Notice to enable the other party to be heard and to present evidence is not a mere technicality or a trivial matter in any administrative or judicial proceedings.

At any rate, it is hard to conceive how it would be for the public's best interests to enjoin petitioner from going on air, or how the public would be seriously and irreparably injured by allowing petitioner to continue its broadcast operations. Neither has any urgent and paramount need been shown for the Cease and Desist Order to be issued.<br><br>On the other hand, this Court has held that a license "is an operating authority of importance involving primarily the interest of the public," and the "valuable rights and investments made in reliance on a license ... should not be destroyed ... except for the most compelling reasons."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br><center><b>II (B)</b></center><br><i>Second</i>, even if petitioner's permits were to be rendered expired <i>ipso facto</i> upon the expiry of the legislative franchise, the issuance of the Cease and Desist Order would still be improper.

On February 26, 2020, two more bills were filed in the House and the Senate, respectively-one until May 4, 2021,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> and the other until December 31, 2020.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> The extensions were sought to give both houses of Congress more time to assess the pending bills.<br><br>On March 10, 2020, the House Committee on Legislative Franchises finally began proceedings for the hearings on these bills.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> However, when COVID-19 struck the country, deliberations were suspended in view of the enhanced community quarantine.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, while Congress cannot be faulted for suspending the deliberations, the fact remains that as early as 2014, franchise renewal applications had been lodged in Congress. For six long years, these bills had hung like a sword of Damocles over petitioner, leaving it without any clear resolution on whether its franchise would be renewed at all.<br><br>The inaction on these pending bills would not have been suspect, had it not been in sharp contrast to Congress' swift action on the franchise renewal of petitioner's leading rival, GMA Network, Inc. House Bill No. 4631 was filed in the 17<sup>th</sup> Congress on December 7, 2016.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> Barely a month later, on January 16, 2017, the House approved the bill, and transmitted it to the Senate two days later. The Senate passed the bill on March 13, 2017, and the House concurred with the amendments a day later. Finally, on April 21, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte (President Duterte) signed the bill into Republic Act No. 10925.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> The entire renewal process took merely four months and only required the filing of one House bill.<br><br>As for petitioner's franchise, there is no clear technical reason why the numerous bills for its renewal stalled in Congress for over half a decade. The closest to it is found in House Resolution No. 639, which stated that the delay was "possibly due to President Duterte's objection to subject renewal[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> Besides that, no other reason has been offered as to why the House could only act on the bills on March 10, 2020, six years after the first one had been filed.<br><br>According to petitioner, its market share is estimated to be anywhere from 31% to 44%, making it one of the largest broadcast stations in the country.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> This means that petitioner provided access to news and entertainment to the majority population. Therefore, the delay in the franchise renewal deliberations for no technical reason at all effectively silenced petitioner, which amounts to a <i>prima facie</i> censorship. This, in the words of Justice J.B.L. Reyes:<br><blockquote>. . . [is] not a mere instance of official indolence, but a subtle attempt to impose absolute radio [and television] censorship, and to silence at will radio [and television] stations which allow airing of views critical of the powers that be. We should be ever alert to such indirect subversion of the constitutional liberties of speech and of the press.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup></blockquote>Indeed, such exercise of censorship is an assault on the right to free speech that is engraved in our fundamental law. In <i>Newsounds Broadcasting Network v. Dy</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> this Court elaborated:<br><blockquote>[I]t cannot be denied that our Constitution has a systemic bias towards free speech. The absolutist tenor of Section 4, Article III testifies to that fact. The individual discomforts to particular people or enterprises engendered by the exercise of the right, for which at times remedies may be due, do not diminish the indispensable nature of free expression to the democratic way of life.<br><br>The following undisputed facts bring the issue of free expression to fore. Petitioners are authorized by law to operate radio stations in Cauayan City, and had been doing so for some years undisturbed by local authorities. Beginning in 2002, respondents in their official capacities have taken actions, whatever may be the motive, that have impeded the ability of petitioners to freely broadcast, if not broadcast at all. These actions have ranged from withholding permits to operate to the physical closure of those stations under color of legal authority. While once petitioners were able to broadcast freely, the weight of government has since bore down upon them to silence their voices on the airwaves. An elementary school child with a basic understanding of civics lessons will recognize that free speech animates these cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup></blockquote>Furthermore, under Article XII, Section 11 of the Constitution, Congress has the sole prerogative of granting or denying franchises of broadcast networks:<br></http:></http:></https:><blockquote><https: legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com="" private+bills=""><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="18&amp;q=SBN-981"><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="l8&amp;q=SBN-1403">SECTION 11.

Neither shall any such franchise or right be granted except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress when the common good so requires.

In Divinagracia,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> this Court explained the dichotomy between the grant of legislative franchises by Congress and the issuance of regulatory licenses by the National Telecommunications Commission:<br><blockquote>The complexities of our dual franchise/license regime for broadcast media should be understood within the context of separation of powers. The right of a particular entity to broadcast over the airwaves is established by law - <i>i.e.</i>, the legislative franchise - and determined by Congress, the branch of government tasked with the creation of rights and obligations. As with all other laws passed by Congress, the function of the executive branch of government, to which the NTC belongs, is the implementation of the law. In broad theory, the legal obligation of the NTC once Congress has established a legislative franchise for a broadcast media station is to facilitate the operation by the franchisee of its broadcast stations. However, since the public administration of the airwaves is a requisite for the operation of a franchise and is moreover a highly technical function, Congress has delegated to the NTC the task of administration over the broadcast spectrum, including the determination of available bandwidths and the allocation of such available bandwidths among the various legislative franchisees. The licensing power of the NTC thus arises from the necessary delegation by Congress of legislative power geared towards the orderly exercise by franchisees of the rights granted them by Congress.<br><br>Congress may very well in its wisdom impose additional obligations on the various franchisees and accordingly delegate to the NTC the power to ensure that the broadcast stations comply with their obligations under the law. Because broadcast media enjoys a lesser degree of free expression protection as compared to their counterparts in print, these legislative restrictions are generally permissible under the Constitution. Yet no enactment of Congress may contravene the Constitution and its Bill of Rights; hence, whatever restrictions are imposed by Congress on broadcast media franchisees remain susceptible to judicial review and analysis under the jurisprudential framework for scrutiny of free expression cases involving the broadcast media.<br><br>The restrictions enacted by Congress on broadcast media franchisees have to pass the mettle of constitutionality. On the other hand, the restrictions imposed by an administrative agency such as the NTC on broadcast media franchisees will have to pass not only the test of constitutionality, but also the test of authority and legitimacy, <i>i.e.</i>, whether such restrictions have been imposed in the exercise of duly delegated legislative powers from Congress. If the restriction or sanction imposed by the administrative agency cannot trace its origin from legislative delegation, whether it is by virtue of a specific grant or from valid delegation of rule-­making power to the administrative agency, then the action of such administrative agency cannot be sustained. The life and authority of an administrative agency emanates solely from an Act of Congress, and its faculties confined within the parameters set by the legislative branch of government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup></blockquote>Moreover, respondent utterly disregarded the official communication from the House of Representatives,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> which called for it to issue petitioner a provisional authority pending the franchise renewal deliberations; as well as Senate Resolution No. 344, adopted on March 4, 2020, which also called for the same provisional authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> This baseless act of defiance should have no place in our system of government.<br><br>By issuing a Cease and Desist Order, respondent, a regulatory agency, effectively removed an entire broadcast network from the airwaves notwithstanding the bills for franchise renewal pending in Congress. Since its Order already operates as a franchise denial, respondent has already preempted any action by Congress--even without having the delegated authority to do so:<br><blockquote>The licensing authority of the NTC is not on equal footing with the franchising authority of the State through Congress. The issuance of licenses by the NTC implements the legislative franchises established by Congress, in the same manner that the executive branch implements the laws of Congress rather than creates its own laws. And similar to the inability of the executive branch to prevent the implementation of laws by Congress, the NTC cannot, without clear and proper delegation by Congress, prevent the exercise of a legislative franchise by withholding or canceling the licenses of the franchisee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup></blockquote>As mentioned, petitioner is one of the largest broadcast networks in the country, delivering news and information to a majority of the population. Even if the Cease and Desist Order were to be withdrawn, it is unclear whether petitioner would be able to operate immediately. It would need days for the network to get back on the air. Every day that it is off the air, information is being denied to the people.<br><br>All this happened while this country is in the midst of a public health crisis. Mass media remains one of the public's main access points of information, and its role cannot be overemphasized:<br><blockquote>An informed citizenry with access to the diverse currents in political, moral and artistic thought and data relative to them, and the free exchange of ideas and discussion of issues thereon, is vital to the democratic government envisioned under our Constitution. The cornerstone of this republican system of government is delegation of power by the people to the State. In this system, governmental agencies and institutions operate within the limits of the authority conferred by the people. Denied access to information on the inner workings of government, the citizenry can become prey to the whims and caprices of those to whom the power had been delegated. The postulate of public office as a public trust, institutionalized in the Constitution (in Art. XI, Sec. 1) to protect the people from abuse of governmental power, would certainly be mere empty words if access to such information of public concern is denied, except under limitations prescribed by implementing legislation adopted pursuant to the Constitution.<br><br>Petitioners are practitioners in media. As such, they have both the right to gather and the obligation to check the accuracy of information they disseminate. For them, the freedom of the press and of speech is not only critical, but vital to the exercise of their professions. The right of access to information ensures that these freedoms are not rendered nugatory by the government's monopolizing pe1iinent information. For an essential element of these freedoms is to keep open a continuing dialogue or process of communication between the government and the people. It is in the interest of the State that the channels for free political discussion be maintained to the end that the government may perceive and be responsive to the people's will. Yet, this open dialogue can be effective only to the extent that the citizenry is informed and thus able to formulate its will intelligently. Only when the participants in the discussion are aware of the issues and have access to information relating thereto can such bear fruit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup></blockquote></http:></http:></https:><div align="center"><b><https: legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com="" private+bills=""><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="18&amp;q=SBN-981"><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="l8&amp;q=SBN-1403">A FINAL NOTE</http:></http:></https:></b><br><https: legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com="" private+bills=""><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="18&amp;q=SBN-981"><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="l8&amp;q=SBN-1403"></http:></http:></https:></div><https: legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com="" private+bills=""><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="18&amp;q=SBN-981"><http: senate.gov.ph="" lis="" bill="" res.aspx?congress="l8&amp;q=SBN-1403"><br>I am not under the illusion that petitioner only produces quality programs aimed to educate and inform the public. Nor were all its presentations near the kind of quality art deserving of attention from its audience. Some of the network's offerings (like some of its noon time shows) had no value other than mindless entertainment that wasted the opportunity to uplift our people in exchange for ratings and advertisement by addressing the basest instinct of human beings.<br><br>Undoubtedly, independent of any judgment on the content of its programs, the quality of information-including the arts relating to mass entertainment-will be gravely affected by petitioner's fate. From the facts of this case, one cannot but help note the extraordinary challenges it faced. That special attention, which resulted in the protracted process to decide 'on the renewal of a franchise that petitioner had held for decades, should have certainly invited more exacting inquiry from this Court.<br><br>In this age, there is a necessity for journalism-with all the ethics that goes with the profession-to prevail over the extraordinary access that is out there on social media, blogs, and other digital sources that can certainly be called misinformation and propaganda.
