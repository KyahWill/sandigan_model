The RTC ruled that these circumstances, in addition to the demeanor of Juare and Aguadilla during the trial, convinced the court that they were guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged. The RTC gave more weight to the circumstantial evidence over the mere defense of <i>alibi</i> and denial proffered by Juare and Aguadilla.<br><br>Juare and Aguadilla filed a Notice of Appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><center><i>The Ruling of the CA</i><br></center><br>On July 4, 2017, the CA affirmed the RTC's Decision convicting Juare and Aguadilla for the crime of Robbery with Homicide but modified the award of damages consonant with recent jurisprudence.<br><br>In affirming Juare and Aguadilla's conviction, the CA also appreciated the circumstantial evidence against them. It noted in particular the blood-stained knife that belonged to the victim that was recovered from the house of Aguadilla and the blood-stained shorts that was recovered from Juare's room. Both items were discovered the morning after the incident and after the body of the victim was found. It likewise gave weight to Teresita's testimony that the three doors of the building can only be locked from the inside, and no one can enter it without being let in by somebody from the inside.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> It ruled that the RTC is in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses since it had the opportunity to observe first-hand their demeanor, conduct, and attitude when they testified in court.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the appeal is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit. The Decision October 23, 2014 rendered by the Regional Trial Court of the City of Malabon, Branch 170. in Criminal Case No. 22886-MN is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, in that accused-appellants are ordered to pay the heirs of the victim Adela Abella civil indemnity in the amount P75,000.00, moral damages in the amount of P75,000.00 and exemplary damages in the amount of P75,000.00 in addition to the actual damages.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote>Unsatisfied with the CA's Decision, Juare and Aguadilla are now before the Court through an appeal.<br><br>The parties adopted their respective Appellant's and Appellee's Briefs filed before the CA as their Supplemental Briefs before the Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><center><i>The Issue</i><br></center><br>The primordial issue for the Court's resolution is whether the guilt of Juare and Aguadilla for the complex crime of Robbery with Homicide has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><center><i>The Ruling of the Court</i><br></center><br>The appeal must fail.<br><br>Time and again, this Court has deferred to the trial court's factual findings and evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, especially when affirmed by the CA, in the absence of any clear showing that the trial court overlooked or misconstrued cogent facts and circumstances that would justify altering or revising such findings and evaluation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> This is because the trial court's determination proceeds from its first-hand opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses, their conduct and attitude under grilling examination, thereby placing the trial court in the unique position to assess the witnesses' credibility and to appreciate their truthfulness, honesty, and candor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The RTC and the CA both relied on a number of circumstantial evidence against Juare and Aguadilla. This Court upholds the findings of both courts. As aptly ruled by the RTC:<br><blockquote>Based on a careful examination and meticulous consideration of all the circumstantial evidence proffered by the Prosecution, this Court is of the considered opinion that the accused are responsible for robbing the victim as well as killing her. The combination of the circumstances alleged and proven is such as to prove a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>All in all, the testimonies of the Prosecution witnesses show a positive finding that indeed herein accused were in the very place where the crime happened. Particularly, in the case of accused Aguadilla his going to and entering the residence of the Abellas on the night of May 23, 2000 was unrebutted and in fact he admitted it when he testified for his own defense. But also Aguadilla's having gone home or out of the Abellas residence after 8:30 or 9:00 p.m. (when their playing of chess and drinking of gin came to an end) or by 11:00 p.m. (when witness Alfredo Tecson went home from the store of Roman Cruz --- which is just across the residence and/or business establishment of the Abellas), no one has ever testified to/on about it. To add to this was the discovery of the bloodied shorts in the morning of May 24, 2000, as well as one of the knives owned by the victim already tucked in the wall of the house of accused Aguadilla, also in the same morning of May 24, 2000.<br><br>x x x When asked by the Court what was his reaction apart from being "surprised" upon hearing about the news that Mrs. Abella was robbed and killed, he simply said that he really felt bad because of her loss or "nanghihinayang."<br><br><i>During the presentation of the evidence for the Defense, the Undersigned Presiding Judge had closely observed the demeanor of both accused on the witness stand and it is his observation that both were definitely not telling the truth as (hey were evasive in their answers and were resorting to "palusot" instead of answering the simple questions with simple but forthright direct and candid answers.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (Italics supplied.)<br></blockquote>The factual findings of the RTC were affirmed by the CA, thus:<br><blockquote>The accused-appellants and prosecution witness Alfredo Baudin were all in agreement that at least between 6 PM to 9 PM of May 23, 2000, only the three of them were in the victim's house aside from the victim herself. They were also in agreement, and supported by the ocular inspection of the police as well as the testimony of the victim's daughter Teresita Abella, that the three doors of the building can only be locked from inside and that no one can enter without being let in by somebody inside. There was also an eyewitness in the person of Alfredo Tecson that accused-appellant Danilo Aguadilla did not leave the premises before 11 PM. We also note that he claimed to be home between 6 AM and 1:00 PM in the afternoon of May 24, 2000. These established and admitted facts only point to nothing else but that the perpetrator/s of the crime is/are among the people inside. However, aside from being at the scene of the crime, there were other circumstances that point to the accused-appellants as authors of the crime. A blood-stained pair of shorts were found by the police among the things of Accused-Appellant Renaldo Juare, which was unexplained by the latter. As for Accused-Appellant Danilo Aguadilla, the fact that the knife which belonged to the victim as claimed by the victim's daughter was found in his house on the day of the crime was discovered, was also unrefuted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court upholds the factual findings of the RTC as affirmed by the CA, and the conclusion that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are credible which must be taken into consideration than the incredible and unbelievable version of the accused-appellants. To stress, the assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and their testimonies is best undertaken by the trial court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witness first-hand and to note their demeanor, conduct, and attitude during examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The factual findings of the RTC, therefore, are accorded the highest degree of respect especially if the CA adopted and confirmed these, unless some facts or circumstances of weight were overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted as to materially affect the disposition of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> In the absence of substantial reason to justify the reversal of the trial court's findings, assessment and conclusion, especially when affirmed by the appellate court, as when no significant facts and circumstances are shown to have been overlooked or disregarded, the Court generally affirms the trial court's findings.<br><br>The Court has ruled that in criminal cases, proof beyond reasonable doubt does not require absolute certainty of the fact that the accused committed the crime, and it does not likewise exclude the possibility of error;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> what is only required is that degree of proof which, after a scrutiny of the facts, produces in an unprejudiced mind moral certainty of the culpability of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Moreover, direct evidence of the commission of a crime is not the only basis on which a court draws its finding of guilt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Established facts that form a chain of circumstances can lead the mind intuitively or impel a conscious process of reasoning towards a conviction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> The commission of a crime, the identity of the perpetrator, and the finding of guilt may all be established by circumstantial evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> In <i>Planteras, Jr. v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> the Court expounded on the distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, thus:<br><blockquote>The difference between direct evidence and circumstantial evidence involves the relationship of the fact inferred to the facts that constitute the offense. Their difference does not relate to the probative value of the evidence.<br><br>Direct evidence proves a challenged fact without drawing any inference. Circumstantial evidence, on the other hand, "indirectly proves a fact in issue, such that the fact-finder must draw an inference or reason from circumstantial evidence."<br><br>The probative value of direct evidence is generally neither greater than nor superior to circumstantial evidence. The Rules of Court do not distinguish between "direct evidence of fact and evidence of circumstances from which the existence of a fact may be inferred." The same quantum of evidence is still required. Courts must be convinced that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>A number of circumstantial evidence may be so credible to establish a fact from which it may be inferred, beyond reasonable doubt, that the elements of a crime exist and that the accused is its perpetrator. There is no requirement in our jurisdiction that only direct evidence may convict.

These circumstantial evidence, as proven by the prosecution, are sufficient proof of the accused appellants' guilt. Records reveal that there are several circumstantial evidence surrounding the commission of the crime. Every circumstance and factual evidence from which inferences are derived were proven and supported by physical and testimonial evidence. And the combination of all these circumstances produced a conviction of the accused-appellants beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>In <i>People v. Beriber</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (<i>Beriber</i>), the Court convicted the accused even though no direct testimony was presented by the prosecution to prove that the accused is the author of the crime of robbery with homicide since several circumstances, when taken together, constitute an unbroken chain of events enough to arrive at the conclusion that appellant was responsible for robbing and killing the victim. In <i>Beriber</i> the Court considered as sufficient to convict the accused the following circumstantial evidence:<br><blockquote>x x x 1. accused was at the <i>locus criminis</i> at around the time of the stabbing incident; 2. witnesses testified seeing him at the scene of the crime going in and going out of the house of the victim at the time of the perpetration of the crime; 3. accused, in his own admission mentioned that he was going to Batangas for medical treatment, however, when the policemen, together with the Barangay Chairman went to Talisay, Batangas where he lives, he was nowhere to be found; 4. immediately after the incident, the witnesses and the offended party noticed that all his clothes kept underneath the bamboo bed where the victim was found sprouted with blood were all gone because he took everything with him although his intention was merely for medical treatment in Batangas; 5. he mentioned that he was then still waiting for Kuya Henry, husband of Lourdes, when he had already a talk with Henry Vergara that he will go to Batangas for medical treatment that did not materialize; 6. after the killing incident, accused simply disappeared and did not return anymore; 7. when he was confronted by Henry Vergara concerning the killing, he could not talk to extricate himself from the accusation; and 8. that he has been using several aliases to hide his true identity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Beriber</i>, the witnesses only saw the accused at the scene of the crime at the time of the commission of the crime, but they did not see him actually robbed and killed the victim. However, the Court considered several circumstances us sufficient proof of the guilt of the accused and eventually convicted him.<br><br>In another case, the Court considered as one of the material circumstantial evidence the human blood stains on the front door of the appellant's house, on his clothing, and on his yellow slippers. The pieces of circumstantial evidence were discovered by the police only after three days from the commission of the crime. The Court considered these circumstantial evidence coupled with other factual evidence sufficient to convict the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, the unbroken chain of the pieces of circumstantial evidence led to one fair reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused-appellants, to the exclusion of all others, as the guilty persons. The accused-appellants were the only persons seen to be present in the victim's house on that fateful night. Aguadilla admitted that he was able to enter the premises because Juare opened the door for him. This circumstance is coupled with the fact that a bloodied shorts was found in Juare's possession and a blood-stained kitchen knife, owned by the victim, was found in Aguadilla's possession after the commission of the crime. In the absence of substantial explanation from the accused-appellants how and why they possessed these incriminating evidence, these facts should be considered circumstantial evidence connected with the commission of the crime and consistent with the accused-appellants' guilt. These interwoven facts produces in an unprejudiced mind moral certainty of the accused-appellants' culpability. Thus, from these circumstances, the prosecution was able to prove all the elements of the special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide.<br><br>The complex crime of Robbery with Homicide is specially defined and penalized under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>ART. 294. <i>Robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons — Penalties</i>. — Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or intimidation of any person shall suffer:<br><ol><li>The penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed.<br></li></ol>x x x x<br></blockquote>It requires the following elements: (1) taking of personal property is committed with violence or intimidation against persons; (2) the property taken belongs to another; (3) the taking is with <i>anima lucrandi</i>; and (4) by reason of the robbery, or on the occasion thereof, homicide is committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> A conviction for robbery with homicide requires certitude that the robbery is the main purpose and objective of the malefactor, and the killing is merely incidental to the robbery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> The intent to rob must precede the taking of human life but the killing may occur before, during or after the robbery.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>When the victim's body was discovered, her room was in disarray. Her daughter, Teresita, testified that her mother's bag containing cash and jewelry was missing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> This Court upholds, as ruled by the trial court and the CA, the credibility of Teresita's claim as the victim was engaged in a Marine Supply business, thus, it is logical that she had money or personal properties on her. The missing bag containing money and jewelry coupled with the fact that the victim's room was in disarray is a proof that somebody took the victim's personal properties. And that somebody has the clear intention to rob the victim.<br><br>Intent to rob, may be inferred from proof of violent and unlawful taking of the victim's property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Here, evidence reveals that the victim struggled to defend her life and property at the time of the commission of the crime as indicated by the locations of the stab wounds she suffered, scattered pieces of broken vases and disarrayed personal properties inside the room. Evidently, there was violent and forcible taking of the victim's personal properties.<br><br>When the fact of asportation has been established beyond reasonable doubt, conviction of the accused is justified even if the property subject of the robbery is not presented in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> After all, the property stolen may have been abandoned or thrown away and destroyed by the robber or recovered by the owner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> It is likewise, immaterial that the robber knows the exact value of the thing taken. It is not required for the prosecution to prove the actual value of the thing stolen as the motivation to rob exists regardless of the amount or value involved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>It is a given fact that there was no eyewitness to the actual killing of the victim. To reiterate, direct evidence of the commission of the crime is not the only basis from which a court may draw its conclusion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> In this case, the totality of the circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused-appellants robbed the victim and on the occasion thereof, the latter was killed. All of the circumstances proved were consistent with each other, consistent with the hypothesis that the accused-appellants (and no other) are guilty, and at the same time inconsistent with the hypothesis that they are innocent.<br><br>The prosecution established the following: that at least between 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. of May 23, 2000, aside from the victim herself, only three persons (Juare, Aguadilla and Baudin) were in the victim's house; the three doors of the building can only be locked from inside and that no one can enter without being let in by somebody inside; among the three persons present on that fateful night, it was Juare who was tasked to lock the doors as Baudin was indisposed; hence, Baudin left the premises; per testimony of Tecson, he saw Aguadilla enter the victim's house through the accordion door at around 9:00 p.m. and he never saw Aguadilla come out from the premises; Aguadilia himself admitted that he entered the victim's house on that fateful night and it was Juare who opened the door for him; and Aguadilla's allegation that he left the premises at around 9:00 p.m. because it was raining was not uncorroborated. The established circumstantial facts point, to nothing else than the conclusion that the perpetrators of the crime are the accused-appellants. Evidently, they were the only persons who were in the very place where the crime happened.<br><br>In addition, a blood-stained shorts was found by the police among the things of Juare, which was unexplained by the latter. Although, the blood-stained shorts was not marked in evidence at the onset of the trial, it was included in the Serology Report No. S-1019-00 of prosecution witness Dr. Jose Arnel Marquez and marked as RDS-2, thus:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.
