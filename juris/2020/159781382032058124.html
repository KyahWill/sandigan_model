Florentino, and imposed the penalty of dismissal as punished under Section 46, Rule 10 of the Revised Rule on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (<i>RRACCS</i>). The Ombudsman disposed, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondents JULIET NGO-FIEL, Municipal Mayor, SOLOMON R. GREGORIO Municipal Planning and Development Coordinator (MPDC), RENATO S. SALUDAGA, Municipal Engineer, JESSIE L. JOMADIAO, Municipal Agricultural Officer, VIRGINIA C. MORALES, Budget Officer, WILMA F. PASTOR, Municipal Civil Registrar, and ROLANDO C. GREGORIO, Municipal Assessor, all of the Municipal Local Government of Looc, Province of Romblon, are hereby found <b>GUILTY</b> of <i>Grave Misconduct</i> and are meted with the penalty of DISMISSAL from the service with the cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and perpetual disqualification from holding public office, as well as in government-owned and -controlled corporations, pursuant to the Revised Rule on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. </p> <p> In the event that the penalty of Dismissal can no longer be enforced, the penalty shall be converted into a FINE in an amount equivalent to respondents' respective salary for one (1) year, payable to the Office of the Ombudsman, and may be deductible from their respective retirement benefits, accrued leave credits, or any receivable from their respective office. </p> <p> x x x x </p> <p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b> </p> </blockquote> <p> The Ombudsman found untoward bias towards R.G. Florentino when: (1) the BAC allowed Romeo Florentino of R.G. Florentino to pay for the publication of the IAEB in Romblon Sun; (2) the BAC declared R.G. Florentino's bid as "eligible" even if the bid security was not present at the opening of bids; and (3) the SWIP was not posted on the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System (<i>PhilGeps</i>) website. </p><p> On April 28, 2015, herein petitioners, Jomadiao and Pastor filed a Motion for Reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> by themselves, and submitted therein that they never underwent any training and were never informed of the procedures, duties, and responsibilities of the BAC. Their participation, as BAC members, only included attending the public bidding on November 12, 2007 and they alleged that they were no longer privy to any transaction that occurred thereafter. They also averred that the publication of the IAEB in the Romblon Sun was made without their knowledge nor consensus and that the non-posting of the SWIP project on the PhilGeps website was not their direct duty. The Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated May 15, 2015 of the Office of the Ombudsman however upheld the November 14, 2014 Decision. </p><p> Aggrieved, petitioners elevated the case to the Court of Appeals (CA) through a petition for review under Rule 43. </p><p> On July 21, 2016, the CA rendered the assailed Decision affirming the findings of the Ombudsman, and disposed: </p><blockquote> <p> <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>. The assailed dispositions are <b>AFFIRMED</b>. No costs. </p> <p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> The CA noted that the BAC must duly ensure faithful compliance to the provisions of R.A. 9184 and its IRR-A during the bidding process. Allowing R.G. Florentino to pay for the IAEB was, therefore, a blatant disregard of R.A. 9184, particularly Section 21 thereof.</p><p> Petitioners moved for a reconsideration of the Decision, but the same was denied in a Resolution dated March 1, 2017. Hence the present petition, with the following issues: </p><blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">I.</div></td> <td width="97%"><div align="justify">WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN DENYING THE PETITION FOR REVIEW AND SUSTAINING THE FINDINGS OF THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN DESPITE THE FACT THAT SAID FINDINGS ARE GROUNDED ON MERE SPECULATIONS, SURMISES AND CONJECTURES, CONTRARY TO THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD[;] </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">II.</div></td> <td><div align="justify">WHETHER THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN APPLYING THE RULING OF THIS HONORABLE COURT IN <b><i>LAGOC V.

FLORENTINO CONSTRUCTION AND TRADING[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote> <p>At the core of this case is whether or not petitioners colluded with Fiel and their co-members in the BAC in ensuring that the SWIP will be awarded to R.G. Florentino. The Court rules in the negative, but finds that petitioners are still wanting in the performance of their duties as BAC members. </p> <p align="center"> <b><i>Advertising of the IAEB</i></b> </p><p> Section 21 of RA 9184 mandates that the procuring entity, in this case the Municipality of Looc, shall cause the advertisement of the invitation to bid, thus: </p><blockquote> <p> SEC. 21. <i>Advertising and Contents of the Invitation to Bid</i>. - In line with the principle of transparency and competitiveness, <b>all Invitations to Bid for contracts under competitive bidding <u>shall</u> be advertised by the Procuring Entity</b> in such manner and for such length of time as may be necessary under the circumstances, in order to ensure the widest possible dissemination thereof, such as, but not limited to, posting in the Procuring Entity's premises, in newspapers of general circulation, the G-EPS and the website of the Procuring entity, if available. The details and mechanics of implementation shall be provided in the IRR to be promulgated under this ACT. x x x</p> <p> The IRR-A then provides: </p> <p> 21.2. <i>Advertising and Posting of the Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid</i> </p> <p> 21.2.1. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 21.2.3 and 21.2.4 of this IRR-A and for the procurement of common-use goods and supplies, the Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid shall be: </p> <blockquote> <p> a) Advertised at least twice within a maximum period of fourteen (14) calendar days, with a minimum period of six (6) calendar days in between publications, in a newspaper of general nationwide circulation which has been regularly published for at least two (2) years before the date of issue of the advertisement; </p> <p> b) Posted continuously in the website of the procuring entity concerned, if available, the website of the procuring entity's service provider, if any, as provided in Section 8 of this IRR-A, and the G­EPS during the maximum period of fourteen (14) calendar days stated above; and </p> <p> c) Posted at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the procuring entity concerned, as certified by the head of the BAC Secretariat of the procuring entity concerned. </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> RA 9184 intends to reach the broadest number of prospective participants to join the public bidding. This is in line with the law's policy of promoting transparency and competitiveness during the entire bidding process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> It is undisputed that the IAEB was published in the Romblon Sun, a newspaper of general local circulation. The charge against petitioners, on the other hand, was centered on the seemingly partial action of the BAC in allowing R.G. Florentino to pay for the publication of the IAEB. </p><p> At the onset, the duty of publication falls upon the BAC Secretariat,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and his or her certification as to the fact of posting refutes allegations to the contrary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> The petitioners, as provisional BAC members, are not responsible for the actual posting of the IAEB and the corresponding payment, if any, of the same. Be that as it may, the Court is of the view that allowing a prospective bidder to pay for any advertisement or publication will not give him or her a leverage in public bidding. Such act is actually against any bidder's interest because it publicizes the existence of a bidding and persuades competition. </p><p> On the issue of non-posting of the IAEB on the PhilGeps website, respondent did not show that the Municipality of Looc had an electronic registry with the PhilGeps nor that it had access to the internet. Posting on the PhilGeps website requires not only prior coordination with the Geps but also a stable network of the procuring entity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Since the viability of posting on the PhilGeps website had not been duly proven during trial, the Court could not postulate on the assumption that the lack of posting on PhilGeps was deliberate. </p><p> Nonetheless, the BAC still fell short in the publication requirement when it failed to advertise the IAEB in a <i>newspaper of general nationwide circulation</i>, or a newspaper that is published nationally. The minutes of the September 24, 2007 meeting uncovers that the BAC acceded to forego publication in a newspaper of general nationwide circulation because the breakdown per project was below P5,000,000.00. This reveals that the BAC was still ascribing to the posting requirements of R.A. 1594, or otherwise known as <i>Prescribing Policies, Guidelines, Rules and Regulations for Government Infrastructure Contracts</i>, the IRR<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> of which provides: </p><blockquote> <p> IB 3 — <i>Invitation to Prequalify/Apply for Eligibility and to Bid</i> </p> <blockquote> <p> 1. For locally funded contracts, contractors shall be invited to apply for eligibility and to bid through: </p> <p> a. For contracts to be bid costing more than P5,000,000 the advertisement shall be made at least three (3) times within a reasonable period depending upon the size and complexity of the contract to be bid but in no case less than two (2) weeks in at least two (2) newspapers of general nationwide circulation which have been regularly published for at least two (2) years before the date of issue of the advertisement. During the same period that the advertisement is posted in the newspaper or for a longer period as determined by the head of the office/agency/corporation concerned, the same advertisement shall be posted in the website of the office/agency/corporation concerned and at the place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the office/agency/corporation concerned. <u>However, for contracts to be bid costing P5,000,000 and below or for contracts authorized to be bid by the regional/district offices involving costs as may be delegated by the head of office/agency/corporation, the invitation to bid shall be advertised at least two (2) times within two (2) weeks in a newspaper of general local circulation in the region where the contract to be bid is located, which newspaper has been regularly published for at least six (6) months before the date of issue of the advertisement</u>. Xxx (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> This has already been superseded by Section 21.2.3 and its IRR-A which states that: </p><blockquote> <p> 21.2.3. For contracts to be bid with an ABC costing two million pesos (P2,000,000.00) and below for the procurement of goods, <u>and five million pesos (P5,000,000.00) and below for the procurement of infrastructure projects, the Invitation to Apply for Eligibility and to Bid shall be posted at least in the website of the procuring entity concerned, if available, the website of the procuring entity's service provider, if any, as provided in Section 8 of this IRR-A, the G-EPS, and posted at any conspicuous place reserved for this purpose in the premises of the procuring entity concerned</u>, as certified by the head of the BAC Secretariat of the procuring entity concerned, during the same period as above. x x x (Emphasis supplied) </p> </blockquote> <p> Yet, the BAC gave an incorrect interpretation of the law because the easing of the posting requirement refers to contracts that are below P5,000,000.00. The SWIP contract was for the entire amount of P9,000,000.00 and it was without regard to the value of the infrastructure project per barangay. </p><p align="center"> <b><i>Validity of the Bid Security</i></b> </p><p> The basic rule in public bidding that bids should be evaluated on the basis of the required documents submitted <i>before</i> and not after the opening of bids must be strictly observed in order to safeguard a fair, honest and competitive public bidding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> A bid security is one of the documents that Section 25.3 and its IRR-A mandates to be included at the opening of bids. </p><p> The Ombudsman determined that R.G. Florentino did not submit a bid security at the time of bidding on November 12, 2007 because the <i>Acknowledgment</i> on the Bidder's Bond was dated 2008 and the Official Receipt of Eastern Assurance &amp; Surety Company (EASC), the bonding company, was issued on March 8, 2008. Hence, the Ombudsman held that the BAC violated RA 9184 for declaring R.G. Florentino as eligible even in the absence of a Bid Security at the time of bidding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p><p> On the other hand, attached on record is a Bidder's Bond<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated November 11, 2007, and valid until February 11, 2008, on which R.G. Florentino was named as the principal and EASC as the surety. It also provides that "THIS BOND IS CALLABLE ON DEMAND UNDER R.A. 9184" for the amount of Two Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (P225,000.00), the condition of which states: </p><blockquote> <p> NOW THEREFORE, the conditions of this obligation are such that if the above-bounded principal shall, in the event ofhis becoming successful bidder in the above proposal (1) fails to guarantee the true and faithful performance in case of the award; (2) shall refuse to accept the same or (3) shall not answer for any delay and/or default in the execution of the contract as provided in the proposal; then the MUNICIPALITY OF LOOC shall be entitled to be indemnified of any loss or damage it may suffer by reason thereof not to exceed the sum of TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P225,000.00) PESOS (sic), Philippine Currency, otherwise this obligation shall be void and without effect.</p> </blockquote> <p> A reading of the Bidder's Bond would show that it satisfied the required form of a Bid Security as provided for in Sections 27.2,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> 27.3<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and 28<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and its IRR-A which must be: (a) Two and a half percent (2½%) of the approved budget for the contract to be bid; (b) callable upon demand issued by a reputable surety or insurance company; (c) in Philippine Peso; and (d) not valid for more than 120 days from the opening of the bid. </p><p> Furthermore, the Bidder's Bond was notarized on November 11, 2007 which contradicts the complaint and the finding of the Ombudsman. </p><p> Hence, the BAC did not err in accepting the bid offer of R.G.
