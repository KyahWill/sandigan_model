She was likewise made to identify Edgar and appellant. During the hearing, the trial court ordered that the former plea of <i>guilty</i> of Edgar be considered as withdrawn and a plea of <i>not guilty</i> be reinstated. Other prosecution witnesses included BBB, CCC, Dr. Angel Cordero and Police Inspector A1iuro Abuyen.<br><br>The version of the prosecution is as follows:<br><br>At around 6:30 p.m. of October 3, 2001, AAA was cooking when two persons, armed with a firearm and a knife, entered through the kitchen door. They then held AAA and told her to keep quiet and brought her to the living room. When two more persons, also with knives, arrived, AAA and the rest of the household, namely, EEE, FFF, GGG, HHH, III, JJJ and KKK, were brought to the living room, hogtied, and their eyes covered with tape. They were all separated and brought to different parts of the house. AAA's eyes were only partly covered, thus enabling her to see one of her companions in the house get hit on the head with a firearm, leaving her unconscious. Subsequently, AAA and EEE were brought to the bathroom by Joseph and Noel Malpas. But EEE was then brought outside again when Joseph and Noel started removing AAA's clothing. When she tried to resist them, AAA's head was knocked twice against the cement wall, causing her to faint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Upon gaining consciousness, AAA discovered that she was half-naked, and felt pain in her knees, head, stomach and vagina. She realized that the blood in the bathroom came from her vagina. Later, some of her companions in the house entered the bathroom to untie her hands, remove the tape from her eyes and carry her out to the living room. By this time, the four men had already left the house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>AAA was examined the next day by Dr. Angel Cordero of the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory whose findings were compatible with AAA having had recent sexual intercourse.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>For its part, the defense presented Edgar and appellant as its witnesses, who interposed the defenses of alibi and denial.<br><br>During the hearing on June 18, 2016, Edgar and appellant manifested their intention to voluntarily plead guilty to Robbery. After searching questions, the trial court was convinced that they freely and voluntarily entered a plea of guilty to Robbery only.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On January 10, 2018, the trial court received a letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> from the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, Tacloban City, informing it that Edgar had died that day. Accordingly, the trial court issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dismissing the case against him on the ground that death of an accused extinguishes his criminal liability.<br><br>On April 18, 2018, the trial court rendered a Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, Judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused ATILANO AGATON y OBICO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the special complex crime of Robbery with Rape and is hereby sentenced to a penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole pursuant to Republic Act No. 9346. He is ordered to return the pieces of jewelry and valuables taken from the spouses [BBB] and [CCC] as enumerated in the Information dated December 3, 2001. Should restitution be no longer possible, accused shall pay the spouses Aya-ay the value of the stolen pieces of jewelry and valuables in the amount of PhP336,000.00. He is further directed to pay [AAA] the amounts of PhP75,000.00 as civil indemnity, PhP75,000.00 as moral damages and PhP30,000.00 as exemplary damages. Interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum is imposed on all the damages awarded in this case from date of finality of this judgment until fully paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>On appeal, the CA affirmed the decision of the trial court, but increased the award of civil indemnity, moral and exemplary damages to P100,000.00 each,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> in view of the guidelines laid down in <i>People v. Jugueta</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On September 13, 2019,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> appellant, through the Public Attorney's Office, appealed the Decision of the CA to this Court, assigning the following error in his appeal, initially passed upon by the CA:<br><blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED­APPELLANT DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>In his brief, appellant averred that his plea of guilt merely involved his intention to rob the house of spouses BBB and CCC, but did not extend to successfully taking the properties therein. He alleges that other than the self­-serving declaration of the spouses that personal prope1iies were taken from them, there is no other evidence that could support such claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In his testimony, he stated that they were not able to take anything because somebody suddenly came to the house.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Appellant's contention is devoid of merit.<br><br>In <i>Evangelio</i>, we ruled that the prosecution was able to establish that all the accused, herein appellant included, took the pieces of jewelry and valuables of the spouses by means of violence and intimidation. They barged into the house of the victims, armed with a handgun and knives, and tied the hands and feet of the members of the household. The perpetrators then asked for the location of the pieces of jewelry and valuables. BBB was also tied and was struck in the head with a gun, causing him to fall face down on the floor with blood oozing from his left eyebrow. He was able to see the perpetrators going out of the house carrying bags and the jewelry box of his wife. There is no doubt, therefore, that appellant is liable for the robbery.<br><br>As regards the allegation of rape, appellant argues that the same was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. According to him, AAA was not inside the house at the time of the incident and he did not witness the alleged rape being committed. Hence, he could not have had the chance to prevent the same considering that he was totally unaware of the same being committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>We held in <i>Evangelio</i> that although AAA did not exactly witness the actual rape because she was unconscious when it happened, the following circumstantial evidence shows that she was indeed raped: <i>first</i>, while two of the robbers were stealing, Joseph and one of the robbers brought AAA inside the comfort room; <i>second</i>, inside the comfort room, AAA was stripped of her clothes and panty; <i>third</i>, when AAA resisted and struggled, Joseph and the other robber banged her head against the wall, causing her to lose consciousness; <i>fourth</i>, when she regained consciousness, the culprits were already gone and she saw her clothes and panty strewn at her side; and <i>fifth</i>, she suffered pain in her knees, head, stomach and, most of all, in her vagina which was then bleeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The CA affirmed the trial court's findings that Joseph and Noel were the ones who brought AAA to the comfort room and stripped her of her clothing in the course of the robbery,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and that there is no convincing evidence of the actual participation of appellant in the rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> The presence of the aggravating circumstances of band and dwelling was likewise affirmed. Indeed, it is settled that when the factual findings of the trial court are confirmed by the CA, said facts are final and conclusive on this Court, unless the same are not supported by the evidence on record.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>However, we disagree with the CA that appellant should be implicated in the rape for the reason that he was positively identified as one of Joseph's companions inside the house. We also disagree with the CA that appellant had the opportunity to stop the other two accused from raping AAA, considering that the same is not supported by the evidence on record. While the trial court found that AAA heard the voice of appellant, this does not prove that appellant had the opportunity to attempt to prevent the rape.<br><br>On cross-examination during the trial of Joseph, AAA stated that she does not know what the other robbers did because, after being hogtied in the living room, she and EEE were brought to the comfort room.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>When AAA was recalled to the witness stand more than a dozen years later, during the trial of appellant, she merely identified the voice of appellant, but did not say at what point she heard him speak during the robbery, to wit:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">PROS.

together carrying the loot. Considering that the rape occurred at the first floor while the ransacking occurred at the second floor, there is reasonable doubt that appellant was aware of what was going on downstairs, especially because AAA's shouts came afterwards.<br><br>On cross-examination, appellant alleged that he did not see AAA inside the house and that it was only during the trial that he learned that a rape had occurred on the occasion of the robbery, to wit:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Now you are denying of a rape incident, so when you said you are denying of rape in the house of [the spouses BBB and CCC], do you mean to say that there was actually a rape incident that took place but you just did not participate in that rape incident?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">Nothing happened.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">You mean to say that you were not able to see an incident of rape in the house of the [spouses BBB and CCC]?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">I did not.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">But you were informed that there was a fact of rape incident that transpired on that day?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div>A</td><td><div align="justify">&nbsp;I never heard, I only heard about that here during the hearing.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="center">xxxx</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">COURT: From the court.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="center">xxxx</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q</div></td><td> <div align="justify">You said that you did not rape [AAA]?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">I did not.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Before the incident did you already know [AAA]?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A </div></td><td><div align="justify">I do not know her.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="justify">When for the first time did you come to know her? </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Here, during the hearing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>While appellant's mere denial that he was aware of the rape during the robbery is inherently weak, it is not bankrupt of weight since the same was confirmed on cross-examination and, more importantly, since the prosecution failed to discharge its burden of showing by positive proof that he was aware.<br><br>In considering the defenses of denial and alibi, we held in <i>Lejano v. People</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><blockquote>But not all denials and alibis should be regarded as fabricated. Indeed, if the accused is truly innocent, he can have no other defense but denial and alibi. So how can such accused penetrate a mind that has been made cynical by the rule drilled into his head that a defense of alibi is a hangman's noose in the face of a witness positively swearing, "I saw him do it."? Most judges believe that such assertion automatically dooms an alibi which is so easy to fabricate. This quick stereotype thinking, however, is distressing. For how else can the truth that the accused is really innocent have any chance of prevailing over such a stone-cast tenet?<br><br>There is only one way. A judge must keep an open mind. He must guard against slipping into hasty conclusion, often arising from a desire to quickly finish the job of deciding a case. A positive declaration from a witness that he saw the accused commit the crime should not automatically cancel out the accused's claim that he did not do it. A lying witness can make as positive an identification as a truthful witness can. The lying witness can also say as forthrightly and unequivocally, "He did it!" without blinking an eye.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, if found credible, the defenses of denial and alibi may, and should, be considered complete and legitimate defenses. The burden of proof does not shift by the mere invocation of said defenses; the presumption of innocence remains in favor of the accused.<br><br>It is a settled rule that when conspiracy is established between several accused in the commission of the crime of robbery, they would all be equally culpable for the rape committed by anyone of them on the occasion of the robbery, unless anyone of them proves that he endeavored to prevent the others from committing rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> By removing culpability for the complex crime from an accused who endeavors to prevent the rape, the law recognizes the less perverse state of his mind vis-a-vis that of the perpetrator of the rape and that of his co-accused who did not even attempt to prevent the same despite an opportunity to do so.<br><br>In <i>United States v. Tiongco</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> we affirmed the conviction of two robbers for Robbery with Rape even if they took no part in the rape because they made no opposition nor prevented their co-accused from consummating the rape. In <i>People v. Merino</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> we found the accused to be equally liable for the rape because he was aware of the dastardly act being performed by his co-accused but merely told the latter to hurry.<br><br>In <i>People v. Canturia</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> however, we declined to hold some of the robbers liable for the rape because while the evidence convincingly shows a conspiracy to commit only robbery among the accused, there is no evidence that the other members of the band were aware of the lustful intent of the perpetrator of the rape and his consummation thereof so that they could have attempted to prevent the same. To be equally responsible for the rape, there should be positive proof that they abetted or, at least, were aware of the rape.<br><br>Positive proof is not merely an inference drawn more or less logically from a hypothetical fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It is proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Absent positive proof, mere presumptions and inferences, no matter how logical and probable, would not be enough.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Anticamara, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> echoing our ruling in <i>Canturia</i>, we ruled that there was no evidence to prove that the accused was aware of the rape and, therefore, could have prevented the same. Thus, we found the accused guilty of the crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention instead of the special complex crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention with rape.<br><br>In <i>People v. Villaruel</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> we found that there is neither allegation nor evidence that the other co-accused also raped the victim or assisted the perpetrators in committing the rape. Consequently, they cannot be held guilty of robbery with rape, but only of robbery.<br><br>In <i>People v. Mendoza</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> we held that for the accused to be convicted only of the crime of robbery, he must prove not only that he himself did not abuse the victim but that he tried to prevent the rape. The accused cannot seek refuge in our ruling in <i>Canturia</i> when the evidence shows that he was indeed aware.<br><br>In <i>People v. Belmonte</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> we ruled that the act of endeavoring to prevent the commission of the lustful act presupposes that there was an opportunity to do so. Hence, where the accused did not prevent the commission thereof despite an opportunity to do so, he is equally culpable for the rape committed by anyone of them on occasion of the robbery.<br><br>In fine, the long line of jurisprudence on the special complex crime of Robbery with Rape requires that the accused be aware of the sexual act in order for him to have the opportunity to attempt to prevent the same, without which he cannot be faulted for his inaction. Further, there must be positive proof to show such awareness.<br><br>Although we made a pronouncement in <i>Evangelio</i> that there was no showing that the other accused, including herein appellant, prevented Joseph from sexually abusing AAA, the record is bereft of any positive proof that he was aware of the act. The fact that he was upstairs while the rape was occurring lends even more credence to the absence of awareness.<br><br>The accused who is aware of the lustful intent or sexual act of his co-­accused but did not endeavor to prevent or stop it, despite an opportunity to do so, becomes complicit in the rape and is perfectly liable for Robbery with Rape. On the other hand, for an accused who is totally ignorant of the same and who did not merely choose to turn a blind eye, it could not have been the intent of the law to punish him as severely as those who committed the sexual act or who were aware thereof but were indifferent to its commission. He shall, therefore, be held liable only for Robbery, as in the case at bench.<br><br>For lack of positive proof that he was aware of the rape, appellant shall only be liable for robbery under paragraph 5, Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, punishable by <i>prision correccional</i> in its maximum period to <i>prision mayor</i> in its medium period. Due to the presence of two aggravating circumstances, the proper penalty should be <i>prision mayor</i> in its medium period. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, appellant should be imposed the indeterminate penalty of four (4) years and two (2) months of <i>prision correccional</i> medium, as minimum penalty, to nine (9) years and four (4) months of <i>prision mayor</i> medium, as maximum penalty.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated August 20, 2019 in CA-G.R.
