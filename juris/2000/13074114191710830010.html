				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These cases are here on automatic appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 17, Davao City, convicting accused-appellant Lorenzo Diaz, Sr.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 in G.R. No. 133735 (Criminal Case No. 38,262-97), of rape against his 
daughter Lanie Diaz, then 13 years old, and imposing upon him the 
penalty of death, and, in G.R. No. 133736 (Criminal Case No. 38,263-97),
 of rape against another daughter Anniely<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Diaz and imposing upon him the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.  Accused-appellant was also ordered to indemnify each of the offended parties in the amount of P30,000.00.
<p>The facts are as follows:
</p><p>In G.R. No. 133735 (Criminal Case No. 38,262-97), the information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> alleged -
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"That on or about September 03, 1996, in the City of Davao, 
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
above-named accused (father of the complainant) wilfully, unlawfully and
 feloniously and by the use of force and intimidation, had sexual 
intercourse with the offended party, Lanie Diaz y Almencion, his 
daughter who was then 13 years old, against her will."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In G.R. No. 133736 (Criminal Case No. 38,263-97), the information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> charged -
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"That on or about January 29, 1993, in the City of Davao, 
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
above-named accused (father of the complainant) wilfully, unlawfully, 
and feloniously and by use of force and intimidation, had sexual 
intercourse with the offended party, Anniely Diaz y Almencion, his 
daughter who was then 16 years old, against her will."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accused-appellant, duly assisted by counsel, pleaded not guilty to the charges against him,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> whereupon the two cases were jointly tried.
</p><p>The prosecution evidence shows that accused-appellant Lorenzo 
Diaz and his wife Nimfa Almencion Diaz were married on June 14, 1976<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and that three children (Anniely, Lanie, and Lorenzo, Jr.) were born to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Anniely was born on January 29, 1977,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> while Lanie was born on October 14, 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 The Diaz family lived in Spring Valley, Buhangin, Davao City until 1992
 when Nimfa left her family to live in Monkayo, Davao del Norte.  It 
appears that the separation was caused by accused-appellant who 
maltreated his wife especially when he was drunk.  Nimfa left her 
children in the care of accused-appellant as she was incapable of 
supporting them.  The couple never reconciled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
</p><p>On January 29, 1993, Anniely Diaz turned 16 years old. 
Accused-appellant came home drunk.  He was angry and ordered Anniely to 
prepare his dinner.  He proceeded to the bedroom where Lanie was 
sleeping and transferred her to her brother's room.  He then ate his 
dinner.  While Anniely was washing the dishes, accused-appellant scolded
 her, telling her that she was not his daughter but that of another man.
  As Anniely cried, accused-appellant reassured her and told her that he
 was only joking.  Afterwards, accused-appellant allowed her to go to 
sleep but ordered her not to lock the door.  At around 10 o'clock in the
 evening, Anniely was awakened by her father who entered her room.  He 
touched her body.  She pushed his hand, but he was able to remove her 
panty and her skirt.  Anniely tried to resist her father's advances, 
but, because her father was a heavy man, he succeeded in inserting his 
penis into her vagina and performing the sexual act with her.  Then he 
left the room with Anniely crying.
</p><p>Anniely did not tell anyone, not even her mother, about her 
experience because she was afraid that her mother might kill her father,
 as she had threatened to do in the past.  Anniely was also afraid 
because accused-appellant might hurt her and her siblings.
</p><p>Anniely later escaped from her father's house.  She was told her 
mother learned that Lanie had been molested by accused-appellant.  
Anniely then admitted to her mother that she too had been raped by her 
father.  She told her that accused-appellant had been molesting her 
since she was nine years old, especially when the latter was drunk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
</p><p>On his birthday, September 3, 1996, accused-appellant got drunk 
again.  At around 9 o'clock in the evening, he went inside the room 
where Lanie was sleeping.  He removed Lanie's short pants, placed 
himself on top of Lanie, and inserted his penis into her vagina. Lanie 
tried to push him away, but he was too strong for her.  When he was 
finished, accused-appellant just left Lanie without saying a word.
</p><p>The following day, Lanie also left their house and went to her 
cousin's house.  She talked to her sister Anniely and told her what had 
happened.  When their mother learned that Lanie had left her father, she
 looked for her.  Lanie told her mother what happened to her.  She said 
she did not report the incident before because her father had threatened
 to kill her mother if she told anyone what happened to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Accused-appellant had been abusing Lanie since 1992, when her mother left the family home.  She was then only nine years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 She said she felt pain the first time her father had sexual intercourse
 with her, but later the pain ceased when her father continued to have 
sex with her.  She even experienced an orgasm when her father had sexual
 intercourse with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
</p><p>Nimfa Almencion Diaz, the victims' mother, learned about her 
daughters' fate from Nita Gulgat.  (Gulgat was the person from whom 
Lanie asked for help after escaping from accused-appellant.) After 
talking to her daughters, Nimfa Diaz took them to the Buhangin Police 
Station.  Lanie and Anniely underwent physical examination at the City 
Health Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
</p><p>The results of Lanie's medical examination are as follows:
</p><blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, the findings on Anniely are as follows:

  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Danilo Ledesma, who examined Lanie and Anniely, testified that 
the healed lacerations found in the hymens of the two girls were more 
than four months old. In fact, they could be between one to five years 
old.  At the time of the examination, Lanie was 13 years old, while 
Anniely was 19.  According to Dr. Ledesma, it is possible that these 
lacerations were caused by the insertion of a hard object, a finger, or 
any sharp foreign object in the victims' vaginas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
</p><p>It then became the turn of the defense to present evidence.
</p><p>Accused-appellant Lorenzo Diaz, Sr. testified that he was a 
jeepney driver; that, as such, he worked for 16 to 17 hours a day; that 
his wife left him in 1994, and since then he had been alone in bringing 
up their children; that, in 1996, he found out his wife was living with 
another man; and that he decided not to file a complaint for adultery 
against her because he took pity on her and the filing of charges might 
take much of his time from his work.  Accused-appellant denied the 
allegations against him.  He claimed that these cases were filed at the 
instigation of his wife since if he was imprisoned, she would be free to
 do as she liked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
</p><p>On June 25, 1997, the trial court rendered a decision convicting 
accused-appellant of rape in the two cases.  The dispositive portion of 
its decision reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"WHEREFORE, finding the evidence of the prosecution more than 
sufficient to prove accused, LORENZO DIAZ, SR., is guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the offense charged, pursuant to Sec. 11 of RA 7659 
amending Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to par. 7 of 
said Rep. Act as well as sub. par. 1, to wit: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>'When the victim is 18 years of age and the offender is a parent,
 ascendant, stepparent, guardian relative by consanguinity or affinity 
within the third civil degree or the common law spouse of the parent of 
the victim.'
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>"Accordingly, in Crim. Case No. 38,262-97, accused LORENZO DIAZ, 
SR., pursuant to Sec. 24 of RA 7659, is sentenced to suffer the supreme 
penalty of death through lethal injection, in accordance with RA 8176, 
in the manner and procedure for its execution, in accordance to law. </p>
  <p>"In Crim. Case No. 38,263-97, accused LORENZO DIAZ, SR., is 
sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, together with all
 accessory penalty as provided for by law. </p>
  <p>"Moreover, pursuant to Art. 100 of the Revised Penal Code, and in 
relation to Art. 104 thereof, accused is furthermore ordered, to pay 
complainants, LANIE and ANNIELY, all surnamed DIAZ, the amount of 
P30,000.00 each, by way of civil indemnity and reparation of the damage 
and wrong done to them, resulting [in] the filing of these cases, which 
brought on them untold sufferings as well as dishonor of [their] 
persons. </p>
  <p>"Pursuant finally, to Sec. 22 of RA 7659, par. 2 thereof, the 
Branch Clerk of Court of this court, is ordered to immediately elevate 
the entire records of these cases, with the Clerk of Court, Supreme 
Court, Manila, for the automatic review of the Supreme Court and 
issuance of its own decision en banc as the case may be. </p>
  <p>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his lone assignment of error, accused-appellant contends that the 
trial court erred in convicting him.  He contends that the evidence does
 not show that he used force, violence, threat, or intimidation against 
his daughters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
</p><p>Accused-appellant's assertion is untenable.  Anniely Diaz' 
testimony clearly establishes the fact that accused-appellant succeeded 
in having sexual intercourse with her through force and intimidation. In
 G.R. No. 133736 (Criminal Case No. 38,263-97), Anniely testified:
</p><blockquote>

condition of your father in that night when you were sexually molested?
      <br>

  <p>Q -  Now, please describe how you were sexually molested by your father?
      <br>
      A -   Actually at that time, he was not yet in the house, but when
 he arrived and I opened the door and he ask me to prepare his dinner 
because he was going to eat his dinner and after that he ordered my 
younger sister to transfer to the other room.
  </p>
  <p>Q -  Are you referring to Lanie?
      <br>
      A -   Yes.

  <p>Q -  Did Lanie Diaz transferred?
      <br>
      A -   He carried Lanie.
  </p>
  <p>Q -  Why, was your sister Lanie sleep at that time?
      <br>

      <br>
      A -   At that time, he took Lanie and transferred to the other room, I was awaken.
  </p>
  <p>Q -  What did you tell your father when he transferred Lanie?
      <br>
      A -   I asked him, why is it that he transferred Lanie when we were sleeping together?
  </p>
  <p>Q -  What was his answer?
      <br>
      A -   According to him, he had to transfer Lanie to the other 
room, because our bed is narrow while in that room of Lorenzo is wide.
  </p>

      <br>
      A -   Yes, sir.

  </p>
  <p>Q - And after that?
      <br>
      A -   So I said, after he told me not to cry anymore because I am 
his true daughter, I ask permission that I will be allowed to sleep, he 
said yes, but he told me, not to close the door of my room.
  </p>
  <p>Q - And afterwards what happened?
      <br>
      A -   I really wanted to close the door because he was angry I did not proceed to lock the door.
  </p>
  <p>Q - After that what did your father do to you?
      <br>
      A -   At that time, I was already sleeping, he entered the room and molested [me].
  </p>
  <p>Q -  You said he molested you, describe how did your father molest you?
      <br>
      A -   He touch my body and then I push aside his hands and later on, he took off my panty.

      <br>
      A - He was already on top of me.

      <br>
      A - I was left in the room crying."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anniely's simple and straightforward narration of what her father did
 to her is convincing.  According to Anniely, accused-appellant came to 
her room and, despite her resistance, succeeded in raping her.
</p><p>While it is true that Anniely did not say she had been threatened
 by her father or that he employed force against her, this does not 
imply that Anniely consented to have sex with her father.  
Accused-appellant did not need to use words in order to threaten or 
force Anniely to submit to his will.  A crime committed by a father who 
wields parental influence over the victim is often accomplished with 
facility.  His moral ascendancy over the victim substitutes for violence
 or intimidation.  A young woman, like the victim herein, can only cower
 in fear and yield in submission.  All that is required to accomplish 
the crime of rape is intimidation, by which the perpetrator keeps his 
victim in a state of fear and humiliation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
</p><p>Indeed, accused-appellant's contention that Anniely consented to 
have sex with him deserves no consideration.  Anniely related in her 
testimony how she tried to push her father away in an attempt to protect
 herself, but he was a heavy man and she could not do anything against 
his sexual advances.  She was crying when her father left her the night 
he raped her.  As soon as she was able, Anniely escaped from her house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
 Clearly, Anniely's behavior during and after the rape is not that of a 
young girl who willingly engaged in sexual intercourse with her own 
father.  With her mother gone and nobody else to turn to for help, 
Anniely was forced to endure accused-appellant's abuse rather than put 
herself and her siblings at risk by defying him.  The fact remains that 
Anniely's testimony established that accused-appellant had sexual 
intercourse with her without her consent and against her will, both 
elements of which are constitutive of the crime of rape.  Considering 
that Anniely's account of what her father did to her remains credible 
and believable, the trial court correctly convicted accused-appellant of
 the crime of rape against his 16-year old daughter Anniely Diaz.
</p><p>On the other hand, in G.R. No. 133735 (Criminal Case No. 38,262-97), Lanie Diaz testified as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"Q - On September 3, 1996 can you tell the court what unusual incident if any happened to you? <br>
    A -   Yes.
  </p>
  <p>Q - What was that unusual incident?
      <br>
      A - It was a birthday of my father.  He got drunk.
  </p>
  <p>Q - Are you referring to your father Lorenzo Diaz?
      <br>
      A - Yes.
  </p>
  <p>Q - In your house at Spring Valley? 
      <br>
      A - Yes.

</blockquote>
<p>Lanie's testimony is characterized by candor and simplicity which 
underscore the fundamental truth of its contents.  In her testimony, 
Lanie related how her father, when drunk, had been abusing her since she
 was nine years old.  She testified that although she resisted him at 
first, she stopped doing so out of fear of her father.  The sexual abuse
 was done so frequently that it had ceased to cause her pain but rather 
enabled her to have orgasm.
</p><p>It has been held that "it is well-nigh impossible for any woman to experience orgasm while being assaulted by a rapist.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Acquittals have been made on this basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> But, with the evidence on record, we are not prepared to hold the same in this case.
</p><p>In <em>People vs. Jervoso</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
 where the accused was acquitted because the complainant admitted that 
she reached a climax during the sexual act with the accused, there were 
several improbabilities which undermined the credibility of 
complainant's testimony, <em>i.e.</em>, the absence of abrasions and 
other injuries on complainant despite her claim that she was dragged on 
the ground, slapped, and pushed down the floor with great force, her 
testimony as to how she was raped which belied her assertion that she 
struggled and resisted the accused's advances, her failure to shout and 
make an outcry when there were several houses near the place where she 
was allegedly raped, and the unexplained delay by complainant in 
reporting the alleged rape. Likewise, in <em>People vs. Burgos</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>
 where the complainant admitted that she enjoyed having sex with the 
accused, the Court also observed that the complainant's testimony 
contained conflicts on major details which discredited its veracity, <em>i.e.</em>,
 her retractions on whether or not the accused ejaculated, her 
vacillations as to how many times she had sex with the accused, and her 
location while the accused allegedly talked with the owner of the house 
where she was supposedly raped.  In both cases, that the complainants 
had orgasm was not the sole reason for the acquittal of the accused.  A 
more important consideration was that the testimonies made by the 
complainants were replete with inconsistencies on significant details 
which considerably eroded their probative value.
</p><p>But, in this case, Lanie's testimony remained unshaken despite 
the numerous questions propounded to her.  She made no attempt to 
embellish or improve upon her story to the extent of even admitting 
something that would endanger her own cause.  This admission so clearly 
against her own interest tends to strengthen rather than weaken Lanie's 
credibility as it erases any suspicion of a rehearsed testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>
</p><p>Considered in its entirety, Lanie's testimony contains no 
indication that she agreed to have sex with her father.  She "felt bad" 
when her father had sexual intercourse with her. Like Anniely, she tried
 to push her father away.  Also noteworthy is that the day following the
 rape on September 3, 1996, Lanie left their house to escape from her 
father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Finally, when asked whether she could forgive her father for what he had done, Lanie did not hesitate to say "no."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>
</p><p>We cannot view Lanie's acts and sentiments to be consistent with 
that of a young girl who consented to have sexual intercourse with her 
own father.  We previously held that one who was sexually abused by her 
own father would want to leave the family home.  Indeed, that Lanie ran 
away from her house shows an unwillingness to live with her own father 
which bolsters her claim of repeated sexual abuse by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>
 That she ceased to resist accused-appellant's advances does not 
necessarily mean that she voluntarily agreed to have sex with her 
father. "Where resistance would be futile, offering none at all cannot 
amount to consent to the sexual assault."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>
 This rings especially true in the case of accused-appellant who, being 
the father, has moral ascendancy over his victim stemming from his 
parental authority over her and the latter's correlative duty to obey 
and observe reverence and respect towards him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>
</p><p>A rape victim's testimony charging a close relative with having 
raped her, such as a complaint filed by a daughter against her own 
father, is entitled to great weight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>
 We see no reason to doubt the veracity of the testimonies of these two 
young girls.  Being of tender age, they would be hard put to fabricate a
 story of defloration against their own father, make public their 
painful and humiliating experiences which are better left forgotten, 
allow an examination of their private parts, expose themselves to the 
trouble, inconvenience, embarrassment, and humiliation of a public 
trial, and jeopardize their chances for marriage unless they are telling
 the truth and are motivated by nothing but the desire to obtain justice
 for the grievous wrongs committed against them by their own father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>
</p><p>Accused-appellant's bare denials of the allegations against him, 
on the other hand, have little evidentiary weight in the face of the 
clear, categorical, and convincing testimonies of his two daughters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>
 His claim that his wife instigated her daughters to file these cases so
 that she can be free to live with another man is not entitled to be 
given credit.  It is quite unnatural for a parent, especially a mother, 
to use her offspring as an engine of malice and expose her daughters to 
the stigma attached to rape victims simply because she wants to end her 
relationship with her husband or to retaliate against him for the sins 
he committed against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> 
Besides, accused-appellant himself said that he did not charge his wife 
with adultery because he felt pity for her and that he was unwilling to 
face the prospect of along litigation that would affect his work.  There
 would thus be no reason for his wife to file false charges against him.
</p><p>We, therefore, find no reason to reverse the findings of the 
trial court.  Accused-appellant was correctly sentenced to reclusion 
perpetua for the commission of rape against Anniely Diaz because, at 
that time, R.A. No. 7659 was not yet in effect and the imposition of the
 death penalty was still constitutionally prohibited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>
</p><p>But with respect to Lanie Diaz, the commission of the rape 
against her on September 3, 1996 is governed by R.A. No. 7659 which took
 effect on December 31, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>
 R.A. No. 7659 amended Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code by imposing 
the penalty of death in cases where rape is committed "[w]hen the victim
 is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, 
ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity of affinity 
within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of
 the victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> 
Consequently, for the imposition of the death penalty, the information 
must allege the qualifying circumstances of relationship between the 
accused and the victim and the victim's age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>
</p><p>In G.R. No. 133735 (Criminal Case No. 38,262-97), the information
 alleged the presence of these qualifying circumstances, i.e., that the 
accused is the father of the victim and that the latter was a 13-year 
old minor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> at the time of the commission of the rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Moreover, these allegations were duly proven in this case.  The birth certificate of Lanie Diaz<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> states that Lorenzo Diaz is her father.  Accused-appellant himself admitted that both Anniely and Lanie Diaz are his children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> As to the victim's age, her birth certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>
 shows that she was born on October 14, 1983.  Thus, on September 3, 
1996, Lanie was exactly 12 years, 10 months, and 20 days old and, 
therefore, a minor at the time of the commission of the rape.
</p><p>Four justices of the Court maintain that Republic Act 7659 is 
unconstitutional insofar as it prescribes the death penalty; 
nevertheless they submit to the ruling of the majority to the effect 
that this law is constitutional and that the death penalty can be 
lawfully imposed in the case at bar.
</p><p>The award of civil indemnity to Anniely Diaz must be increased to P50,000.00 in accordance with current jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup>
 In addition, moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 must be awarded 
to her without need of further proof other than that rape was committed 
against her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>
</p><p>With regard to Lanie Diaz, the civil indemnity awarded must be increased to P75,000.00 in accordance with our current rulings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>
 that if rape is qualified by any of the circumstances under which the 
death penalty shall be imposed, the indemnity shall be P75,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In addition, she must be paid P50,000.00 as moral damages.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision of the Regional Trial 
Court, Branch 17, Davao City is AFFIRMED, with the modification that in 
G.R. No. 133735 (Criminal Case No. 38,262-97), the indemnity to Lanie 
Diaz is increased to P75,000.00 and, in addition, accused-appellant is 
ordered to pay her P50,000.00 as moral damages, while in G.R. No. 133736
 (Criminal Case No. 38,263-97), the indemnity awarded to Anniely Diaz is
 increased to P50,000.00, and in addition, the amount of P50,000.00 is 
awarded to her by way of moral damages.
</p><p>In accordance with Section 25 of R.A. 7659, amending Art. 83 of 
the Revised Penal Code, upon the finality of this decision, let the 
records of these cases be forthwith forwarded to the Office of the 
President should he decide to exercise his prerogative of mercy.
