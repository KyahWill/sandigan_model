				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For automatic review is the decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 45, Anonas, Urdaneta, Pangasinan convicting appellant Domingo Valdez y Dulay guilty of two crimes:&nbsp; (1) murder for which he was sentenced to suffer the death penalty and (2) illegal possession of Firearms and Ammunition under Presidential Decree No. 1866 for which he was sentenced to suffer <i>reclusion perpetua</i> based on the following criminal indictments:<br><br><blockquote>"<b>CRIMINAL CASE NO.

At that time, Marcelo's other housemates - his wife, son Rolando Valdez, daughter-in-law Imelda Umagtang and an eight-year-old boy named Christopher Centeno - were staying upstairs preparing to sleep.&nbsp; In the course of their conversation, Labrador was lying sideways on a carabao sled, placed under the family <i>nipa</i> house.&nbsp; He was facing his father at the eastern side of the house, at a distance of about less than two (2) meters from each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><sup> </sup>TSN, June 13, 1996, pp. 14 and 17. 3 Suddenly, two consecutive gunshots were fired coming from the western side of the house by an assailant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The first shot landed on the left forefinger and thumb of Labrador, while the second shot hit him two (2) inches from the left shoulder, below the neck which exited at the right side just below his breast.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> After firing, the assailant immediately ran away towards the west direction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Marcelo Valdez who was talking to his son, immediately called for help while the victim managed to walk upstairs towards the kitchen. The stunning sound of the two gunfire and Marcelo's cry for help alerted Imelda Umagtang and her common-law husband Rolando Valdez, who were both lying on bed, to verge upon the kitchen where they saw the victim bathed in his own blood.&nbsp; When Rolando inquired from the victim who shot him, the latter replied that it was the appellant.&nbsp; At this time, the victim's brother and in-laws arrived.&nbsp; They also asked the victim what happened and the latter once more said that it was appellant who shot him.&nbsp; At such time, the search for the passenger jeep that will transport the victim to the hospital continued.&nbsp; After an hour, they were able to find a passenger jeep but the victim already succumbed to death prior to his transport to the hospital.<br><br>The next day, on November 1, 1995, Dr. Asuncion Tuvera of San Manuel Rural Health Unit conducted the autopsy on the cadaver of the deceased in the latter's house.&nbsp; The medical examination revealed the following gunshot wounds-<br><br><blockquote>"A. External findings:<br><br>Chest - gunshot wound at the left sternal line 2 inches below the left clavicle, 2 cm in diameter penetrating<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">- gunshot wound at the right enterior axillary line at the level of the lumbar area.<br></div><br>Extremities - lacuated wound on the left thumb and index finger with fracture of the phalanges.<br><br>"B. Internal findings:<br><br>Chest - fracture of the 3<sup>rd</sup> enterior left rib.<br>Abdomen placuated wound of the liver.<br><br>"Cause of death:<br>Cardio respiratory arrest secondary to severe hemorrhage secondary to gunshot wound on the chest and lumbar area." (Exhibit "E"; records, p. 7)</blockquote><br>Thereafter, appellant was charged before the trial court with two separate information for murder and illegal possession of firearms to which he pleaded not guilty.&nbsp; After trial, judgment was rendered convicting appellant as earlier mentioned. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the Court finds:<br><br><u>"IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. U-8719:</u><br><br>"The accused <u>DOMINGO VALDEZ Y DULAY GUILTY</u> beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER defined and penalized under republic Act No. 7659 otherwise known as the Heinous Crime Law, the offense having been committed with the attendant aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, abuse of superior strength and nighttime, hereby sentences him the ultimum supplicium of DEATH to be executed pursuant to Republic Act No. 8177 known as the Lethal Injection Law, to pay the heirs of the victim LABRADOR VALDEZ in the amount of P50,000.00 as indemnity; P23,500.00 as actual damages; P200,000.00 as moral damages; and to pay the costs.<br><br><u>"IN CRIMINAL CASE NO.

Appellant's assertion of impossibility of identification in a period of a "few seconds look" at the time of the second shot, which was fired successively, was negated by the fact that appellant shot the victim at a distance of around two meters from the kerosene lamp.&nbsp; The distance of the appellant from the kerosene lamp does not preclude the possibility of identification since the place was properly illumined capacitating the witness to identify the assailant.&nbsp; In fact, both Marcelo and the deceased were able to identify appellant.<br><br>Appellant capitalizes on the alleged failure of Lilia Valdez (wife of the deceased) to mention to the officer who investigated the killing, that she heard her husband say that the appellant was his assailant. He argues that her testimony in court that she heard her husband say that it was appellant who shot him, was merely an afterthought.&nbsp; In support thereof, appellant quotes the following answers of Lilia Valdez during cross-examination -<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">"ATTY.

Imelda Umagtang<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> testified to these utterances of the deceased in court.<br><br>The victim's septuagenarian father Marcelo Valdez likewise affirmed the identity of the appellant as the assailant.&nbsp; He testified in court that he recognized the assailant with the lighting coming from the kerosene lamp hanging on the wall, which illuminated the whole ground of the <i>nipa</i> hut.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> He claimed that he recognized appellant at the second shot<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> at a distance of around three meters (3) away from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> At the time appellant fired the second shot, appellant was less than a meter away from the victim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and around two meters from the kerosene lamp.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Lilia Valdez, the victim's wife, recounting that fateful day, similarly attested appellant's culpability in court.&nbsp; She testified that when her husband was shot she was in her house with her children, about 25 to 30 meters<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> from the victim's location.&nbsp; When she heard the gunfire and the summons of her parents-in-law that her husband was shot, she rushed to her husband and saw him bloodied, lying prostrate in the kitchen.&nbsp; She asked the victim what happened and the latter answered that appellant shot him.<br><br>Appellant likewise debunks the probative value given to Imelda Umagtang's testimony that she heard the victim say that it was appellant who shot him because such statement was not directed to her by the victim but to Rolando Valdez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> This according to appellant finds support in the following testimony of Imelda -<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">"ATTY.

appellant as his assailant have the vestiges of a dying declaration, the elements for its admissibility are:<br><br><blockquote>" (1) the declaration was made by the deceased under consciousness of his impending death; (2) the deceased was at time competent as a witness; (3) the declaration concerns the cause and surrounding circumstances of the declarant's death; and (4) it offered in a criminal case wherein the declarant's death is subject of inquiry."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote><br>These requirements are present in this case. The deceased made, before his death, more than one statement, naming the person who shot him.&nbsp; The statements uttered by the deceased were in response to the queries about the identity of the assailant.&nbsp; Such utterances are admissible as a declaration of the surrounding circumstances of the victim's death, which were uttered under the consciousness of an impending death.&nbsp; That the victim was conscious of his impending death is shown by the extent and seriousness of the wounds inflicted upon the victim.&nbsp; The victim, prior to his death, was competent to be a witness in court and such dying declaration is offered in a criminal prosecution for murder where he was himself a victim.<br><br>In a further but futile attempt to exculpate himself from liability, appellant contends that he has no motive to kill the victim.&nbsp; While he admitted that the victim eloped with his wife, he was not the only suspect having a motive to kill the victim. Suffice it to say that the evidence on motive is inconsequential when the identity of the culprit has been positively established<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>Ultimately, the issues raised by appellant fall within the sphere of credibility of witnesses which, the reviewing court on appeal, ordinarily gives deference to the assessments and conclusion of the trial court provided it is supported by the evidence on record.&nbsp; Findings of facts by the trial court are usually not disturbed on appeal on the proposition that the lower court had the unique opportunity of having observed the elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' deportment on the stand while testifying.<br><br>The killing was attended by treachery when the deceased was shot at his back while lying on a carabao sledge conversing with his father, in a sudden and unexpected manner giving him no opportunity to repel it or defend himself against such attack,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and without any provocation on his part. With respect to the other aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation, abuse of superior strength, and nighttime, this Court cannot appreciate the same against the appellant for lack of factual basis.&nbsp; There is no evidence on record that appellant contemplated and took some time of cool reflection before performing his evil act for evident premeditation to set in.&nbsp; The abuse of superior strength, assuming there is any, is already absorbed in treachery.&nbsp; Nighttime as an aggravating circumstance was not established for lack of proof that appellant specifically sought the darkness of night to perpetuate his deed.&nbsp; In the absence of any evidence that nocturnity was specifically sought for by the offender in the commission of the crime, such aggravating circumstance may not be validly appreciated.<br><br>In criminal prosecutions, the accused is entitled to an acquittal, unless his guilt is shown beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean such a degree of proof as, excluding possibility of error, produces absolute certainty.&nbsp; Moral certainty only is required, or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The prosecution ably discharged its duty by establishing its case against appellant through the required quantum of proof.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. U-8720, appellant was found guilty of the crime of Illegal Possession of Firearms and Ammunition punished under P.D. 1866 and was sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay the costs.&nbsp; His separate indictment was on account of the unlicensed firearm used in the killing. Under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 8294,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> "if homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, such use of an unlicensed firearm shall be considered as an aggravating circumstance." Although the crime in this case was committed in 1995, the amendatory law (R.A. No. 8294) which became effective on July 6, 1997, fifteen (15) days after its publication in Malaya and Philippine Journal on June 21, 1997, since it is favorable to appellant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> shall be given a retroactive effect.&nbsp; Therefore, the illegal possession or use of the unlicensed firearm may no longer be separately charged<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and only one offense should be punished, <i>viz</i>., murder in this case, and the use of unlicensed firearm should only be considered as an aggravating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Considering that appellant is liable for murder, the illegal possession case can no longer be pursued because it is merely treated as an aggravating circumstance.<br><br>Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code penalizes murder with <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.&nbsp; Since the killing was committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, such circumstance will be treated merely as an aggravating circumstance under R.A. 8294.&nbsp; Pursuant to Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code, when the law prescribes a penalty composed of two indivisible penalties, such as <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death, there being one aggravating circumstance, the greater penalty (death) shall be applied. However, the aggravating circumstance of use of an unlicensed firearm cannot be appreciated in this case because its retroactive application would be unfavorable to the accused, since the higher penalty of death would necessarily be imposed.&nbsp; Thus, we could only impose the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>in line with the ruling in <b><i>People vs. Nepomuceno, Jr.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> -<br><br>"It must be underscored that although R.A.
