 arraignment on June 10, 1994, accused-appellant, assisted by counsel de

jointly tried. On November 20, 1995, the Regional Trial Court of 
Romblon, Romblon, Branch 81 rendered a Decision finding 
accused-appellant Gadfre Tianson guilty of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The dispositive portion of said Decision provides, as follows -</p> <p>"WHEREFORE, this Court finds the accused GADFRE TIANSON GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of:</p> <ol><li>1. Rape under the Information, dated August 23, 1991, in Criminal Case No. 1822 and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>,

 period of preventive imprisonment the accused had undergone shall be 
credited in his favor to its full extent and the penalties herein 
imposed shall be served successively in accordance with Articles 29 and 
70, respectively, of the Revised Penal Code.</p> <p>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p></blockquote> <p>Hence, this appeal.</p> <p>In
 both cases, the trial court relied on the separate testimonies of the 
victims, Rosalie M. Gapi and Rosanna M. Manipol, corroborated by the 
testimony of Dr. Catalino B. Gumban, medical officer of the Romblon 
District Hospital. </p> <p>The facts of Criminal Case No. 1822 are as follows:</p> <p>In
 the evening of February 11, 1991, the victim, Rosalie M. Gapi, then 
thirteen (13) years old and a confessed virgin, was left alone in their 
house in Concepcion Norte, Santa Maria, Romblon. After cooking for 
herself and eating, Rosalie closed the door and windows of their house, 
lit a gas lamp in her room and went to bed. At around 11:00 o'clock that
 night, she woke up and noticed that the gas lamp was off. She was about
 to go outside her room to get a match for the lamp when she suddenly 
met the accused-appellant who blocked her and placed a pillow on her 
face. Accused-appellant then ordered her to lie down on the bed and held
 both her hands behind her with his left hand. With his right hand, 
accused-appellant removed his pants and succeeded in removing the shorts
 and panty of Rosalie. While this was happening, Rosalie smelled an odor
 that seemed to come from a cigarette, which odor caused her to feel 
dizzy and eventually made her unconscious. However, before becoming 
unconscious, Rosalie was aware that accused-appellant laid on top of her
 and inserted his penis into her vagina. She heard accused-appellant 
utter the words, "Wow, virgin". During this time, Rosalie felt pain and 
tried to struggle. When she woke up at around 4:00 o'clock in the 
morning, accused-appellant was no longer around. Rosalie noticed that 
she only had her t-shirt on and that her body was painful, particularly 
her thighs and vagina. She also saw blood on the blanket and mat where 
she had lain. After crying, she washed the bloodied blanket and mat, 
afraid that her parents might see these and scold her.</p> <p>Rosalie 
further testified that after the rape, accused-appellant even told her 
on the street that it was he who had sex with her. In her sworn 
statement, Rosalie likewise stated that accused-appellant was openly 
narrating what happened to them in public.</p> <p>It took Rosalie some 
time before she was able to narrate the incident to her mother, who 
accompanied her to file a sworn statement with the police on July 27, 
1991. Rosalie then submitted herself to a medical examination on July 
29, 1991. A certification was issued by the examining physician, Dr. 
Jocelyn I. Ilagan, that Rosalie's vulvar opening revealed a mucosal scar
 or a healed lacerated wound. It was also reported that during her 
internal examination, her vaginal vault admitted two fingers without 
pain, and that there was no resistance on internal examination, 
suggesting a possible hymenal break.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p> <p>In
 his defense, accused-appellant testified that he had known Rosalie for a
 year prior to the incident and had been courting her two (2) weeks 
prior to such date. Rosalie, however, turned him down because she 
already had a boyfriend. Yet, he claims that even while he was still 
courting Rosalie, they already had sex and that at around six o'clock in
 the evening of that fateful night, Rosalie invited him over to her 
house to help her with her school assignment. He also claims that 
Rosalie left him to look for a companion in the house of one Bogoy 
Dalisay but that she returned alone. Accused-appellant alleges that he 
declared he was going home but Rosalie stopped him and asked him to 
spend the night in her house. At around 12:00 o'clock midnight, Rosalie 
gave him a pillow and mat and told him he could already sleep. They then
 started kissing, after which he undressed himself first and then 
Rosalie and then proceeded to have sex with her. He narrated that while 
they were having sex, Rosalie even asked him to place a pillow under her
 buttocks. They had sex again at around 12:30 o'clock and, again, at 
around 3:00 o'clock in the morning. He left her at around 4:00 o'clock 
the following morning.</p> <p>Accused-appellant further alleges that 
Rosalie was no longer a virgin when they had sex and that her charge of 
rape against him is a lie as she consented to their sexual acts. He 
claims that Rosalie was probably afraid of her mother, prompting her to 
cry rape. Accused-appellant also avers that on July 28, 1991, Rosalie's 
mother asked him to go to their house where she asked him to wait for 
Rosalie's father so that they can arrange their marriage. He narrated 
that he asked the same from Rosalie's mother. He claims that he stayed 
in their house from 9:00 o'clock in the morning until 4:00 o'clock in 
the afternoon. However, Rosalie's father failed to arrive.</p> <p>On 
cross-examination, accused-appellant admitted leaving for Manila on July
 30, 1991, or three (3) days after he learned of the criminal cases 
filed against him, admittedly to hide. He stayed in Manila for three (3)
 years and only returned to Romblon in May, 1994.</p> <p>The facts of Criminal Case No. 1825, are as follows -</p> <p>In
 the afternoon of July 17, 1991, Rosanna M. Manipol, then fifteen (15) 
years old and a confessed virgin, was in the house of one Vicente 
Ramirez with her brother and classmates, to eat lunch as was their 
custom during school lunch breaks. Rosanna was not, however, able to 
return to school that afternoon because she developed a fever and 
decided to stay in the said house and rest while waiting for a companion
 to take her home; her own house being two and a half (2 and Â½) 
kilometers away from their school. At around 2:00 o'clock that 
afternoon, while lying down and resting in the said house, Rosanna felt 
somebody enter and later saw accused-appellant in front of her, wearing 
t-shirt and short pants. She was about to scream but was stopped when 
accused-appellant, armed with a five (5) inch fan knife, warned her not 
to scream or he would kill her. He also warned Rosanna that if she tells
 her parents about the incident, he would kill her. Accused-appellant 
pinned down Rosanna's hands with his right hand and sat on the bed where
 she was lying. Rosanna then smelled a bad odor coming from the 
direction of the accused-appellant who had entered the room smoking, 
which caused her to become dizzy and unconscious. When Rosanna regained 
consciousness, she felt weak and noticed that she no longer had her 
skirt nor shorts and panties on. Instead, Rosanna found her skirt and 
panty beside her on the bed, while her shorts were under the bed. She 
also noticed blood on her private part and near her buttocks.</p> <p>Rosanna
 knew accused-appellant even before the incident when he was briefly 
introduced to her by one Marissa Ramirez, whom Rosanna knew to be his 
relative, sometime in December, 1990.</p> <p>She narrated what happened 
to her to the police authorities only on July 27, 1991, or ten (10) days
 later, because she was afraid of the threat made by accused-appellant 
that he would kill her if she told her parents about the incident. It 
was after she learned that Rosalie Gapi was also raped by 
accused-appellant that she decided to narrate what happened to her as 
well. Two (2) days after executing her sworn statement, or on July 29, 
1991, Rosanna submitted herself to a medical examination, a 
certification was issued by the examining physician, Dr. Jocelyn I. 
Ilagan, that Rosanna's "vaginal vault admits 2 fingers without pain; no 
resistance on internal examination, possibility of a broken hymen".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p> <p>Accused-appellant
 admits having had sex with Rosanna during the incident in question, but
 claims that the same was with the latter's consent, she being his 
sweetheart since May, 1991; that he sent her a courtship letter after 
being told by Rosanna's friends that she liked him; and that she 
answered his proposal soon after she received his letter. According to 
accused-appellant, he had sex with Rosanna for at least seven (7) times,
 all in the same house where the alleged rape took place. 
Accused-appellant claims that Rosanna would always invite him over and 
that sometimes she would miss school in her desire to be with him. He 
claims that Rosanna's companions ignored their being alone in the room 
because they knew they were sweethearts.</p> <p>In convicting the 
accused-appellant on both charges of rape, the trial court gave credence
 to the testimonies of the two (2) victims, and rejected the claim of 
accused-appellant that the sexual act in both instances was done with 
the respective consent of the two (2) victims. In rejecting 
accused-appellant's insistence on consensual sex, the trial court ruled 
that the same was hard to believe. The trial court also took note of the
 fact that accused-appellant failed to produce the letter he testified 
to as having been sent to him by Rosanna. Likewise, accused-appellant's 
flight was taken as indicative of his guilt of the crimes charged 
against him.</p> <p>In this Appeal, accused-appellant raises the following assignment of errors -</p> <p align="center">"I</p> <blockquote> <p>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTION THAN THAT OF THE DEFENSE.</p></blockquote> <p align="center">II</p> <blockquote> <p>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME CHARGED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p></blockquote> <p>Anent
 the first assigned error, we reiterate the time-honored rule that the 
trial court's assessment of the credibility of witnesses is accorded 
great respect and will not be disturbed on appeal unless a material or 
substantial fact has been overlooked or misappreciated, which if 
properly taken into account may alter the outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 In the instant case, we have painstakingly reviewed the records and 
transcript of stenographic notes and have not found any reason to 
overturn the challenged Decision.</p> <p>Accused-appellant insists that 
the sexual acts he had with both victims are with their respective 
consent. While the Court has upheld the defense of consensual sex in 
some cases on the basis of strong evidence, consisting of letters and 
the testimonies of witnesses showing that the alleged rape was actually 
sex by mutual consent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> the "sweetheart theory", being raised as an affirmative defense, must be established by convincing proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 The burden of proof is on the accused-appellant that he and the victims
 are sweethearts. However, accused-appellant failed to establish such 
fact by convincing evidence.</p> <p>As regards Criminal Case No. 1822, 
accused-appellant's testimony that he already had sex with Rosalie even 
while courting her, is equally hard to believe. We find his bare 
allegation as incredible, unnatural, unconvincing and so inconsistent 
with human nature and the course of things as to be totally devoid of 
credibility. Indeed, we cannot fathom how a fourteen year old barrio 
girl, barely into her teens, can so wantonly engage in sex with a 
twenty-four year old man whose courtship she had spurned. Such scenario 
is made more inconceivable by the fact, that Rosalie had a boyfriend at 
that time, as admitted by accused-appellant.</p> <p>Coming now to 
Criminal Case No. 1825, accused-appellant's referral to a love letter 
allegedly sent to him by Rosanna cannot be given credence by this Court 
considering that it was not presented in court or testified to by a 
disinterested witness.</p> <p>In both cases, we have two young girls 
barely in their teens caught by surprise by a twenty-four year old 
virtual stranger who brutally forced himself into their juvenile bodies.
 Physically and mentally, they could do little to resist his strong 
advances. Under the circumstances, physical resistance need not be 
established, especially since intimidation was exercised upon the 
victims and they submitted themselves against their will to 
accused-appellant's lust because of fear for life and personal safety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p> <p>Young
 though they are, the doctrine still holds that when a woman testifies 
that she has been raped, she says in effect, all that is necessary to 
show that rape has been committed, as long as her testimony meets the 
test of credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
Courts give credence to the testimony of a young girl who claims to be a
 victim of sexual assault, because ordinarily, no girl or woman of 
decent repute would undergo the humiliation of a public trial and 
testify on the details of her ordeal, unless motivated by a desire to 
have the offender apprehended and punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 In this case, other than the accused-appellant's allegation of 
"conspiracy" by the victims' mothers and other relatives, no such motive
 has been shown as to why Rosalie and Rosanna would accuse him of the 
heinous crime of rape. Coming now to the award of damages, the trial 
court's award of P40,000.00 in moral damages should be increased to 
P50,000.00 in line with recent jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 In addition to moral damages, civil indemnity should also be awarded to
 the victims. Under prevailing jurisprudence, civil indemnity of 
P50,000.00 is automatically awarded to the offended party without need 
of further evidence other than the fact of the commission of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 Finally, pursuant to Article 2230 of the Civil Code, the presence of 
one aggravating circumstance justifies the award of exemplary damages. 
Accused-appellant should thus pay Rosalie P25,000.00 as exemplary 
damages since the aggravating circumstance of dwelling was duly proven, 
the evidence having established that he entered the residence of Rosalie
 and there perpetuated the sexual attack.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p> <p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>,
 the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Romblon, Romblon, Branch 
81, in Criminal Cases Nos. 1822 and 1825 dated November 20, 1995, 
convicting accused-appellant of rape and sentencing him to suffer the 
penalty of reclusion perpetua, with all its accessory penalties, in each
 case, is <strong>AFFIRMED </strong>with the following <strong>MODIFICATIONS</strong>:</p> <ol><li>The award of moral damages awarded to both victims is increased to P50,000.00 each;<br><br> </li><li>Accused-appellant is ordered to pay both victims civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00 each; and<br><br> </li><li>Accused-appellant
