				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court seeking the reversal of the Order dated February 25, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; of the Regional Trial Court of Balayan, Batangas, Branch XI,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; in Civil Case No. 3442, denying the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction to enjoin the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) from holding the plebiscite scheduled on February 28, 1998, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>The facts are undisputed.<br><br>On February 23, 1998, petitioners, as officials and residents of <i>barangay</i> San Rafael, Calaca, Batangas, filed a class suit against the <i>Sangguniang Panglalawigan</i> of Batangas, <i>Sangguniang Pambayan</i> of Calaca, Batangas, and the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), docketed as Civil Case No. 3442, before the Regional Trial Court of Balayan, Batangas, Branch XI, for annulment of Ordinance No. 05 and Resolution No. 345, series of 1997, both enacted by the <i>Sangguniang Panglalawigan</i> of Batangas, and COMELEC Resolution No. 2987, series of 1998, with prayer for preliminary injunction/temporary restraining order.&nbsp; Ordinance No. 05<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp; declared the abolition of <i>barangay</i> San Rafael and its merger with <i>barangay</i> Dacanlao, municipality of Calaca, Batangas and accordingly instructed the COMELEC to conduct the required plebiscite as provided under Sections 9 and 10 of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; On the other hand, Resolution No. 345<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; affirmed the effectivity of Ordinance No. 05, thereby overriding the veto<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; exercised by the governor of Batangas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; Ordinance No. 05 was vetoed by the governor of Batangas for being <i>ultra vires</i>, particularly, as it was not shown that the essential requirements under Section 9, in relation to Section 7, of Republic Act No. 7160, referring to the attestations or certifications of the Department of Finance (DOF), National Statistics Office (NSO) and the Land Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), were obtained.&nbsp; Pursuant to the foregoing ordinance and resolution, on February 10, 1998, the COMELEC promulgated Resolution No. 2987, providing for the rules and regulations governing the conduct of the required plebiscite scheduled on February 28, 1998, to decide the issue of the abolition of <i>barangay</i> San Rafael and its merger with <i>barangay</i> Dacanlao, Calaca, Batangas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Simultaneous with the filing of the action before the trial court, petitioners also filed an <i>ex parte</i> motion for the issuance of a temporary restraining order to enjoin respondents from enforcing Ordinance No. 05, Resolution No. 345, and COMELEC Resolution No. 2987.<br><br>In an Order dated February 25, 1998, the trial court denied the <i>ex parte</i> motion for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction for lack of jurisdiction.&nbsp; According to the trial court, the temporary restraining order/injunction sought by petitioners is directed only to COMELEC Resolution No. 2987.&nbsp; The trial court ruled that any petition or action questioning an act, resolution or decision of the COMELEC must be brought before the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On February 27, 1998, petitioners filed the instant petition with prayer for a temporary restraining order, without filing a motion for reconsideration of the trial courts Order dated February 25, 1998, claiming the urgency or immediate necessity to enjoin the conduct of the plebiscite scheduled on February 28, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution dated March 10, 1998, the Court directed the parties to maintain the <i>status quo</i> prevailing at the time of the filing of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On August 28, 1998, the Solicitor General filed a Manifestation and Motion in <i>lieu</i> of Comment, declaring that he concurs with petitioners cause and recommending that the instant petition be given due course.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, the Court further resolved on September 29, 1998 to require the COMELEC and the <i>Sangguniang Panglalawigan</i> of Batangas to submit their own Comment on the petition.<br><br>In a Resolution dated June 15, 1999, the Court resolved to give due course to the petition and require the parties to submit their respective memoranda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In their Memorandum filed on October 26, 1999, petitioners submitted the following issue for the resolution of this Court:<br><blockquote>"WHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT COURT HAS JURISDICTION TO ENJOIN THE COMELEC FROM IMPLEMENTING ITS RESOLUTION NO. 2987, SERIES OF 1998, WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE PLEBISCITE SCHEDULED ON FEBRUARY 28, 1998 TO DECIDE ON THE ABOLITION OF <i>BARANGAY</i> SAN RAFAEL AND ITS MERGER WITH <i>BARANGAY</i> DACANLAO, CALACA, BATANGAS, PENDING THE DETERMINATION OF CIVIL CASE NO. 3442 FOR THE ANNULMENT OF ORDINANCE NO. 05, RESOLUTION NO. 345 AND COMELEC RESOLUTION NO. 2987.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </blockquote><i>First,</i> petitioners contend that the assailed Order dated February 25, 1998, of the Regional Trial Court of Balayan, Batangas, Branch XI, encourages multiplicity of suit[s] and splitting a single cause of action, contrary to Section 3, Rule 2, of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioners maintain that since COMELEC Resolution No. 2987 was only issued pursuant to Ordinance No. 05 and Resolution No. 345 of the <i>Sangguniang Panglalawigan</i> of Batangas, the propriety of the issuance of COMELEC Resolution No. 2987 is dependent upon the validity of the Ordinance No. 05 and Resolution No. 345.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; And considering that the jurisdiction of the trial court to hear and determine the validity of Ordinance No. 05 and Resolution No. 345 is not disputed, the assailed Order dated February 25, 1998, directing petitioners to seek the preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order before this Court, advances multiplicity of suits and splitting a single cause of action.<br><br><i>Second,</i> petitioners assert that when the COMELEC exercises its quasi-judicial functions under Section 52 of the Omnibus Election Code (<i>Batas Pambansa Blg. 881</i>), its acts are subject to the exclusive review by this Court; but when the COMELEC performs a purely ministerial duty, such act is subject to scrutiny by the Regional Trial Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; citing <b><i>Filipinas Engineering and Machine Shop vs. Ferrer </i></b>(135 SCRA 25 [1985]), thus:<br><blockquote>"It cannot be gainsaid that the powers vested by the Constitution and the law on the Commission on Elections may either be classifi1ed as those pertaining to its adjudicatory or quasi-judicial functions, or those which are inherently administrative and sometimes ministerial in character."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </blockquote>Corollary thereto, petitioners submit that [t]he conduct of [a] plebiscite, pursuant to Ordinance No. 05 and Resolution No. 345, is not adjudicatory [or quasi-judicial] in nature but simply ministerial or administrative in nature [and only] in obedience to the aforesaid Ordinance and Resolution, citing <i><b>Garces vs. Court of Appeals</b></i>, 259 SCRA 99 (1996), thus:<br><blockquote>"xxx To rule otherwise would surely burden the Court with trivial administrative questions that are best ventilated before the RTC [Regional Trial Court], a court which the law vests with the power to exercise original jurisdiction over all cases not within the exclusive jurisdiction of any court, tribunal, person or body exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><i>Lastly,</i> petitioners allege that while the plebiscite sought to be enjoined has already been conducted on February 28, 1998, the instant petition is far from being moot and academic, claiming that the actual holding of the said plebiscite could not validate an otherwise invalid ordinance and resolution;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; that there are still substantial matters to be resolved;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; assuming <i>arguendo</i> that this petition has become moot and academic,&nbsp; courts will decide a question otherwise moot and academic if it is capable of repetition, yet evading review;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; and finally, petitioners maintain that this Court has resolved to require the parties to maintain the <i>status quo</i> prevailing at the time of the filing of the petition, that is, a day before the plebiscite was scheduled to be conducted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Concurring with petitioners arguments, the Solicitor General, in his Memorandum filed on September 7, 1999, asserts that xxx. [i]t is already settled in this jurisdiction that what is contemplated by the terms any decision, order or ruling of the COMELEC reviewable by <i>certiorari</i> to this Honorable Court, as provided under Section 7, Article IX-A of the [1987]&nbsp; Constitution, are those that relate to the COMELECs exercise of its <u><b>adjudicatory or quasi-judicial</b></u> powers involving <u><b>elective</b></u> regional, provincial and city officials. (Citations omitted.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> 24 The Solicitor General further argues that the issuance of COMELEC Resolution No. 2987 is a ministerial duty of the COMELEC in the exercise of its administrative functions, hence, it is submitted that the aforecited constitutional provision is inapplicable.<br><br>Public respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC), on the other hand, submits that the power to review or reverse COMELEC Resolution No. 2987 solely belongs to this Court, citing the earlier cases of <b><i>Zaldivar vs. Estenzo</i></b> (23 SCRA 533, 540-541 [1968] ); <i><b>Luison vs. Garcia</b></i> (L-10916, May 20, 1957); <i><b>Macud vs. COMELEC</b></i> (23 SCRA 224 [1968] ); and <b><i>Aratuc vs. COMELEC</i></b> (88 SCRA 251, 272 [1979]);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; thus:<br><blockquote>"xxx.&nbsp; For even without the express constitutional prescription that only this Court may review the decisions, orders and rulings of the Commission on Elections, it is easy to understand why no interference whatsoever with the performance of the Commission on Elections of its functions should be allowed unless emanating from this Court.&nbsp; The observation of Acting Chief Justice J.B.L. Reyes in Albano v. Arranz while not precisely in point, indicates the proper approach.&nbsp; Thus:&nbsp; It is easy to realize the chaos that would ensue if the Court of First Instance of each and every province were to arrogate unto itself the power to disregard, suspend, or contradict any order of the Commission on Elections; that constitutional body would be speedily reduced to impotence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </blockquote>The COMELEC further argues that if a Regional Trial Court does not have jurisdiction to issue writs against statutory agencies of government like the ones cited above [referring to the former Court of Industrial Relations, Philippine Patent Office, Public Service Commission, Social Security Commission, National Electrification Administration and Presidential Commission on Good Government], <i>a fortiori</i> it can not have any such jurisdiction over the Commission on Elections, a constitutional independent body expressly clothed by the 1987 Constitution with, among others, quasi-judicial functions and tasked with one of the most paramount aspects of a democratic government.&nbsp; xxx.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Finally, the COMELEC contends that the temporary restraining order sought by petitioners has been rendered moot and academic by the actual holding of the plebiscite sought to be enjoined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The appeal is meritorious.<br><br>Section 7, Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution provides in part that:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 7.&nbsp; xxx.&nbsp; Unless otherwise provided by this Constitution or by law, any decision, order, or ruling of each Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court on <i>certiorari</i> by the aggrieved party within thirty days from receipt of a copy thereof."</blockquote>In <i><b>Garces vs. Court of Appeals</b></i> (259 SCRA 99 [1996] ) and <b><i>Filipinas Engineering and Machine Shop vs. Ferrer</i></b> (135 SCRA 25 [1985]), we found occasion to interpret the foregoing provision in this wise:<br><blockquote>"xxx.&nbsp; What is contemplated by the term final orders, rulings and decisions of the COMELEC reviewable by certiorari by the Supreme Court as provided by law are those rendered in actions or proceedings before the COMELEC and taken cognizance of by the said body in the exercise of its adjudicatory or quasi-judicial powers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </blockquote>In <i><b>Filipinas</b></i>, we have likewise affirmed that the powers vested by the Constitution and the law on the Commission on Elections may either be classified as those pertaining to its adjudicatory or quasi-judicial functions, or those which are inherently administrative and sometimes ministerial in character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>As aptly explained by the Solicitor General, in the instant case, after the COMELEC ascertained the issuance of the ordinance and resolution declaring the abolition of <i>barangay</i> San Rafael, it issued COMELEC Resolution No. 2987 calling for a plebiscite to be held in the affected barangays, pursuant to the provisions of Section 10 of Republic Act No. 7160.&nbsp; We agree with the Solicitor General that xxx.&nbsp; [t]he issuance of [COMELEC] Resolution No. 2987 is thus a ministerial duty of the COMELEC that is enjoined by law and is part and parcel of its <u><b>administrative</b></u> functions.&nbsp; It involves no exercise of discretionary authority on the part of respondent COMELEC; let alone an exercise of its adjudicatory or quasi-judicial power to hear and resolve controversies defining the rights and duties of party-litigants, relative to the conduct of elections of public officers and the enforcement of the election laws. (Citation omitted.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; Briefly, COMELEC Resolution No. 2987 which provides for the rules and regulations governing the conduct of the required plebiscite, was not issued pursuant to the COMELECs quasi-judicial functions but merely as an incident of its inherent administrative functions over the conduct of plebiscites, thus, the said resolution may not be deemed as a "final order" reviewable by <i>certiorari</i> by this Court.&nbsp; Any question pertaining to the validity of said resolution may be well taken in an ordinary civil action before the trial courts.<br><br>Even the cases cited by the public respondent in support of its contention&nbsp; that the power to review or reverse COMELEC Resolution No. 2987 solely belongs to this Court&nbsp; are simply not in point.&nbsp; <i><b>Zaldivar vs. Estenzo</b></i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; speaks of the power of the COMELEC to enforce and administer all laws relative to the conduct of elections to the exclusion of the judiciary.&nbsp; In the present case, petitioners are not contesting the exclusive authority of the COMELEC to enforce and administer election laws. <i><b>Luison vs. Garcia</b></i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; refers to this Courts power to review administrative decisions, particularly referring to a COMELEC resolution declaring a certain certificate of candidacy null and void, based on Article X, Section 2 of the 1935 Constitution.&nbsp; In <i><b>Macud vs. COMELEC</b></i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; we reiterated that when a board of canvassers rejects an election return on the ground that it is spurious or has been tampered with, the aggrieved party may elevate the matter to the COMELEC for appropriate relief, and if the COMELEC sustains the action of the board, the aggrieved party may appeal to this Court.&nbsp; In both <i><b>Luison</b></i> and <i><b>Macud</b></i>, the assailed COMELEC resolutions fall within the purview of final orders, rulings and decisions of the COMELEC reviewable by <i>certiorari</i> by this Court.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, public respondents other contentions deserve scant consideration.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition for review is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>, and the assailed Order dated February 25, 1998, of the Regional Trial Court of Balayan, Batangas, Branch XI is hereby <b>SET ASIDE</b> and <b>ANNULLED</b>.&nbsp; The Regional Trial Court of Balayan, Batangas, Branch XI is ordered to proceed with dispatch in resolving Civil Case No. 3442.&nbsp; The execution of the result of the plebiscite held on February 28, 1998 shall be deferred depending on the outcome of Civil Case No. 3442.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Purisima, Gonzaga-Reyes</i>, and De Leon, Jr., JJ., concur.<br><i>Pardo, J.</i>, no part, was Comelec Chairman at the time.<br><i>Ynares-Santiago, J.</i>, on leave.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE" size="1"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 17-19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Presided by Judge Roberto L.
