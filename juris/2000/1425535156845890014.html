Such abdication of duty, according to petitioner, amounts to grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.</p><p>It must be borne in mind that the purpose of governing statutes on the conduct of elections —&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>x x x [i]s to protect the integrity of elections to suppress all evils that may violate its purity and defeat the will of the voters. The purity of the elections is one of the most fundamental requisites of popular government. The Commission on Elections, by constitutional mandate must do everything in its power to secure a fair and honest canvass of the votes cast in the elections. In the performance of its duties, <em>the Commission must be given a considerable latitude in adopting means and methods that will insure the accomplishment of the great objective for which it was created — to promote free, orderly and honest elections.

There can hardly be any doubt that the text and intent of this constitutional provision is to give COMELEC all the necessary and incidental powers for it to achieve the holding of free, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible elections.</p><p>In accordance with this intent, the Court has been liberal in defining the parameters of the COMELEC’s powers in conducting elections. <em>Sumulong v. COMELEC</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> aptly points out that —&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>"Politics is a practical matter, and political questions must be dealt with realistically — not from the standpoint of pure theory.

Thus, he claims that the summary dismissal of his motion to dismiss is tainted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.</p><p>We disagree.</p><p>The filing of the motion to dismiss, in fact, appears to be part of a perfidious plot to prevent the early termination of the proceedings in Election Case No. 4847 as evidenced by a confluence of events clearly showing a pattern of delay employed by petitioner to avert the revision ballots. These events, pointed out by private respondent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and borne by the record, show that —&nbsp; </p><ol><li>It was only on September 1, 1999 after the creation of the Revision Committee and the appointment of its Chairman and Members and after the said committee was ordered by the trial court to commence the revision and to render its report within 20 days that the petitioner orally moved for the dismissal of the case on the flimsy grounds that (1) the ballot boxes subject of the protest and counter — protest have been violated; (2) the automated counting of ballots does not contemplate a manual recount of ballots; and (3) protestant is guilty of forum-shopping warranting summary dismissal of the protest; <br></li>&nbsp; <li>After the oral arguments on the oral motion to dismiss the petitioner requested for ample time within which to file an Omnibus Motion to Dismiss and over the vigorous opposition of the private respondent the same was granted by the court and the petitioner was given a period of ten (10) days to file the same and the private respondent was likewise given a period of ten (10) days to file his comment;&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>On September 11, 1998, the motion to dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and during the hearing on the said motion and the opposition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> thereto on September 21, 1998, the petitioner again asked for ample time to file a rejoinder to the vigorous opposition to motion to dismiss which was again granted by the court and it was only on September 28, 1998 that said rejoinder was filed; <br></li>&nbsp; <li>After a denial of the motion to dismiss on November 10, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration on November 18, 1998;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>When the motion for reconsideration was denied on December 1, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> petitioner filed on December 18, 1998 before the Commission on Elections a petition for<em> certiorari</em> and prohibition with prayer for preliminary injunction and asked the trial court to defer the proceedings of Election Case No. 11-27 until after his petition shall have been finally resolved which was granted by the trial court. Hence, the scheduled revision of the ballots on December 14, 15, 16 and 17, 1998 was cancelled and the proceedings of the case held in abeyance;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>As the Comelec <em>En Banc </em>did not give due course to petitioner’s prayer for writ of preliminary injunction, the trial court, upon motion of the private respondent, issued an order for the revision of ballots on February 8, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> On said day, neither the petitioner’s counsel nor his designated revisors appeared, instead the petitioner, assisted by his numerous armed men, numbering around 30 stated (<em>sic</em>) in strategic places, prevented the court personnel to enter the court premises. Were it not for the maximum tolerance exercised by the PNP personnel and the intervention of the local <em>datus</em>/leaders, there would have been bloodshed;&nbsp; </li>&nbsp; <li>On February 9, 1999, the petitioner’s counsel filed a withdrawal of appearance with the attached letter-request of the petitioner asking for the deferment of the revision of ballots for at least two (2) weeks to enable him to engage the services of another counsel.

This Honorable Supreme Court, without granting the prayer for TRO, directed the RTC, Branch III, Iligan City not to promulgate any decision in the said election case until further order[s] from this most Honorable Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></li></ol><p>It is clear, given the foregoing facts of this case, that the roundabout manner within which petitioner virtually substituted his answer by belatedly filing a motion to dismiss three (3) months later is a frivolous resort to procedure calculated to frustrate the will of the electorate. As pointedly observed by the COMELEC in its challenged Resolution dated July 6, 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> petitioner only filed his motion to dismiss "when the results of the trial appear[ed] to be adverse to him’"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> or right after the creation of the Revision Committee had been ordered by the trial court. If petitioner truly intended to move for the preliminary hearing of his special and affirmative defenses as he claims, then he should have simultaneously moved for the preliminary hearing of his special and affirmative defenses <em>at the time he filed his answer</em>. Otherwise, he should have filed his motion to dismiss "within the time for but before filing the answer…" pursuant to Section 1, Rule 16 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.</p><p>Suffice it to state in this regard that such a whimsical change of mind by petitioner can not be countenanced much more so in election cases where time is of the essence in the resolution thereof. Indeed, the Omnibus Election Code states in no uncertain terms that —</p><p>SEC. 258. <em>Preferential disposition of contests in courts</em>. The RTC, in their respective cases,<em> shall give preference to election contests over all other cases,</em> except those of <em>habeas corpus,</em> and shall, without delay, hear and within thirty (30) days from the date of their submission for decision, but in every case within six (6) months after filing, decide the same. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (emphasis and italics supplied)</p><p>Petitioner further argues that his submissions that a.] the integrity of the ballot boxes has been violated; b.] only rejected ballots or ballots manually counted are the proper subjects of an election protest; and c.] private respondent is guilty of forum-shopping, are enough grounds to dismiss the case.</p><p>We remain unconvinced.</p><p>As aptly observed by the COMELEC in the challenged Resolution, these grounds are "<em>evidentiary</em> in nature and can be best ventilated during the trial of the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> It needs be stressed in this regard that the purpose of an election protest is to ascertain whether the candidate proclaimed elected by the board of canvassers is <em>really</em> the lawful choice of the electorate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In an election contest where the correctness of the number of votes is involved, the best and most conclusive evidence are the ballots themselves; where the ballots can not be produced or are not available, the election returns would be the best evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In this case, the counted official ballots are available and there is no evidence, other than the bare allegation of petitioner, that the sanctity of the ballot boxes subject matter of the protest have been violated or the official ballots contained therein impaired. The best way, therefore, to test the truthfulness of petitioner’s claim is to open the ballot boxes in the protested precincts followed by the examination, revision, recounting and re-appreciation of the official ballots therein contained in accordance with law and pertinent rules on the matter. Needless to state this can only be done through a full-blown trial on the merits, not a peremptory resolution of the motion to dismiss on the basis of the bare and one-sided averments made therein.</p><p>Petitioner’s reliance on COMELEC Resolution No. 2868<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> to support his restrictive claim that only rejected ballots or ballots manually counted in case of failure of the automated counting machines are the proper subjects of an election protest, is just as unpersuasive.</p><p>There is admittedly a<em> lacuna leges</em> in R.A. No. 8436 which prescribes the adoption of an automated election system. However, while conceding as much, this Court ruled in <i>Tupay Loong v. COMELEC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> that the Commission is nevertheless not precluded from conducting a manual count when the automated counting system fails, reasoning thus:</p><blockquote>x x x&nbsp; In enacting R.A. No. 8436, Congress obviously failed to provide a remedy where the error in counting is not machine related for human foresight is not all-seeing. <em>We hold, however, that the vacuum in the law cannot prevent the COMELEC from levitating above the problem.</em> Section 2(1) of Article IX (C) of the Constitution gives the COMELEC the broad power "to enforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election, plebiscite, initiative, referendum and recall." Undoubtedly, the text and intent of this provision is to give the COMELEC all the necessary and incidental powers for it to achieve the objective of holding free, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible elections. Congruent to this intent, this Court has not been niggardly in defining the parameters of powers of COMELEC in the conduct of our elections … In the case at bar, the COMELEC order for a manual count was not only reasonable. It was the only way to count the decisive local votes ... The bottom line is that by means of the manual count, the will of the voters of Sulu was honestly determined. <em>We cannot kick away the will of the people by giving a literal interpretation to R.A. 8436. R.A. 8436 did not prohibit manual counting when machine count does not work. </em>Counting is part and parcel of the conduct of an election which is under the control and supervision of the COMELEC x x x<br><p>x x x Our elections are not conducted under laboratory conditions. In running for public offices, candidates do not follow the rules of Emily Post. <em>Too often, COMELEC has to make snap judgments to meet unforeseen circumstances that threaten to subvert the will of our voters. In the process, the actions of COMELEC may not be impeccable, indeed, may even be debatable. We cannot, however, engage in a swivel chair criticism of these actions often taken under very difficult circumstances.</em></p></blockquote><p>Verily, the legal compass from which the COMELEC should take its bearings in acting upon election controversies is the principle that <em>"clean elections control the appropriateness of the remedy."</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p>Be that as it may, the fact is the averments in petitioner’s counter-protest and private respondent’s protest already justified the determination of the issues through a judicial revision and recounting of the ballots pursuant to Section 255 of the Omnibus Election Code which provides that —</p><blockquote><p>SEC. 255. <em>Judicial counting of votes in election contest</em>.— <em>Where allegations in a protest or counter-protest so warrant or whenever in the opinion of the court the interests of justice so require,</em> it shall immediately order the book of voters, ballot boxes and their keys, ballots and other documents used in the election be brought before it and that the ballots be examined and votes recounted. (Italics supplied)</p></blockquote><p>So too must fall petitioner’s procedural objection that private respondent should be faulted for forum-shopping <i>vis-à-vis</i> this Court’s pronouncement in <em>Samad v. COMELEC</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> which states in no uncertain terms that —&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>As a general rule, the filing of an election protest or a petition for <em>quo warranto </em>precludes the subsequent filing of a pre-proclamation controversy, or amounts to the abandonment of one earlier filed, thus depriving the COMELEC of the authority to inquire into and pass upon the title of the protestee or the validity of his proclamation. The reason is that once the competent tribunal has acquired jurisdiction of an election protest or a petition for <em>quo warranto</em>, all questions relative thereto will have to be decided in the case itself and not in another proceeding. This procedure will prevent confusion and conflict of authority. Conformably, we have ruled in a number of cases that after a proclamation has been made, a pre-proclamation case before the COMELEC is no longer viable.&nbsp; </p><p>The rule admits of exceptions, however, as where: (1) the board of canvassers was improperly constituted; (2) <em>quo warranto was not the proper remedy; (3) what was filed was not really a petition for quo warranto or an election protest but a petition to annul a proclamation; (4) the filing of a quo warranto petition or an election protest was expressly made without prejudice to the pre-proclamation controversy or was made ad cautelam; </em>and (5) the proclamation was null and void.</p></blockquote><p>Petitioner’s argument that the filing of a motion to dismiss in an election contest filed with a regular court is not a prohibited pleading is well taken. As we pointed out in<em> Melendres, Jr. v. COMELEC</em>: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Neither can petitioner seek refuge behind his argument that the motion to dismiss filed by private respondent is a prohibited pleading under Section 1, Rule 13 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure because the said provision refers to proceedings filed <em>before the COMELEC</em>. <em>The applicable provisions on the matter are found in Part VI of the Rules of Procedure titled "PROVISIONS GOVERNING ELECTION CONTESTS BEFORE TRIAL COURT"</em> and as this Court pointedly stated in<em> Aruelo v. Court of Appeals</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>It must be noted that <strong><em>nowhere</em></strong> <em>in Part VI of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure is it provided that motions to dismiss and bill of particulars are not allowed in election protests or quo warranto cases pending before regular courts.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Constitutionally speaking, the COMELEC cannot adopt a rule prohibiting the filing of a certain pleading in the regular courts. The power to promulgate rules concerning pleadings, practice and procedure in all courts is vested in the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; </p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The foregoing pronouncement, however, will not extricate petitioner from his predicament because the denial of petitioner’s motion to dismiss was based on the fact that the <em>other</em> grounds relied therein was considered unmeritorious and not because the said motion is a prohibited pleading in electoral protest cases. While the challenged COMELEC Resolution may not have been entirely correct in dismissing the petition in this regard, the soundness of its discretion to accord unto the trial court the competence to resolve the factual issues raised in the controversy cannot be doubted. Indeed, as reasoned by the COMELEC, the —&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>x x x Commission assumes the competence of the trial court to handle electoral protest and cannot encroach on its original and exclusive jurisdiction on electoral protest cases involving the contested mayoralty seat. To our mind, the trial court should be allowed to resolve the case on the merits to be able to rule on the factual and legal grounds raised by the petitioner as his defenses in his Answer. Should the petitioner be dissatisfied with the outcome of the case in the lower court, he can still appeal, as his relief, to this Commission within the reglementary period provided by law.</p></blockquote><p>Moreover —&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>At balance, the question really boils down to a choice of philosophy and perception of how to interpret and apply the laws relating to elections; literal or liberal; the letter or the spirit; the naked provision or the ultimate purpose; legal syllogism or substantial justice; in isolation or in the context of social conditions; harshly against or gently in favor of the voter’s obvious choice. <strong><em>In applying elections laws, it would be far better to err in favor of popular sovereignty than to be right in complex but little understood legalisms.</em></strong><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p></blockquote><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, in view of all the foregoing, the petition is hereby <em>DISMISSED</em> for lack of merit.</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p><p><em>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Puno, Vitug, Mendoza, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes,</em> and <em>De Leon, Jr., JJ., </em>concur.</p><p><em>Panganiban, J., </em>in the result.</p><p><em>Melo, Kapunan, </em>and<em> Purisima, JJ., </em>on leave.</p><p><br></p><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><em> Rollo</em>, p. 32.<p></p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Record, pp. 72-74.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Record, pp. 30-38.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <em>Ibid.,</em> pp. 39-45.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><em> Id.,</em> pp. 214-215.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <em>Id.,</em> pp. 216-218.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><em> Id.,</em> pp. 219-220.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <em>Id.,</em> p. 221.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><em> Id.,</em> p. 222.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <em>Id.,</em> p. 58.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <em>Id.,</em> pp. 59-69.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><em> Id., </em>pp. 80-89.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <em>Id., </em>pp. 90-124.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <em>Id.,</em> pp. 125-143.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <em>Id.,</em> pp. 26-28.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <em>Id., </em>pp. 144-174.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> <em>Id.,</em> pp. 175-184.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <em>Rollo</em>, p. 138; Annex O, Petition.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Record, pp. 223-225.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> <em>Ibid.,</em> p. 226.</p><p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <em>Cauton v.
