				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for review on certiorari seeking to set aside the decision of the Court of Appeals which reversed the decision of the lower court in CA-G.R. CV No. 36821, entitled "Wildvalley Shipping Co., Ltd., plaintiff-appellant, versus Philippine President Lines, Inc., defendant-appellant."<br><br>The antecedent facts of the case are as follows:<br><br>Sometime in February 1988, the Philippine Roxas, a vessel owned by Philippine President Lines, Inc., private respondent herein, arrived in Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela, to load iron ore. Upon the completion of the loading and when the vessel was ready to leave port, Mr. Ezzar del Valle Solarzano Vasquez, an official pilot of Venezuela, was designated by the harbour authorities in Puerto Ordaz to navigate the Philippine Roxas through the Orinoco River.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> He was asked to pilot the said vessel on February 11, 1988<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> boarding it that night at 11:00 p.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The master (captain) of the Philippine Roxas, Captain Nicandro Colon, was at the bridge together with the pilot (Vasquez), the vessel's third mate (then the officer on watch), and a helmsman when the vessel left the port<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> at 1:40 a.m. on February 12, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Captain Colon left the bridge when the vessel was under way.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The Philippine Roxas experienced some vibrations when it entered the San Roque Channel at mile 172.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The vessel proceeded on its way, with the pilot assuring the watch officer that the vibration was a result of the shallowness of the channel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Between mile 158 and 157, the vessel again experienced some vibrations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> These occurred at 4:12 a.m.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> It was then that the watch officer called the master to the bridge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The master (captain) checked the position of the vessel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and verified that it was in the centre of the channel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> He then went to confirm, or set down, the position of the vessel on the chart.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> He ordered Simplicio A.

Like any other fact, they must be alleged and proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>A distinction is to be made as to the manner of proving a written and an unwritten law. The former falls under Section 24, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court, as amended, the entire provision of which is quoted hereunder. Where the foreign law sought to be proved is "unwritten," the oral testimony of expert witnesses is admissible, as are printed and published books of reports of decisions of the courts of the country concerned if proved to be commonly admitted in such courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Section 24 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Court, as amended, provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 24. Proof of official record. -- The record of public documents referred to in paragraph (a) of Section 19, when admissible for any purpose, may be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the officer having the legal custody of the record, or by his deputy, and accompanied, if the record is not kept in the Philippines, <b>with a certificate that such officer has the custody.</b> If the office in which the record is kept is in a foreign country, the certificate may be made by a secretary of the embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent or by any officer in the foreign service of the Philippines stationed in the foreign country in which the record is kept, and authenticated by the seal of his office." (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The court has interpreted Section 25 (now Section 24) to include competent evidence like the testimony of a witness to prove the existence of a written foreign law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In the noted case of <b><i>Willamette Iron &amp; Steel Works vs. Muzzal,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><b><i> </i></b> it was held that:<br><blockquote>"... Mr. Arthur W. Bolton, an attorney-at-law of San Francisco, California, since the year 1918 under oath, quoted verbatim section 322 of the California Civil Code and stated that said section was in force at the time the obligations of defendant to the plaintiff were incurred, i.e. on November 5, 1928 and December 22, 1928. This evidence sufficiently established the fact that the section in question was the law of the State of California on the above dates. A reading of sections 300 and 301 of our Code of Civil Procedure will convince one that these sections do not exclude the presentation of other competent evidence to prove the existence of a foreign law.<br><br>"`The foreign law is a matter of fact ...You ask the witness what the law is; he may, from his recollection, or on producing and referring to books, say what it is.' (Lord Campbell concurring in an opinion of Lord Chief Justice Denman in a well-known English case where a witness was called upon to prove the Roman laws of marriage and was permitted to testify, though he referred to a book containing the decrees of the Council of Trent as controlling, Jones on Evidence, Second Edition, Volume 4, pages 3148-3152.) x x x."<br></blockquote>We do not dispute the competency of Capt. Oscar Leon Monzon, the Assistant Harbor Master and Chief of Pilots at Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> to testify on the existence of the <i>Reglamento General de la Ley de Pilotaje </i>(pilotage law of Venezuela)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and the <i>Reglamento Para la Zona de Pilotaje N<sup>o </sup>1 del Orinoco </i>(rules governing the navigation of the Orinoco River). Captain Monzon has held the aforementioned posts for eight years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> As such he is in charge of designating the pilots for maneuvering and navigating the Orinoco River. He is also in charge of the documents that come into the office of the harbour masters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, we take note that these written laws were not proven in the manner provided by Section 24 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>The <i>Reglamento General de la Ley de Pilotaje </i>was published in the <i>Gaceta Oficial</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32] </sup>of the Republic of Venezuela. A photocopy of the <i>Gaceta Oficial</i> was presented in evidence as an official publication of the Republic of Venezuela.<br><br>The <i>Reglamento Para la Zona de Pilotaje N<sup>o </sup>1 del Orinoco</i> is published in a book issued by the <i>Ministerio de Comunicaciones </i>of Venezuela.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Only a photocopy of the said rules was likewise presented as evidence.<br><br>Both of these documents are considered in Philippine jurisprudence to be public documents for they are the written official acts, or records of the official acts of the sovereign authority, official bodies and tribunals, and public officers of Venezuela.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>For a copy of a foreign public document to be admissible, the following requisites are mandatory: (1) It must be attested by the officer having legal custody of the records or by his deputy; and (2) It must be accompanied by a certificate by a secretary of the embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice consular or consular agent or foreign service officer, and with the seal of his office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The latter requirement is not a mere technicality but is intended to justify the giving of full faith and credit to the genuineness of a document in a foreign country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>It is not enough that the <i>Gaceta Oficial</i>,<i> </i>or a book published by the <i>Ministerio de Comunicaciones </i>of Venezuela, was presented as evidence with Captain Monzon attesting it. It is also required by Section 24 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Court that a certificate that Captain Monzon, who attested the documents, is the officer who had legal custody of those records made by a secretary of the embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice consul or consular agent or by any officer in the foreign service of the Philippines stationed in Venezuela, and authenticated by the seal of his office accompanying the copy of the public document. No such certificate could be found in the records of the case.<br><br>With respect to proof of written laws, parol proof is objectionable, for the written law itself is the best evidence. According to the weight of authority, when a foreign statute is involved, the best evidence rule requires that it be proved by a duly authenticated copy of the statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>At this juncture, we have to point out that the Venezuelan law was not pleaded before the lower court.<br><br>A foreign law is considered to be pleaded if there is an allegation in the pleading about the existence of the foreign law, its import and legal consequence on the event or transaction in issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>A review of the Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> revealed that it was never alleged or invoked despite the fact that the grounding of the M/V Philippine Roxas occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of Venezuela.<br><br>We reiterate that under the rules of private international law, a foreign law must be properly pleaded and proved as a fact. In the absence of pleading and proof, the laws of a foreign country, or state, will be presumed to be the same as our own local or domestic law and this is known as processual presumption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Having cleared this point, we now proceed to a thorough study of the errors assigned by the petitioner.<br><br>Petitioner alleges that there was negligence on the part of the private respondent that would warrant the award of damages.<br><br>There being no contractual obligation, the private respondent is obliged to give only the diligence required of a good father of a family in accordance with the provisions of Article 1173 of the New Civil Code, thus:<br><blockquote>"Art. 1173. The fault or negligence of the obligor consists in the omission of that diligence which is required by the nature of the obligation and corresponds with the circumstances of the persons, of the time and of the place. When negligence shows bad faith, the provisions of articles 1171 and 2201, paragraph 2, shall apply.<br><br>"If the law or contract does not state the diligence which is to be observed in the performance, that which is expected of a good father of a family shall be required."<br></blockquote>The diligence of a good father of a family requires only that diligence which an ordinary prudent man would exercise with regard to his own property. This we have found private respondent to have exercised when the vessel sailed only after the "main engine, machineries, and other auxiliaries" were checked and found to be in good running condition;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> when the master left a competent officer, the officer on watch on the bridge with a pilot who is experienced in navigating the Orinoco River; when the master ordered the inspection of the vessel's double bottom tanks when the vibrations occurred anew.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The Philippine rules on pilotage, embodied in Philippine Ports Authority Administrative Order No. 03-85, otherwise known as the Rules and Regulations Governing Pilotage Services, the Conduct of Pilots and Pilotage Fees in Philippine Ports enunciate the duties and responsibilities of a master of a vessel and its pilot, among other things.<br><br>The pertinent provisions of the said administrative order governing these persons are quoted hereunder:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 11. Control of Vessels and Liability for Damage. -- On compulsory pilotage grounds, the Harbor Pilot providing the service to a vessel shall be responsible for the damage caused to a vessel or to life and property at ports due to his negligence or fault. He can be absolved from liability if the accident is caused by force majeure or natural calamities provided he has exercised prudence and extra diligence to prevent or minimize the damage.<br><br>"The Master shall retain overall command of the vessel even on pilotage grounds whereby he can countermand or overrule the order or command of the Harbor Pilot on board. In such event, any damage caused to a vessel or to life and property at ports by reason of the fault or negligence of the Master shall be the responsibility and liability of the registered owner of the vessel concerned without prejudice to recourse against said Master.<br><br>"Such liability of the owner or Master of the vessel or its pilots shall be determined by competent authority in appropriate proceedings in the light of the facts and circumstances of each particular case.<br><br><center>"x x x<br></center><br>"Sec. 32. Duties and Responsibilities of the Pilots or Pilots' Association. -- The duties and responsibilities of the Harbor Pilot shall be as follows:<br><br><center>"x x x<br></center><br>"f) A pilot shall be held responsible for the direction of a vessel from the time he assumes his work as a pilot thereof until he leaves it anchored or berthed safely; Provided, however, that his responsibility shall cease at the moment the Master neglects or refuses to carry out his order."<br></blockquote>The Code of Commerce likewise provides for the obligations expected of a captain of a vessel, to wit:<br><blockquote>"Art. 612. The following obligations shall be inherent in the office of captain:<br><br><center>"x x x<br></center><br>"7. To be on deck on reaching land and to take command on entering and leaving ports, canals, roadsteads, and rivers, unless there is a pilot on board discharging his duties. x x x."<br></blockquote>The law is very explicit. The master remains the overall commander of the vessel even when there is a pilot on board. He remains in control of the ship as he can still perform the duties conferred upon him by law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> despite the presence of a pilot who is temporarily in charge of the vessel. It is not required of him to be on the bridge while the vessel is being navigated by a pilot.<br><br>However, Section 8 of PPA Administrative Order No. 03-85, provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 8. <i>Compulsory Pilotage Service</i> - For entering a harbor and anchoring thereat, or passing through rivers or straits within a pilotage district, as well as docking and undocking at any pier/wharf, or shifting from one berth or another, every vessel engaged in coastwise and foreign trade shall be under compulsory pilotage.<br><br><center>"xxx."<br></center></blockquote>The Orinoco River being a compulsory pilotage channel necessitated the engaging of a pilot who was presumed to be knowledgeable of every shoal, bank, deep and shallow ends of the river. In his deposition, pilot Ezzar Solarzano Vasquez testified that he is an official pilot in the Harbour at Port Ordaz, Venezuela,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and that he had been a pilot for twelve (12) years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> He also had experience in navigating the waters of the Orinoco River.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The law does provide that the master can countermand or overrule the order or command of the harbor pilot on board. The master of the Philippine Roxas deemed it best not to order him (the pilot) to stop the vessel,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> mayhap, because the latter had assured him that they were navigating normally before the grounding of the vessel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Moreover, the pilot had admitted that on account of his experience he was very familiar with the configuration of the river as well as the course headings, and that he does not even refer to river charts when navigating the Orinoco River.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Based on these declarations, it comes as no surprise to us that the master chose not to regain control of the ship. Admitting his limited knowledge of the Orinoco River, Captain Colon relied on the knowledge and experience of pilot Vasquez to guide the vessel safely.<br><blockquote>"Licensed pilots, enjoying the emoluments of compulsory pilotage, are in a different class from ordinary employees, for they assume to have a skill and a knowledge of navigation in the particular waters over which their licenses extend superior to that of the master; pilots are bound to use due diligence and reasonable care and skill. A pilot's ordinary skill is in proportion to the pilot's responsibilities, and implies a knowledge and observance of the usual rules of navigation, acquaintance with the waters piloted in their ordinary condition, and nautical skill in avoiding all known obstructions. The character of the skill and knowledge required of a pilot in charge of a vessel on the rivers of a country is very different from that which enables a navigator to carry a vessel safely in the ocean. On the ocean, a knowledge of the rules of navigation, with charts that disclose the places of hidden rocks, dangerous shores, or other dangers of the way, are the main elements of a pilot's knowledge and skill. But the pilot of a river vessel, like the harbor pilot, is selected for the individual's personal knowledge of the topography through which the vessel is steered."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br></blockquote>We find that the grounding of the vessel is attributable to the pilot. When the vibrations were first felt the watch officer asked him what was going on, and pilot Vasquez replied that "(they) were in the middle of the channel and that the vibration was as (sic) a result of the shallowness of the channel."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Pilot Ezzar Solarzano Vasquez was assigned to pilot the vessel Philippine Roxas as well as other vessels on the Orinoco River due to his knowledge of the same. In his experience as a pilot, he should have been aware of the portions which are shallow and which are not. His failure to determine the depth of the said river and his decision to plod on his set course, in all probability, caused damage to the vessel. Thus, we hold him as negligent and liable for its grounding.<br><br>In the case of <b><i>Homer Ramsdell Transportation Company vs. La Compagnie Generale Transatlantique</i></b>, 182 U.S. 406, it was held that:<br><blockquote>"x x x The master of a ship, and the owner also, is liable for any injury done by the negligence of the crew employed in the ship. The same doctrine will apply to the case of a pilot employed by the master or owner, by whose negligence any injury happens to a third person or his property: as, for example, by a collision with another ship, occasioned by his negligence. And it will make no difference in the case that the pilot, if any is employed, is required to be a licensed pilot; provided the master is at liberty to take a pilot, or not, at his pleasure, for in such a case the master acts voluntarily, although he is necessarily required to select from a particular class.
