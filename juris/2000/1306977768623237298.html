<p>Judge Fe Albano Madrid, Judge Demetrio Calimag, Jr., Judge Efren Lamorena and

dated 11 May 1999, the OCA reported thusly: </p>
<p align="center">"<b>JUDGE FE ALBANO MADRID</b> <br>RTC, Branch 21, Santiago City 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Judge Madrid gave no explanation for the delay in the resolution of Civil 
Case No. 0105 and why there were cases which were unacted on for a considerable 
length of time. All she stated were the present status of the said cases, (pp. 
54-56, rollo).</p>
<p>"a. Delay in the Resolution of Civil Case No. 0105.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judge Madrid informed that Civil Case No. 0105 has long been dismissed on 
February 7, 1984. What might have been referred to was Spc. Proc. No. 0105 where 
there is a pending Motion for Reconsideration. The petitioner in the said case 
submitted his Supplemental Offer of Documentary Evidence on October 10, 1997 but 
was inadvertently missed. Thus, the Motion for Reconsideration was resolved only 
on February 10, 1998. </p></blockquote>
<p>"b. Unacted cases for a considerable length of time.</p></blockquote>
<ol><li><i>Civil Case 2348 For Declaration of Nullity of Marriage</i> - Summons to 
the defendant was returned unserved on October 23, 1977 with the information 
that the defendant is abroad. There is still no action by the plaintiff to have

Dismiss which was filed by the defendants on August 7, 1998.<br>

dismissed upon the manifestation of the parties that they already entered into 
an amicable settlement.<br>
</li><li><i>Civil Case 2425 For Specific Performance</i> - No answer was filed by the 
defendant. A motion to declare in default was filed by the plaintiff only on 
June 23, 1998 which was granted on June 26, 1998. On July 21, 1998, during the 
scheduled ex-parte reception of evidence, the plaintiff moved for the suspension 
of the proceedings for ninety days to restudy the complaint. The motion was 
granted.<br>
</li><li><i>Civil Case 2317 For Damages</i> - Summons was returned unserved with the 
information that the defendant is not known in the address given. There is still 
no action by the defendant.<br>
</li><li><i>Civil Case 2383 For Forcible Entry</i> - This is an appeal from the MTCC, 
Santiago City. Appellant was directed to submit his appeal memorandum within 
thirty days. He failed to submit. Appeal was dismissed on August 17, 1998.<br>

<p align="center">"<b>JUDGE EFREN A. LAMORENA</b><br>RTC, Branch 36, Santiago 
City</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Judge Efren A. Lamorena, RTC, Branch 36, Santiago City, submitted his 
reasons (pp. 60-61, rollo) for the delay in the resolution of some cases in his 
sala as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. Due to his health problem (a vision impairment) caused by a cataract 
disease clouding his eyes with intense pain and compromising as it compromised 
his eyesight thus, preventing him to carry his normal work; (Judge Lamorena 
informed that as soon as his economic life improves, he will try to submit 
himself for an eye operation. Just recently he suffered a stroke).</p>
<p>"2. His health problem is compounded by the hard working condition of his 
office. It is very small and crowded. All the equipments of the court are 
stocked without any airconditioning unit. (The Team noted that Judge Lamorena 
has no court and staff room.) He conducts his trials at the corridors and shares 
the room with the Office of the Clerk of Court.</p>
<p>"3. His sala was designated to try heinous crimes;</p>
<p>"4. He likewise revealed that he commutes daily in a public transportation at 
a distance of seventy two (72) kilometers one way with a travel time of at least 
four (4) hours a day.</p></blockquote>
<p>"On November 12, 1998 (p. 80, rollo) Judge Lamorena informed that of the 
thirty-one (31) cases mentioned in Item No. 5-a, only six (6) cases remain to be 
decided or resolved, while seven (7) of the cases listed in Item No. 5-c are 
likewise being resolved.</p>
<p>"Judge Lamorena informed that had it not been for the Super Typhoon Iliang 
and later Loleng whose destructive fury devastated the province of Isabela, 
including his residence, he would have resolved already all the said cases.</p>
<p>"He likewise manifested that he is already ready to resume trying cases in 
his sala.</p>
<p>"It is should be noted that Judge Lamorena however did not furnish this 
Office copies of his decisions. </p></blockquote>
<p align="center">"<b>JUDGE SERGIO A. PLAN</b> <br>MTC, Cauayan, Isabela </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In his letter dated August 27, 1998 (p. 68, rollo), Judge Plan simply 
informed the status of the following cases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. <u>Civil Case No. 1706</u> - Not submitted for decision because 
defendants have not been served with summons as they could not be located. Due 
to the inaction of the plaintiff, the case is ordered archived. </p>
<p>"2. <u>Civil Case Nos. 1894 &amp; 1896</u> - The Court archived said cases 
due to the inaction of the plaintiff for unreasonable length of time. </p>
<p>"3. <u>Civil Case No. 1932</u> - Not immediately acted upon due to the 
withdrawal of counsel Atty. Agustin Ladera for the plaintiff and substituted by 
new counsel Atty. Bernard Olalia who has not filed a formal appearance as 
counsel for the plaintiff and to have the motion to declare defendants in 
default set for hearing with notice to the defendants. Hence, due to the 
inaction of the plaintiff, the Court archived the case.</p>
<p>"4. <u>Civil Cases Nos. 1946 &amp; 2034</u> - Not immediately decided due to 
the failure of the plaintiff to submit the exhibits offered as evidence and as 
the Court was about to archive the cases, the plaintiff submitted the required 
exhibits and thereupon, the Court rendered its decision dated March 23 and March 
31, 1998, respectively."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Judge Wilfredo Ambrosio failed to comply with the directive of the Court. The 
OCA advised the Court that Judge Ambrosio had resigned from the service upon the 
filing of his certificate of candidacy although his resignation papers, for 
purposes of payment of his benefits, were yet being processed.</p>
<p>With respect to Judge Fe Albano Madrid, the OCA observed that the delay, for 
only a number of days, in the resolution of Civil Case No. 0105, was excusable. 
The slow movement in the other cases was found to be attributable, not to the 
Judge, but mainly to the parties. .</p>
<p>The OCA noted that Judge Calimag, in not proffering a single explanation, had 
tacitly admitted his failure to resolve the cases assigned to him within the 
reglementary period.</p>
<p>The OCA said that Judge Plan had given no explanation for his delay in 
disposing the cases in his <i>sala</i> except to state that it was due to the 
fault of the parties.</p>
<p>The OCA expressed its sympathy over the plight of Judge Lamorena who suffered 
a stroke and eventually died while in service. Judge Wilfredo Tumaliwan was 
forthwith designated as Acting Presiding Judge of Branch 36 <i>vice</i> Judge 
Lamorena.</p>
<p>In his compliance made on 11 May 1999, Judge Plata averred that Criminal 
Cases No. 3433, 3434, 2778, 3435, 3071, 2840 and 3570 (instead of 5570), as well 
as Civil Cases No. 320, 327, 399, 322, 328, 325, 330, 326, and 331, were already 
decided. The Judge, however, failed to submit copies of his orders and decisions 
in the criminal cases. The OCA, in its 28 January 2000 memorandum, observed that 
Judge Plata's orders and decisions were issued only about four (4) months after 
the judicial audit was conducted. The OCA noted that Civil Cases No. 331, 330, 
322 and 327, while all dated 05 June 1998, were released for mailing only on 07 
August 1998 or almost two (2) months after they were decided.</p>
<p>The OCA recommended that -</p>

<p>The OCA did not suggest any administrative sanction against the late Judge 
Lamorena for "humanitarian reasons."</p>
<p>The Court agrees with the findings, and adopts the recommendations, of the 
OCA.</p>
<p>In A.M. No. 97-9-283-RTC (Report on the Judicial Audit Conducted in Regional 
Trial Court, Branch 1, Bangued, Abra, 31 May 2000), the Court deemed it 
inappropriate to impose sanction upon Judge Francisco O. Villarta who died 
during the pendency of the case against him. For like reasons, no administrative 
sanction would here be imposed on Judge Efren A. Lamorena.</p>
<p>In the resolution of the Court on 20 July 1999, the parties were required to 
manifest within ten (10) days from notice if they would be willing to submit the 
case for resolution on the basis of the reports on record. The parties having 
failed to comply with its directive, the Court resolved to dispense with their 
manifestation.</p>
<p>The Court agrees with the OCA that the lapses on the part of the judges can 
be traced to their failure in the proper observance of the following circulars 
of the Court; to wit:</p>
<p>(1) Administrative Circular No. 1, dated 28 January 1988, which states: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. <i>Effective Docket Control:</i> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.1 All presiding judges of trial courts must, <i>upon assumption of 
office,</i> and <i>every semester thereafter</i> on June 30th and December 31st 
of every year conduct a <i>physical inventory</i> of their dockets for the 
purpose of determining the actual number of cases pending in their salas.</p>
<p>1.2 An <i>inventory</i> shall be prepared to indicate the <i>cases pending 
trial,</i> the <i>cases submitted for decision</i> and the <i>cases that have 
been archived</i>. Copy of such inventory shall be submitted to the Supreme 
Court through the Court Administrator within thirty (30) days from receipt of 
this Circular and the Inventory Form. </p></blockquote>
<p>"1.3 The Presiding Judge and the Clerk of Court shall <i>initial</i> the 
Records or Rollos of each case <i>to indicate the date of actual inventory.</i> 
The inventory shall include a <i>list of cases submitted for decision,</i> 
indicating the <i>title and case number </i>and the <i>date of filing</i> of 
said case. An updated inventory is to be submitted to the Supreme Court every 
six (6) months thereafter as required in Paragraph 1.1. hereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The circular has been restated by the Court in Administrative Circular No. 
10-94 of 29 June 1994.</p>
<p>(2) Circular No. 13, dated 01 July 1987, reiterated in Administrative 
Circular No. 3-99, dated 15 January 1999, which mandates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To insure speedy disposition of cases, the following guidelines must be 
faithfully observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I. The session hours of all Regional Trial Courts, Metropolitan Trial Courts, 
Municipal Trial Courts in Cities, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit 
Trial Courts shall be from 8:30 A.M. to noon and from 2:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M., 
from Monday to Friday. The hours in the morning shall be devoted to the conduct 
of trial, while the hours in the afternoon shall be utilized for (1) the conduct 
of pre-trial conferences; (2) writing of decisions, resolutions, or orders; or 
(3) the continuation of trial on the merits, whenever rendered necessary, as may 
be required by the Rules of Court, statutes, or circulars in specified 
cases.</p>
<p>However, in multi-sala courts in places where there are few practicing 
lawyers, the schedule may be modified upon request of the Integrated Bar of the 
Philippines such that one-half of the branches may hold their trial in the 
morning and the other half in the afternoon. Except those requiring immediate 
action, all motions should be scheduled for hearing on Friday afternoons, or if 
Friday is a non-working day, in the afternoon of the next business day. The 
unauthorized practice of some judges of entertaining motions or setting them for 
hearing on any other day or time must be immediately stopped. </p>
<p>"II. Judges must be punctual at all times.</p>
<p>"III. The Clerk of Court, under the direct supervision of the Judge, must 
comply with Rule 20 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure regarding the calendar 
of cases.</p>
<p>"IV. There should be strict adherence to the policy on avoiding postponements 
and needless delay.</p>
<p>Sections 2, 3 and 4 of Rule 30, 1997 Rules on Civil Procedure on adjournments 
and postponements and on the requisites of a motion to postpone trial for 
absence of evidence or for illness of a party or counsel should be faithfully 
observed.</p>
<p>Lawyers, as officers of the court, are enjoined to cooperate with judges to 
ensure swift disposition of cases."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>The Court, here again, must stress that while it is not unaware of the heavy 
caseload of judges nor is it impervious to the plight of judges, it cannot, 
however, take too lightly Rule 3.05, of Canon 3, of the Code of Judicial Conduct 
requiring the disposition of the court business and of pending cases or 
incidents promptly and seasonably.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> 
All that a judge really needs to do, in case of great difficulty, would be to 
request for an extension of time over which the Court has, almost invariably, 
been sympathetic. </p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court RESOLVED, conformably with the recommendations of 
the OCA, that -</p>
<ol><li>Judge Fe Albano Madrid, RTC, Branch 21, Santiago City, be <b>REPRIMANDED</b>
