				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Louciano P. Armecin, Clerk III; Alfredo 
C. Galozo, Jr., Utility Worker II; and Reynato O. Cadavos, Utility 
Worker I, were charged with Simple Misconduct and censured in a Report 
dated July 27, 1998<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> by 
complainant Executive Judge Leandro T. Loyao, Jr. for leaving their 
posts at the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of
 Maasin, Southern Leyte, Branch 24 without permission. <p> The report 
was thereafter referred to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) 
which, after evaluation, recommended that: a.] the report of the 
complainant executive judge be treated as an administrative charge 
against the three respondents; b.] respondents be held guilty as 
charged; and c.] respondents be administratively censured for their 
misconduct with the stern warning that a repetition of the same or any 
similar act shall be dealt with more severely.</p><p> The Court 
subsequently issued a Resolution dated August 2, 1999: a.] requiring the
 respondents to manifest whether they are submitting the case for 
decision within ten days from notice; and b.] docketing the case as a 
regular administrative proceeding.</p><p> In compliance with the 
foregoing directive, respondents filed a Manifestation on August 20, 
1999 submitting the case for decision with prayer that the Court dismiss
 the charges against them.</p><p> The Report of complainant Executive 
Judge states that on July 23, 1998 at 3:00 p.m., respondents left the 
office for personal purposes without asking permission from their 
superior. Their absence allegedly left the entire office undermanned.</p><p>
 As a consequence, complainant Executive Judge issued Office Memorandum 
No. OEJ-0-01-98 dated July 23, 1998 directing all respondents to explain
 in writing within 72 hours from receipt why they should not be 
administratively dealt with for their unauthorized absence in the office
 and taking advantage of the leave of absence of Atty. Roman T. Galdo, 
Clerk of Court at the<em> Bulwagan ng Katarungan</em> of Maasin, 
Southern Leyte. </p><p> In compliance with Office Memorandum No. 
OEJ-0-01-98, respondents jointly explained that in the morning of July 
23, 1998, Sheriff Romulo G. Madredijo requested respondent Armecin to 
buy food at the public market for his birthday party. At past noon, 
Armecin proceeded to the public market to purchase fish and spices. 
After lunch, respondents reported for work and recorded their time of 
arrival at the office logbook.</p><p> Respondents further explained that
 they left their co-workers Romulo G. Madredijo and Lolita R. Edilo at 
the office and at around 3:00 p.m., they proceeded to Armecin’s house 
located near the Provincial Capitol grounds to prepare, out of <em>pakikisama</em>,
 the food they purchased earlier for Madredijo’s birthday. Shortly 
thereafter, respondents brought the prepared food to the <em>Bulwagan ng
 Katarungan</em> where the birthday party was to be held. </p><p> 
Stressing that <em>pakikisama</em> is a practice and tradition already 
existing in the office, respondents clarified that they did not take 
advantage of the leave of absence of the Clerk of Court and what they 
did was only a way of expressing their felicitation to the celebrant 
co-worker who was celebrating his 59th birthday. </p><p> Complainant 
Executive Judge found the explanation of respondents unsatisfactory and 
recommended the censure of the latter with the warning that a repetition
 of the same or any other similar act in the future shall be dealt with 
more severely. Complainant pointed out that respondents should have 
sought his permission inasmuch as their immediate superior, Atty. Galdo,
 was absent, adding that respondents need not leave the office during 
working hours to prepare the food for the party after office hours.</p><p>
 More importantly, complainant reported that on the same day, they were 
preparing the records of appealed cases to be reported to the Court 
Administrator. However, the three (3) respondents seemingly did not show
 any interest in finishing the said report but gave priority instead to a
 personal favor for the sake of <em>pakikisama</em>. </p><p> The Court 
finds that indeed respondents were remiss in their obligations as 
judicial employees when they went out during office hours without asking
 the permission of their superior. Their explanations that they went out
 to buy and prepare food for the birthday celebration of their 
officemate and that they did the same out of <em>pakikisama</em>&nbsp; is 
unsatisfactory and should not be countenanced. </p><p> While <em>pakikisama</em>
 is a value deeply embedded in our tradition and mores that often 
fosters harmony and good working relationships in the workplace, 
carrying out its observance and practice to the degree where it 
frustrates or prejudices the administration of justice should not be 
tolerated. </p><p> Since the administration of justice is a sacred task,
 the persons involved in it ought to live up to the strictest standard 
of honesty, integrity and uprightness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; It bears stressing once again that public service 
requires utmost integrity and the strictest discipline possible of every
 public servant. A public office is a public trust that enjoins all 
public officers and employees, particularly those serving in the 
judiciary, to respond with the highest degree of dedication often <em>even
 beyond personal interest</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 In this regard, it must be borne in mind that –&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> … 
the image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct 
and, official or otherwise, of the men and women, from the judge to the 
least and lowest of its personnel, hence, it becomes the imperative 
sacred duty of each and everyone in the court to maintain its good name 
and standing as a true temple of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p></blockquote><p> "The conduct and behavior of<em> 
every</em> person connected with an office charged with the dispensation
 of justice, from the presiding judge to the lowest clerk, is 
circumscribed with a heavy burden of responsibility. His conduct, at all
 times, must not only be characterized by propriety and decorum but 
also, and above all else, be above suspicion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> All too often, this Court has 
declared that any act which falls short of the exacting standards for 
public office, especially on the part of those expected to preserve the 
image of the judiciary, shall not be countenanced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> To reiterate, public office is a public 
trust. Public officers must at all times be accountable to the people, 
serve them with utmost degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and 
efficiency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Needless to 
state, respondents in their ill-advised alacrity to please a co-worker 
and a misplaced sense of <em>pakikisama</em>, ran afoul of such 
standards. Only recently in <em>Office of the Court Administrator v. 
Sheriff IV Julius G. Cabe, RTC, Branch 28, Catbalogan, Samar</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Court said –&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>
 Time and again, we have emphasized the heavy burden and responsibility 
which court personnel are saddled with in view of their exalted 
positions as keepers of public faith. They must be constantly reminded 
that any impression of impropriety, misdeed or negligence in the 
performance of official functions must be avoided. As we have held in 
the case of <em>Mendoza vs. Mabutas</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> this Court condemns and would never countenance such 
conduct, act or omission on the part of all those involved in the 
administration of justice which would violate the norm of public 
accountability and diminish or even just tend to diminish the faith of 
the people in the Judiciary.</p></blockquote><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>,
 respondents Louciano P. Armecin, Clerk III, Alfredo C. Galozo, Jr., 
Utility Worker II and Reynato O. Cadavos, Utility Worker I of the Office
 of the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Maasin, Leyte,
