				<H3>INTERNATIONAL EXPRESS TRAVEL & TOUR SERVICES, INC., PETITIONER, VS. HON. COURT OF APPEALS, HENRI KAHN, PHILIPPINE FOOTBALL FEDERATION, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>KAPUNAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On June 30 1989, petitioner International Express Travel and Tour Services, 
Inc., through its managing director, wrote a letter to the Philippine Football 
Federation (Federation), through its president private respondent Henri Kahn, 
wherein the former offered its services as a travel agency to the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The offer was accepted.</p>
<p>Petitioner secured the airline tickets for the trips of the athletes and 
officials of the Federation to the South East Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur as 
well as various other trips to the People's Republic of China and Brisbane. The 
total cost of the tickets amounted to P449,654.83. For the tickets received, the 
Federation made two partial payments, both in September of 1989, in the total 
amount of P176,467.50.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p>On 4 October 1989, petitioner wrote the Federation, through the private 
respondent a demand letter requesting for the amount of P265,894.33.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> On 30 October 1989, the Federation, 
through the Project Gintong Alay, paid the amount of P31,603.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<p>On 27 December 1989, Henri Kahn issued a personal check in the amount of 
P50,000 as partial payment for the outstanding balance of the Federation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Thereafter, no further payments were made 
despite repeated demands. </p>
<p>This prompted petitioner to file a civil case before the Regional Trial Court 
of Manila. Petitioner sued Henri Kahn in his personal capacity and as President 
of the Federation and impleaded the Federation as an alternative defendant. 
Petitioner sought to hold Henri Kahn liable for the unpaid balance for the 
tickets purchased by the Federation on the ground that Henri Kahn allegedly 
guaranteed the said obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p>Henri Kahn filed his answer with counterclaim. While not denying the 
allegation that the Federation owed the amount P207,524.20, representing the 
unpaid balance for the plane tickets, he averred that the petitioner has no 
cause of action against him either in his personal capacity or in his official 
capacity as president of the Federation. He maintained that he did not guarantee 
payment but merely acted as an agent of the Federation which has a separate and 
distinct juridical personality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p>
<p>On the other hand, the Federation failed to file its answer, hence, was 
declared in default by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
<p>In due course, the trial court rendered judgment and ruled in favor of the 
petitioner and declared Henri Kahn personally liable for the unpaid obligation 
of the Federation. In arriving at the said ruling, the trial court rationalized: 
</p>
<p>Defendant Henri Kahn would have been correct in his contentions had it been 
duly established that defendant Federation is a corporation. The trouble, 
however, is that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant Henri Kahn has adduced 
any evidence proving the corporate existence of the defendant Federation. In 
paragraph 2 of its complaint, plaintiff asserted that "Defendant Philippine 
Football Federation is a sports association xxx." </p>
<p>This has not been denied by defendant Henri Kahn in his Answer. Being the 
President of defendant Federation, its corporate existence is within the 
personal knowledge of defendant Henri Kahn. He could have easily denied 
specifically the assertion of the plaintiff that it is a mere sports 
association, if it were a domestic corporation. But he did not. </p>
<p align="center">x x x </p>
<p>A voluntary unincorporated association, like defendant Federation has no 
power to enter into, or to ratify, a contract. The contract entered into by its 
officers or agents on behalf of such association is not binding on, or 
enforceable against it. The officers or agents are themselves personally liable. 
</p>
<p align="center">x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p>
<p>The dispositive portion of the trial court's decision reads: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered ordering defendant Henri Kahn to pay the 
plaintiff the principal sum of P207,524.20, plus the interest thereon at the 
legal rate computed from July 5, 1990, the date the complaint was filed, until 
the principal obligation is fully liquidated; and another sum of P15,000.00 for 
attorney's fees.</p>
<p>The complaint of the plaintiff against the Philippine Football Federation and 
the counterclaims of the defendant Henri Kahn are hereby dismissed. </p>
<p>With the costs against defendant Henri Kahn.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>Only Henri Kahn elevated the above decision to the Court of Appeals. On 21 
December 1994, the respondent court rendered a decision reversing the trial 
court, the decretal portion of said decision reads: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the judgment appealed from is hereby REVERSED 
and SET ASIDE and another one is rendered dismissing the complaint against 
defendant Henri S. Kahn.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
</p></blockquote>
<p>In finding for Henri Kahn, the Court of Appeals recognized the juridical 
existence of the Federation. It rationalized that since petitioner failed to 
prove that Henri Kahn guaranteed the obligation of the Federation, he should not 
be held liable for the same as said entity has a separate and distinct 
personality from its officers. </p>
<p>Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration and as an alternative prayer 
pleaded that the Federation be held liable for the unpaid obligation. The same 
was denied by the appellate court in its resolution of 8 February 1995, where it 
stated that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As to the alternative prayer for the Modification of the Decision by 
expressly declaring in the dispositive portion thereof the Philippine Football 
Federation (PFF) as liable for the unpaid obligation, it should be remembered 
that the trial court dismissed the complaint against the Philippine Football 
Federation, and the plaintiff did not appeal from this decision. Hence, the 
Philippine Football Federation is not a party to this appeal and consequently, 
no judgment may be pronounced by this Court against the PFF without violating 
the due process clause, let alone the fact that the judgment dismissing the 
complaint against it, had already become final by virtue of the plaintiff's 
failure to appeal therefrom. The alternative prayer is therefore similarly 
DENIED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner now seeks recourse to this Court and alleges that the respondent 
court committed the following assigned errors:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT PETITIONER HAD DEALT 
WITH THE PHILIPPINE FOOTBALL FEDERATION (PFF) AS A CORPORATE ENTITY AND IN NOT 
HOLDING THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT HENRI KAHN WAS THE ONE WHO REPRESENTED THE PFF 
AS HAVING A CORPORATE PERSONALITY. </p>
<p>B. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT HOLDING PRIVATE RESPONDENT 
HENRI KAHN PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR THE OBLIGATION OF THE UNINCORPORATED PFF, 
HAVING NEGOTIATED WITH PETITIONER AND CONTRACTED THE OBLIGATION IN BEHALF OF THE 
PFF, MADE A PARTIAL PAYMENT AND ASSURED PETITIONER OF FULLY SETTLING THE 
OBLIGATION.</p>
<p>C. ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT KAHN IS NOT PERSONALLY LIABLE, 
THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT EXPRESSLY DECLARING IN ITS DECISION 
THAT THE PFF IS SOLELY LIABLE FOR THE OBLIGATION. </p></blockquote>
<p>The resolution of the case at bar hinges on the determination of the 
existence of the Philippine Football Federation as a juridical person. In the 
assailed decision, the appellate court recognized the existence of the 
Federation. In support of this, the CA cited Republic Act 3135, otherwise known 
as the Revised Charter of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation, and 
Presidential Decree No. 604 as the laws from which said Federation derives its 
existence. </p>
<p>As correctly observed by the appellate court, both R.A. 3135 and P.D. No. 604 
recognized the juridical existence of national sports associations. This may be 
gleaned from the powers and functions granted to these associations. Section 14 
of R.A. 3135 provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEC. 14. <i>Functions, powers and duties of Associations</i>. - The National 
Sports' Association shall have the following functions, powers and duties: 
</p></blockquote>
<ol><li>To adopt a constitution and by-laws for their internal organization and 
government; <br>
</li><li>To raise funds by donations, benefits, and other means for their purposes. 
<br>
</li><li>To purchase, sell, lease or otherwise encumber property both real and 
personal, for the accomplishment of their purpose;<br>
</li><li>To affiliate with international or regional sports' Associations after due 
consultation with the executive committee; </li></ol>
<p align="center">x x x </p>
<ol start="13"><li>To perform such other acts as may be necessary for the proper accomplishment 
of their purposes and not inconsistent with this Act. </li></ol>
<p>Section 8 of P.D. 604, grants similar functions to these sports associations: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEC. 8. <i>Functions, Powers, and Duties of National Sports Association</i>. 
- The National sports associations shall have the following functions, powers, 
and duties: </p></blockquote>
<ol><li>Adopt a Constitution and By-Laws for their internal organization and 
government which shall be submitted to the Department and any amendment thereto 
shall take effect upon approval by the Department: <i>Provided</i>, 
<i>however,</i> That no team, school, club, organization, or entity shall be 
admitted as a voting member of an association unless 60 per cent of the athletes 
composing said team, school, club, organization, or entity are Filipino 
citizens;<br>
</li><li>Raise funds by donations, benefits, and other means for their purpose 
subject to the approval of the Department;<br>
</li><li>Purchase, sell, lease, or otherwise encumber property, both real and 
personal, for the accomplishment of their purpose;<br>
</li><li>Conduct local, interport, and international competitions, other than the 
Olympic and Asian Games, for the promotion of their sport;<br>
</li><li>Affiliate with international or regional sports associations after due 
consultation with the Department; </li></ol>
<p align="center">x x x </p>
<ol start="13"><li>Perform such other functions as may be provided by law. </li></ol>
<p>The above powers and functions granted to national sports associations 
clearly indicate that these entities may acquire a juridical personality. The 
power to purchase, sell, lease and encumber property are acts which may only be 
done by persons, whether natural or artificial, with juridical capacity. 
However, while we agree with the appellate court that national sports 
associations may be accorded corporate status, such does not automatically take 
place by the mere passage of these laws. </p>
<p>It is a basic postulate that before a corporation may acquire juridical 
personality, the State must give its consent either in the form of a special law 
or a general enabling act. We cannot agree with the view of the appellate court 
and the private respondent that the Philippine Football Federation came into 
existence upon the passage of these laws. Nowhere can it be found in R.A. 3135 
or P.D. 604 any provision creating the Philippine Football Federation. These 
laws merely recognized the existence of national sports associations and 
provided the manner by which these entities may acquire juridical personality. 
Section 11 of R.A. 3135 provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEC. 11. <i>National Sports' Association; organization and recognition. </i>- 
A National Association shall be organized for each individual sports in the 
Philippines in the manner hereinafter provided to constitute the Philippine 
Amateur Athletic Federation. Applications for recognition as a National Sports' 
Association shall be filed with the executive committee together with, among 
others, a copy of the constitution and by-laws and a list of the members of the 
proposed association, and a filing fee of <em>ten pesos</em>. </p>
<p>The Executive Committee shall give the recognition applied for if it is 
satisfied that said association will promote the purposes of this Act and 
particularly section three thereof. No application shall be held pending for 
more than three months after the filing thereof without any action having been 
taken thereon by the executive committee. Should the application be rejected, 
the reasons for such rejection shall be clearly stated in a written 
communication to the applicant. Failure to specify the reasons for the rejection 
shall not affect the application which shall be considered as unacted upon: 
<i>Provided, however, </i>That until the executive committee herein provided 
shall have been formed, applications for recognition shall be passed upon by the 
duly elected members of the present executive committee of the Philippine 
Amateur Athletic Federation. The said executive committee shall be dissolved 
upon the organization of the executive committee herein provided<i>: Provided, 
further,</i> That the functioning executive committee is charged with the 
responsibility of seeing to it that the National Sports' Associations are formed 
and organized within six months from and after the passage of this Act. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Section 7 of P.D. 604, similarly provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEC. 7.<i> National Sports Associations.</i> - Application for accreditation 
or recognition as a national sports association for each individual sport in the 
Philippines shall be filed with the Department together with, among others, a 
copy of the Constitution and By-Laws and a list of the members of the proposed 
association. </p>
<p>The Department shall give the recognition applied for if it is satisfied that 
the national sports association to be organized will promote the objectives of 
this Decree and has substantially complied with the rules and regulations of the 
Department: <i>Provided,</i> That the Department may withdraw accreditation or 
recognition for violation of this Decree and such rules and regulations 
formulated by it. </p>
<p>The Department shall supervise the national sports association: <i>Provided, 
</i>That the latter shall have exclusive technical control over the development 
and promotion of the particular sport for which they are organized. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly the above cited provisions require that before an entity may be 
considered as a national sports association, such entity must be recognized by 
the accrediting organization, the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation under 
R.A. 3135, and the Department of Youth and Sports Development under P.D. 604. 
This fact of recognition, however, Henri Kahn failed to substantiate. In 
attempting to prove the juridical existence of the Federation, Henri Kahn 
attached to his motion for reconsideration before the trial court a copy of the 
constitution and by-laws of the Philippine Football Federation. Unfortunately, 
the same does not prove that said Federation has indeed been recognized and 
accredited by either the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation or the 
Department of Youth and Sports Development. Accordingly, we rule that the 
Philippine Football Federation is not a national sports association within the 
purview of the aforementioned laws and does not have corporate existence of its 
own. </p>
<p>Thus being said, it follows that private respondent Henry Kahn should be held 
liable for the unpaid obligations of the unincorporated Philippine Football 
Federation. It is a settled principal in corporation law that any person acting 
or purporting to act on behalf of a corporation which has no valid existence 
assumes such privileges and becomes personally liable for contract entered into 
or for other acts performed as such agent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> As president of the Federation, Henri 
Kahn is presumed to have known about the corporate existence or non-existence of 
the Federation. We cannot subscribe to the position taken by the appellate court 
that even assuming that the Federation was defectively incorporated, the 
petitioner cannot deny the corporate existence of the Federation because it had 
contracted and dealt with the Federation in such a manner as to recognize and in 
effect admit its existence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The 
doctrine of corporation by estoppel is mistakenly applied by the respondent 
court to the petitioner. The application of the doctrine applies to a third 
party only when he tries to escape liability on a contract from which he has 
benefited on the irrelevant ground of defective incorporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In the case at bar, the petitioner is not 
trying to escape liability from the contract but rather is the one claiming from 
the contract. </p>
