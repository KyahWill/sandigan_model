				<BR><STRONG>KAPUNAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for review on certiorari before us seeks the 
reversal of the Court of Appeals’ Resolutions dated 29 September 1995 
and 7 June 1996, which respectively denied petitioner’s petition for 
relief from judgment under Rule 38 of the Revised Rules of Court and the
 motion for reconsideration filed therein for lack of merit.
<p>The antecedents leading to the present controversy are as follows:
</p><p>On 24 August 1992, petitioner was charged with Qualified Illegal 
Possession of Firearm and Illegal Possession of Firearm before the 
Regional Trial Court of Manila (Branch XLI) under the following 
informations:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">INFORMATION
  </p>
  <p>The undersigned accuses MARIO BASCO y SALAO of the crime of Qualified Illegal Possession of Firearm, committed as follows:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That on or about May 3, 1992, in the City of Manila, Philippines,
 the said accused, not being allowed or authorized by law to keep, 
possess and carry a firearm, did then and there willfully, unlawfully 
and knowingly have in his possession, control and custody a firearm, to

    <p>one (1) cal. .38 revolver, Squire Bingham bearing Serial No. 
183110 loaded with one (1) live ammunition and five (5) spent shells
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>without first obtaining the necessary license and/or permit to 
carry and possess the same and in connection and by reason of such 
possession, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, 
with intent to kill, fire and shoot one Rolando Buenaventura y Manuel, 
thus inflicting upon the latter mortal gunshot wounds and injuries which
 caused the death of the latter as a consequence.
  </p>

  </blockquote>
<p>On 9 September 1992, upon arraignment, petitioner pleaded not guilty and the trial on the merits ensued.
</p><p>On 15 March 1993, the trial court rendered its decision finding petitioner guilty as charged and sentenced him as follows:
</p><blockquote>
<p>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:
</p><ol><li>In Criminal Case No. 92-109511, finding the accused MARIO BASCO y

  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioner received a copy of the trial court’s decision on 22 March 
1993. Thereafter, on 6 April 1993, petitioner’s counsel filed a Motion 
for Reconsideration of the said decision. However, in the notice of 
hearing, petitioner’s counsel failed to indicate the date and time of 
the motion’s hearing as explicitly required by Sections 4 and 5, Rule 15
 of the Rules of Court.
</p><p>When petitioner’s counsel realized his error, he submitted a Notification and Manifestation on 14 April 1993, which reads, thus:
</p><blockquote>

Reconsideration dated 5 April 1993. However, due to inadvertence brought
 about by the need to rush the finalization of this motion, which has 
been delayed by the spate of prolonged power outages, this setting was 
omitted. </p>
  <p>Accused therefore serves notice that he is submitting the Motion 
for Reconsideration dated 5 April 1993 for this Court’s consideration

  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 28 April 1993, the trial court issued the following order:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">O R D E R
  </p>
  <p>The record shows that the judgment in this case was promulgated 
last March 22, 1993. In other words, accused had up to April 6, 1993 
within which to perfect an appeal.
  </p>
  <p>Last April 5, 1993, the accused through a new counsel filed a 
Motion for Reconsideration without the notice required under Secs. 4 and
 5 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court.
  </p>
  <p>Considering that a motion that does not contain a notice of hearing
 is but a mere scrap of paper, it presents no question which merits the 
attention and consideration of the Court, it is not even a motion for it
 does not comply with the rules and hence the Clerk has no right to 
receive it; the Court did not act on the motion.
  </p>
  <p>Last April 14, 1993, accused through counsel filed with the Court a
 Notification and Manifestation whereby it prayed that the Motion for 
Reconsideration be set for hearing today. Considering that the motion 
above adverted did not suspend the running of the period to appeal; that
 the judgment in this case has become final and executory, the Motion 
for Reconsideration and the Notification and Manifestation filed by the 
accused are hereby denied.
  </p>
  <p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In response thereto, petitioner on 4 May 1993 filed a petition for 
relief from judgment with the Regional Trial Court pursuant to Rule 38 
of the Rules of Court. He contended that his inadvertence was due to the
 perennial brownouts being experienced across the country during that 
time and should, thus, be considered as a mistake or excusable 
negligence. Technical rules of procedure, he further asserted, should 
not be applied strictly when to do so would result in manifest 
injustice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
</p><p>On 12 July 1993, the trial court issued an order denying the 
petition for relief for lack of merit. Said order is hereunder 
reproduced in part:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">x x x
  </p>
  <p>As can be readily seen, accused had up to April 6, 1993 within which to file his Motion for Reconsideration or Appeal.
  </p>
  <p>While it is true that judgments or orders may be set aside due to 
fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence (Sec. 2, Rule 38), "a 
motion which does not meet the requirements of Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 
15 of the Revised Rules of Court is a worthless piece of paper which the
 clerks have no right to receive and the respondent court a quo has no 
authority to act upon." (Lucila B. Vda. de Azarias, petitioner, vs. The 
Honorable Manolo L. Madela, et al., 38 SCRA 35.) </p>
  <p>The failure or defect in the notice of hearing in said motion 
cannot be cured by subsequent action of the court, for as held in 
Andrada, et al. vs. The Honorable Court of Appeals, et al., 60 SCRA 379,
 the Supreme Court said:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"This Court has repeatedly made it clear not only that a notice 
addressed to the Clerk of Court requesting him to ‘set the foregoing 
motion for the consideration and approval of this Honorable Court 
immediately upon receipt hereof’ does not comply with the requirements 
of Section 5 of Rule 15 but also that subsequent action of the court 
thereon does not cure the flaw, for a motion with a notice fatally 
defective is a ‘useless piece of paper.’"
      </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The notice of hearing in the motion for reconsideration addressed 
to the Branch Clerk of Court states: "Please submit the foregoing Motion
 to the Honorable Court for its consideration and approval immediately 
upon receipt hereof." The same is patently a defective and fatal notice.
 </p>
  <p>The subsequent filing of the Notification and Manifestation that 
said Motion would be submitted for consideration and approval on Friday,
 23 April 1993 at 8:30 o’clock in the morning did not cure the defect in
 the notice of hearing in the motion. As already stated, the last day 
for accused to file an appeal was April 6, 1993. As of April 7, 1993, 
the period to file an appeal already lapsed so that, curing the 
defective notice of hearing on April 14, 1993, granting that the 
subsequent notification cured the defect, was no longer possible. </p>
  <p>WHEREFORE, premises considered, finding the Petition for Relief 
from Order of 28 April 1993 to be without merit, the same is hereby 
DENIED and let accused be committed to the Director of Prisons, 
Muntinlupa, Metro-Manila.
  </p>
  <p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioner appealed the aforequoted order to the Court of Appeals on 
30 July 1993. On 29 September 1995, the Court of Appeals dismissed 
petitioner’s appeal on the ground of lack of jurisdiction through the 
following resolution:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">RESOLUTION
  </p>
  <p>This "Appeal on Certiorari" purporting to be an appeal of a special
 action is actually an appeal from the March 15, 1993 decision of Branch
 41 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila convicting accused-appellant, 
Mario Basco, in Criminal Cases Nos. 92-109511 and 92-109512, for 
Qualified Illegal Possession of Firearms and Violation of Section 261 
(9) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 in relation to Section 31, and for 
violation of Republic Act 7166, respectively. </p>
  <p>A perusal of the records of the case discloses that no special 
civil action was filed with the court a quo that may be made the subject
 of this appeal. The only incidents submitted to it for resolution were 
the Motion for Reconsideration of the March 15, 1993 decision and 
Petition for Relief from Order which were both denied.
  </p>
  <p>Since accused appellant was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
 the crimes charged and was sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion
 perpetua in Criminal Case No. 92-109511, and imprisonment of One (1) 
Year to Three (3) Years in Criminal Case No. 92-109512, his appeal falls
 under the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court 
(Article VIII, Section 5, par. 2[d], Constitution).
  </p>
  <p>We are thus constrained to dismiss this appeal on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.
  </p>
  <p>We cannot certify the appeal to the High Tribunal as it is not a 
case contemplated by Section 13 of Rule 124 of the Revised Rules of 
Court and to do so, would contravene the guidelines set forth in Supreme
 Court Circular No. 2-90.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(d)....No transfer of appeals erroneously taken – <u>No transfers
 of appeals taken to the Supreme Court or to the Court of Appeals to 
whichever of these Tribunals has appropriate appellate jurisdiction will
 be allowed</u>, continued ignorance of willful disregard of the law on 
appeals will not be tolerated. (Paragraph [d], Sub-Head 4 of Circular 
No. 2-90), </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>which circular is based from the High Tribunal’s March 1, 1990 
minute resolution in the case of Anacleto Murillo v. Rodolfo Consul, 
(UDK-9748, 183 SCRA xi, xvii, xviii) where it emphatically declared 
that: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is no longer any justification for allowing transfers of 
erroneous appeals from one court to another, much less for tolerating 
continued ignorance of the law on appeals. It thus behooves every 
attorney seeking review and reversal of a judgment or order promulgated 
against his client, to determine clearly the errors he believes may be 
ascribed to the judgment or order, whether of fact or of law, then to 
ascertain which court properly has appellate jurisdiction; and finally, 
to observe scrupulously the requisites for appeal prescribed by law, 
with keen awareness that any error or imprecision in compliance 
therewith may well be fatal to his client’s cause. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>WHEREFORE, the appeal is hereby DISMISSED.
  </p>
  <p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration was, likewise, denied by the 
Court of Appeals in its resolution dated 7 June 1996. The Court of 
Appeals ruled, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">x x x
  </p>
  <p>Accused-appellant moors his motion upon the ground that his appeal 
was not from the judgment of conviction but rather from the court <u>a quo</u>’s order denying his petition for relief from judgment. </p>
  <p>We find this argument to be untenable. A Petition for Relief from Judgment is an extraordinary remedy.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Relief from judgment or order is premised on equity and it is 
granted only in exceptional circumstances, as when a judgment or order 
is entered, or any other proceeding is taken through fraud, accident, 
mistake or excusable negligence. <em>(Director of Lands v. Rommaban, 131 SCRA 431, 437 [1984])</em>.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Appellant has cited us to no ground to enable him to avail of this 
remedy. What is evident is that accused-appellant resorted to this 
remedy only to retrieve his lost appeal.
  </p>
  <p>WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.
  </p>
  <p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, this petition for review on certiorari.
</p><p>Petitioner raises three issues for the Court’s resolution:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>A. &nbsp;&nbsp;WHETHER OR NOT THE PROSECUTION HAS PROVED THE GUILT OF THE PETITIONER BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT. </p>
  <p>B. &nbsp;&nbsp;WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS CORRECTLY RULED THAT 
PETITIONER’S APPEAL FROM THE DENIAL OF HIS PETITION FOR RELIEF SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN LODGED WITH THIS HONORABLE COURT. </p>
  <p>C. &nbsp;&nbsp;WHETHER OR NOT THE PETITIONER HAS SUCCEEDED IN SHOWING HIS ENTITLEMENT TO RELIEF.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The core issue in this case is whether or not petitioner’s plea for 
annulment of judgment under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court is 
meritorious.
</p><p>At the outset, it bears stressing that the instant controversy 
does not concern an appeal from the judgment of conviction itself. The 
Court of Appeals evidently erred in dismissing petitioner’s appeal on 
the ground of lack of jurisdiction. It ruled that since petitioner was 
meted the sentence of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, his appeal falls 
under the Supreme Court’s exclusive appellate jurisdiction in accordance
 with Article VIII, Section 5 (2)[d] of the 1987 Constitution of the 
Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
</p><p>The case brought to the Court of Appeals involved an appeal from 
the trial court’s denial of petitioner’s petition for relief from 
judgment. When the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on 29 September
 1995, the applicable provision was Section 2, Rule 41 of the Rules of 
Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> governing appeals from the Regional Trial Courts to the Court of Appeals. Said provision specifically stated that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Sec. 2. <em>Judgments or orders subject to appeal</em>.—xxx </p>
  <p>A judgment denying relief under Rule 38 is subject to appeal, and 
in the course thereof, a party may also assail the judgment on the 
merits, upon the ground that it is not supported by the evidence or it 
is contrary to law.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>Service Specialists, Inc. v. Sheriff of Manila</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 the Court confirmed that "a judgment or order denying relief under Rule
 38 is final and appealable, unlike an order granting such relief which 
is interlocutory." Hence, jurisdiction then properly belonged to the 
Court of Appeals.
</p><p>The issue of jurisdiction aside, the Court has emphasized that 
petition for relief from judgment is a unique remedy in the sense that 
it is based on the principle of equity and constitutes the petitioner’s 
final chance to prosecute or defend his cause. Being an act of grace, a 
petition for relief from judgment is usually not regarded with favor and
 thus, is allowed only in exceptional cases where there are no other 
adequate and available remedies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>The Court, in <em>Samoso v. CA</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> further elucidates:
  </p>
  <p>Relief from judgment under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court is a 
remedy provided by law to any person against whom a decision or order is
 entered into through fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence. 
It is of equitable character, allowed only in exceptional cases as when 
there is no other available or adequate remedy. When a party has another
 adequate remedy available to him, which was either a motion for new 
trial or appeal from adverse decisions of the lower court, and he was 
not prevented by fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence from 
filing such motion or taking the appeal he cannot avail himself of the 
relief provided in Rule 38 (Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. 
Lood, 110 SCRA 205 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1981]</sup>; Ibabao v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 150 SCRA 76 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1987]</sup>).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioner, however, implores the Court to be liberal in the 
application of technical rules of procedure (which in this instance 
refer to the requisites of a proper notice of hearing) and cites a 
plethora of cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> in 
support thereof. He reasons out that the defective notice of hearing in 
his motion for reconsideration was due to the day-long brown-outs that 
plagued the metropolis and which caused his counsel to have the above 
pleading prepared outside the law office. In view of this peculiar 
circumstance, he submits that his counsel’s failure to specify the date 
and time for the hearing of his motion for reconsideration should 
rightly be deemed excusable negligence.
</p><p>Petitioner claims that whatever defect there was in his motion 
was cured by the notification and manifestation which he filed even 
before the trial court issued its order denying the motion for 
reconsideration for being a mere scrap of paper.
</p><p>Finally, petitioner points that his conviction carries a prison 
term for life which, standing alone, is a circumstance exceptional 
enough to allow him opportunity to challenge the judgment of conviction 
against him for reasons of equity and substantial justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
</p><p>We are acutely aware of the judicial mandate that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Rules of court prescribing the time within which certain acts must 
be done, or certain proceedings taken, are absolutely indispensable to 
the prevention of needless delays and the orderly and speedy discharge 
of judicial business. Strict compliance with such rules is mandatory and
 imperative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>With respect to notices of hearing of motions, this has been more 
often than not the Court’s guiding principle. We have time and again 
given warning that a notice of hearing which does not comply with the 
requirements of Sections 4, 5 and 6, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 is a worthless piece of paper and would not merit any consideration 
from the courts. Recently, this rule was reiterated and upheld in <em>People of the Philippines vs. CA, et al</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Under Section 4 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court, the applicable 
law during the pendency of the case before the trial court, every 
written motion must be set for hearing by the applicant and served 
together with the notice of hearing thereof, in such a manner as to 
ensure receipt by the other party at least three days before the date of
 hearing, unless the court, for good cause, sets the hearing on shorter 
notice. Under Sections 5 and 6 thereof, the notice of hearing shall be 
addressed to the parties concerned and shall specify the time and date 
of the hearing of the motion; no motion shall be acted upon by the court
 without proof of service of the notice thereof, except when the court 
is satisfied that the rights of the adverse party are not affected.
  </p>
  <p>A motion without a notice of hearing is pro forma, a mere scrap of 
paper that does not toll the period to appeal, and upon expiration of 
the 15-day period, the questioned order or decision becomes final and 
executory. The rationale behind this rule is plain: unless the movant 
sets the time and place of hearing, the court will be unable to 
determine whether the adverse party agrees or objects to the motion, and
 if he objects, to hear him on his objection, since the rules themselves
 do not fix any period within which he may file his reply or opposition.
  </p>
  <p>A supplemental pleading subsequently filed to remedy the previous 
absence of notice will not cure the defect nor interrupt the tolling of 
the prescribed period within which to appeal. In <em>Cledera v. Sarmiento</em>, citing <em>Manila Surety v. Bath</em>, this Court ruled:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We are not impressed by the argument that the supplement filed by
 the appellants on May 30 should be deemed retroactive as of the date 
the motion for reconsideration was filed and, therefore, cured the 
defect therein. To so consider it would be to put a premium on 
negligence and subject the finality of judgments to the forgetfulness or
 whims of parties-litigants and their lawyers. This of course would be 
intolerable in a well-ordered judicial sytsem. 
    </p>
    <p>[A]ppellants were or should have been alerted to the fact that 
their motion for reconsideration of May 12 did not interrupt the period 
for appeal when they received the court’s order of May 21, 1959, wherein
 it was stated that what appellants had filed was not even a motion and 
presented no question which the court could decide. </p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, procedural rules were conceived to aid the attainment of
 justice. If a stringent application of the rules would hinder rather 
than serve the demands of substantial justice, the former must yield to 
the latter. Recognizing this, Section 2, Rule 1 of the Rules of Court 
specifically provides that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Sec. 2. Construction. — These rules shall be <u>liberally construed</u>
 in order to promote their object and to assist the parties in obtaining
 just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and 
proceeding. (Underscoring ours.)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The liberal construction of the rules on notice of hearing is exemplified in <em>Goldloop Properties, Inc. v. CA</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Admittedly, the filing of respondent-spouses’ motion for 
reconsideration did not stop the running of the period of appeal because
 of the absence of a notice of hearing required in Secs. 3, 4 and 5, 
Rule 15, of the Rules of Court. As we have repeatedly held, a motion 
that does not contain a notice of hearing is a mere scrap of paper; it 
presents no question which merits the attention of the court. Being a 
mere scrap of paper, the trial court had no alternative but to disregard
 it. Such being the case, it was as if no motion for reconsideration was
 filed and, therefore, the reglementary period within which 
respondent-spouses should have filed an appeal expired on 23 November 
1989. </p>
  <p>But, where a rigid application of that rule will result in a 
manifest failure or miscarriage of justice, then the rule may be 
relaxed, especially if a party successfully shows that the alleged 
defect in the questioned final and executory judgment is not apparent on
 its face or from the recitals contained therein. Technicalities may 
thus be disregarded in order to resolve the case. After all, no party 
can even claim a vested right in technicalities. Litigations should, as 
much as possible, be decided on the merits and not on technicalities.
  </p>
  <p>Hence, this Court should not easily allow a party to lose title and
 ownership over a party worth P4,000,000.00 for a measly P650,000.00 
without affording him ample opportunity to prove his claim that the 
transaction entered into was not in fact an absolute sale but one of 
mortgage. Such grave injustice must not be permitted to prevail on the 
anvil of technicalities.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, in Samoso v. CA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the Court ruled:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>But time and again, the Court has stressed that the rules of 
procedure are not to be applied in a very strict and technical sense. 
The rules of procedure are used only to help secure not override 
substantial justice (National Waterworks &amp; Sewerage System vs. 
Municipality of Libmanan, 97 SCRA 138 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1980]</sup>; Gregorio v. Court of Appeals, 72 SCRA 120 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1976]</sup>).
 The right to appeal should not be lightly disregarded by a stringent 
application of rules of procedure especially where the appeal is on its 
face meritorious and the interests of substantial justice would be 
served by permitting the appeal (Siguenza v. Court of Appeals, 137 SCRA 
570 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1985]</sup>; Pacific Asia 
Overseas Shipping Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission, et
 al., G.R. No. 76595, May 6, 1998). x x x.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the instant case, it is petitioner’s life and liberty that is at 
stake. The trial court has sentenced him to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>
 and his conviction attained finality on the basis of mere technicality.
 It is but just, therefore, that petitioner be given the opportunity to 
defend himself and pursue his appeal. To do otherwise would be 
tantamount to grave injustice. A relaxation of the procedural rules, 
considering the particular circumstances herein, is justified.
</p><p>Considering that there is sufficient evidence before the Court to
 enable it to resolve the fundamental issues, we will dispense with the 
regular procedure of remanding the case to the lower court, in order to 
avoid further delays in the resolution of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, the petition is 
given DUE COURSE. The 12 July 1993 Order of the trial court denying the 
petition for relief from judgment and the Court of Appeals’ Resolution 
dated 29 September 1995 and 7 June 1996 dismissing petitioner’s appeal 
from said 12 July 1993 Order are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. 
Petitioner and the Solicitor General are required to file with this 
Court their respective briefs in support of their positions within the 
period prescribed in the rules.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.

consent, confession or compromise on the ground of fraud, mistake or

third-party complaints, while the main case is pending, unless the court
 allows an appeal therefrom; and
