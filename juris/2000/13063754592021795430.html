On motion of the prosecution and without opposition on the part of the accused, the three (3) cases were then jointly heard.<br><br>On 13 October 1997, the trial court rendered its decision convicting the accused; the court adjudged:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing findings that the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused Rodolfo Villaraza y Panis of the crime of rape in Crim.

With costs de officio.<br><br>"SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </blockquote> In its <i>ponencia</i>, the court summed up the evidence that led it to the judgment of conviction; thus:<br><blockquote>"The evidence adduced by the prosecution in these three (3) cases consisted of the testimonies of Wenifreda Garcia, Jennifer Garcia, and Dr. Ana Dominica M. Perol. Wenifreda Garcia testified that she is married to Benjamin Garcia with whom she has three (3) children, namely: Jerry, Jennifer, and Jennilyn. She and her husband separated sometime in 1990. In 1993, she lived with the accused with whom she has a child by the name of Rowena. In 1994, Wenifreda Garcia left the accused. In 1995, she and the accused lived together again with her children in Bell, Magarao, Camarines Sur. They separated again but on January 1, 1997, the accused was able to find her in Magarao, Camarines Sur. On January 2, 1997, her daughter Jennifer was brought to her by her half-brother from Pio Duran where she was studying. From January 1, 1997, she started living x x x again with the accused who promised her that he would change for the better. On January 15, 1997, she and her children, together with the accused, transferred to a house in the middle of the rice field at Magarao, Camarines Sur.<br><br>"On February 21, 1997, Wenifreda Garcia noticed that her daughter Jennifer, herein complainant, was weak. She asked Jennifer why she was weak, but Jennifer did not tell her anything. In the afternoon of March 1, 1997, she and her daughter Jennifer went together to catch snails, and during that time, she noticed the unusual behavior of Jennifer. She told Jennifer not to go with the accused and after telling her Jennifer stared at her and cried. When she asked her daughter what happened, Jennifer told her that she was raped by the accused. Jennifer told her mother that the accuse pulled down her panty and then he inserted his penis inside her private part, causing it to bleed and causing her pain also.<br><br>"Jennifer confided to her mother that she was raped by the accused on February 21, 1997, February 26, 1997, and on March 1, 1997. The first two times that she was raped happened at the place where there are banana plants and the third time was right in their house in the middle of the rice land. Upon being informed by Jennifer of what happened to her, she told her daughter to just keep quiet as they will do something to place the accused in jail. After learning of what happened to her daughter she sought the help of a municipal kagawad of Magarao and she had Jennifer be examined by the Municipal Health Officer of Magarao, Camarines Sur as shown by the Medical Certificate issued by Dr. Ana Dominica Perol, Municipal Health Officer of Magarao, Camarines Sur.<br><br>"Jennifer Garcia testified that the accused whom she calls 'uncle' was living with her family in their house at Bell, Magarao, Camarines Sur. On February 21, 1997, in the afternoon, she and the accused went to a place at a distance of about thirty (30) meters from their house near an irrigation canal where there were banana plants. They went there because according to the accused they would get banana blossoms. When they reached the place where there were many banana plants near the irrigation canal, the accused who was holding a bolo made Jennifer Garcia lie down. After lying down on her back, the accused removed her panty and then removed his clothes also. After removing his clothes, the accused placed himself on top of her while she was lying down on her back and then he inserted his penis into her private part, causing it to bleed and also causing her pain. Afterwards, the accused told Jennifer Garcia that she should not report to her mother of what happened, otherwise he would kill them.<br><br>"Jennifer Garcia declared that on February 26, 1997, she went with the accused again in the same place where she was raped on February 21, 1997, near the irrigation canal where there are banana plants. When they reached the place, the accused made her lie down and he removed her clothes. After removing her clothes, he removed also his clothes and then he inserted his penis into her private part. She knew that his penis entered her private part because of the pain which made her cry and that her private part also bled. Afterwards, the accused told her again not to report to her mother what happened, or else he would kill them.<br><br>"Jennifer Garcia further testified that on March 1, 1997, while she and the accused were in their house, he told her to let her sister go to sleep. After she was able to let her sister go to sleep, the accused made her lie down and then he removed her clothes. After removing her panty, he also removed her clothes and then he inserted his penis into her private part. And because of the pain, she cried. Afterwards, the accused reminded her again not to tell her mother, who was then in Calabanga, Camarines Sur, of what happened and he repeated his threat that he would kill them if she would report to her mother.<br><br>"Dr. Ana Dominica M. Perol, the Rural Health Physician of Magarao, Camarines Sur, testified that she physically examined Jennifer Garcia and that in connection with the same, she issued a medical certificate dated March 10, 1997 (Exhs. B and B-1). Dr. Perol declared that during her examination she found that there were hymenal lacerations which were already healed at 10:00 o'clock, 1:00 o'clock, and 3:00 o'clock positions. These lacerations could have been caused by penetration of the male organ, cycling, horse riding, and other factors. Her second finding was that there was no difficulty in inserting her finger into the private part of the complainant. This shows that there is already laxity of the hymen, and this could have been caused also by the penetration of the sex organ by biking, cycling, and other factors. She declared that when she examined the complainant, she did not find any vaginal smear for spermatozoa. Dr. Perol testified that the laceration which is found in the vagina of the complainant could have happened may be more than one (1) year, or more than one (1) month, or maybe even ten (10) days before she examined her on March 10, 1997. With respect also to the finding that when vaginal smear was taken and examined, there was no spermatozoa, she declared that the life span of spermatozoa may last from two (2) to three (3) days, but there is no definite medical finding that she knows of with regard to the actual life span of spermatozoa.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </blockquote>In his plea before this Court, accused-appellant bewails the credibility of complainant, contending that her account of the three incidents of sexual assault is so identical that it can only lead one to question its veracity.<br><br>The Court has gone over the testimony of young Jennifer, and it finds itself equally convinced, like the court below, that not only did Jennifer testify straightforwardly and candidly on how she has been ravished by accused-appellant repeatedly but that, also, her narration of the incidents accords with human experience and the normal course of events of this nature.<br><br>Quoted below is her testimony before the trial court:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">"PROS.

Nor can her silence be construed as being a manifestation of false accusation. Minor lapses in the memory of a rape victim can be expected even as it is an understandable human frailty not to be able to recount with facility all the details of a dreadful and harrowing experience.<br><br>The accused submits that the deportment of private complainant after the alleged sexual assaults is incongruent with the demeanor of one who has been supposedly molested. Nobody can exactly tell how a victim of sexual transgression is supposed to act or behave after her ordeal. Here, again, the Court has recognized the fact that different people act differently to a given type of situation, for there hardly can be cited any known standard form of behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange or startling experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In a strained effort to seek an acquittal, accused-appellant would posit that the rape charge leveled against him has been triggered by the disagreement that eventuated between him and Wenifreda whom he earlier ordered to stop working as a laundry woman and to instead devote her time to taking take care of the children. Wenifreda allegedly has shrugged off this idea, earning her bitterness in the process. This excuse is simply too frail to bear out resentment and ill will. Even when consumed with hatred and revenge, it takes nothing less than psychological depravity for a mother to concoct a story too damaging to the welfare and well-being of her own daughter.<br><br>Accused-appellant contends that the medico-legal findings conducted upon the private complainant negate the sexual invasion that allegedly occurred on 01 March 1997. Citing Dr. Perol's testimony, he claims that the laceration could not have healed in less than ten (10) days. Accused-appellant forgets that twice before, in February of 1997, the victim has been subjected to his lust. It is the medical examination on 09 March 1997, relating to the last sexual assault, that has revealed healed lacerations. At all events, the absence of fresh lacerations does not work against the case for the prosecution;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; indeed, the physical examination of the victim is not indispensable in rape cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; While Dr. Perol has confirmed the absence of spermatozoa in the complainant's vaginal canal, this fact, however, does not necessarily imply that complainant has not actually been subjected to rape; rape is consummated, not by the ejection of spermatozoa in the female organ,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; but by the physical act of intercourse.<br><br>In his defense, accused-appellant, interposing <i>alibi</i> in all three (3) instances of rape, claimed that, on 21 February 1997, he was in their house in Bell, Magarao, and had not been at any time that day to the irrigation canal; that on 26 February 1997, he was cleaning the rice fields, approximately 90 feet from the irrigation canal; and that on 01 March 1997, he was busy preparing the rice seedlings to be planted in the farm of one Sesenando Cabael in San Felipe, Naga City. In order to successfully establish an <i>alibi</i>, however, it should be satisfactorily shown that the accused was at some other place during the commission of the crime and that it was physically impossible for him to have been then at the site thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; It would not be enough to prove that the accused was elsewhere when the crime was committed; it should likewise be proven that it would have been physically impossible for him to be at the <i>locus criminis</i> or its immediate vicinity when the crime was perpetrated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; In this, accused-appellant had miserably failed.<br><br><i>Alibi</i> is almost always flawed not only by its inherent weakness but also by its implausibility. Easily susceptible of concoction and viewed invariably with suspicion, an <i>alibi</i> may be considered with favor only when established by positive, clear, and satisfactory evidence. Significantly, where no one corroborates the <i>alibi</i> of an accused, such defense becomes all the weaker for this deficiency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; Neither can plain denial, a negative and self-serving evidence, stand against the positive identification and categorical testimony made by a victim of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; A mere denial is seldom given greater evidentiary value than the testimony of a witness who creditably testifies on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The Court, all told, finds no cogent reasons to ignore the findings of the trial court which has accorded to the complainant full faith and confidence in her testimony.<br><br>The supreme penalty of death, nevertheless, cannot be imposed upon the accused. The imposition of the death penalty becomes mandatory when the victim of rape is "under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; In order to warrant the imposition of that capital punishment, the victim's minority and her relationship to the offender, being considered special qualifying circumstances, should be both alleged and proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; While in all three (3) Informations, Jennifer has been specifically stated to be an eleven-year old minor when sexually abused, her relationship with accused-appellant Rodolfo Villaraza, has not been properly averred. Accused-appellant is not the stepfather of the complainant. The records indicate that her mother, Wenifreda, and accused-appellant have just been "live-in partners," the latter being, in fact, lawfully married to Benjamin Garcia, the complainant's father. Benjamin Garcia and Wenifreda Garcia have parted ways in 1990. A stepfather-stepdaughter relationship presupposes a legitimate relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; A stepdaughter is a daughter of one's spouse by a previous marriage or the daughter of one of the spouses by a former marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; The failure to accurately allege the relationship between appellant and his victim in the information bars his conviction of rape in its qualified form.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; The accused, having been consistently referred to as the stepfather of the complainant in each information, is thus auspiciously spared from the supreme punishment by this technical flaw.<br><br>Consistent with present case law which treats the imposition of civil indemnity as being mandatory upon the finding of rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; accused should likewise be ordered to pay the amount of P50,000.00 by way of civil indemnity for each count of rape or a total of P150,000.00. This civil indemnity is distinct from, and awarded in addition to, moral damages, the two being based on different jural foundations and assessed by the court in the exercise of sound discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the Court AFFIRMS with modification the appealed decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 28, of Naga City in Criminal Case No. 97-6670, No. 97-6671 and No. 97-6672 by finding accused-appellant Rodolfo Villaraza y Panis guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the three counts of rape and sentencing him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> on each count, with all the accessory penalties of the law, and to pay the victim Jennifer Garcia the amounts of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P150,000.00) as civil indemnity and One Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P150,000.00) as moral damages.
