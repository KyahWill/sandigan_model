				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Josefino Leodones and Norma Luciano were indicted for violation of Section 8, Article II, of Republic Act No. 6425 under an Information that read:<br><br><blockquote>"That on January 23, 1996 in the City of Kalookan, Metro Manila Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this honorable Court, the above-named accused after conspiring and confederating with each other did then and there willfully, feloniously, and unlawfully, have in their possession, custody and control: (a) two (2) heat sealed transparent plastic bag containing cocaine, with a total weight of 287.04 grams, (b) three (3) sticks of marijuana with a total weight of 1.02 grams and (c) one (1) heat sealed transparent plastic bag containing marijuana with a weight of 1.01 grams, all of which are prohibited drugs, without any permit, license, prescription or authority as required by law.<br><br>"Contrary to Law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote><br>The two accused entered a plea of "not guilty" to the accusation when arraigned.<br><br>Culled from the decision of the trial court were the conflicting versions given by the prosecution and the defense about the case.<br><br>According to the prosecution, on 17 January 1996, SPO Neowillie De Castro of the Special Operations Unit, Narcotics Command, applied for a search warrant.&nbsp; The application was granted by then Regional Trial Court (RTC) Judge, now Court of Appeals Justice Marina L. Buzon, on 22 January 1996.&nbsp; About four o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, Senior Inspector Romulo Manzanas, SPO2 Bonifacio Cabral, SPO1 De Castro and SPO1 Wilfredo Mendoza, coordinating with <i>Barangay Kagawad</i> Santi Santos Ramos, repaired to 120 Aglipay Street, Caloocan City, the place designated in the search warrant.&nbsp; The team arrived at approximately eight o'clock in the evening and forthwith served the warrant on accused Norma Luciano.&nbsp; She signed it.&nbsp; Inside the second room of the house that the group inspected, SP02 Cabral and SPO1 Mendoza found (a) three sticks of marijuana, (b) one transparent plastic sachet containing suspected marijuana (found inside a cabinet), (c) one weighing scale (trickle brand), and (d) two packs of suspected cocaine contained in a transparent plastic bag, weighing 300 grams, more or less.&nbsp; An inventory of the items seized was made and signed by SPO1 De Castro, Senior Inspector Manzanas, <i>Brgy. Kagawad </i>Ramos and Sheila Leodones, a daughter of the accused. A Certificate of Good Conduct of Search was signed by accused Luciano and her daughter.&nbsp; Luciano, when confronted by Sr. Insp. Manzanas, pointed to Josefino Leodones to be the owner of the confiscated articles.&nbsp; The operatives convinced Sheila to accompany them to the place where accused Leodones could be found.&nbsp; Sheila accompanied them to the house of Leodones' mother at No. 35 A. De Leon St., 9th Avenue, Grace Park, Caloocan City, where Leodones was promptly apprehended. The seized items were taken to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.&nbsp; The initial laboratory report No. D-87-96, dated 24 January 1996, submitted by forensic chemist Julita T. De Villa showed the articles to be positive of cocaine and marijuana.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>"Exh. `A' and `B' - POSITIVE to the tests for Cocaine, a prohibited drug;<br><br>"Exh. `C-1' through `C-4' - POSITIVE to the tests for Marijuana, a prohibited drug."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote><br>A different version was strongly voiced out by the defense.&nbsp; According to it, on 23 January 1996, around ten o'clock in the evening, Norma Luciano and her daughter Sheila Leodones were watching television in their house at 120 Aglipay St., 9th Avenue, Caloocan City, when they noticed someone jumped over the terrace followed by a continuous knocking at their door.&nbsp; Someone yelled, "<i>Misis, dalian mo, buksan mo ang pinto</i>."&nbsp; When Luciano opened the door, six persons in civilian clothes and bearing long firearms rushed inside the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Identifying themselves as police officers, the group showed to her a piece of paper which they claimed was a search warrant.&nbsp; Luciano followed SPO2 Cabral, SPO1 Mendoza and <i>Brgy. Kagawad </i>Ramos, who appeared to be drunk, into the bedroom.&nbsp; She was forced to go out of the room by SPO1 Mendoza who told her to instead have a talk with Sr. Insp. Manzanas.&nbsp; She went to Sr. Insp. Manzanas but because he paid no attention to her she returned to the bedroom followed by Manzanas.&nbsp; This time, it was Sr. Insp. Manzanas who asked her to leave.&nbsp; Later, she heard somebody yell out "<i>putang ina, eto na</i>" which prompted her to again rush inside.&nbsp; SPO1 Mendoza was then seen to be lifting the first layer of the mattress and seemingly looking at a plastic bag he held with the other hand.&nbsp; SPO2 Cabral, at the other end of the bed, was holding another packet, saying "<i>eto pa</i>." Luciano and Sheila were later forced to sign some papers.&nbsp; Sheila was then required to accompany the policemen to the house of her paternal grandmother at 35 A. de Leon St., 9th Ave., West Grace Park, Caloocan City, where her father was residing with his legitimate family.&nbsp; Leodones was awakened by one of his children and told that Sheila was at the doorstep, crying and in state of shock.&nbsp; Leodones went downstairs to meet Sheila. Leodones was taken outside by one of the men while another pulled out a gun and poked it at his abdomen.&nbsp; A son of Leodones was hit with a .45 caliber pistol, violently thrown against the wall and told "<i>huwag makialam</i>."&nbsp; Leodones was arrested and taken inside a <i>tamaraw</i> van without any inkling why he was being accosted.&nbsp; Luciano, Leodones and Sheila were all taken to Camp Crame, Quezon City.&nbsp; At Camp Crame, Sr. Insp. Manzanas convinced Luciano to point to Leodones as being the owner of the seized articles.&nbsp; Sr. Insp. Manzanas even offered to lend Luciano P2,000.00.&nbsp; Luciano was allowed to go home but was fetched the following morning, 25 January 1996, at about nine o'clock in the morning by SPO2 Cabral, SPO1 Mendoza and SPO2 Domingo.&nbsp; She was taken back to Camp Crame and, in the afternoon, was brought, along with Leodones, to the Department of Justice for Inquest.&nbsp; After having executed their sworn statements, the two were returned to and detained at Camp Crame.<br><br>The trial judge, seeing the case for the prosecution, passed judgment in its decision of 02 February 1999, promulgated on 24 February 1999, finding the accused both guilty of the offense charged.<br><br><blockquote>"FOREGOING CONSIDERED, the prosecution was able to prove with normal certainty, the guilt of both accused beyond reasonable doubt of having violated Sec. 8, Art. II RA 6425, as amended by RA 7659.<br><br>"WHEREFORE, Judgment is hereby rendered CONVICTING the accused Norma Luciano and Josefino Leodones of Violation of Sec. 8, Art. II, RA Act 6425, as amended by RA 7659; and both are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay a fine of FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS EACH and to suffer the accessory penalties provided for by law.<br><br>"The prohibited articles confiscated from said accused are hereby forfeited in favor of the government to be turned over to the Dangerous Drugs Board for appropriate disposition.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>On 31 May 1999, the convicted accused filed a notice of appeal.&nbsp; In their brief, they alleged:<br><br><blockquote>"I.&nbsp; THE TRIAL COURT OVERLOOKED MATERIAL FACTS OF SUBSTANCE WHICH, IF DULY CONSIDERED, WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT THE RESULT OF THIS CASE.<br><br>"II.THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING APPELLANTS FOR FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO OVERTHROW THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IN THEIR FAVOR."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br>The Solicitor General recommends acquittal.<br><br>Like the Solicitor General, the Court is equally perplexed why a request to analyze the seized substances was made on 11 January 1996 when the search for, as well as the seizure of, the prohibited articles was done several days later or, specifically, only on 23 January 1996.&nbsp; Mrs. Julita De Villa, a Forensic Chemist assigned at the PNP Crime Laboratory, testified:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2" valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Prosecutor: </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Now, on January 11, 1996, do you remember if you reported for duty?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Now, while you were on duty, do you remember having received a letter-request sent to you by certain Police Insp.

In addition, the articles presented to Mrs. De Villa were suspected methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu and suspected cocaine but the "Receipt of Property Seized" during the operations indicated that no shabu was taken from the house of Leodones.&nbsp; The items said to have been seized only included "three (3) sticks of marijuana; one (1) transparent plastic sachet containing suspected marijuana; one (1) weighing scale marked (trickle brand); and two (2) packs of suspected cocaine contained in transparent plastic, approximately three hundred (300) grams."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><sup></sup><br><br>Mrs. De Villa was later recalled on 29 May 1996 and, in an apparent attempt to correct the blunder, testified about a request for laboratory examination received by her office on 24 January 1996.&nbsp; Even the Solicitor General was not impressed and pointed out:<br><br><blockquote>"It must be mentioned that de Villa who made a chemical analysis of the specimens submitted on January 11, 1996 and those received by the PNP Crime Laboratory on January 24, 1996 testified for the prosecution twice, the first on May 20, 1996 and the second when she was recalled to the witness stand on May 29, 1996.&nbsp; When she was first called to the witness stand, de Villa was presented as the Chemist `who conducted the laboratory examination on the specimen subject matter of this case' (p. 3, TSN, May 20, 1996).&nbsp; Understandably, the subject matter of this case adverted to refers to the prohibited drugs (cocaine and marijuana) mentioned in the Information which were seized on January 23, 1996.&nbsp; However, de Villa did not actually testify on May 20, 1999 regarding the result of the chemical analysis on these drugs subject matter of this case but on the contents of the two (2) plastic bags (Exhibits E-1 and D-1) which were received by the PNP Crime Laboratory on January 11, 1996 (pp. 2-19, TSN, May 20, 1996).&nbsp; Of course, the specimens which are the real subject matter of this case were testified to by de Villa on May 29, 2000 when she was recalled.<br><br>"The rule is that after examination of a witness by both sides has been concluded, the witness cannot be recalled without leave court in its discretion, which may be granted only upon a showing of some concrete, substantial grounds for recall, such as particularly identified material points were not covered, or particular vital documents were not presented to the witness or the cross-examination was conducted in so inept manner as to result in a virtual absence thereof (People vs. Rivera, 200 SCRA 786 [1991]).<br><br>"In this case, de Villa's testimony when she was recalled dealt on matters which were not all touched during her first testimony or which were otherwise testified to by her for the very first time.&nbsp; To say the least, it is strange because the pertinent documents to which de Villa was confronted on May 29, 1996 were available and subject to her disposal at the time she first testified on May 20, 1996 as she herself prepared those documents.<br><br>"Thus, the fact that it was de Villa who conducted the chemical analysis and the corresponding report on the specimens subject of her recall testimony puts under serious question the basis and purpose for which de Villa's said testimony was offered.&nbsp; The prosecution recalled de Villa `to testify on another matter because there were two (2) markings already, one is already marked as Exhibit `A' which he identified' and `to testify for a new evidence which is the subject matter of this information . . .' (p.2, TSN, May 29, 1996 [emphasis ours]).<br><br>"The reference to `a new evidence' is baffling because it creates an impression that on May 20, 1996, when de Villa first testified, `the new evidence' were not yet in existence.&nbsp; It must be stressed that as early as January 24, 1996, de Villa had already prepared an made available Chemistry Report D-87-96 respecting the 287.04 grams of cocaine, the `new evidence' adverted to by the prosecution (p. 12, TSN, May 29, 1996).&nbsp; Truly, there is reasonable ground to doubt the credibility of Senior Inspector Manzanas and his men and that of de Villa."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>Indeed, there would appear to be good reasons for doubting the claim by the police officers that the signature of Sheila on the receipt of the property seized, and the signatures of Sheila and Luciano on the certificate of good conduct search, were obtained freely.&nbsp;
