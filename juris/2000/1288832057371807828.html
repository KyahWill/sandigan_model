(PD 442)<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>Upon arraignment, both Mercado and Tomas pleaded Not Guilty to the offense.<br><br>The prosecution presented the testimony of five complainants, namely: Lourdes Pastor, Romeo Pastor, Imelda Corre, Lilibeth Mabalot and Cristina Arellano, and one corroborating witness, Antonia Reodique. The testimony of complainant Cristina Arellano was, however, expunged from the records due to her failure to take the witness stand for cross-examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Complainant Lourdes Pastor (Lourdes, for brevity), testified that sometime during the last week of November 1992, she and her brother Romeo Pastor and another companion went to a house in Villa Nova Subdivision, Novaliches, Quezon City to visit a fortune teller. The fortune teller introduced herself as Dioscora Mercado de Arabia. While Lourdes and Romeo were in Mercado's residence, they noticed a passport with money inserted in it. When they inquired from Mercado what the passport and money were for, she replied that she is capable of sending persons abroad for employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> She assured Lourdes and Romeo that if they will be able to give her their passport and placement fee in the amount of P17,500.00 each, she could facilitate their employment and departure for Taiwan by January 1993. Mercado added that they would be working as factory workers in Taiwan with a monthly salary of P25,000.00. Lourdes discussed the prospective job in Taiwan with Mercado in the latter's residence about four times during the period between the last week of November and first week of December 1992. On December 8, 1992, Lourdes gave her passport and placement fee in the amount of P17,500.00 to Mercado in the presence of co-accused Tomas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> When Lourdes asked for a receipt, Mercado told her that she could not be issued one because she was being hired on a direct basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> On January 16,1993, however, Lourdes was unable to leave for Taiwan as promised by Mercado. When she went to the latter's house to inquire as to the reason for her failure to leave for Taiwan, Mercado explained that January 16 was a holiday in Taiwan. After January 16,1993, Mercado kept on promising that Lourdes and the other applicants would leave soon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On February 4, 1993, Mercado called Lourdes at home and asked the latter to come to her house. Upon arriving at Mercado's residence in Villa Nova Subdivision, Lourdes and the other applicants who were then present were informed by Mercado that they would all be going to the office of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI, for brevity) to cause the surveillance of a certain Rebecca Sipagan. Although Lourdes did not know and had never met Sipagan, she went with Mercado and about twenty other applicants to the NBI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>At the NBI office, Lourdes and the other applicants waited for Mercado while the latter talked to a lawyer-investigator in a separate room. Thereafter, Mercado, who was holding a blank affidavit form, went to the room where they were waiting and told them that they were going to Malacañang to sign some papers. However, instead of proceeding to Malacañang, they went to a house under the Nagtahan bridge, which house was owned by a certain Sgt. Bass.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Inside the said house, Mercado distributed copies of the blank affidavit form to Lourdes and the other applicants and dictated to them what to write in the blanks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In accordance with Mercado's instructions, Lourdes wrote the name of Rebecca Sipagan as respondent in the affidavit form and alleged therein that she gave Sipagan P30,000.00 as placement fee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On direct examination, however, Lourdes testified that she does not know Rebecca Sipagan and that she only executed the affidavit following Mercado's instructions. Lourdes clarified that she had no intention of filing a complaint against Sipagan because she never met the latter and could not have possibly given money to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Lourdes further testified that subsequently, she went back to the NBI&nbsp; to explain that she wanted to file a complaint not against Rebecca Sipagan but against Dioscora Mercado, since the latter was the person who recruited her.&nbsp; After talking to a certain Atty. Arugay of the NBI, Lourdes executed another affidavit, this time alleging that it was Dioscora Mercado who recruited her and who received her passport and placement fee but who failed to send her to Taiwan for employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>When asked about Tomas' participation in Mercado's recruitment activities, Lourdes replied that Tomas was always present during her meetings with Mercado, but it was Mercado who received her money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Lourdes' brother and co-complainant Romeo Pastor (Romeo, for brevity) testified that he met accused Mercado and Tomas for the first time during the first week of November 1992 when he went to Mercado's house in Villa Nova Subdivision, Novaliches, Quezon City together with his sister Lourdes Pastor. On that day, he saw that there were several other persons in Mercado's house. When he inquired from Mercado what these people were doing in her house, she informed him that they were applicants who were about to leave the country for employment as factory workers in Taiwan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Mercado told him that if he was interested to work as a factory worker earning a monthly salary of P25,000.00, he could leave for Taiwan together with the second batch in December 1992 upon submission of his passport and payment of a placement fee in the amount of P17,500.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> On December 9, 1972, Romeo submitted his documents and passport together with his placement fee of P17,500.00 to Mercado and Tomas. When he asked for a receipt, Mercado told him that since he was being hired on a direct basis, it was no longer needed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> When he failed to leave for Taiwan in December as promised by Mercado, he talked to her and she guaranteed that he could leave by January 16, 1993. His departure for Taiwan in January 16 was postponed again because according to Mercado, the said date was a holiday in that country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On February 3,1993, Mercado called him up and asked him to go to her house the following day, February 4, 1993. When Romeo went to Mercado's house in February 4, he saw that there were many other applicants waiting there.&nbsp; Later, he was told that they would be proceeding to the NBI to cause the surveillance of one Rebecca de Jesus Sipagan. Romeo testified that he did not know anyone by that name. Still, he went with Mercado and some twenty other applicants. When they were at the NBI, he and the other applicants waited together in one area while Mercado talked for along time to an NBI investigator inside another room. Later, Mercado went out of the room and asked them who would speak on behalf of the applicants. When Romeo was asked by Mercado if he wanted to be their spokesperson, he declined. Thereafter, about five persons, including Mercado and his sister Lourdes, entered the investigation room. They were able to get copies of an affidavit form. Subsequently, Mercado told him and the other applicants that they were going to Malacañang to accomplish the affidavit forms. However, Romeo and the other applicants were brought to an apartment under the Nagtahan Bridge instead.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>While they were in said apartment, Mercado instructed them to fill in the affidavit forms, and to allege therein that Rebecca Sipagan promised to send them to Taiwan and to return their money. After Romeo accomplished the affidavit form given to him, he gave the same to Mercado.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> During his direct and cross-examinations, however, Romeo explained that he filed an affidavit-complaint against Sipagan only because that was what Mercado wanted and he was promised by her that his money would be returned to him if he filed a complaint against Sipagan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>However, since his money was still not returned after he accomplished said affidavit and gave the same to Mercado, Romeo, his sister Lourdes and another complainant, Lilibeth O. Mabalot, went to a police station in Valenzuela, Metro Manila to file a complaint against Mercado and Tomas. They were advised by the Valenzuela police to return to the NBI and file a complaint against the persons responsible for their recruitment. Thus, Romeo, Lourdes and Lilibeth Mabalot explained to an NBI investigator the circumstances surrounding the execution of their respective affidavits against Sipagan. Thereafter, they executed separate affidavits alleging that Mercado and Tomas recruited them for employment as factory workers in Taiwan and took their money.<br><br>Another complainant, Imelda Corre, (Imelda, for brevity) testified that sometime in 1991, she met Mercado and Tomas at their residence in Novaliches, Quezon City. They talked about Mercado being a manghihilot and a fortune teller. Imelda's sister also learned that Mercado had the capacity to send workers abroad. In October 1992, Imelda went to Mercado's house to inquire about the possibility of working in Taiwan. When she arrived in said residence, she noticed that there were about ten persons wating to submit their respective passports to Mercado. Mercado told Imelda that she could facilitate her employment abroad as a factory worker earning P25,000.00 monthly, but she had to submit her passport so that her departure for Taiwan would be processed. Mercado also asked her to give P10,000.00 as placement fee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On November 3, 1992,Imelda went back to Mercado's residence to give her passport, other requirements and the P10,000.00 placement fee. Mercado received these from Imelda in the presence of Tomas. When Imelda asked for a receipt, Mercado told her that it was no longer necessary because she was being hired on a direct basis. Mercado also told her that she would leave for Taiwan on January 16,1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> However, Imelda was unable to depart for Taiwan on said date. When she confronted Mercado about this, she was told that the trip had to be postponed for February as it turned out that January 16, 1993 was a holiday in Taiwan. Like the other complainants, Imelda was still unable to leave for Taiwan thereafter, despite Mercado's promises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Imelda further testified that on February 4,1993, Tomas called her up and asked her to proceed to Mercado's residence. Tomas explained that they were going to cause the surveillance of a certain Rebecca de Jesus, whom Imelda had never seen nor heard of. Eager to recover her money, Imelda went to the NBI on February 5,1995 and joined Mercado and the other applicants, including Romeo, Lourdes, Lilibeth Mabalot and Cristina Arellano. At the NBI, Mercado, her husband and some of Mercado's friends entered a room. Imelda and the other applicants waited outside. After about forty-five minutes, Mercado went out of the room and called Lourdes. After another fifteen minutes, Mercado called Imelda and asked her to sign a piece of paper which she likened to an attendance sheet After signing the paper, Mercado went inside the room again. Thereafter, Mercado went out of the room again and told Imelda to go home already. Instead of going home, Imelda proceeded together with some twenty other applicants to a house in Nagtahan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>While they were at the house in Nagtahan, Imelda and the other applicants were given one affidavit form each which they filled in with the information which Mercado dictated to them. Mercado also asked Imelda and the others to sign their respective affidavits. When Imelda inquired why they had to sign the affidavit, Mercado explained that it was the only way by which they could get back their money. After signing the affidavit, Imelda gave the same to Mercado. Imelda was not given a copy thereof. Thereafter, Mercado told her that she could go home and that the former would just get in touch with her. She was not present when the said document was notarized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, Mercado called up Imelda and asked her if she wanted to apply for overseas employment with another agency. Sometime in February, Mercado again urged Imelda to apply for employment with another agency, and said that if Imelda could leave the country through another employment agency, she could still have the opportunity to earn what she had spent earlier.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Imelda grew even more suspicious of Mercado. Thus, together with her fellow applicants Cristina Arellano and Lilibeth Mabalot, she went to the Philippine Overseas Employment Authority (POEA, for brevity) and inquired whether Mercado and Tomas were licensed recruiters. They discovered that the two were not licensed to recruit applicants for employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On March 3, 1993, Imelda, Romeo, Lourdes, Cristina Arellano and Lilibeth Mabalot returned to the NBI to follow up the status of the complaints against Rebecca Sipagan, for which they executed affidavits earlier on February 5, 1993. They told the NBI agents that they actually did not know Rebecca Sipagan. Imelda related everything the transpired relative to her application and the money which she gave to Mercado. Thereafter, she accomplished another affidavit before NBI administering officer Britanico which she subscribed before Assistant City Prosecutor Arturo delos Reyes. In said affidavit, Imelda stated that it was Mercado and Tomas who committed illegal recruitment and estafa against her as well as against her fellow applicants Lourdes, Romeo, Lilibeth Mabalot and Cristina Arellano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Imelda further stated that on March 11, 1993, the NBI invited Mercado and Tomas for questioning. After the investigation, they were brought to the NBI headquarters in Quezon City and charges of illegal recruitment and estafa were filed against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Complainant Lilibeth Mabalot (Lilibeth, for brevity) likewise testified that she met accused Mercado for the first time in 1991 at the wake of a common friend. She was introduced to Mercado by her sister, lmelda Corre. She met Mercado for the second time on November 3,1992, at the latter's residence in Novaliches. She went there together with her sister Imelda because they received information that Mercado and Tomas were recruiting applicants for employment in Taiwan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Mercado told her that she could be employed in Taiwan as a factory worker with a monthly salary of ranging from P25,000.00 to P30,000.00 if she could submit her passport and other documents and pay a placement fee of P7,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Tomas said she would take care of facilitating the processing of Lilibeth's papers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On or about November 7,1992, Lilibeth together with her sister Imelda returned to Mercado's house in Novaliches to talk to the latter and Tomas. Lilibeth gave her placement fee of P7,000.00 to Mercado. When she asked for a receipt, Mercado told her that no receipt could be issued because she was being sent abroad on a direct hiring basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Lilibeth was told by Mercado that she would be able to leave for Taiwan either in December 1992 or January 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Like the other complainants, Lilibeth was unable to leave for Taiwan as promised by Mercado.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> She was unable to retrieve the sum of P7,000.00 which she gave to Mercado for the processing of her application for employment in Taiwan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Thus, on March 3, 1993, Lilibeth, together with Imelda, Cristina Arellano, Romeo and Lourdes went to the NBI to file complaints for illegal recruitment and estafa against Mercado and Tomas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Corroborating witness Antonia Reodique (Antonia, for brevity) for her part testified that she met accused Tomas for the first time in the morning of December 12, 1992 through complainant Lilibeth Mabalot when she accompanied her sister Cristina Arellano to Tomas' house to inquire about the possibility of finding employment in Taiwan. Antonia said that it was Lilibeth who informed Cristina Arellano that Tomas and Mercado were recruiting applicants for employment as factory workers in Taiwan. Antonia testified that she overheard the conversation of Cristina Arellano and accused Tomas, particularly, that Cristina was being required to pay a placement fee of P12,000.00. On the afternoon of the same day, Cristina went back to Tomas' house and gave her passport and the placement fee of P12,000.00 to Tomas, who instructed Cristina to wait for the processing of her employment papers. Cristina was however, unable to leave for Taiwan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, accused Mercado and Tomas raised the defense that they were not recruiters, but, like the complainants, they too were recruited by Rebecca de Jesus Sipagan as applicants for employment abroad. Mercado and Tomas denied having recruited Lourdes Pastor, Romeo Pastor, Lilibeth Mabalot and Imelda Corre.<br><br>Mercado testified that she first met Rebecca Sipagan sometime in September 1992 when the latter came to her house for a massage. In the course of their conversation, Sipagan represented that she could send persons for employment in Taiwan. She said that if Mercado was interested in working abroad, she can go to her (Sipagan's) office in Fairview. Subsequently, when Mercado went to Sipagan's residence and office in Fairview, the latter told her that for purposes of facilitating her employment abroad, she had to submit her birth certificate, marriage contract, pictures and give a placement fee of P30,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Mercado also stated that she met complainants Lourdes Pastor, Romeo Pastor, Lilibeth Mabalot, Imelda Corre as well as Cristina Arellano for the first time on November 8, 1992 in the house of Rebecca Sipagan, where like her, they were applying for work abroad. She met them again at Sipagan's house sometime in December, 1992 when they were all following up the status of their respective applications for employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Mercado further testified that she first met co-accused Tomas at the house of Sipagan on November 28, 1992. Tomas was then renting a room therein and was also processing her employment abroad through Sipagan. Mercado and Tomas became friends and the latter eventually transferred to the former’s residence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Mercado stated that when she was unable to leave for Taiwan on January 16, 1993 as promised by Sipagan, she went back to the latter's house but unfortunately, she did not see Sipagan there. Due to her failure to depart for Taiwan, she called Imelda, Lourdes, Romeo, Lilibeth on February 5, 1993 and asked them to go with her to the NBI to file a complaint for illegal recruitment and estafa against Sipagan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>For her part, acused Tomas testified that she met co-accused Mercado for the first time in October, 1992 in the house of Rebecca Sipagan in Fairview, as they were both applying for overseas employment in Taiwan through Sipagan. On that same day, she accepted Mercado's offer to lease a room in the latter's residence in Novaliches, Quezon City while awaiting her departure for Taiwan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>As to her application for employment in Taiwan, Tomas said that she gave her passport and other pertinent documents plus P30,000.00 as placement fee to Sipagan. She was not given a receipt by the latter who explained that she was being sent to Taiwan on direct hiring basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> She further stated that she was unable to leave for Taiwan as promised by Sipagan, whose whereabouts she eventually lost track of. She then planned to file a complaint against Sipagan, so she talked to Mercado who was then the oldest among the applicants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> On February 5, 1993, Tomas together with Mercado and the other applicants went to the NBI to file a complaint against Sipagan.<br><br>Tomas denied that there was any truth to the charges against her and Mercado. She explained that the complainants filed charges against them upon the prodding of NBI Agent Jessie Camara, a cousin of Lourdes and Romeo Pastor.<br><br>She clarified that she met complainants Lourdes Pastor and Romeo Pastor at the house of Mercado only once, on January 2, 1993, when they discussed the details of their departure for Taiwan scheduled on January 16, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> She added that she met Cristina Arellano in Mercado's house in December 1992 when they could no longer find their recruiter, Rebecca Sipagan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>On August 30, 1995, the Regional Trial Court rendered the assailed Decision finding both Mercado and Tomas guilty of illegal recruitment. The two accused filed a Motion for Reconsideration with the trial court on November 7,1995. However, said motion was denied by the lower court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><blockquote>Hence, this appeal which raises the following error:<br><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF ILLEGAL RECRUITMENT ON A LARGE SCALE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant Mercado contends that the prosecution failed to show that she had given the complainants the distinct impression that she had the power or ability to send the complainants abroad such as to convince them to part with their money in order to be so employed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> as required in <em>Darvin vs. Court of Appeals.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Mercado pointed out that as a mere fortune teller and <em>manghihilot</em> who reached only Grade 2 in elementary school, she could not have possibly deceived complainants, who are all high school graduates, into believing that she could send them to Taiwan to work as factory workers. She added that she did not even work in a travel agency or an office which could have lent a semblance of distinction to a fraudulent scheme on her part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Tomas, on the other hand, claims that the prosecution failed to prove that she actively participated in recruiting the complaining witnesses for employment as factory workers in Taiwan. She pointed out that all the witnesses testified that they handed their money over to Mercado and that it was the latter who constantly enticed them to work in Taiwan. Tomas only called up one complainant, Imelda Corre, to inform her that they would cause the surveillance of Rebecca Sipagan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>With regard to accused-appellant Mercado, this Court finds that the trial court did not err in finding her guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale.<br><br>Illegal recruitment has been defined to include the act of engaging in any of the activities mentioned in Article 13 (b) of the Labor Code without the required license or authority from the POEA. Under the aforesaid provision, any of the following activities would constitute recruitment and placement: canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring or procuring workers, including referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not. Article 13 (b) further provides that any person or entity which, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee employment to two or more persons shall be deemed engaged in recruitment and placement.

The Court notes that while Romeo said that he gave his placement fee to the two accused,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> in other portions of his testimony, he only referred to accused Mercado and made no mention of Tomas, thus:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valalign="top">ATTY.
