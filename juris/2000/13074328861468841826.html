				<H3>MAMERTO T. PACRIS, COMPLAINANT, VS. JUDGE ADRIAN N. PAGALILAUAN, RESPONDENT.<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PURISIMA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">At bar is an administrative complaint of Mamerto T. Pacris 
(complainant) against Judge Adrian N. Pagalilauan (respondent) of Branch
 12, Regional Trial Court, Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, for serious 
misconduct, gross ignorance of the law, inefficiency and falsification 
of monthly certificate of service.
<p>Complainant charges respondent as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “THE CHARGES </p>
  <p align="center">xxx                                    xxx                              xxx
  </p>
  <p>During the pendency of Election Case No. 1807-S, entitled ‘Federico
 Q. Galapia, protestant, versus Mamerto T. Pacris, protestee,’ which was
 tried and submitted for decision before respondent judge, and during 
the campaign of (sic) the 1995 elections, wherein the protestant and the
 protestee were again among the candidates for mayor in Sanchez Mira, 
Cagayan, the protestant in his campaign speeches told the public that he
 will sit as the Mayor-elect of Sanchez Mira on April 14, 1995.  So the 
protestee approached the respondent judge in his chambers to inquire 
from him if he has (sic) already rendered his decision in the election 
protest involving the protestant and the protestee and stated to him 
what the protestant had been publicly telling the people, but respondent
 judge told protestee not to believe the protestant and to convince 
protestee, he showed his unsigned decision dismissing Election Case No. 
1807-S. </p>
  <p align="center">xxx                                    xxx                              xxx
  </p>
  <p>In the early morning of April 20, 1995, the undersigned before 
going to Tuguegarao, Cagayan, to see the Governor on official matters, 
he decided to see first the respondent judge in his chambers, which he 
was using it (sic) at that time as his sleeping quarters without the 
permission of the Supreme Court because he left his boarding house after
 he was caught peeping at the daughter of his landlady while taking a 
bath, to ascertain from him if it is (sic) true what protestant had been
 telling the public that he will (sic) sit that day, April 20, 1995, as 
the mayor-elect of Sanchez Mira and he admitted that he had changed his 
unsigned decision dismissing the election protest and invalidated the 
ballots with undetached coupons.
  </p>
  <p>When protestee arrived home from Tuguegarao in the afternoon, he 
was informed that the respondent judge had promulgated his decision 
(Annex ‘A’) in the election protest and the Comelec Officer of Sanchez 
Mira had already received his copy of the decision from whom protestee 
got an immediate xerox copy as the basis of his perfection of an appeal 
with the COMELEC on April 22, 1995. </p>
  <p align="center">xxx                                    xxx                              xxx
  </p>
  <p>That respondent judge, as part of his plan, design or scheme to 
make protestant win the election protest, intentionally violated the 
COMELEC Rules of Procedure in his desire to favor the protestant, by not
 setting a date for the promulgation of the decision wherein due notice 
must be given to the parties, but instead he immediately promulgated the
 same on the very day it was rendered, in violation of Rule 35, Sec. 19 
of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure and the case of Alejo vs. Tanada, 238 
SCRA 60 (1994).
  </p>
  <p>That respondent judge, intentionally and persistent-disregarded 
(sic) well-known law, legal rules and jurisprudence or stare decisis to 
the prejudice of the protestee and knowing it as the only possible means
 to make protestant win his election protest, declared invalid one 
hundred twenty one (121) ballots with undetached upper coupons cast in 
favor of protestee in violation of Sec. 211 of the Omnibus Election 
Code, which provides:
  </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> ‘27. Failure to remove the detachable coupon from a ballot does not annul such ballot.’
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>and the settled doctrine that voters shall not be deprived by 
(sic) their votes by mere failure of the election officer to comply with
 the formal prerequisites of voting (Valenzuela vs. Carlos, 42 Phil. 
428).
    </p>
    <p>To justify his illegal, unlawful and fraudulent act in declaring 
invalid 121 ballots with undetached upper coupons, respondent judge 
opined:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> ‘xxx the protestee cit(ed) the case of Valenzuela vs. Carlos, 
42 Phil. 428.  The Court agrees with this, for it is but fair and 
reasonable in so far as simple, innocent and honest ommission (sic) of 
election officers are concerned.  The court however doubts whether the 
rules should cover all kinds of ommission (sic) by election officers be 
it deliberate or not and irrespective of whether or not the ommission 
(sic) defeats the secrecy of the voter’s vote. xxx.’ 
          </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>contrary to the Supreme Court ruling in Albert vs. Court of First Instance of Manila (Br. VI), 23 SCRA 948, which states:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> ‘So it is, that in Martiniano P. Vivo vs. Hon. Gaudencio 
Cloribel, et al., L-23239, November 23, 1966 (18 Supreme Court Reports 
Anno. 713,726), <u>this Court stressed the need for trial judges to take cognizance of the rulings of the Supreme Court</u>. xxx’ (Underscoring supplied) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>xxx                                    xxx                              xxx
    </p>
    <p>and Circular No. 13, dated July 1, 1987, of the Supreme Court, 
providing general guidelines for all members of the judiciary, that 
judges should keep abreast of the rulings and doctrines laid down by the
 Supreme Court and apply them to appropriate cases regardless of their 
personal opinion.
    </p>
    <p>That respondent judge, to buttress his decision making protestant
 win in the election protest, which exposes his complete ignorance of 
the law, not only invalidated the 121 ballots with undetached upper 
coupons but also considered said ballots as marked contrary to the 
settled doctrines in elections (sic) contest that the mark which shall 
invalidate the ballot are those which the voter himself deliberately 
placed on his ballot for the purpose of identifying it thereafter.  In 
other words, a markplaced (sic) on the ballot by a person other than the
 voter himself does not invalidate [the ballot] as marked (Tajanlangit 
vs. Cazenas, G.R. No. L-18894, June 30, 1962, 5 SCRA 567).  Hence, the 
ballots which (sic) upper coupons were not detached by the Chairman of 
the Board of Inspectors are not marked ballots.
    </p>
    <p>That respondent judge, either as a part of his plan, design or 
scheme to make protestee lose in the election protest or in evident bad 
faith and/or partiality, also declared invalid six (6) ballots cast in 
favor of the protestee which were not signed by the Chairman of the 
Board of Inspectors.  However, he did not declare invalid the twenty 
five (25) ballots cast in favor of the respondent.  In the case of 
Lucero vs.  De Guzman, 45 Phil. 852, 875, the Court held that ‘xxx It is
 a well settled rule that a voter shall not be deprived of the franchise
 by mere failure of the election officials to comply with some 
provisions or another statute relative to the acts to be done 
exclusively by the officer’. </p>
    <p>The respondent judge, not supported by evidence or with conscious
 and deliberate act to do an injustice against the protestee, stated in 
his decision that, ‘after a careful scrutiny of the Book of Voters and 
List of Voters, the Court finds’, among others, the following three (3) 
of the eight voters to be invalid: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> ‘Precinct No. 23 </p>
      <p> ‘1. Acdal, Orlino P voted, but at the back of his voters affidavit it is marked ‘deceased’; </p>
      <p>‘2. Cabulisan, Pacito (policeman) voted but according to information he had been dead  before the election.’
          </p>
      <p>xxx                                    xxx                              xxx
      </p>
      <p> ‘Precinct No. 22-B </p>
      <p> ‘1.  Alegado Nancita - voted but no name in Book of Voters.’  
          </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Orlino P. Acdal died on December 12, 1992 (Annexes B-B1, while 
Pacito Cabulisan died on June 2, 1992 (Annex C) after the elections on 
May 11, 1992.  The annotations ‘deceased’ at the back of their voters 
affidavit were entered by the Comelec Officer when he requested the 
court during the trial of the election protest for the return to his 
Office the Book of Voters of the aforesaid precincts preparatory to the 
May 8, 1995 elections. </p>
    <p>Nancita Alegado is a classroom teacher in Barangay Tokitoc, 
Sanchez Mira, Cagayan and is a registered voter of Precinct 35 therein 
(Annex D).   She was assigned and served as a member of the Board of 
Inspectors of Precinct 22-B of Barangay Masisit and she voted in said 
precinct pursuant to Sec. 169 of the Omnibus Election Code allowing 
members of the board of election inspectors to vote in the polling place
 where they are assigned on election day.
    </p>
    <p>That respondent judge, to further fortify his plan, design or 
scheme to make protestee lose the election protest and with deliberate 
intent to cause injustice on the part of the protestee and a clear 
violation of Sec. 14, Art. VIII, 1987 Constitution, dismissed for lack 
of merit protestee’s counter-protest without taking into account the 
facts and evidence alleged in his counter-protest and without expressing
 therein clearly and distinctly the facts and law on which the dismissal
 was based. </p>
    <p>Considering the facts that protestant had been publicly telling 
the people that he has plenty of money; that he will do everything 
within his resources to win his election protest; that he will sit as 
the mayor-elect of Sanchez Mira on April 20, 1995, the date of the 
questioned decision of respondent judge; that respondent judge had 
prepared an unsigned decision dismissing the election protest; that he 
was enticed to prepare another decision dated April 20, 1995, which he 
promulgated on the same day, declaring protestant as the winner in the 
May 11, 1992 elections for mayor of Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, in complete 
disregard to (sic) the decisions and rules and regulation of the Supreme
 Court, the principle of res ipsa liquitor (sic) be applied to him. 
(People vs. Valenzuela, 135 SCRA 712).
    </p>
    <p>That respondent judge, since appointment to the judiciary, as 
presiding judge of the Regional Trial [Court], Second Judicial Region, 
Branch 12, Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, up to the present, has not been 
reporting for duty and hearing cases every Mondays, Thursday afternoons 
and Fridays of the week.  He arrives in his station from Tuguegarao, 
Cagayan, where he resides, in the morning of Tuesday and leaves his 
station after lunch of Thursday, thereby affecting his integrity and 
efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>That respondent judge, despite the fact that he does not report 
for duty and hold session on Mondays, Thursday afternoons and Fridays, 
he certified in his Monthly Certificate of Service that he rendered 
complete service for the month, which is a clear case of falsification 
of monthly certificate of service since he became a judge up to the 
present.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In compliance with the First Indorsement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated July 9, 1997 of Court Administrator Alfredo L. Benipayo, respondent submitted his Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> stating, among others:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “3. That from the time I assumed office as the presiding judge of 
the Regional Trial Court, Branch 12, Sanchez Mira, Cagayan I became 
aware, for the first time, of the existence and pendency of Election 
Case No. 1807-S before the said Court when it was included in the July 
29, 1993, calendar of the Court, at which time the committee on revision
 of ballots and recounting of votes had not yet submitted its report of 
the result of the revision and recounting of votes in the precincts 
covered by the protest and counter-protest  xxx. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">xxx                                    xxx                              xxx
</p><blockquote>
  <p>10. That  thereafter several incidents were submitted by the 
parties for resolution by the Court and after hearing, resolving all the
 incidents, the Court issued an order dated February 21, 1995, a copy of
 which is hereto attached as ANNEX ‘15’ giving the parties twenty (20) 
days within which to submit their respective memorandum and on March 13,
 1995, the protestee submitted his memorandum personally signed by him; </p>
  <p>11. That on April 20, 1995, the undersigned, as presiding judge of 
the court, rendered a decision on the merits.  All the foregoing facts 
and incidents aptly demonstrate that I was not really inefficient in 
disposing of Election Case No. 1807-S wherein retired Judge Mariano T. 
Pacris is the protestee and counter-protestant.  Much of the delay is 
attributable to the protestee and counter-protestant himself and his 
counsel.
  </p>
  <p>12. That as regards the alleged delay in the elevation of the 
record of the case as pointed in the Comelec resolution cited in the 
letter-complaint, such delay, if there was any, was entirely called for 
and fully justified by the events and incidents which took place in 
connection with the case after the promulgation and filing of the notice
 of appeal by the protestee, such as:
  </p>
  <p align="center">xxx                                    xxx                              xxx
  </p>
  <p>Consequently, it is most respectfully submitted that the delay if 
there is any, in the elevation of the record of the case to the Comelec 
called for and fully justified by the incidents and events that took 
place after the promulgation of the decision and the filing of a notice 
of appeal by the protestee; 
  </p>
  <p>13. That in so far as the alleged campaign speeches of the 
protestant, Federico Q. Galapia, during the campaign period immediately 
preceding the May 12, 1995 local elections, stating, among others, that 
he would sit as Mayor elect of Sanchez Mira on April 14, 1995 and/or on 
April 20, 1995 I have absolutely nothing to do with the same, the truth 
of the matter being that I never had any occasion to talk to him or any 
of his two counsels, Attys. Victoriano G. Pascua and Abuan regarding the
 case; hence the reason why I told the protestee, Mamerto T. Pacris, 
when he approached me for the first time asking me if I had already 
rendered my decision in the case and on the occasion of which I told him
 I have not yet finished making the decision in the case, which was then
 absolutely true, the truth of the matter being that I was still in the 
process of writing the draft of the decision.  Hence, contrary to the 
imputation contained in the letter-complaint, I never showed him any 
decision, unsigned or otherwise, in the case, much less dismissing the 
election case;
  </p>
  <p align="center">xxx                                    xxx                              xxx
  </p>
  <p>15. That it is true that in the morning of April 20, 1995, the day I
 signed the decision in the case, the protestee approached me for the 
second time, again inquiring if I had already finished the decision in 
the case and I told him the decision was already finished which prompted
 me to release the decision that very same day by handing the same to 
the Clerk of Court who then, right away, mailed copies of the same to 
the parties concerned, but I never told or admitted to the protestee 
that I changed the decision dismissing the election protest the truth of
 the matter being that I never made or prepared a decision, unsigned or 
otherwise, dismissing the election protest; 
  </p>
  <p>16. That the release and consequent promulgation of the decision on
 April 20, 1995 without the date of the promulgation having been set and
 the parties notified thereof caused no damage or prejudice to any of 
the rights of the parties in the case, the evident purpose of the 
provisions of Sec. 20, Rule 35, Part VI of the Comelec Rules of 
Procedure, providing for the setting of the promulgation of decisions 
rendered by the Regional Trial Courts in elections cases being only to 
avoid any squable (sic) between the parties litigants, in case of an 
appeal, as to whether or not the appeal was perfected within the period 
of appeal, a question which sometimes arises on account of the 
difficulty of establishing or knowing at what time or on what date the 
party litigants received their respective copy of the decision or order 
appealed from, as well as to achieve auniform (sic) time or date from 
which to perfect the period of appeal for both the protestant and the 
protestee in such cases;
  </p>
  <p align="center">xxx                                    xxx                              xxx
  </p>
  <p>18.  That in so far as the 122 ballots in Precinct No. 23 Masisit, 
which were declared invalid in the decision rendered, I was fully aware 
of the provisions of Sec. 211, par. No. 27 of the Omnibus Election Code 
and of the doctrines or ruling made by the Honorable Supreme Court to 
the effect that the voter should not be deprived of his or her vote by 
the mere failure of the election officers to comply with the formal 
pre-requisites of voting.  It was, and still is, my honest and 
considered view, however, that Sec. 211, par. 27 and the above-mentioned
 doctrines or ruling of the Honorable Supreme Court are not applicable 
xxx.
  </p>
  <p>19.  That as regards to the six (6) ballots wherein the protestee 
was voted for but which were declared invalid in the decision for the 
reason that the same were not signed by the Chairman of the Board of 
Election Inspectors, and my failure to declare invalid the twenty/five 
(25) ballots wherein the protestant was voted for and which are 
likewise, unsigned by the Chairman, I candidly admit I committed a 
mistake or ommission (sic).  My ommission (sic) or mistake however, is 
an honest one and was the result of pure inadvertense (sic); not a 
deliberate act. xxx
  </p>
  <p>20.  That as regards to the three (3) votes for the protestee 
mentioned in the letter-complaint and which are declared invalid in the 
decision, the invalidation of said votes or ballots were based on what 
appeared in the Book of Voters and in the List of Voters used during the
 May 11, 1992 elections.  Thus, in the Book of Voters for precinct No. 
23, Masisit Orlino Acdal who appears in the list of voters used during 
the May 11, 1992 elections to have voted, is therein indicated as 
deceased; while Mancita Alegado who appears in the list of voters to 
have cast her vote in Precinct No. 22-B Masisit, is not a registered 
voter in the precinct per the Book of Voters because her name does not 
appear therein;
  </p>
  <p>21.  Relative to the allegations of the letter-complaint averring 
that I peeped at the daughter of my former landlady and that I have been
 using the court’s chamber as my sleeping quarters, there is absolutely 
no truth to the same.  As a matter of fact the incidents referred to is 
the subject of a previous anonymous letter-complaint in relation to 
which I have submitted my comments and which had been docketed as 
Administrative Matter No. RTJ 96-1363 and in connection with the 
supposed complaint, complainant had never appeared nor located inspite 
of efforts exerted by the Justice of the Court of Appeals to where it 
was assigned for investigation; </p>
  <p>22.  That it is not true that I have not been reporting for duty on
 Mondays, Fridays and Thursday afternoons, the truth of the matter being
 that I do work from Monday to Friday and on many instances I even 
worked at home on Saturdays and Sundays when resolving cases involving 
difficult questions of law, although I seldom conduct trials or hearing 
of cases on Mondays and Fridays because said days are devoted by me to 
make my decisions and study cases pending trial before the Court;” 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On March 16, 1998, the Court resolved<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 to refer the case to Associate Justice Hilarion L. Aquino of the Court 
of Appeals for investigation, report and recommendation.  However, 
Justice Aquino begged leave to be relieved of the case because the 
respondent is a townmate of his and for a number of years, a former 
colleague when he (Justice Aquino) was Executive Judge of the Regional 
Trial Court in Tuguegarao, Cagayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>

 Bernardo P. Abesamis of the Court of Appeals for investigation, report

</p><p>During the hearing on October 15, 1998 before Justice Abesamis, the parties stipulated on the following facts:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “1. Complainant lacks sufficient evidence to prove that respondent
 judge used his chambers as sleeping quarters; the said allegation is 
considered withdrawn; </p>
  <p>2.  Complainant’s allegation that respondent judge committed an act
 of voyeurism is subject matter of another pending administrative matter
 against respondent, hence, considered withdrawn from this case; </p>
  <p>3. Complainant’s allegation that delay visited the disposition of 
Election Case No. 1807-S is not a charge but merely mentioned in passing
 in connection with the said case; and </p>
  <p>4. Respondent judge admitted the factual footholds of the following allegations in the complaint:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>a) he promulgated the decision without setting the date therefor and notifying the parties;
    </p>
    <p>b) he did not observe stare decisis in ruling against the validity of 121 ballots with undetached upper stubs;
    </p>
    <p>c) he erred in invalidating six (6) ballots not signed by the Chairman of the Board of Canvassers;

    <p>d) he invalidated the votes of Acdal, Cabulisan and Alegado;

PROTESTANT IN ELECTION CASE NO. 1807-S IS DISMISSED FOR LACK OF MERIT. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and recommended thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “WHEREFORE, all the foregoing considered, it is respectfully 
recommended that: (a) respondent judge be fined in the amount equivalent
 to his one (1) month salary for gross ignorance of the law and serious 
misconduct; (b) the charge of falsification of certificates of service 
be dismissed for lack of merit; and (c) the charge of inefficiency be 
likewise dismissed, however, respondent judge be enjoined to observe 
proper trial hours subscribed Circular No. 13.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The charge of gross misconduct against respondent judge for allegedly
 showing to complainant a copy of his unpromulgated decision in Election
 Case No. 1807-S, lacks sufficient evidentiary support.  In his 
Memorandum of December 9, 1998, the Investigator stated:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “Proceeding from the premises that respondent judge drafted two 
decisions and that Court Stenographer Malvar is of unprejudiced 
disposition, it is within rhyme and reason to conclude that respondent 
judge likewise gave complainant-protestee a ‘sneak preview’ of his first
 draft decision. xxx”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing on record to prove that the respondent showed a copy of his subject  decision to the complainant.
</p><p>That respondent prepared two drafts of his subject decision is of
 no moment.  It may be that he changed his mind after preparing one 
draft or intentionally prepared two drafts for his evaluation and 
consideration.  Besides, the decision became effective only upon its 
promulgation.
</p><p>But the acts of respondent constitute gross ignorance of the law, as charged:
</p><p>1.  Respondent admitted that he promulgated the decision in 
Election Case No. 1807-S without first setting the date therefor and 
with no notice to the parties.
</p><p>Section 19, Rule 35 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “Sec. 19. Promulgation and Finality of Decision. - The decision of
 the Court shall be promulgated on a date set by it of which due notice 
must be given the parties.  It shall become final five (5) days after 
its promulgation.  No motion for reconsideration shall be entertained.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. Respondent invalidated one hundred twenty-one (121) ballots with 
undetached upper stubs contrary to jurisprudence and the provisions of 
the Omnibus Election Code.
</p><p>As admitted by respondent, he did not observe stare decisis in 
invalidating one-hundred twenty one (121) ballots with undetached upper 
stubs. What the respondent did does not accord with applicable rules and
 jurisprudence:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “Sec.  211.  Rules for the appreciation of ballots. - In the 
reading and appreciation of ballots, every ballot shall be presumed to 
be valid unless there is clear and good reason to justify its rejection.
  The board of election inspectors shall observe the following rules, 
bearing in mind that the object of the election is to obtain the 
expression of the voters’ will: </p>
  <p align="center">xxx                                    xxx                              xxx
  </p>
  <p>27. Failure to remove the detachable coupon from a ballot does not annul such ballot.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in <em>De los Angeles vs. Rodriguez</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> citing <em>Lucero vs. De Guzman</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the Court held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> ‘“The circumstance that the coupon bearing the number of a ballot 
is not detached at the time the ballot is voted does not justify the 
court in rejecting the ballot.  The duty of detaching the coupon is 
placed by law upon the election officials, and the voter must not be 
deprived of the franchise by reason of their failure to perform this 
duty.”’
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondent, in his 2nd Indorsement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 manifested awareness of the foregoing rules and jurisprudence but 
contended that paragraph 27 of Section 211 of the Omnibus Election Code 
 “refers to the lower stab (sic) of the ballot”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and not the upper stubs involved in the present case.  
</p><p>Respondent erred in making distinctions where the law is clear 
and no distinction is necessary. He erred in not adhering to the 
precedents set by this Court no matter what his opinion on the matter 
may be.  Judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws shall form
 part of the legal system of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
</p><p>Indeed, respondent appears unmindful of his duty as a member of the judiciary:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “18.  <em>Influence of decisions upon the development of the law</em> </p>
  <p>A judge should be mindful that his duty is the application of 
general law to particular instance, that ours is a government of laws 
and not of men, and that he violates his duty as a minister of justice 
under such a system if he seeks to do what he may personally consider 
substantial justice in a particular case and disregards the general law 
as he knows it to be binding on him.  Such action may have detrimental 
consequences beyond the immediate controversy.  He should administer his
 office with a due regard to the integrity of the system of the law 
itself, remembering that he is not a depository of arbitrary power, but a
 judge under the sanction of law.” (<em>Canons of Judicial Ethics</em>) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.  Then too, he invalidated six (6) ballots for complainant for 
being unsigned by the Chairman of the Board of Canvassers but did not 
invalidate the ballots cast in favor of protestant which were also 
unsigned by the Chairman.
</p><p>Respondent admitted having done the same fact but explained that 
it was through mistake or omission.  His defense is unsustainable.  He 
is liable for violating the rule that failure of the Chairman of the 
Board of Election Inspectors to comply with his mandated administrative 
responsibility, i.e., signing, authenticating and thumbmarking of 
ballots, should not penalize the voter with disenfranchisement:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “Similarly, Section 211 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, otherwise 
known as the ‘Omnibus Election Code of the Philippines’ provides that in
 the reading and appreciation of ballots, every ballot shall be presumed
 to be valid unless there is a clear and good reason to justify its 
rejection. Certainly, the inefficiency of an election officer in failing
 to affix his signature at the back of the ballot does not constitute as
 a good and clear reason to justify the rejection of a ballot.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>4.  So also, he invalidated the vote of Nancita Alegado, a member of 
the Board of Election Inspectors of Precinct 22 of Sanchez Mira, 
Cagayan, on the ground that her name did not appear in the Book of 
Voters.
</p><p>Respondent likewise violated Section 169 of the Omnibus Election Code, which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “Sec. 169. Voting privilege of members of the board of election 
inspectors. - Members of the board of election inspectors and their 
substitutes may vote in the polling place where they are assigned on 
election day; Provided, That they are registered voters within the 
province, city or municipality where they are assigned: and Provided, 
finally, That their voting in the polling places where they are not 
registered voters be noted in the minutes of the board of election 
inspectors.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Alegado is a registered voter of Precinct 35 of Sanchez Mira, 
Cagayan, but she was serving as an election inspector in Precinct 22-B 
so that she was entitled to vote in the latter precinct.  Despite the 
categorical declaration in the law that she had voting rights, 
respondent improperly excluded her vote just because Ms. Alegado’s name 
did not appear in the Book of Voters.   
</p><p>5. Respondent dismissed complainant’s counter-protest without 
stating the facts and law on which such dismissal was based.  In 
dismissing complainant’s counter-protest, respondent disposed:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “WHEREFORE, the protestant Federico Q. Galapia in the 
above-entitled case should be, as he is hereby declared to be the winner
 in the May 11, 1992 election (sic) for mayor of Sanchez Mira, Cagayan. </p>
  <p>The counter-protest filed by the protestee is hereby dismissed for lack of merit, with costs de oficio.
  </p>
  <p>IT IS SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefrom, it can be gleaned unerringly that respondent never 
discussed in the body of his decision the basis for the dismissal of the
 counter-protest.  In so doing, he violated a basic legal principle, a 
constitutional one at that,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> that in making a decision, the facts and the law upon which the decision is based must be expressed clearly and distinctly.
</p><p>All the foregoing studiedly considered, the Court is of the 
irresistible conclusion that respondent Judge is guilty of gross 
ignorance of the law.  He should be reminded of paragraph 2 of Circular 
No. 13 (SUBJECT: GUIDELINES IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE) in 
relation to which circular the Court enunciated the rule that “[j]udges 
should keep abreast of the rulings and doctrines laid down by the 
Supreme Court and apply them to appropriate cases regardless of their 
personal opinion.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
</p><p>The laws that respondent violated or failed to apply are not 
complicated, and do not involve difficult questions of law.  His failure
 to apply basic legal principles constitutes utter disregard of 
well-settled doctrines.
</p><p>6. Respondent also failed to observe office hours as required by Circular No. 13.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“GUIDELINES FOR TRIAL COURTS </p>
  <p>The following guidelines are hereby issued for all trial courts:
  </p>
  <p>1. Punctuality and strict observance of office hours. - Punctuality
 in the holding of scheduled hearings is an imperative.  Trial judges 
should strictly observe the requirement of <em>at least eight hours of service a day</em>,
 five hours of which should be devoted to trial, specifically from 8:30 
a.m. to 12:00 noon and from 2:00 to 4:30 p.m. as required by par. 5 of 
the Interim Rules issued by the Supreme Court on January 11, 1983, 
pursuant to Sec. 16 of BP 129.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and Administrative Circular No. 1:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “xxx                                 xxx                              xxx </p>
  <p>2. Maximum Use of Judge Time and Effective Court Management:
  </p>
  <p>2.1 All Presiding Judges are directed to comply strictly with the 
guidelines established in Circular No. 13, July 1, 1987, on punctuality 
and observance of office hours, effective use of pre-trial and discovery
 procedure, effective management of trials, the availment of annual 
conferences.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondent, in his 2nd Indorsement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>dated August 27, 1997, stated:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “22. That it is not true that I have not been reporting for duty 
on Mondays, Fridays and Thursday afternoons, the truth of the matter 
being that I do work from Monday to Friday (sic) and on (sic) many 
instances I even worked at home on Saturdays and Sundays when resolving 
cases involving difficult questions of law, although I seldom conduct 
trials or hearing of cases on Mondays and Fridays because said days are 
devoted by me to make my decisions and study cases pending trial before 
the Court;”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Respondent admitted not holding trials on Mondays and Fridays, 
contrary to the instruction of the Court.  Respondent has to be reminded
 that proper and efficient utilization of office hours for hearings and 
trials is to ensure a speedy administration of justice.
</p><p>1. Respondent’s voyeurism was the subject of Administrative 
Matter No. 96-1363 which had been resolved by the Court in a Decision 
dated October 12, 1998, disposing thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> ‘“WHEREFORE, for his disgraceful acts of voyeurism committed 
against Marilyn C. Dumayas, respondent  Judge Adrian N. Pagalilauan, 
RTC-Br. 12, Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, is fined P10,000.00 with warning that
 a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more 
severely.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. The charge that respondent has been using his chambers as sleeping
 quarters is anemic of evidentiary support and is therefore dismissed.
</p><p>3. The alleged delay in the disposition of Election Case No. 
1807-S is also dismissed because complainant stipulated that the same is
 not a charge but merely mentioned in connection with the election case.
  Besides, Justice Abesamis found no evidence of delay in the 
disposition of subject election case.
</p><p>4. Respondent’s alleged error in nullifying the votes of 
Cabulisan and Acdal is likewise dismissed for lack of corroborating 
evidence to substantiate the same.
</p><p>5. Respondent’s alleged failure to set Election Case No. 1807-S for hearing should also be dismissed because:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “First, as the record of the case bears him out, complainant was 
amenable to the submission of the case for decision without hearing.  In
 an Order, dated February 21, 1995, respondent judge explicit[ly] 
instructed with caveat that ‘the parties hereby given twenty (20) days 
from today to submit their respective memorandum.  With or without their
 memoranda, the case will be submitted for decision.’ The parties, 
including complainant, did not manifest their objection in open court or
 move for the reconsideration of said order in writing.  Instead, they 
submitted their respective compliance thereto. </p>
  <p>Second, it is duly noted that when complainant saw the first draft 
of decision, which he alleged was in his favor, there was no fuss over 
the lack of hearing.  xxx”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>6. The charge of falsification of Certificates of Service is also dismissed in view of the absence of proof.
</p><p>7. The charge that respondent has been partial in favor of the 
counsel for the protestant in Election Case No. 1807-S is also dismissed
 for lack of merit.  The Clerk of Court of Branch 12, Regional Trial 
Court, Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, has certified that since the respondent 
became the Presiding Judge, there was only one criminal case which was 
reconsidered, from conviction to acquittal, and that it was counsel for 
protestant, Atty. Victoriano Pascua, who appeared as the private 
prosecutor in the said case.  Furthermore, Atty. Pascua has a lot of 
cases pending in the sala of the respondent that somehow explains the 
long hours he spends in the courtroom.
</p><p>Justice Abesamis recommended that the respondent be fined in an 
amount equivalent to one (1) month salary, for gross ignorance of the 
law.  Respondent was once administratively fined P10,000.00  in 
Administrative Matter No. 96-1363.  The current salary of a regional 
trial court judge is P24,127.00 a month.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, respondent Judge Adrian N. 
Pagalilauan  is found GUILTY of gross ignorance of the law and is hereby
 FINED in the amount of TEN THOUSAND (P10,000.00) PESOS.
</p><p>The charges of serious misconduct, falsification of certificates of service and inefficiency are DISMISSED for lack of merit.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.
</strong>
</p><p><em>Melo, (Chairman), Vitug, Panganiban</em>, and <em>Gonzaga-Reyes, JJ.</em>, concur.
