Worldwide Manpower and Management Services.&nbsp; She asserts that she was employed as a secretary of Satellite Travel Agency owned by Pamani and that she was only instructed by Pamani to report every morning to L.A. Worldwide to conduct recruitment activities.<br><br>We find the above contention unmeritorious.<br><br>In dealing with the private complainants, appellant presented herself as the person who had the power to deploy workers abroad.&nbsp; If it were true that she was not recruiting in her personal capacity but was merely acting as the secretary of Mr. Pamani, appellant should have referred the complainants to the employees of L.A. Worldwide Manpower and Management Services, a duly licensed recruitment agency, where Mr. Pamani was the Overseas Marketing Director.&nbsp; She did not refer complainants to Pamani, or any other person who exercised supervision over her undertaking in her dealings with the private complainants, giving us the impression that she was acting on her own. Worse, appellant did not present Pamani, the person who was allegedly responsible for the recruitment, as a witness to back up her claim.&nbsp; With the failure of appellant to present Pamani, she risked the adverse inference and legal presumption that evidence suppressed would be adverse if produced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Moreover, appellant did not use the receipts issued by L.A.
