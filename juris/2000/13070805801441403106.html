				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>What is before us is an appeal <i>via certiorari</i> to set aside the 
decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals 
annulling the order of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 163, Pasig City which 
granted the issuance of a writ of execution in Civil Case No. 64798.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p>The antecedent facts are as follows: </p>
<p>Respondent Jorge Z. Ortoll was the owner of a three-bedroom condominium unit 
at Alexandra Apartments in Pasig, Metro Manila. In December 1992, respondent 
Ortoll and petitioner Benigno M. Salvador entered into an option to purchase 
agreement which, for and in consideration of two hundred thousand (P200,000.00) 
pesos, granted petitioner Salvador the option to purchase the condominium unit 
within a period of six (6) months from December 1, 1992, for the total sum of 
six million four hundred thousand (P6,400,000.00) pesos, payable in cash. </p>
<p>Upon petitioner Salvador's request, respondent Ortoll allowed him to occupy 
the condominium unit, subject to the condition that if petitioner Salvador 
failed to exercise the option within the agreed period, he would voluntarily 
vacate the premises without necessity of demand or judicial intervention. 
Moreover, petitioner Salvador would pay liquidated damages in the amount of five 
hundred thousand (P500,000.00) pesos should it become necessary to go to court 
to evict him from the property. The option to buy is not assignable, nor is 
there an intention to put the unit up for lease. </p>
<p>On May 28, 1993, petitioner Salvador informed respondent Ortoll that his bank 
approved his loan application in the amount of three million five hundred 
thousand (P3,500,000.00) pesos and asked that he be granted a few more weeks to 
complete the purchase price. However, on June 1, 1993, Atty. Domingo Gonzales, 
respondent Ortoll's lawyer, sent petitioner Salvador a letter demanding that he 
vacate the property on June 30, 1993 and pay the amount of thirty five thousand 
(P35,000.00) pesos as usage fee of the condominium unit for the month of June 
1993. </p>
<p>On June 7, 1993, petitioner Salvador informed respondent Ortoll that his 
bank, Monte de Piedad Savings and Loan Bank, increased his approved loan to ten 
million (P10,000,000.00) pesos and repeated his appeal to extend the period to 
exercise his option to purchase the condominium unit.</p>
<p>In a letter faxed on July 7, 1993, respondent Ortoll told petitioner Salvador 
that these proposals were not acceptable. The thirty five thousand (P35,000.00) 
pesos that he was asking Salvador to pay corresponded to the usage fee of the 
condominium unit for the duration covered by the option agreement, and not 
payment for the extension of the lease. If he were to grant the request for 
extension until August 31, 1993, Salvador must pay the option money to extend 
the option to purchase agreement of one hundred five thousand (P105,000.00) 
pesos. </p>
<p>Petitioner Salvador did not inform respondent Ortoll whether he was accepting 
the counter-proposal. Neither did he vacate the condominium unit nor pay the 
purchase price of six million four hundred (P6,400,000.00) pesos. </p>
<p>On September 15, 1993, respondent Ortoll filed with the Metropolitan Trial 
Court, Branch 68, Pasig City an action for ejectment. </p>
<p>On December 29, 1993, the Metropolitan Trial Court decided the case in favor 
of respondent Ortoll.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> However, on 
appeal, the Regional Trial Court, Pasig City, on September 23, 1994, reversed 
the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p>
<p>On October 17, 1994, respondent Ortoll moved for reconsideration of the 
decision but the Regional Trial Court denied the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Upon appeal <i>via </i>petition for review 
to the Court of Appeals, the appellate court reversed the decision of the 
Regional Trial Court and reinstated the decision of the Metropolitan Trial 
Court, with modification. The dispositive portion reads: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision of the court a quo is REVERSED 
and the MTC decision is REINSTITUTED with MODIFICATION that the private 
respondent shall pay to the petitioner, as plaintiff in the case the amount of 
P500,000.00 liquidated damages pursuant to the agreement between them."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner Salvador appealed to the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p>
<p>During the pendency of the appeal, petitioner Salvador initiated a new 
complaint with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 163, Pasig City<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> for specific performance and damages and 
prayed for the enforcement of the option to purchase agreement then pending with 
the Supreme Court. </p>
<p>To put an end to the case pending before the trial court, petitioner Salvador 
and respondent Ortoll entered into a compromise agreement, which the Regional 
Trial Court approved on June 28, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
The pertinent provisions of the agreement provided that: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"1. Both parties have agreed to settle the case amicably with the plaintiff 
buying the Alexandra Unit E-251 of defendant for ELEVEN MILLION THREE HUNDRED 
THOUSAND PESOS (P11,300,000.00), under the following terms and conditions: </p>
<p align="center">"A. TERMS OF PAYMENT</p>
<p>"A. 1. 50% or P5,650,000.00 payable on or before the 90<sup>th</sup> day from 
execution of this compromise agreement; and, the balance of: </p>
<p>"A. 2. 50% or P5,650,000.00 payable on or before the 30<sup>th</sup> day from 
due date of the first payment; </p>
<p>"A. 3. The total consideration of P11.3 Million shall be covered by two (2) 
separate post dated checks.</p>
<p>"A. 4. Jorge Z. Ortoll, to deliver CCT No. PT-7461 to Plaintiff upon 
encashment of second check covering the full payment together with the real 
estate taxes payment for 1996.</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p align="center">"B. OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"B.1. The above consideration of P11.3 million shall be net CASH to 
defendant. Plaintiff have agreed to pay the EVAT, withholding tax, documentary 
stamps to be affixed to the Deed of Sale, transfer tax, registration expenses 
and all other incidental expenses to transfer title of subject property in the 
name of the buyer.</p>
<p>"B.2. As a further consideration of the compromise agreement, both parties 
have agreed to file a Joint Motion to Withdraw the Petition for Review docketed 
as G. R. No. 122164 (CA-G. R. SP No. 36531) now pending before the Supreme Court 
(Second Division) covering the same property subject matter of the above 
captioned complaint. </p>
<p>"B.3. Finally, both parties have agreed to waive any and all causes or rights 
of action each one may have against the other involving the said property."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Under the terms of the compromise agreement, petitioner Salvador would pay 
one half of the purchase price on or before September 26, 1996, and the other 
half thirty (30) days after, or on or before October 26, 1996. Petitioner 
Salvador failed to comply with these obligations, since payment was tendered 
only on October 28, 1996, two days late from the deadline. </p>
<p>On October 14, 1996, petitioner Salvador informed respondent Ortoll that his 
application for a loan of P11,300,000.00 had been approved by the United Coconut 
Planters Life Assurance Corporation (UCPLAC). However, the approved loan was for 
the account of Jasper Phils. Corporation, and subject to the condition that the 
deed of sale be issued in the name of Jasper Phils. </p>
<p>On October 16, 1996, respondent Ortoll informed petitioner Salvador that he 
would deliver the title upon full payment of the purchase price, including 
payment of taxes due thereon pursuant to the terms of the judgment by 
compromise. The following additional conditions were set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) Salvador would pay an interest equivalent to 1.5% on the amount of 
P5,650,000.00 due and unpaid as of September 26, 1996; </p>
<p>(b) Salvador would pay rent for his possession and occupation of the 
condominium unit until the sale has been finalized;</p>
<p>(c) Salvador would pay the E-VAT and other taxes due on the property; and 
</p>
<p>(d) The seller would be Tamaraw Investors Management Enterprises, Inc. 
(TIME), who had purchased Ortoll's interests on the condominium unit on August 
25, 1997. </p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioner Salvador agreed to pay the rent, but refused payment of interest 
on delayed payment and the value-added tax on the transaction. </p>
<p>On November 8, 1996, petitioner Salvador applied with the trial court for the 
issuance of writ of execution to implement the judgment by compromise. The Court 
granted the motion in an order dated January 28, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The trial court said that: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Since both parties in this case claim rights which are not expressly 
embodied in their compromise agreement which were the bases of the decision of 
this Court in this case, and since plaintiff already has the amount ready for 
payment of the subject of their controversies, the Alexandra Unit E-251, this 
Court believes that it would be for the interest of both parties that defendant 
Jorge Z. Ortoll accepts the check for P11,300,000.00 and execute the deed of 
sale of Condominium Unit, Alexandra E-251, in favor of plaintiff, Benigno 
Salvador. </p>
<p>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, let a writ of execution be issued to enforce 
the decision of the Court in this case." </p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>On January 29, 1997, the trial court issued the writ of execution.</p>
<p>On February 7, 1997, respondent Ortoll moved to quash the writ of 
execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On March 11, 1997, the 
trial court denied the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> On 
March 17, 1997, the trial court gave due course to the appeal filed by 
respondent Ortoll and ordered the elevation of the records of the case to the 
Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p>
<p>In the appeal, respondent Ortoll alleged that the appealed order must be 
annulled on two grounds: (1) it substantially varied the terms of the judgment 
by compromise; and (2) he has unilaterally rescinded the compromise judgment due 
to petitioner Salvador's failure to strictly comply with its terms. </p>
<p>On April 30, 1999, the Court of Appeals promulgated its decision ruling that 
the appealed order substantially deviated from and varied the terms of the 
compromise judgment. The appealed order extended the time of payment granted to 
the buyer and fixed "a new period for its fulfillment excusing him from the 
effects of his default and compelling defendant to accept a bilateral lump-sum 
payment of plaintiff's obligations without any compensation for such delay."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p>
<p>The Court of Appeals sustained respondent Ortoll's contention that by virtue 
of petitioner Salvador's failure to comply with the terms of the compromise 
judgment, respondent Ortoll could exercise his right to unilaterally rescind the 
compromise judgment pursuant to the provisions of Article 2041 of the Civil 
Code. The seller of the condominium unit had no obligation to accept the tender 
of payment made by the buyer because the party making it was not the buyer and 
the tender was conditional and deficient. Hence, by virtue of the unilateral 
rescission, the compromise judgment has been rendered <i>functus officio</i>. 
</p>
<p>The dispositive portion of the decision provides that: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"<b>WHEREFORE, </b>finding the appeal meritorious, the appealed Order dated 
January 28, 1997 is hereby declared <b>NULL AND VOID </b>and it is hereby <b>SET 
ASIDE.</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> 
</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>On July 9, 1999, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p>
<p>On November 4, 1999, the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's motion for 
reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p>
<p>Hence, this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p>
<p>Petitioner Salvador contends that the appellate court erred in ruling that: 
(1) the writ of execution varied the terms of the compromise judgment; (2) he 
breached the compromise judgment, as a result of which, respondent Ortoll was 
entitled to unilaterally rescind the compromise agreement pursuant to Article 
2041 of the Civil Code; and (3) respondent Ortoll was not estopped from 
exercising the right to rescind the compromise judgment. </p>
<p>We grant the petition. </p>
<p>The issues raised by the petitioner are as follows:</p>
<ol><li>Whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the writ of execution 
issued by the lower court to execute the compromise agreement had the effect of 
substantially altering the compromise agreement and extending the time of 
plaintiff Salvador to pay the purchase price; <br>
</li><li>Whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the breach was 
substantial and thus entitled respondent Ortoll to unilaterally rescind the 
compromise judgment. </li></ol>
<p>As to the first assigned error, we do not agree with the Court of Appeals 
that the writ of execution varied the terms of the compromise agreement. The 
main purpose of the compromise is to settle between the two parties the amount 
to be paid by petitioner as purchase price for the condominium unit. The writ of 
execution is simple. Petitioner is ordered to pay P11,300,000.00 and respondent 
to issue the corresponding deed of absolute sale. There was no substantial part 
that was changed by the writ of execution. The purchase price is the same and 
the other terms of the compromise were still incorporated therein.</p>
<p>This Court has time and again reiterated the ruling that if the parties could 
end their legal battles in an amicable way it would be to the best interest of 
the parties and the courts as well. "The law encourages the amicable settlement 
not only of pending cases but also disputes which might otherwise be filed in 
court,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> as what the trial court 
wished to avert when it issued the writ of execution dated January 28, 1997. 
</p>
<p>As to the second assigned error, it is very obvious that petitioner Ortoll as 
early as September 26, 1996, was aware of the non-payment of respondent Salvador 
since that was the date that Salvador was supposed to pay fifty per cent of the 
P11,300,000.00 purchase price for the condominium unit.</p>
<p>However, on October 16, 1996 respondent Ortoll still had communication with 
Salvador and the lending agency UCPLAC that the loan of Salvador was already 
approved for P11,300,000.00 but the same was in the name of JASPER Phils. On the 
same day, Ortoll did not register any objection to said arrangement and even 
wrote Salvador that he would accept full payment; Ortoll did not state in his 
letter that he was not agreeable with the arrangement that the purchase would be 
done in the name of Jasper Phils. Inc. What he stipulated in his letter were 
additional conditions, which would jack-up the purchase price to thirteen 
million pesos (P13,000,000.00). Such actions simply mean that he was still 
willing to push through with the compromise agreement, he was not rescinding the 
agreement but was adding new conditions to the compromise. </p>
<p>Petitioner Salvador contends that respondent Ortoll is estopped from 
rescinding the compromise judgment because of his representation that he would 
continue with the enforcement of the compromise judgment despite the breach. 
"Estoppel <i>in pais</i> arises when one, by his acts, representations or 
admissions, or by his own silence when he ought to speak out, intentionally or 
through culpable negligence, induces another to believe certain facts to exist 
and such other rightfully relies and acts on such belief, so that he will be 
prejudiced if the former is permitted to deny the existence of such facts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p>
<p>With respondent Ortoll's constant communication through his representatives 
on the status of the loan of petitioner Salvador and his letter of October 16, 
1996, agreeing to the purchase after full payment, it is clear that he was not 
rescinding the compromise agreement and was pushing through with the sale. The 
only issue that caused the institution of this case was the demand by Ortoll of 
additional interest that was not in the original compromise agreement. It is 
respondent Ortoll who wished to change the stipulations in the compromise 
agreement. </p>
<p>The greater interest at stake in this case is the end to litigation and the 
settling of the dispute as to the purchase of the condominium unit, for which 
the parties entered into a compromise agreement which has the force and effect 
of a judgment and is considered final and executory. "It is well-settled that a 
judicial compromise has the effect of <i>res judicata </i>and is immediately 
executory and not appealable unless a motion to set aside the same is filed on 
the ground of fraud, mistake or duress, in which event an appeal may be filed 
from an order denying the same. A court can not set aside a judgment based on 
compromise without having declared in an incidental hearing that such a 
compromise is vitiated by any of the grounds for nullity enumerated in Article 
2038 of the Civil Code."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the Court grants the petition, and annuls and sets aside 
the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G. R. CV No. 54740. </p>
<p><b>IN LIEU THEREOF,</b> the Court reinstates the order dated January 28, 
1997, of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 163, Pasig City in Civil Case No. 
64798, for the issuance of a writ of execution to enforce the compromise 
decision of the court in the case.</p>
