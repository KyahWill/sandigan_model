				<BR><BR><div align="justify">No person should be penalized for the exercise of the right to litigate. This right, however, must be exercised in good faith.

Agapito L. Domingo of the Southern Police District investigated the accident and filed the following report:<br><blockquote><br>"Investigation disclosed that shortly before the accident took place, V-3 (D.M. Transit Bus) was traveling along South Expressway coming from Alabang towards the general direction of Makati. When upon reaching a place at KM Post 14 [in front] of Merville Subd., said V-3 hit and bumped the rear left side portion of V-1 [Bondads’ jeepney] which was then at [stop] position due to flat tire [;] due to the severe impact cause by V-3 it swerved to the left and collided with the right side portion of V-2&nbsp; [Morales’ car] which was travelling [in] the same direction taking the innermost lane ddd sss[;] V-2 was dragged to its left side and hit the concrete wall. All vehicles incurred damages and sustaining injuries to the occupant of V-1 and the passengers of V-3. Victims were brought to the hospital for treatment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>Before the Regional Trial Court of Makati on April 12, 1985, Petitioner Industrial Insurance Company, Inc. and Grace Ladaw Morales filed a Complaint for damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> against DM Transit Corporation, Eduardo Diaz, Pablo Bondad and Ligorio Bondad. Petitioner contended that it had paid Morales P29,800 for the damages to her insured car. It also asserted that the December 17, 1984 accident had been caused "solely and proximately" by the "joint gross and wanton negligence, carelessness and imprudence of both defendant drivers Eduardo Diaz y Mendoza and Ligorio Bondad y Hernandez, who failed to exercise and observe the diligence required by law in the management and operation of their respective vehicles and by their defendant employers; D.M. Transit Corporation and Pablo Bondad, respectively, for their failure to exercise the diligence required of them by law in the selection and supervision of their employees including their aforementioned involved drivers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On June 6, 1985, Respondents Pablo and Ligorio Bondad filed their Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> denying any responsibility or liability to petitioner and Morales. They asserted that their vehicle was on full stop because of a flat tire. Thus, it was the bus which hit Morales’ car.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In their Counterclaim, they contended that petitioner had acted in bad faith in impleading them and that, contrary to its allegation, no prior demand had been made upon them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In its October 14, 1991 Decision, the trial court exculpated the Bondads and ordered petitioner to pay them actual, moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney’s fees.<br><br>Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the ruling of the trial court with modification.<br><br>Hence, this Petition for Review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><center><u><strong>The CA Ruling</strong></u></center><br>The appellate court debunked petitioner’s assertion that it had a cause of action against the Bondads, whose negligence was allegedly the proximate cause of the damage to the insured vehicle.<br><blockquote>"The records are clear, however, that soon after the D.M. Transit Bus hit the jeepney of the defendant Bondad, the bus swerved to the left hitting the car of plaintiff Morales. This fact was supported by the investigation report made by Pfc. Agapito L. Domingo of the Southern Police District (Exh. "A") as well as the testimony of defendant Ligorio Bondad which was supported by photographs of defendant Bondad’s jeepney which were taken immediately after the incident. (Exh. "3") It was shown that the jeepney remained at the right shoulder of the expressway (northbound) even after it had been hit forward from its position as a result of the impact. According to Ligorio Bondad, when he noticed that his tire was flat, he slowed down and drove towards the rightmost lane of the expressway with great difficulty until he was able to stop at the right shoulder of the road. (TSN, pp. 55-62, March 21, 1989) This was consistent with the affidavit he had made at the Traffic Bureau Station in Fort Bonifacio on the same day of the accident, December 17, 1984. (Exh. "2-A")<br><br>"Proximate cause is that which, in natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by an efficient intervening cause, produces injury without which the result would not have occurred. (<em>Sabena Belgian World Airline, 255 SCRA 38; Pilipinas Bank vs. Court of Appeals, 234 SCRA 435</em>) As borne out by the evidence in this case, the proximate cause of the damage to the car of plaintiff Morales was the negligence of the driver of the DM Transit bus. Plaintiff-appellant had no valid cause of action against defendants Bondad."<br></blockquote>The CA, however, reduced the lower court’s award of damages to the Bondads, ratiocinating as follows:<br><br>"We agree with the trial court when it granted the counter-claim of defendants Bondad. The plaintiff-appellant insurance company did not verify the facts before impleading the Bondads in this action for damages. The trial court noted that plaintiff-appellant failed to even make a formal demand from the defendants Bondad before it filed the present case. As stated by the trial court in the aforequoted decision, had a formal demand been made by the plaintiffs on the Bondads, matters could have been clarified. As it were, the Bondads had to come to Makati from Alaminos every time this case was set for hearing and not only suffered inconvenience but incurred expenses, particularly for attorney’s fees.<br><br>"We, however, believe that the expenses for attending the hearings should be deleted, the same not having been sufficiently proven. Likewise, moral and exemplary damages should be reduced to the more reasonable amounts of P50,000.00 and P10,000.00, respectively."<br><br><center><u><strong>Issues</strong></u></center><br>In its Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> petitioner presents the following issues for resolution: <br><blockquote>"A) Whether or not the assailed decision and resolution of the Honorable Court of Appeals were scrutinized closely with the legal aspect of law, Articles 2202, 2203, 2219 and 2220 of the Civil Code, in light of the evidence presented in making its decision and its resolution.<br><br>"B) Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals with due respect, went out of the "path of law" and disregarded past precedents applicable to the case at bar."<br></blockquote>In the main, the core issue is the propriety of the award of moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney’s fees, to the respondents. We shall also discuss a preliminary matter: the cause of the accident.<br><br><center><u><strong>The Court’s Ruling</strong></u></center><br>The Petition is not meritorious.<br><br><center><u><strong>Preliminary Issue:<br><em>Cause of Accident</em></strong></u></center><br>Petitioner insists that the negligence of Ligorio and Pablo Bondad was the proximate cause of the accident that damaged the insured vehicle of Grace Ladaw Morales.<br><br>This argument deserves scant consideration. Questions regarding the cause of the accident and the persons responsible for it are factual issues which we cannot pass upon. It is jurisprudentially settled that, as a rule, the jurisdiction of this Court is limited to a review of errors of law allegedly committed by the appellate court. It is not bound to analyze and weigh all over again the evidence already considered in the proceedings below.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>True, there are instances when this Court may review factual issues,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> but petitioner has failed to demonstrate why his case falls under any of them. There is no contrariety between the findings of the trial court and those of the CA as to what and who had caused the December 17, 1984 accident. We find no reason to modify or reverse both courts’ finding that the mishap was caused by the negligence of Eduardo Diaz, the bus driver. <br><br><center><u><strong>Main Issue:<br><em>Award of Damages and Attorney’s Fees</em></strong></u></center><br>In justifying the award of attorney’s fees and other litigation expenses, the appellate court held that respondents were compelled to litigate an unfounded suit because of petitioner’s negligence and lack of prudence in not verifying the facts before filing this action. In affirming the award of moral damages, it accepted the trial court’s justification that respondents had "been recklessly and without basis x x x impleaded by the plaintiff in spite of the clear language in the Traffic Investigation Report x x x submitted by Pfc. Agapito Domingo."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>We agree.<br><br>Attorney’s fees may be awarded by a court if one who claims it is compelled to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect one’s interests by reason of an unjustified act or omission on the part of the party from whom it is sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In this case, the records show that petitioner’s suit against respondents was manifestly unjustified. In the first place, the contact between the vehicles of respondents and of Morales was completely due to the impact of the onrushing bus. This fact is manifest in the police investigation report and, significantly, in the findings of facts of both lower courts. <br><br>Moreover, even a cursory examination of the events would show that respondents were not even remotely the cause of the accident. Their vehicle was on the shoulder of the road because of a flat tire. In view of their emergency situation, they could not have done anything to avoid getting hit by the bus. Verily, an ordinary person has no reason to think that respondents could have caused the accident. It is difficult to imagine how petitioner could have thought so.<br><br>More significantly, petitioner <em>knew</em> that respondents were not the cause of the accident. This is evident from its failure to even make a prior formal demand on them before initiating the suit. Indeed, the cause of the accident was the negligence of the DM Transit bus driver. In this light, we agree with the following findings of the trial court:<br><blockquote>"It is the Court’s findings that the D.M. Transit Bus in question was recklessly engaged in a race with a Baliuag Transit Bus and tried to outrun the former by using the shoulder of the road, a tactic that is very common along the South Expressway. Unfortunately for the D.M. Transit Bus, defendant Pablo Bondad’s jeepney was at a stop at the shoulder along the path to be taken by the erring bus[;] it was not parked, but was at an emergency stop, the emergency being a flat tire. The consequence of this rash action was the accident to the Bondad jeepney and subsequently to the Lancer car owned and operated by one Grace Morales Ladaw which vehicle was pinned by the D.M. Transit to the concrete island dividing the road. There can be no question that the driver of the D.M. Transit Bus was at fault for the accident.<br><br>"It is further the Court’s finding that the plaintiffs have absolutely no cause of action against the Bondads. The latter’s jeepney never got into contact with Ms. Morales’ car. While it is true that before the D.M. Transit Bus hit Ms. Morales car, it had gotten involved in an accident with the Bondad jeepney[;] it is equally true that at the time of the accident the Bondad jeepney was at an emergency stop. This fact was obvious not only from the scene of the accident but also from the police investigation report. There was no need to implead the Bondads as defendants, and if the jeepney had in any way caused, or contributed to, the accident, it could very well be impleaded by the D.M. Transit Bus operator. Worse, no demand for payment was ever made by the plaintiffs on the Bondads. Had a formal demand been made by the plaintiffs on the Bondads, the latter’s role could have been clarified. As it is, they had to face a lawsuit and were constrained to come all the way to Makati from Alaminos for not to do so could place them in a situation where judgment may be rendered against them."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>In impleading respondents, petitioner clearly acted in wanton disregard of facts that were as obvious then as they are now. To repeat, even a cursory examination of the police investigation report and other pertinent data at the time would show that there was no reason to implead respondents. The carelessness and lack of diligence of petitioner destroy its claim of good faith. Accordingly, the award of attorney’s fees should be sustained.<br><br>In the same vein, we affirm the award of moral damages. To sustain this award, it must be shown that (1) the claimant suffered injury, and (2) such injury sprung from any of the cases listed in Articles 2219 and 2220 of the Civil Code. It is not enough that the claimant alleges mental anguish, serious anxiety, wounded feelings, social humiliation, and the like as a result of the acts of the other party. It is necessary that such acts be shown to have been tainted with bad faith or ill motive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, it has been shown that the petitioner acted in bad faith in compelling respondents to litigate an unfounded claim. As a result, Respondent Ligorio Bondad "could no longer concentrate on his job." Moreover, Pablo Bondad became sick and even suffered a mild stroke. Indeed, respondents’ anxiety is not difficult to understand. They were innocently attending to a flat tire on the shoulder of the road; the next thing they knew, they were already being blamed for an accident. Worse, they were forced to commute all the way from Laguna to Makati in order to attend the hearings. Under the circumstances of this case, the award of moral damages is justified.<br><br>Likewise, we affirm the award of exemplary damages because petitioner’s conduct needlessly dragged innocent bystanders into an unfounded litigation. Indeed, exemplary damages are imposed by way of example or correction for the public good, in addition to moral, temperate, liquidated or compensatory damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>In sum, the Court affirms the award of moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney’s fees and litigation expenses. The facts of this case clearly show that petitioner was motivated by bad faith in impleading respondents. Indeed, a person’s right to litigate, as a rule, should not be penalized. This right, however, must be exercised in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>One final note. Respondents pray that the amount of actual, moral and exemplary damages awarded by the trial court be reinstated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> We cannot do so in this case because they did not appeal the CA Decision. Jurisprudentially, they are deemed to be satisfied with it and thus cannot be allowed to attack it belatedly in their Memorandum.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby <em>DENIED</em> and the assailed Decision <em>AFFIRMED</em>.
