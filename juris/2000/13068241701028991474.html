He then removed her panty and, pressing a knife on her, inserted his penis into her vagina and then had her. All that Nerissa could do was to cry in pain.&nbsp; His lust satisfied, he told her to put back on her clothes.&nbsp; The next morning, at about seven o'clock, Nerissa left the house and went to see her aunt with whom she stayed for a week until her father came to fetch her.&nbsp; She felt that she had no choice but to reluctantly go with him.&nbsp; The following night, he again raped her.&nbsp; Manuel Liban would eventually continue raping his daughter on seven different occasions within a one-year period, the specific dates of some of which Nerissa could no longer distinctly remember.<br><br>The last rape took place on 15 October 1996.&nbsp; The three sisters were already asleep.&nbsp; When Nerissa awoke, she found herself tied and naked.&nbsp; Her father then mounted her and inserted his organ into her vagina.&nbsp; She wanted to shout but she was gagged.&nbsp; When her father had left, Leonarda came and untied her.&nbsp; Manuel Liban later came back and seeing Nerissa already unbound, he lashed her to the window.&nbsp; Leonarda told her that their father was also doing the same thing to her. Crying, the two sisters made plans to escape and proceeded to the house of their maternal aunts, remaining there for a while.<br><br>When school started, Nerissa also took Hilda away for fear that their father would do "the same thing" to the young sibling.&nbsp; Tormented by her traumatic encounters, Leonarda left for Manila.&nbsp; Other than Leonarda, Nerissa never told a soul about the rape incidents. On one occasion, while attending church services, she met her friend Manay Luisa.&nbsp; Unable to contain her pent-up anguish, Nerissa blurted out to Luisa her cruel experience.&nbsp; Luisa advised her to see a doctor for check-up to ascertain whether her frequent bouts with dizziness indicated possible pregnancy.&nbsp; The medical certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> issued by Dr. Ma. Humilde Janaban attested to private complainant's non-virgin state and the presence of vaginal lacerations caused by sexual intercourse. The doctor told Nerissa, to her relief, that she was not expecting.<br><br>In December that year, Nerissa was accompanied by her <i>Tia </i>Nora to the police headquarters to lodge a complaint against her father. Informations were filed against Manuel Liban for two counts of rape committed against Nerissa Liban, one on 06 November 1995, docketed Criminal Case No. 97-4363, and the second on 15 October 1996, docketed Criminal Case No. 97-4362, that read:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"<b>INFORMATION</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br><b>(Criminal case No. 97-4363)</b><br></div><br>"The undersigned Assistant Provincial Prosecutor accuses MANUEL LIBAN, of Barangay Caricaran, Bacon, Sorsogon, of RAPE defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, committed as follows:<br><br>"That on or about 9:00 P.M. of November 6, 1995 at Barangay Caricaran, Bacon, Sorsogon, the above-named accused with lewd designs, by means of force and intimidation and taking advantage of his moral ascendancy over his 12-year old daughter NERISSA P.

No. 7659, and imposed upon him the penalty of death -<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the COURT finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of RAPE under Article 335 as amended by Sec. II, R.A. 7659 in Criminal Case No. 97-4363 and hereby sentences him the maximum penalty of death and to pay the offended party the amount of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity; to pay the amount of P10,000.00 as moral damages, and the amount of P10,000.00 as exemplary damages without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the cost.<br><br>"As to Crim. Case No. 97-4362, on reasonable doubt, the accused is hereby acquitted.<br><br>"With cost <i>de oficio</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>The case has been forwarded to this Court for its review. Closely examining the records, the Court finds hardly anything of substance or significance that can warrant a reversal of the finding of the court <i>a quo </i>that indeed accused-appellant has violated his own daughter.<br><br>The testimony of private complainant was unflinching and straightforward.&nbsp; With tears of anguish, she was able to convincingly narrate the ordeal she had been through.&nbsp; No nefarious motive was shown that would have impelled her to testify falsely against her own father.

This extreme penalty is to be imposed when the following circumstances concur, <i>i.e</i>., 1) there is sexual congress without consent; 2) the offender is the father, stepfather, ascendant, guardian or relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree of the victim or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim; and 3) the victim is under eighteen years of age at the time of the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In looking at the attendance of the above conditions the Court has consistently taken an extremely careful stance.&nbsp; With regard, particularly, to the minority of the victim, the Court has belabored the matter on end.<br><br>In <i>People vs. Ernesto Perez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Court reduced the penalty from death to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for the failure of the prosecution to specifically state in the information the age of the victim.&nbsp; The Court deemed the omission to be constitutionally fatal.&nbsp; <i>Perez</i> equated the imposition of the death penalty in the face of such oversight as being a denial of the right of the accused to be informed of the charges so as to adequately prepare him for his defense, a flaw that could not be cured simply by introducing evidence therefor.<br><br>In <i>People vs. Melencio Bali-balita</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the victim, Ella Magdasoc, testified that she was eleven years old, having been born on 12 April 1987, when she was raped by the accused on 26 August 1992.&nbsp; Although no birth certificate or other official document to prove the age of the victim was presented in evidence, the testimony of the victim about her age, however, was corroborated by her half-sister, Miriam Gozum, who declared that, indeed, Ella was eleven years old at the time of the rape.&nbsp; <i>Bali-balita</i> considered the testimony of the two sisters, along with her physical appearance at the time of trial and the fact that no conflicting piece of evidence on her actual age was given that could place the matter in any serious doubt, to be sufficient in establishing the minority of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In <i>People vs. Amado Sandrias Javier</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><i> </i>the lack of objection on the part of the defense pertaining to the age of the victim was held not to exempt the prosecution from presenting the birth certificate of the private complainant upon the premise that the alleged age of the private complainant, at the time of the commission of the offense, was sixteen or just two years shy from the majority age of eighteen.&nbsp; <i>Javier </i>explained that in an "age of modernism," there would hardly be much difference between a sixteen-year old lass and an eighteen-year old girl on physical features and attributes.<br><br><i>People vs. Cula</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>reiterated <i>Javier </i>when this Court lowered the penalty in a case of rape committed on a 16-year old victim on the ground that the prosecution did not present any independent proof of age, such as a birth certificate, and for the failure by the trial court to make a categorical finding on the matter. <i>Cula</i> stressed that it was the burden of the prosecution to prove, with certainty, the fact that the victim was below eighteen years at the time of commission of the rape to justify the imposition of the death penalty, and that the failure of the accused-appellant to there present testimony or proof to the contrary did not exonerate the prosecution from its burden.<br><br><i>People vs. Tipay</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><i> </i>held that the presentation of a birth certificate was not indispensable to prove minority; thus, the minority of a victim who was well below the age of ten, being quite manifest, could enable the court to take judicial notice thereof.&nbsp; <i>Tipay</i> thought to only be crucial years the age range of fifteen to seventeen years where minority might not always be "indubitable."<br><br>In <i>People vs. Tundag</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the victim testified that she was thirteen years old at the time of the rape but later admitted that she did not know exactly when she was born.&nbsp; The manifestation by the prosecution of its inability to secure a copy of the victim's birth certificate, as well as its motion that judicial notice be taken of the fact that the victim was below eighteen years old at that time, was not sanctioned by this Court to be sufficient in establishing the victim's minority.&nbsp; Not even absence of contest from the defense, the Court said, could exempt the prosecution from this burden.&nbsp; <i>Tundag</i> stressed that the minority of the victim should also be proven with equal certainty as the crime itself to justify a conviction of rape in its qualified form.&nbsp; <i>Tundag </i>went on to say that the age of the victim, without qualification, was not a matter of judicial notice, whether mandatory<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> or discretionary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Citing <i>People vs. Rebancos,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and <i>People vs. Vargas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> both of which cases required the presentation of independent proof on the age of private complainants whose ages were said to be nine and ten years old, respectively, at the time of rape, <i>Tundag</i> ruled that the evident tender age of the victim in a crime of rape committed by a relative did not excuse the prosecution from the need to present a birth certificate or, in its absence, an independent piece of evidence, sufficient for the purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The Court here emphasizes that the severity, as well as the irreversible and final nature, of the penalty of death once carried out makes the decision-making process in capital offenses aptly subject to the most exacting rules of procedure and evidence.&nbsp; It is to be recognized that, due to variable circumstances, no two cases are really ever alike that, at times, may easily mislead one to perceive the Court to be giving, <i>albeit</i> inaccurately, vacillating rulings. Relative particularly to the qualifying circumstance of minority of the victim in incestuous rape cases, the Court has consistently adhered to the idea that the victim's minority must not only be specifically alleged in the <b>information </b>but must likewise be established beyond reasonable doubt <b>during</b> trial.&nbsp; Neither the obvious minority of the victim, nor the absence of any contrary assertion from the defense, can exonerate the prosecution from these twin requirements.&nbsp; Judicial notice of the issue of age, without the requisite hearing conducted under Section 3,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Rule 129, of the Rules of Court, would not be considered enough compliance with the law.&nbsp; The birth certificate of the victim or, in lieu thereof, any other documentary evidence, like a baptismal certificate, school records and documents of similar nature, or credible testimonial evidence, that can help establish the age of the victim should be presented.&nbsp; While the declaration of a victim as to her age, being an exception to the hearsay proscription, would be admissible under the rule on pedigree, the question on the relative weight that may be accorded to it is another matter. Corroborative evidence would be most desirable or even essential when circumstances warrant.<br><br>In the instant case, save for the bare testimony of the victim that she was <b>ten years </b>old at the time of the first rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> nothing else could be elicited from the records to ascertain the correct age of the victim.<br><br>In sum, the Court upholds the decision of the trial court convicting Manuel Liban of the crime of rape but must reduce, on account of the insufficiency of proof on the qualifying circumstance of minority of the victim, the penalty of death to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; With respect to the civil liability, the Court sustains the award of P50,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> as civil indemnity and of P10,000.00 as moral damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> but increases the exemplary damages from P10,000.00 to P20,000.00 in consonance with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment of the court <i>a quo</i> finding accused-appellant Manuel Liban, guilty of rape is AFFIRMED but the sentence of death therein imposed by it is reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; The awards of civil liability in favor of the victim are SUSTAINED except for the exemplary damages of P10,000.00 which is hereby increased to P20,000.00.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, Ynares-Santiago,</i> and <i>De Leon, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1] </sup>TSN, Nerissa Liban, 12 August 1997, p. 15.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Exh.
