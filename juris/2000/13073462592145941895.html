				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>The instant Petition for Review seeks to annul the September 9, 1997 
Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in 
CA-G.R. SP No. 40003 dismissing the Petition and affirming the order of 
dismissal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court 
of Quezon City, Branch 218, of Civil Case No. Q-95-24711, on the ground of 
forum-shopping, and the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of 
the Court of Appeals denying petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration.</p>
<p>The relevant antecedent facts are as follows: </p>
<p>On February 23, 1994, petitioners Emmanuel De Vera Motus and Corazon 
Rodriguez Motus filed a Petition for Letters of Administration of the Intestate 
Estate of the late Mariano Peñaverde,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
their alleged uncle, which was docketed as Sp. Proc. No. Q-94-19471. </p>
<p>On August 11, 1995, all the herein petitioners filed a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> against respondents herein, for Annulment 
of Affidavit of Self-Adjudication, Title and Reopening of Distribution of Estate 
with prayer for a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction, which was docketed 
as Civil Case No. Q-95-24711.</p>
<p>The Complaint alleged that petitioners were the nephews and nieces of the 
late Victorina Motus Peñaverde, the wife of Mariano Peñaverde who predeceased 
him. Victorina was the sister of their respective parents. Victorina married 
Mariano Peñaverde on December 29, 1971. During their marriage, the couple 
acquired a five hundred (500) square meter parcel of land located in Quezon 
City, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. RT-61118 of the Register of 
Deeds of Quezon City. The couple had no children. Victorina died on September 2, 
1990 while Mariano died on November 3, 1993. Before his death, more specifically 
on January 29, 1993, Mariano executed an Affidavit of Self-Adjudication, 
averring that he is the sole heir of Victorina and adjudicating to himself 
Victorina's estate, consisting of her share in the subject property. Thereafter, 
Mariano subdivided the land and obtained the corresponding titles for the same. 
Petitioners, as plaintiffs therein, claim that they were deprived of their 
rightful share in Victorina's estate. </p>
<p>Instead of filing an Answer to the Complaint, respondents Bernardita Feranil 
Peñaverde, Marlito F. Peñaverde, Margolfo F. Peñaverde and Marian F. Peñaverde 
filed a Motion to Dismiss and to Declare Plaintiffs in Contempt of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> charging petitioners with forum-shopping. 
Respondents-movants alleged that there are two (2) pending cases before Branch 
222 of the Court, the Petition above-mentioned (Sp. Proc. No. Q-94-19471) and 
Civil Case No. Q-94-19103, a Complaint for recovery of possession and title 
filed by respondents Catalina Peñaverde, Consuelo Peñaverde Calleja and 
Victoriano Peñaverde against the respondents Bernardita Feranil and her 
children, Marian, Marlito and Margolfo. Plaintiffs in that case averred that 
Bernardita Feranil and her children had earlier filed a Complaint for Support 
against Mariano, on the allegation that he sired three children with Bernardita 
Feranil; namely, Marian, Marlito and Margolfo. The parties reached a compromise 
agreement whereby Mariano paid them P32,000.00 and, in turn, they executed a 
written note that upon their receipt of the full payment thereof, they were 
withdrawing their Complaint for Support and would no longer file any claim 
relating thereto. When Mariano fell ill, Bernardita and her children offered to 
take care of him and were allowed to stay in the subject premises. However, 
after Mariano's death, they refused to vacate the subject property or surrender 
the titles thereto which they had, in the meantime, gained possession of. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs therein claimed that they were the only surviving heirs of 
Mariano, as his sister, niece and nephew, respectively. Catalina claimed that 
from the time Mariano's wife, Victorina, died, she had lived with him in the 
subject property but, after Mariano's death, she was driven away therefrom by 
Bernardita and her children.</p>
<p>Petitioners filed their Comment and/or Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, 
arguing that forum-shopping is not applicable as there is no identity of cause 
of action or parties in the three cases. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other respondents filed their Answer to the Complaint. </p>
<p>On December 19, 1995, the lower court issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dismissing Civil Case No. Q-95-24711 on 
the ground of forum-shopping. According to the lower court, all three (3) cases 
revolved around the issue of who should succeed to the properties of the late 
Mariano Peñaverde. Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the 
lower court in its Order dated February 6, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
<p>Undaunted, petitioners brought a petition for <i>certiorari</i> to the Court 
of Appeals which, on September 9, 1997, issued the assailed Decision dismissing 
the Petition, thus affirming the lower court's finding of forum-shopping. </p>
<p>With the denial of their Motion for Reconsideration on October 17, 1997, 
petitioners filed the instant Petition for Review assailing the Court of 
Appeals' finding of forum-shopping. Forum-shopping is "the institution of two 
(2) or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause on the supposition 
that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p>
<p>The two cases filed by petitioners are: (1) Sp. Proc. No. Q-94-19471, which 
seeks letters of administration for the estate of Mariano Peñaverde; and (2) 
Civil Case No. Q-95-24711, which seeks the annulment of the Affidavit of 
Self-Adjudication executed by Mariano Peñaverde and the annulment of titles in 
his name as well as the reopening of the distribution of his estate.</p>
<p>Evidently, in filing Sp. Proc. No. Q-94-19471, petitioners sought to share in 
the estate of Mariano, specifically the subject land previously owned in common 
by Mariano and his wife, Victorina. This is also what they hoped to obtain in 
filing Civil Case No. Q-95-24711. </p>
<p>Indeed, a petition for letters of administration has for its object the 
ultimate distribution and partition of a decedent's estate. This is also 
manifestly sought in Civil Case No. Q-95-24711, which precisely calls for the 
"Reopening of Distribution of Estate" of Mariano Peñaverde. In both cases, 
petitioners would have to prove their right to inherit from the estate of 
Mariano Peñaverde, albeit indirectly, as heirs of Mariano's wife, Victorina. 
</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, petitioners are indeed guilty of forum-shopping. 
When their appointment as judicial administrators of the estate of Mariano in 
Sp. Proc. No. Q-94-19471 was questioned by herein respondent, Bernardita 
Feranil,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> petitioners filed the second 
case, Civil Case No. Q-95-24711, as an alternative remedy, obviously to fortify 
their chances of obtaining a share in the same estate.</p>
<p>In the recent case of Ayala Land. Inc. v. Valisno<b><i>,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> we had the occasion to explain the 
concept of forum-shopping, to wit - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forum-shopping exists when the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> are present 
or where a final judgment in one case will amount to <i>res judicata</i> in 
another (Alejandrino v. Court of Appeals, 295 SCRA 536, 554 [1998]; Philippine 
Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Inc. v. Abiertas House of Friendship, Inc., 
292 SCRA 785, 794 [1998]). In turn, <i>litis pendentia</i> requires the 
concurrence of the following requisites:</p></blockquote>
<ol><li>Identity of parties, or at least such parties as those representing the same 
interests in both actions; <br><br>
</li><li>Identity of rights asserted and reliefs prayed for, the reliefs being 
founded on the same facts; and<br><br>
</li><li>Identity with respect to the two preceding particulars in the two cases, 
such that any judgment that may be rendered in the pending case, regardless of 
which party is successful, would amount to <i>res adjudicata</i> in the other 
case. (Philippine Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Inc. v. Abiertas House of 
Friendship, Inc., supra., at 791; citations omitted. </li></ol>
<blockquote>
<p>As explained by this Court in <i>First Philippine International Bank v. Court 
of Appeals</i> (252 SCRA 259 [1996]), forum-shopping exists where the elements 
of <i>litis pendentia</i> are present, and where a final judgment in one case 
will amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other. Thus, there is forum-shopping 
when, between an action pending before this Court and another one, there exist: 
"a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same 
interests in both actions, b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, 
the relief being founded on the same facts, and c) the identity of the two 
preceding particulars is such that any judgment rendered in the other action, 
will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to <i>res judicata</i> in 
the action under consideration; said requisites also constitutive of the 
requisites for <i>auter action pendant</i> or <i>lis pendens</i>." Another case 
elucidates the consequence of forum-shopping: "[W]here a litigant sues the same 
party against whom another action or actions for the alleged violation of the 
same right and the enforcement of the same relief is/are still pending, the 
defense of <i>litis-pendentia</i> in one case is a bar to the others; and, a 
final judgment in one would constitute <i>res judicata</i> and thus would cause 
the dismissal of the rest." (Prubankers Association v. Prudential Bank &amp; 
Trust Company, 302 SCRA 74, 83-84 [1999].)</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case at bar, it cannot be denied that the parties to Sp. Proc. No. 
Q-94-19471 and Civil Case No. Q-95-24711 are identical. There is also no 
question that the rights asserted by petitioners in both cases are identical, 
<i>i.e.</i>, the right of succession to the estate of their aunt, Victorina, 
wife of Mariano. Likewise, the reliefs prayed for --- to obtain their share in 
the estate of Mariano --- are the same, such relief being founded on the same 
facts ---their relationship to Mariano's deceased wife, Victorina. </p>
<p>Finally, the judgment rendered in the administration proceedings of Mariano's 
estate will amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the action to annul the Affidavit 
of Self-Adjudication and the titles in Mariano's name. In the instant case, 
petitioners' prayer in Civil Case No. Q-95-24711 is for the Affidavit of 
Self-Adjudication of Mariano as well as the resulting titles in Mariano's name 
to be declared null and void. Part of petitioners' prayer is for the subject 
property to be redistributed to the lawful heirs, themselves included. However, 
these reliefs may very well be ventilated in Sp. Proc. No. Q-94-19471, setting 
aside petitioners' fear that with the dismissal of Civil Case No. Q-95-24711, 
they would lose their chance to recover their share in the estate of their aunt, 
Victorina.</p>
<p>We are not unmindful of the rule that while intestate courts may pass upon 
the title to a certain property for the purpose of determining whether the same 
should or should not be included in the inventory, such determination is not 
conclusive and is subject to final decision in a separate action regarding 
ownership which may be constituted by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Such limited jurisdiction of intestate 
courts is not applicable in the case before us, however, considering that 
petitioners are not total strangers to the intestate proceedings but are, in 
fact, claimants in the same as heirs, albeit indirect, of Mariano. </p>
<p>The dismissal of Civil Case No. Q-95-24711 is in order, considering our 
finding that petitioners are guilty of forum shopping. It needs stressing that a 
party is not permitted to pursue simultaneous remedies in two different fora. 
This is a practice which ridicules the judicial process, plays havoc with the 
rules of orderly procedure, and is vexatious and unfair to the other parties to 
the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p>
