Then Guillermo Villafania, Jr. stabbed Angelito, Sr. a number of times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The witness also recounted that he did not notice the presence of any other person at the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant Bernardo Daroy testified that he was in the house of Roberto Palaganas on the evening of January 28, 1993. At around 9:00 p.m., Palaganas went out of the house to buy sardines at the store. When Palaganas returned, he informed them that he saw Angelito, Sr. sprawled on the ground. Because the witness was a barangay kagawad, he immediately went to the place of the incident<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> where he saw the body of Angelito, Sr. being carried by his wife, Virginia, Romeo Ferialde and Juan Ferialde. According to the witness, he was implicated in this case because he was trying to prevent Virginia Angelito (who happened to be his first cousin) and the others from carrying the cadaver of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>On December 15, 1994, the trial court rendered a decision finding five of the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder and acquitting Felipe Villafania on reasonable doubt. The dispositive part of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused Bernardo Daroy alias “Datdo”, Guillermo Villafania, Jr. alias “Jr.”, Gregorio Villafania alias “Greg”, Bernardo Calacsan alias “Mike” and Roger Javillonar guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder attended by the aggravating circumstances of superior strength and nighttime and not offset by any mitigating circumstance, and pursuant to law, each of the accused is sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. The said accused are ordered to pay an indemnity to the heirs of the deceased Philip Angelito, Sr. in the amount of P50,000.00 Further the accused are ordered to pay the widow Virginia Angelito P21,000.00 representing the actual expenses.<br><br>Accused Felipe Villafania is acquitted of the crime charged for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. He is absolved from paying any damages considering that the facts from which his civil liability might arise does not exist.<br><br>SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></blockquote>Hence, this appeal. Accused-appellants contend that-<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF MURDER.</blockquote>The contentions have no merit. The pivotal issue being factual and evidentiary, the credibility of the witnesses assumes extreme importance. Well-entrenched is the tenet that this Court will not interfere with the trial court’s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses, absent any indication or showing that the trial court has overlooked some material facts or gravely abused its discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> As this Court has reiterated often enough, the matter of assigning values to declarations at the witness stand is best and most competently performed or carried out by a trial judge who, unlike appellate magistrates, can weigh such testimony in light of the accused’s behavior, demeanor, conduct and attitude at the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The trial court’s assessment reveals that:<br><blockquote>“xxx xxx.<br><br>The defense of accused Bernardo Calacsan that he was a victim of frame-up and the defense of accused Roger Javillonar that he was included as one of the accused because the prosecution witnesses used to see him going (sic) with Bernardo Daroy attend the pre-wedding arrangement as well as the denial of accused Bernardo Daroy that he participated in the perpetration of the crime for which he was charged are not worthy of belief since the prosecution witnesses, namely: Philip Angelito, Jr., Philvin Angelito and Virginia F. Angelito positively identified them as having stabbed to death on January 28, 1993 at about 10:00 in the evening Philip Angelito, Sr. Besides, the defense of accused Guillermo Villafania, Jr. that he acted in legitimate self-defense is not clearly proven. xxx xxx.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote>After a thorough review and examination of the evidence on hand, we find that the prosecution evidence fully establishes the guilt of the accused-appellants. The trial court, however, erred in appreciating nighttime as an aggravating circumstance for the simple reason that, aside from the fact that it was not alleged in the information, it does not appear that said circumstance was purposely sought by appellants in the commission of the crime. The eyewitnesses, Virginia Angelito, Philips Angelito, Jr. and Philvin Angelito, identified the accused-appellants as the assailants. The eyewitnesses recognized the accused-appellants, having been their neighbors. As stated by the trial court, the prosecution witnesses could not have committed a mistake in pointing to the accused-appellants as the persons who stabbed Philip Angelito, Sr. because the place where the incident happened was illumined by a flashlight held by Virginia Angelito who was, more or less, seven (7) meters away from the accused-appellants.<br><br>Accused-appellants also underscore the alleged conflict in the prosecution witnesses’ account in respect of the weapons used by accused-appellants Guillermo Villafania, Jr., Bernardo Daroy and Gregorio Villafania. Under the circumstances, we are not persuaded by the alleged inconsistencies regarding the weapons used in committing the crime. According to the testimony of the medico-legal officer who conducted the medical examination, the victim sustained six (6) stab wounds which could have been caused by a sharp pointed instrument.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> The stab wounds could have been caused by an ice pick<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> or small bolo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Considering that the five accused-appellants ganged up on Philip Angelito, Sr. and two of the eyewitnesses are minors who are not used to seeing such deadly weapons, the said inconsistencies are minor and immaterial, and do not discredit the testimony of the prosecution witnesses on the material and significant points bearing on accused-appellants’ acts of stabbing the victim to death, in conspiracy with each other. As long as the testimony of the witnesses corroborate each other on material points, the minor inconsistencies therein cannot destroy their credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Inconsistencies on minor details do not undermine the integrity of a prosecution witness. The minor inconsistencies and contradictions in this case only serve to attest to the truthfulness of the witnesses and to the fact that they had not been coached or rehearsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, accused-appellants failed to establish any unworthy or ill motive which induced or impelled the prosecution witnesses to falsely accuse them of committing murder. There is nothing in the record which would lead us to conclude that the prosecution witnesses had any improper motive against accused-appellants. It is settled that where there is no evidence to show any dubious reason or improper motive why a prosecution witness would testify falsely against an accused or falsely implicate him in a heinous crime, the testimony is worthy of full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellants also maintain that there was no conspiracy as the individual act of accused-appellants Roger Javillonar and Bernardo Calacsan in holding the hands of Philip Angelito, Sr. was an equivocal act. Accused-appellants submit that Roger Javillonar and Bernardo Calacsan “…only instinctively held the hands of Philip [Angelito, Sr.] after he fell down to make him stand up again as the natural position of a person on a road is standing up rather than lying down.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> We do not agree. In conspiracy, direct proof of a previous agreement to commit a crime is not necessary. It may be deduced from the mode and manner by which the offense was perpetrated, or inferred from the acts of the accused when such point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action, and community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> In the case at bar, at the time of the aggression, all of the accused-appellants acted in concert, each doing his part to fulfill their common design to kill their victim, and although only three of them stabbed the victim, the act of the three is deemed to be the act of all. Accused-appellant Roger Javillonar held the right hand of the victim and Bernardo Calacsan held the left hand, while the other three (3) accused-appellants Guillermo Villafania, Jr., Gregorio Villafania and Bernardo Daroy stabbed the victim to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>Lastly, accused-appellants contend that Guillermo Villafania, Jr. should be held guilty only of homicide, not murder, because treachery does not exist in the instant case. Accused-appellants assert that “Philip [Angelito, Sr.] was forewarned that being armed and dangerous, people are bound to fight back as Guillermo [Villafania, Jr.] did.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> We are not persuaded. Accused-appellants employed a mode of attack which was deliberately designed to insure the victim’s death without any risk arising from the defense which he could have made. The victim’s hands were both held by two (2) of the assailants while the three (3) others stabbed him, inflicting upon the victim six (6) stab wounds. These facts portray well that the held hands of the victim rendered him defenseless and helpless thereby allowing accused-appellants to commit the crime without risk at all to themselves.<br><br>With regard to the award of damages, we affirm the award of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity for the death of the victim and P21,000.00 as actual damages.
