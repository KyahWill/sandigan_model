				<H3>IN RE: VICENTE Y. BAYANI <br><br>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The case before us arose when Atty. Vicente Y. Bayani failed to 
submit proof of service of the appellantâ€™s brief on the Solicitor 
General in G.R. No. 115079<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the consequent inability of the latter to file the appellee's brief.
<p>On August 09, 1999, the Supreme Court referred Atty. Bayani's 
failure to submit the procedural requirement to the Integrated Bar of 
the Philippines for investigation, report and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
</p><p>On September 27, 1999, IBP Commissioner Victoria Gonzalez-De Los 
Reyes sent a letter to Atty. Bayani requiring him to submit his comment 
within five (5) days from receipt of the letter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
</p><p>However, the letter was returned to the IBP with the notation "Return to Sender-Moved."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
</p><p>Thus, in her report and recommendation dated January 25, 2000, 
Commissioner Gonzalez-De Los Reyes recommended Atty. Bayani's suspension
 as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the undersigned Commissioner recommends 
that Atty. Vicente Bayani, for his violation of Rule 18.03 of the Canon 
18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, be SUSPENDED from the 
practice of the law profession for a period of three (3) months and 
until the time he complies with the Order of the Supreme Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On March 18, 2000, the Board of Governors of the Integrated Bar of 
the Philippines issued a resolution adopting and approving the report 
and recommendation of the investigating commissioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
</p><p>We concur.
</p><p>A lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him as his negligence in connection therewith shall render him liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
</p><p>Atty. Bayani's failure to submit proof of service of appellant's 
brief on the Solicitor General in G. R. No. 115079 and his failure to 
submit the required comment manifest willful disobedience to the lawful 
orders of the Supreme Court, a clear violation of the canons of 
professional ethics.
</p><p>It appears that Atty. Bayani has fallen short of the 
circumspection required of a member of the Bar. A counsel must always 
remember that his actions or omissions are binding on his clients.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> A lawyer owes his client the exercise of utmost prudence and capability in that representation.
</p><p>Further, lawyers are expected to be acquainted with the rudiments
 of law and legal procedure, and anyone who deals with them has the 
right to expect not just a good amount of professional learning and 
competence but also a whole-hearted fealty to his client's cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Court finds Atty. Vicente Y. 
Bayani remiss in his sworn duty to his client, to the Court and the Bar.
 He is thus SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of three (3)
 months and until the time he complies with the Order of the Supreme 
Court to submit the required proof of service in G. R. No. 115079.
</p><p>Let a copy of this decision be entered in the personal records of
 respondent as an attorney and as a member of the Integrated Bar, and 
furnish the Bar Confidant, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, with 
copies thereof and the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts
 in the country.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.
