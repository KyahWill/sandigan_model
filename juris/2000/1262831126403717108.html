Downstairs, Arturo Laus (Erlinda’s father), Hildo Buacon, appellant Arnulfo Quilaton, Diding Manalingping, Avelino Ahao, Arnel Laus, Gerry de Juan, and Pio de Juan were sleeping (p. 11, TSN, March 4, 1985). Buacon, Quilaton, Ahao, Pio de Juan and Mamalingping were laborers in Arturo Laos’ rubber plantation (pp. 3-4, TSN, March 14, 1985).<br><br>"Between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. of the same night, Erlinda was sleeping when she was struck by an ax (p. 14, TSN, March 14, 1985). She shouted at her husband, Carlito, and woke him up (p. 14, TSN, August 20, 1984).<br><br>"Carlito Taping stood up. Erlinda, on the other hand, got a flashlight and, with it, saw her husband push Hildo Buacon and Diding Mamalingping (p. 15, TSN, August 20, 1984).<br><br>"Carlito Taping was hacked by Hildo Buacon on the head (p. 16, TSN, August 20, 1984). Carlito then pushed Buacon and Mam[a]lingping down. The two men fell to the elevated floor portion of the stairs before reaching the ground floor (pp. 18-19, TSN, August 21, 1984).<br><br>"Thereafter, Patricio Quiyo who was downstairs handed a gauge 20 firearm to Buacon (p. 21, TSN, March 14, 1985) who then went upstairs and shot Carlito Taping. The latter was hit [i]n the stomach (p. 20, TSN, August 21, 1984). Erlinda Taping was almost 1 1/2 meters from her husband, and 3 to 4 meters from Buacon at the time of the shooting (p. 21, TSN, August 21, 1984).<br><br>"After the shooting, Buacon gave the gun to Patricio Quiyo (p. 21, TSN, August 21, 1984). Thereafter, these two men with Diding Mamalingping ran out of the house (p. 22, TSN, August 21, 1984).<br><br>"When Erlinda, with Carlito and their children, went downstairs, she saw her father (Arturo Laus) already dead, with a wound on the face just above the nose. Pio de Juan was lying face down on the cemented floor, also dead. Erlinda also saw Arnel Laus wounded on the head, but still alive, as well as Gerry de Juan who was likewise wounded (pp. 22-25, TSN, August 21, 1984). Carlito saw appellant Quilaton come out from under the bed (p. 8, TSN, January 4, 1984).<br><br>"Erlinda brought Arnel Laus and Carlito Taping to the Brokenshine Hospital. She did not bring Gerry de Juan along since she thought he was already dead (p. 26, TSN, August 21, 1984).<br><br>"De Juan was brought to the Madonna Hospital. It was appellant who paid for his hospitalization (pp. 26-28, TSN, August 21, 1984)."<br></blockquote><center><b><i><u>Version of the Defense</u></i></b><br></center><br>In his Brief, appellant submits the following statement of facts:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><blockquote>"On August 9, 1980 at Barangay Kauswagan, Magpet, North Cotabato, a group of malefactors attacked/assaulted the occupants of a house and committed the following crimes: double murder and triple frustrated murder.<br><br>"It was established that these persons were also occupants of the house that night and were sleeping there being workers/laborers, and in the case of Arnulfo Quilaton, a houseboy, 16 years of age.<br><br>"The victims of the crimes were ARTURO LAUS and PIO DE JUAN who were killed[;] JERRY DE JUAN, ARNEL LAUS and CARLITO TAPING, Arturo Laus’ son-in-law were seriously injured.<br><br>"Accused of the crimes were: PATRICIO QUIYO, DIDING MAMALINGPING, AVELINO AHAO, HILDO BUACON and ARNULFO QUILATON alias ARNOLD.<br><br>"It was also established that in the afternoon of that day there was a drinking spree in the rubber plantation attended by the accused. But while Buacon declared that Arnulfo Quilaton was with the group, this was denied by Avelino Ahao, who omitted Arnulfo’s name in his testimony, but Carlito Taping, principal witness and offended party declared that Quilaton was not a participant in the spree, confirmed by Quilaton himself when he testified in his behalf. There is therefore serious doubt as to the participation of ARNULFO QUILATON in the conspiracy, thus he can not legally be responsible for the acts of his co-accused, especially [since] it is a basic rule of evidence that conspiracy must be proved like the crime itself beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>"Carlito Taping who was seriously injured during the incident was first treated at Sto. Niño Hospital in Makilala town but was transferred to the Brokenshire Hospital in Davao City.<br><br>"The prosecution’s Offer of Evidence/Exhibits will show that no doctor was presented, but the medical certificates of the wounded were identified by Carlito Taping and/or Erlinda Laus Taping.<br><br>"From the evidence adduced, it appears that the MOTIVE for the crimes committed were (1) tenancy disputes and (2) [the allegation that] Carlito Taping x x x boxed Patricio Quiyo in the presence of the Barangay Captain, Jesus Kionisala."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>The trial court summarized appellant’s testimony in this wise:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><blockquote>"ARNULFO QUILATON testifying in his behalf declared that he is 29 years old, married, farmer, a resident of Kauswagan, Magpet, Cotabato. That on 9 August 1980, he was in the house of his employer Arturo Laos. He denied having planned and participated in the killing of Laos and Pio de Juan. He admitted having struck Jerry de Juan believing that he was a bad man. The house of Arturo Laos is a two (2) storey [structure;] the upper portion is occupied by the Taping family, while the lower portion is occupied by Arturo Laos, Pio de Juan, Jerry de Juan and Arnel Laos. He denied having knowledge of the plan to kill Laos and de Juan as he was at the time in his employer’s house."<br></blockquote><br><center><b><u>Ruling of the Trial Court</u></b><br></center><br>In convicting the accused, the trial court explained:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><blockquote>"From the mass of evidence, the prosecution has established the identity of the accused Hildo Buacon, Avelino Ahao and Arnulfo Quilaton as the perpetrators of the crime.

Moreover, Carlito subsequently declared that, to his knowledge, appellant <i>did not participate</i> in the crime. In an affidavit dated May 23, 1994, he averred:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><blockquote>"That I very well know Arnulfo Quilaton alias Arnold, he having grown up in our family and that I very well know and am convinced that he had nothing to do and was totally innocent of the gory and tragic incident that happened to our family on August 9, 1990 at nighttime;<br><br>"That I and my witnesses did not see or notice any participation or involvement of Arnulfo Quilaton relative to the crime, and as a matter of fact he assisted and accompanied me in going to the hospital, first [to] Sto. Nino, Makilala, Cotabato and later to the Brokenshire Hospital in Davao City; that I know him to be trustworthy and of good moral character."</blockquote><b><i><u>Proof of Conspiracy</u></i></b><br><br>Citing the testimonies of Erlinda and Carlito, the trial court nonetheless convicted appellant on the basis of his alleged conspiracy with the other accused.<br><br>We disagree. The well-settled rule is that conspiracy must be proven as clearly as the commission of the offense itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> True, direct proof is not essential, because conspiracy may be inferred from the conduct of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime, showing that they had acted with a common purpose and design.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Clearly, however, the prosecution failed to prove the elements of conspiracy. There was no evidence that appellant aided the other accused or that he participated in their criminal design. Conspiracy was not implied by his mere presence at the crime scene,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> which could be explained by the fact that as an employee of the deceased, he had been told to sleep there. In fact, the two eyewitnesses saw him only <i>after</i> the incident.<br><br>The testimonies given to implicate appellant indicated only that he was seen coming out of hiding after the other accused had fled. There was nothing abnormal or sinister about his conduct. That he hid while the killing was being committed was not a crime. Some may damn him for cowardice but, just the same, the act of hiding did not prove participation or conspiracy in the crime.<br><br>Furthermore, appellant himself assisted Carlito Taping in bringing the wounded to the hospital that night. While this act did not necessarily prove that he was innocent, it nonetheless strengthened his contention that he had no part in the criminal design.<br><br><b><i><u>Testimonies of the Other Accused<br>Failed to Implicate Appellant</u></i></b><br><br>Noteworthy is the fact that not one of the other accused, after having admitted their participation in the crime, implicated herein appellant.

That alleged admission, by itself, did not show beyond reasonable doubt that appellant was part of the conspiracy. He himself explained that he thought he was hitting one of the "bad men." His explanation must be viewed in the light of the chaos that characterized the night. As testified to by the other accused, there were four attackers. It was dark and forbidding. It was not surprising that someone who was not a part of the conspiracy was confused and unable to think rationally. That appellant immediately concluded that the person he had hit was one of the attackers was not farfetched. To repeat, no other act was imputed to him. Verily, the circumstance cited by the solicitor general fails to produce moral certainty that appellant was part of the conspiracy.<br><br>In the present case, we are convinced that the prosecution evidence failed to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence.
