				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 95, Quezon City, finding accused-appellant Eric Baid y Ominta guilty of the crime of rape against Nieva Garcia y Saban, a mental patient, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay the victim the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br>The information against accused-appellant, based on the complaint filed by the offended woman and her mother, alleged -<br><blockquote>That on or about the 22nd day of December 1996, in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused by means of force and intimidation, to wit: by then and there [willfully], unlawfully and feloniously undressing one NIEVA GARCIA y SABAN, a mental patient suffering [from] schizophrenia and put himself on top of her, and thereafter have carnal knowledge with the undersigned complainant against her will and without her consent.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>When arraigned, accused-appellant entered a plea of not guilty, whereupon trial of the case on the merits proceeded.<br><br>The prosecution presented three witnesses, namely, the complainant, Dr. Herminigilda Salangad, the complainant's attending psychiatrist, and Dr. Emmanuel Reyes, the medico-legal officer who examined the complainant.<br><br>Complainant is a 27-year old single woman, who was diagnosed as having suffered from schizophrenia since 1988. In December 1996, she was confined at the Holy Spirit Clinic in Cubao, Quezon City because of a relapse of her mental condition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> On the other hand, accused-appellant was a nurse-aide of said clinic.<br><br>On December 22, 1996, at around 3 a.m., accused-appellant sneaked into the patients' room. He woke the complainant up and offered her a cigarette, at the same time touching her foot. Complainant took the cigarette. As she smoked it, accused-appellant caressed her. Apparently, she was aroused, because she afterward removed her pants. It turned out she was not wearing any underwear. Accused-appellant also removed his pants and the two had sexual intercourse. Afterwards, they transferred under the bed and continued their sexual intercourse. Complainant said she felt accused-appellant had an orgasm. A female patient who had been awakened tried to separate the two, and, as she failed to do so, she went out to call the two nurses on duty. The nurses responded but, when they arrived, accused-appellant had left, while complainant had already put on her pants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Complainant was brought later during the day before Dr. Emmanuel Reyes for medico-legal examination. She told him what happened. Dr. Reyes reduced her narration of the incident into writing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and then gave her a physical examination. His report stated:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><blockquote>FINDINGS:<br><br><u>GENERAL AND EXTRAGENITAL:</u><br><br>Fairly developed, and coherent female subject. Breasts are hemispherical with pale brown areola and nipples from which secretions could be pressed. Abdomen is flabby and soft.<br><br><u>GENITAL:</u><br><br>There is moderate growth of pubic hair. Labia majora are full, convex and coaptated with the pale brown labia minora presenting in between. On separating the same disclosed an abraided posterior fourchette and an elastic, fleshy-type hymen with deep healed lacerations at 3, 6 and 9 o'clock. External vaginal orifice offers moderate resistance to the introduction of the examining finger and the virgin-sized speculum. Vaginal canal is wide with flattened rugosities. Cervix is normal in size, color and consistency.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CONCLUSION:</span><br><br>Subject is in non-virgin state physically.<br><br>There are no external signs of application of any form of violence.<br><br>REMARKS:<br><br>Vaginal and peri-urethral smears are negative for gram negative diplococci and for spermatozoa.</blockquote>Dr. Reyes said the fresh abrasion, located at 6 o'clock posterior of the complainant's genitalia, could have been recently caused by a hard blunt object, such as an erect penis during sexual intercourse, or by the insertion of a finger. Dr. Reyes found that complainant was suffering from mental illness and that she had lapses in the course of her interview.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant testified in his behalf. He stated that he had been a nurse-aide of the Holy Spirit Clinic since September 18, 1995. His job was to watch the patients, especially when they become violent. He also fetched them from their homes. He admitted that he knew the complainant but claimed he did not know the reason for her confinement. He denied the allegations against him. He testified that, on the date and time referred to by the complainant, he was asleep in the nurse-aide quarters located about ten meters from the room where complainant was staying. He admitted, however, that to go to the patients' room, he did not have to pass by the nurses' station. He said he knew that, at the time in question, there were two nurses on duty and ten patients in the room. He described the patients' room as having an area of about eight by five square meters with wooden beds arranged one foot apart from each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant was questioned by the trial court. He testified that on December 22, 1996, he was on duty from 4 p.m. to 12 midnight. He was a stay-in nurse-aide of the clinic. He stated that the clinic consisted of two floors and five rooms. The room where complainant and the other patients were staying and his quarters were both on the ground floor of the building. He admitted that the clinic was for the mentally ill and that, as a nurse-aide, he was supposed to know the status of every patient and his job was to watch them and pacify them whenever they become violent. He said he was very well acquainted with the behavior of the patients considering the length of time he had been working in the clinic. He claimed, however, that he did not specifically know from what ailment complainant was suffering, but only that she was undergoing treatment because of mental deficiency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, accused-appellant admitted that he knew it was prohibited to give cigarettes to patients. He further admitted that, as a nurse-aide, he could enter the patients' room anytime to check their condition and see to it that the lights were turned off when they were not needed. He further stated that he was not investigated by the police when he was invited to their headquarters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On June 20, 1997, the trial court rendered its decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused Eric Baid y Ominta GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape defined in and penalized by Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Rep. Act 7659, and hereby sentences the said accused to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua. The accused is further ordered to indemnify the victim Nieva Garcia y Saban the amount of P50,000.00, as moral damages.<br><br>IT IS SO ORDERED.</blockquote>Accused-appellant contends that the trial court erred in convicting him of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Complainant is suffering from schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder of unknown etiology, characterized by disturbance in thinking involving a distortion of the usual logical relations between ideas, a separation between the intellect and the emotions so that the patient's feelings and his or her manifestations seem inappropriate to his or her life situation, and a reduced tolerance for the stress of interpersonal relations so that the patient retreats from social intercourse into his or her own fantasy life and commonly into delusions and hallucinations, and may, when untreated or unsuccessfully treated, go on to marked deterioration or regression in his or her behavior though often unaccompanied by further intellectual loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The following are the symptoms of schizophrenia:<br><ol type="A"><li><i>Characteristic symptoms:</i> Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated):<br><br>(1) delusions<br><br>(2) hallucinations<br><br>(3) disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence)<br><br>(4) grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior<br><br>(5) negative symptoms, i.e., affective flattening, alogia, or avolition<br><br>Note: Only one criterion A symptom is required if delusions are bizarre or hallucinations consist of a voice keeping up a running commentary on the person's behavior or thoughts, or two or more voices conversing with each other.<br><br></li><li><i>Social/occupational dysfunction:</i> For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, one or more major areas of functioning such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational achievement).<br><br></li><li><i>Duration:</i> Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet criterion A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or two or more symptoms listed in criterion A present in an attentuated form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).<br><br></li><li><i>Schizoaffective and mood disorder exclusion:</i> Schizoaffective disorder and mood disorder with features have been ruled out because either (1) no major depressive, manic, or mixed episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms; or (2) if mood symptoms, their total duration has been brief relative to the duration of the active and residual periods.<br><br></li><li><i>Substance/general medical condition exclusion:</i> The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.<br><br></li><li><i>Relationship to a pervasive developmental disorder: </i>If there is a history of autistic disorder or another pervasive developmental disorder, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present for at least a month (or less if successfully treated).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></li></ol>Schizophrenia is classified into five subtypes, namely, paranoid, disorganized (hebephrenic), catatonic, undifferentiated, and residual.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Dr. Herminigilda Salangad, the complainant's attending psychiatrist and consultant at the Medical Center in Muntinlupa, the Perpetual Help Medical Center, the Philippine National Police, and the Holy Spirit Clinic, was presented as an expert witness. According to her, complainant was, at the time of the incident, suffering from an undifferentiated type of schizophrenia, described as having the characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia but does not fit the profile for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic schizophrenia. Dr. Salangad stated that complainant seemed to shift from one type of schizophrenia to another. Complainant was catatonic when she first treated her, a situation where the patient shows waxy flexibility (e.g., when a limb is repositioned, that limb remains in that position for a prolonged period of time as if the patient is made of wax), mutism or agitation, and the patient mimics words and actions during examination. Later, complainant became paranoid, i.e., suspicious, hostile and aggressive. She also manifested a behavior where she mumbled and smiled to herself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>It is contended that as complainant is a schizophrenic, her testimony should not have been given credence by the trial court. It is argued that: (1) there were serious inconsistencies between her sworn statement and her testimony in court; (2) the prosecution failed to present witnesses to corroborate her testimony; (3) complainant failed to identify accused-appellant; (4) the results of the medico-legal examination were negative for spermatozoa; (5) the healed lacerations showed that complainant had sexual intercourse seven days before the alleged incident; and (6) the probability was that her allegations of rape were merely a product of her fantasy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>We disagree.<br><br>Notwithstanding her mental illness, complainant showed that she was qualified to be a witness, i.e., she could perceive and was capable of making known her perceptions to others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Her testimony indicates that she could understand questions particularly relating to the incident and could give responsive answers to them.

When complainant testified, she stated that, aside from the fact that accused-appellant had sexual intercourse with her on her bed, he made her transfer later under the bed. Be that as it may, complainant has consistently established in all of her statements that he had sexual intercourse with her on her bed. Whether or not he had sex with her near the window and while facing him is of no moment and does not negate the finding of rape. Whatever may be the inconsistencies in her testimony, they are minor and inconsequential.

However, he cannot do this now as he did not raise any objection to Dr. Salangad's qualifications in the trial court. On the contrary, he even cross-examined her on the matters on which she testified. In accordance with Rule 132, §36, objections not timely raised are deemed waived.<br><br>The fact that Dr. Salangad was hired by the family of complainant to give expert testimony as a psychiatrist did not by that fact alone make her a biased witness and her testimony unworthy of consideration. As has been said:<br><blockquote>. . . Although courts are not ordinarily bound by expert testimonies, they may place whatever weight they choose upon such testimonies in accordance with the facts of the case. The relative weight and sufficiency of expert testimony is peculiarly within the province of the trial court to decide, considering the ability and character of the witness, his actions upon the witness stand, the weight and process of the reasoning by which he has supported his opinion, his possible bias in favor of the side for whom he testifies, the fact that he is a paid witness, the relative opportunities for study and observation of the matters about which he testifies, and any other matters which deserve to illuminate his statements. The opinion of the expert may not be arbitrarily rejected; it is to be considered by the court in view of all the facts and circumstances in the case and when common knowledge utterly fails, the expert opinion may be given controlling effect (20 Am. Jur., 1056-1058). The problem of the credibility of the expert witness and the evaluation of his testimony is left to the discretion of the trial court whose ruling thereupon is not reviewable in the absence of an abuse of that discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote>It has not been shown in this case that the trial court abused its discretion in appreciating the testimony of Dr. Salangad so as to justify setting aside its findings.<br><blockquote>Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, provides:<br><br><i>ART. 335. When and how rape is committed. </i>- Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances.<br><br>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By using force or intimidation;<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br><br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<br><br>The crime of rape shall be punished by reclusion perpetua.<br><br>. . . .<br></blockquote>To warrant a conviction for rape under paragraph (2) of Art. 335, a woman need not be proven as completely insane or deprived of reason. The phrase "deprived of reason" has been construed to include those suffering from mental abnormality or deficiency or some form of mental retardation, those who are feebleminded although coherent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>That the complainant was suffering from schizophrenia at the time of the rape is shown by the fact that she was in the clinic precisely because of such illness and by her behavior at the trial, during which she would smile for no reason at all while answering the questions. Though she may not have totally lost her memory, it was shown that she was suffering from an impairment of judgment, which made her incapable of giving, an intelligent consent to the sexual act. It has been held that where the rape victim is feeble-minded, the force required by the statute is the sexual act itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Even assuming then that the complainant consented to have sexual intercourse with accused-appellant, the copulation would fall under the third paragraph of Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code in view of the fact that complainant was mentally ill. Sexual intercourse with an insane, deranged, or mentally deficient, feebleminded, or idiotic woman is rape, pure and simple.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>At any rate, complainant said in her sworn statement that she was afraid of accused-appellant because of the nature of his job as a nurse-aid. Thus she stated:<br><blockquote>28.&nbsp; Tanong : Ikaw ba ay natatakot kay Eric?<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Sagot : Kaunti lang, dahil sa trabaho niya.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></div></blockquote><br>As Dr. Salangad explained:<br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

He claimed that, at the time of the incident, he was in his quarters at the Holy Spirit Clinic sleeping. For the defense of alibi to be believed, the following requisites must be met: (a) his presence at another place at the time of the perpetration of the offense must be proven; and (b) it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant's testimony itself demonstrates the untenability of his alibi. First, his declaration that he was in another room of the clinic is uncorroborated. Second, the room in which he said he was sleeping at that time of the incident was only a few meters away from the patients' room where complainant was confined. Third, he admitted that, as a nurse-aide, he was allowed to enter the patients' room anytime for purposes of checking on the patients. Above all, his alibi cannot be given credence because complainant has pointed to him as the culprit of the rape. In cases in which the accused-appellant was identified by the victim herself who harbored no ill motive against him, the defense of alibi was rejected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The trial court correctly awarded moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00, in accordance with our recent rulings that moral damages may be awarded in rape cases without any need of proof of moral suffering. However, in addition, civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00 should have been awarded the complainant consistent with the ruling that rape victims are entitled to such an award without need of proof except the fact of the commission of the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> On the other hand, the plea of the prosecution that the indemnity should be raised to P75,000.00 cannot be granted because such amount is awarded only in cases of qualified rape. In this case, there were no qualifying circumstances raising the penalty to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>WHEREFORE, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 95, Quezon City is AFFIRMED with the modification that, in addition to the award of P50,000.00 for moral damages made by the trial court, complainant should be indemnified in the amount of P50,000.00.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Quisumbing, Buena,</i> and <i>De Leon, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Bellosillo, J., </i>(Chairman), on leave.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Per Judge Diosdado Madarang Peralta.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Rollo, pp. 12-13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> TSN (Dr. Salangad), pp. 5, 12, April 23, 1997.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> TSN (Nieva Garcia), pp. 4-9, April 10, 1997; TSN (Nieva Garcia), p. 3, April 27, 1997; Exhibit D; Records, pp. 5-6.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Exhibit B-2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Exhibit A.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> TSN (Dr. E.
