				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In the early morning of February 8, 1990, a group of men arrived at the residence of Julianito Luna y Tagle, Barangay Captain of Namunga, Rosario, Batangas. One of two men who introduced themselves as policemen allegedly looking for a certain Hernandez suddenly shot Julianito in the head with a .45 caliber pistol and immediately after, they sped away in an owner-type jeep.<br><br>Accused-appellant Elberto Base was among those identified on board the jeep and, together with Conrado Guno, Frederick Lazaro and Eduardo Patrocinio, were indicted for Murder with Direct Assault Upon a Person in Authority in a Second Amended Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> alleging that -<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 8th day of February 1990, at about 7:00 o'clock in the morning, in Barangay Namunga, Municipality of Rosario, Province of Batangas, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above named accused, armed with a caliber .38 revolver and .45 caliber pistol, conspiring and confederating together, acting in common accord and mutually helping one another, with treachery and evident premeditation and by means of a motor vehicle which is a top down owner type jeep colored green with Plate No. UV-CFU-178, and without justifiable cause, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot with the said .45 caliber pistol, suddenly and without warning, one Julianito Luna y Tagle known to them to be an elected Barangay Captain (<i>Punong Barangay</i>) of the said Municipality while in the performance of his official duties or on the occasion thereof, or in connection therewith, thereby inflicting upon the latter [a] gun shot wound, 1x1 cm., left temporal region, 2 cm. above the left ear, entry with contusion collar, inwards, upwards and backwards, with exit at right occipital region and with avulsion of brain, complete fracture of skull, which directly caused his death.<br><br>Contrary to law.</blockquote><br>Upon arraignment, accused Elberto Base and Conrado Guno pleaded not guilty<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> to the crime charged. Frederick Lazaro and Eduardo Patrocinio have remained at large.<br><br>Trial thereafter ensued after which the court <i>a quo </i>rendered judgment, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court finds accused Elberto Base guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder, and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua; </i>to indemnify the heirs of the deceased 50,000.00 for the death of Julianito Luna; the total sum of P40,000.00 as actual damages; and the amount of P100,000.00, by way of moral damages.<br><br>It appearing that accused Elberto Base is a detention prisoner, the preventive imprisonment he had undergone should be taken into consideration in the computation of his sentence. <br><br>And for failure on the part of the prosecution to prove the guilt of accused Conrado Guno beyond reasonable doubt of the charge against him in the Information, he is hereby ACQUITTED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>Dissatisfied, accused Elberto Base interposed this appeal alleging that -<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT ELBERTO BASE OF THE CRIME OF MURDER ON THE BASIS OF HIS ALLEGED EXTRA-JUDICIAL CONFESSION DESPITE ITS INADMISSIBILITY.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF [THE] CRIME OF MURDER.</blockquote><br>The prosecution's version of the incident adopted the trial court's factual narration of what transpired thus:<br><br><blockquote>xxx around 7:00 o'clock in the morning of February 8, 1990 three men arrived in the residence of Julianito Luna in Namunga, Rosario, Batangas. One was identified to be called Apple who knocked at the door and the person who accompanied his two other companions. After Apple left, Julianito Luna who was the Barangay Captain of the place together with his wife and son Arvin went out and Julianito Luna talked with the two men who introduced themselves as policemen and were looking for one Hernandez.<br><br>Julianito told the two men that he did not know the man they were looking for and told Arvin to accompany the two men to one Ka Prado. At that juncture the man armed with a .45 pistol shot Julianito once hitting the latter on his head and Julianito sprawled on the ground.<br><br>After the shooting the two men ran towards their top down owner jeep colored green parked on the National Highway in front of the residence of Julianito Luna and thereafter sped away towards the direction of the Poblacion of Ibaan, Batangas. <br><br>Julianito Luna was rushed to a local hospital in Rosario, Batangas who was given first aid and at a time when he was about to be brought to Manila, he expired due to a gun shot wound, 1 x 1 cm. left temporal region, 2 cm. above the left ear, entry with contusion collar, inwards, upwards and backwards, with exit at right occipital region and with avulsion of brain complete fracture of skull, which directly caused his death.<br><br>Early reports having reached the 217th PC Co. in Masaya, Rosario, Batangas a team of PC and Police elements was immediately dispatched to track down the assassins of Julianito Luna and in due time the motor vehicle of the assassins was recovered in the premises of the house of Mrs. Amelia Quizon in Barangay Lodlod, Lipa City already parked but without the assassins.<br><br>The motor vehicle was brought to the camp of the 217th PC Co., but was immediately returned to the place based upon a notion that the assassins would come back to the place to recover the same vehicle.<br><br>As expected, not long thereafter Elberto Base one of the accused arrived in the premises of the house of Mrs. Amelia Quizon in order to recover the top down owner type jeep and it was then when he was collared by a team of PC soldiers who were all in civilian clothes and brought to the camp together with the motor vehicle.<br><br>In the camp in a line-up of several people Elberto Base was positively identified by Amelia Quizon as one of the passengers of the jeep who parked the jeep in her premises and also the person who tried to recover the jeep when he was finally collared by the PC soldiers. What made her so remember Base is the scar on the face of the latter.<br><br>It was also established that before the vehicle in question was brought to Lodlod, Lipa City by the assassins, the latter passed by the house of the brother of Leo Vale in San Jose, Batangas, and because the brother of Leo Vale was not there, Leo Vale was requested by the passengers of the jeep to accompany them to the house of the husband of Amelia Quizon in Lodlod, Lipa City, to which request Leo Vale acceded.<br><br>And in a line-up of several people Leo Vale positively identified accused Elberto Base as one of the passengers of the jeep whom he accompanied to Lodlod, Lipa City, and which identification he reiterated when he testified in Court. He also identified the subject vehicle, which the passengers boarded and left in the premises of the residence of Amelia Quizon. <br><br>The owner of the jeep involved with Plate No. UV-CPU-170 which the assassins used was established to be that of Loreto Angeles of Parañaque, Metro Manila. It was established that on February 7, 1990 accused Frederick Lazaro known to him as a policemen of Parañaque together with accused Eduardo Patrocinio borrowed from him the said vehicle telling him that he was going to Carmen, Pangasinan, to which request he acceded and promising him to return said jeep the following day.<br><br>While in the camp of the 217th PC Company Elberto Base executed a written Sworn Statement with the assistance and presence of Atty. Romeo Reyes of Rosario, Batangas, who testified in court, to the effect that he assisted the accused in the execution of his statement, by telling Elberto Base of his constitutional rights before said execution. He further testified that throughout the proceedings he was present and the accused read the contents of his statement before swearing to the truth of the same.<br><br>A perusal of the statement of Elberto Base shows that he was well aware of the intended plot to kill Julianito Luna, by admitting that a week before the killing he was with the assassins surveiling the residence of Julianito Luna.<br><br>He also admitted to be with accused Frederick Lazaro and Patrocinio when the jeep in question was borrowed by the two and was with accused Lazaro and Patrocinio when they left Kalayaan, Pasay City in proceeding to San Juan, Batangas that day when Julianito Luna was shot.<br><br>Accused Base also admitted that he was left on a shed in Ibaan, Batangas when Frederick Lazaro and Patrocinio returned to Rosario and when they came back, he was fetched and was with them in going to San Jose, Batangas in the house of one June Vale and later on in Barangay Lodlod, Lipa City where they left the jeep in the premises of the house of Amelia Quizon. And finally Base admitted in his statement that he was told to recover the jeep in Lodlod, Lipa City.</blockquote><br>Accused-appellant denied having anything to do with the fatal shooting of the victim and alleges, in sum, that he was tortured to admit the crime. As culled from his testimony, at around 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. in the afternoon of February 8, 1990, he had just disembarked at the bus stop at Mataas na Lupa, Lipa City after visiting his uncle Mauro Espina, his sister-in-law Perla Ronquillo and Opring Espina in Maricaban, Pasay City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> From there, he intended to proceed on board a jeepney to the terminal near the market in Lipa City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Xsc<br><br>However, he never reached his destination because he was picked up by three armed men in civilian clothes who told him to come along with them as they would ask him some questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> He was brought to Lodlod, Lipa City at the house of Amelia Quizon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Upon their arrival at Quizon's place, a gun was poked at accused-appellant and he was ordered to lie down facing the ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> As he lay thus, he was trussed up at the neck, bound hand and foot with<i> abaca </i>rope with his hands tied behind his back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> He was then loaded on a top down jeep and brought to the 217th PC Company Detachment in Rosario, Batangas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Upon their arrival at the PC Detachment, accused-appellant was brought to the CAFGU barracks and there he was mauled, pounded with gun barrels and gun butts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> by fifteen (15) persons<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and forced to admit to the shooting of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> As a result of the mauling, his lips bled and he broke a tooth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> To underscore just how tightly his captors bound him, accused-appellant likewise showed the court <i>a quo </i>a scar on his left arm allegedly caused by the tying of the rope.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>As his lips bled because of the beating, accused wiped it across the leg of his trousers pointing to a dark stain on the left leg of his pants he was wearing in court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which was allegedly caused by brushing his bloodied lips thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> After wiping his bloodied mouth, the physical abuse continued despite accused's entreaties and protestations as to why he was being beaten up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> He even informed them that he was a Barangay Council member, to no avail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> After he was manhandled, he was interrogated by Sgt. Romulo Mercado who sat by a typewriter and took down his statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant, however, claimed that although Sgt. Mercado asked him questions, the latter did not take down accused's real answers and instead the said investigator typed what he wanted to type therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Accused further testified that he was not given any opportunity to read in whole or in part the typewritten statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and that it was only upon arrraignment that he came to know that the written statement taken from him which he was forced to sign was actually a confession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <br><br>With regard to the manner in which the custodial interrogation was conducted and the Sworn Statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> was executed, accused-appellant testified that his pleas to his interrogators that they observe his constitutional rights went unheeded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> He likewise claimed that although the sworn statement bore the attesting signature of Atty. Romeo Reyes, he neither knew nor saw Atty. Reyes at the 217th PC Detachment on February 8, 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Accused-appellant denied thet he knew his co-accused Conrado Guno, Frederick Lazaro and Eduardo Patrocinio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> He likewise denied knowing Leo Valle and Erlinda Angeles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The crux of accused-appellant's appeal hinges on the admissibility of the Sworn Statement dated February 8, 1990. In challenging its probative value, he insists in sum that the document is inadmissible in evidence because it was executed in violation of his constitutional rights, firstly his right to counsel of his own choice.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>Section 12, Article III of the Constitution embodies the mandatory safeguards afforded a person under investigation for the commission of a crime and the concomitant duty of the State and its agencies to enforce such mandate. It declares that:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 12. (1). Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice. If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one. These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel.<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="top" width="8%"><div align="left">(1)</div></td> <td width="92%"><div align="justify">No torture, force, violence, threat, intimidation or any other means which vitiate the free will shall be used<br> against him.

If the rule were otherwise, then, the tempo of a custodial investigation will be solely in the hands of the accused who can impede, nay, obstruct the progress of the interrogation by simply selecting a lawyer who for one reason or another, is not available to protect his interest. This absurd scenario could not have been contemplated by the framers of the charter.</blockquote><br>While the initial choice in cases where a person under custodial investigation cannot afford the services of a lawyer is naturally lodged in the police investigators, the accused really has the <i>final choice</i> as he may reject the counsel chosen for him and ask for another one. A lawyer provided by the investigators is deemed engaged by the accused where he never raised any objection against the former's appointment during the course of the investigation and the accused thereafter subscribes to the veracity of his statement before the swearing officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Verily, to be an effective counsel "[a] lawyer need not challenge all the questions being propounded to his client. The presence of a lawyer is not intended to stop an accused from saying anything which might incriminate him but, rather, it was adopted in our Constitution to preclude the slightest coercion as would lead the accused to admit something false.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The counsel, however, <i>should never prevent an accused from freely and voluntarily telling the truth.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>A circumspect scrutiny of the records leaves this Court unconvinced of accused-appellant's claim that he was not adequately assisted by counsel during his custodial interrogation.

Reyes' participation during the custodial investigation of accused was anything but perfunctory. Much less could it be argued that he was remiss in his duties to assist the accused. On the contrary, they in fact underscore his active participation in the proceedings. <br><br>To support his claim that his sworn statement was irregularly taken, accused-appellant further insists that the same was obtained through force and paints a graphic picture of torture at the hands of fifteen persons who repeatedly beat him up with gun barrels and butts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> as a result of which he allegedly lost a tooth and sustained contusions, a busted mouth and broken bones at his back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>We remain unpersuaded.<br><br>For all accused-appellant's protestations to the contrary, his tale of coercion and torture in the hands of his interrogators taxes credulity <i>vis-à-vis </i>his testimonial declarations that despite supposedly being severely mauled and sustaining injuries as a result thereof he did not: 1.] complain to the senior officer of his interrogators about how he was treated during his custodial investigation;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> 2.] tell his wife of his injuries when she arrived the next day nor did he ask her to take him to a hospital for treatment;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> 3.] inform his lawyer of the alleged injuries he sustained at the hands of his interrogators although he had several opportunities to do so;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> 4.] inform his lawyer that he was forced to sign the sworn statement;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> 5.] present any medical certificate to prove the existence of his alleged injuries. Topping accused-appellant's incredible tale of torture is his almost two-year silence on the incident which only came to light when he testified in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Accused-appellant explains away these lapses as the products of his `fear' of his interrogators.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> However, his failure to speak up and disclose his fear at the earliest opportunity subjects to serious doubt the reality and substance of that supposed fear.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Along the same vein, accused-appellant's unsupported claims of physical abuse in the hands of his interrogators simply ring hollow in the absence of other proof to corroborate them. Indeed - Sccalr<br><br><blockquote>"... bare assertions of maltreatment by the police authorities in extracting confessions from the accused are not sufficient in view of the standing rule enunciated in the cases of <i>People v.

Settled is the rule that evidence, to be believed, must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness, but must be credible in itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Suffice it to state in this regard that such circumstances narrated by accused-appellant only tends to underscore the incongruity of his tale of torture. Calrsc<br><br>A circumspect scrutiny of accused-appellant's <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></i>clearly shows how he and his co-accused planned the killing of the deceased as well as the sequence of events before and after the occurrence of the incident. These events could not have been supplied either any of those interviewed by the peace officers or by the peace officers themselves because the said statement is replete with details which only one who has an intricate knowledge thereof can supply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Verily -<br><br><blockquote>"It remains only to note that the extrajudicial statements of Romeo Jabil and Rufo Llenarasas are replete with details and they corroborate and complement each other so substantially that it is very difficult to suppose that the statements had been merely derived from the creative imagination of the police officers involved.

Furthermore, Atty. Romeo T. Reyes and the interrogator, Sgt. Romulo Mercado, testified to the voluntariness of his confession. In this regard, it must be stressed that the aforementioned rule merely requires that there should be some other evidence "<i>tending </i>to show the commission of the crime apart from the confession."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>All told, an overall scrutiny of the records of this case leads us to no other conclusion but the correctness of the trial court in holding that the accused-appellant and his co-accused committed murder. What remains to be determined is whether the elements of the crime have been established.<br><br>Conspiracy is alleged in the information charging the accused-appellant of the crime. Conspiracy -<br><br><blockquote>"... exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. <i>Direct proof is not essential, for conspiracy may be inferred from the acts of the accused prior to, during or subsequent to the incident. </i>Such acts must point to a joint purpose, concert of action or community of interest. <i>Hence, the victim need not be actually hit by each of the conspirators for the act of one of them is deemed the act of all."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></i></blockquote><br>A perusal of the <i>Sinumpaang Salaysay<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></i>would readily show accused-appellant's complicity in the slaying of the victim. In the sworn statement, he narrated that a week before the killing, he was with the assassins in conducting a surveillance of the victim's residence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> He also declared that he was with Frederick Lazaro and Eduardo Patrocinio when the jeep with Plate Number CFU-178 was borrowed by the two accused<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and that he was with them when they left Pasay City bound for San Juan, Batangas, the day the victim was shot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> He likewise averred that he was left on a shed in Ibaan, Batangas when Lazaro and Patrocinio returned to Rosario, Batangas and that he was with them when they went to the house of Jun Vale at San Jose, Batangas;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> from there they proceeded to Lodlod, Lipa City where they left the jeep in the premises of Amelia Quizon's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Finally, accused-appellant admitted that he was told to recover the jeep in Lodlod, Lipa City on the day he was arrested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>The one-week interval when accused-appellant and his co-conspirators first cased the victim's house up to the actual date of the killing underscores the presence of evident premeditation. For this aggravating circumstance to be considered, there must be proof of the following elements thereof, <i>i.e., </i>1.] the time the offenders determined to commit the crime; 2.] an act manifestly indicating that they clung to their determination; and 3.] a sufficient lapse of time between determination and execution to allow reflection upon the consequences of the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> <br><br>Treachery is also alleged in the information indicting the accused.
