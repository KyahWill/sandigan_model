				<H3>REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL AUDIT CONDUCTED ON THE BOOKS OF ACCOUNTS OF OIC MELINDA DESEO, MTC, GENERAL TRIAS, CAVITE,<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MENDOZA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Office of the Court Administrator examined the books of 
account of the Municipal Trial Court, General Trias, Cavite with regard 
to collections for the Fiduciary Fund for the period November 1997 to 
February 4, 1999 and for the General and Judiciary Development Funds for
 the period August 1998 to January 31, 1999.  The financial audit was 
ordered in response to the letter, dated February 4, 1999, of Judge 
Lerio C. Castigador of that court, informing the Court that Court 
Interpreter Melinda Deseo, who was formerly the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) 
of said MTC, had used her cash collections to encash personal checks.
<p>In her explanation, dated February 13, 1999, Court Interpreter 
Deseo admitted the allegations.  She admitted that she deposited in the 
savings account of the MTC in lieu of her cash collections not only her 
personal checks received from the Government Service Insurance System 
for salary and salary loan but those of her friends and relatives as 
well.  She claimed that she did so in good faith and that she had seen 
to it that the amounts she had taken from her collections were equal to 
the amounts of the checks she deposited in the savings account of the 
MTC.  She explained said that she encashed the personal checks of her 
friends and relatives out of "necessity" and also her personal checks to
 defray the expenses of her sick mother, and otherwise avoid 
unscrupulous money changers who cashed checks at huge discounts.  She 
admitted that she did the foregoing without the authority of judge 
Castigador and expressed regrets for what she had done.
</p><p>The Office of the Court Administrator found the following:
</p><blockquote>
<ol><li>The Rural Bank of General Trias, Cavite is being utilized as 
depository bank instead of Land Bank of the Philippines or Provincial 
Treasurer's Office/City Treasurer's Office/Municipal Treasurer's Office,
 the authorized depository agencies of the government. </li><br><li>The incumbent Officer-In-Charge, Ms. Corazon Perez, was directed 
to transfer the outstanding balance as of February 4, 1999 net of 
interest earned from Rural Bank of General Trias to the nearest Land 
Bank of the Philippines. </li><br><li>The interests earned from Fiduciary Fund are not remitted on a 
quarterly basis to the National Treasury under the General Fund as 
provided for in Circular No. 50-95. </li><br><li>There were encashments of personal checks from Fiduciary Fund collections. </li><br><li>The accountable officer was not complying with Circular No. 22-94 
which requires that all receipts must be issued in strict numerical 
sequence and all copies of cancelled receipts must be intact for COA 
inspection. </li><br><li>Entries in the Cashbook do not reconcile with the monthly reports 
submitted to the Accounting Division, Office of the Court Administrator.
 </li></ol>
<p>In the course of our examination we noted that there was an overage 
deposit of P1,500 deposits in the Rural Bank of General Trias which 
according to Ms. Deseo pertains to the deposits made by Mr. Perfecto 
Villanueva in Criminal Case No. 2476 under O.R. No. 6852716, dated 
February 19, 1998.  This was already refunded to Mr. Villanueva by 
virtue of a Court Order dated February 23, 1998.  According to Ms. Deseo
 she personally refunded the amount upon presentation of the SC official
 receipt from her collections and did not withdraw the said amount from 
the bank.  There is also unwithdrawn interest of P180.12 making a total 
of P1,680.12 overage from bank balance as against cashbook and Statement
 of Unwithdrawn Fiduciary Fund.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On the basis of the foregoing findings, the OCA recommended on 
October 20, 1999 that (1) Melinda Deseo be given an admonition and 
warned that repetition of what she had done or a similar offense would 
be dealt with more severely; (2) the present OIC, Corazon Perez, be 
advised to comply strictly with Circular No. 50-95 and other circulars 
governing the collection of funds; and (3) Judge Lerio Castigador be 
admonished to closely monitor the handling of the cash collections.
</p><p>In view of the recommendation that Court Interpreter Melinda 
Deseo be simply given an admonition with warning, the matter was 
returned to the OCA for revision of its recommendations.  However, in 
its memorandum, dated February 9, 2000, the OCA reiterated its previous 
recommendation.
</p><p>Hence, the necessity to impose a penalty on Ms. Deseo, consistent with the OCA's finding that she violated Circular No. 50-95.
</p><p>The pertinent portions of this Circular are set forth below:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">CIRCULAR NO. 50-95

</blockquote>
<p>Considering her admissions and the findings of the OCA, there is no 
doubt that Court Interpreter Melinda Deseo violated Circular No. 50-95 
by using her cash collections, which she should have deposited in the 
bank for the account of the MTC, in order to encash not only her 
personal checks but also those of her friends and relatives.  As we have
 previously stated, the Fiduciary Fund is in the nature of a trust fund 
which should not be withdrawn without authority of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Its use for other purposes constitutes a misappropriation of public funds placed in the care of the public officer concerned.
</p><p>Ms. Deseo's claim that she encashed the checks of friends and 
relatives because they badly needed cash and her checks to defray the 
expenses of her sick mother cannot be justified.  The same excuse has 
been rejected by this Court as the activity is no different from the 
activities of money changers victimizing lowly employees in need of 
cash.  Indeed, the activity found was actually a lending operation with 
the use of public funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><p>In recommending that Ms. Deseo be merely admonished, the OCA stated:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Ms. Deseo was designated as Officer-in-Charge of this court on 
September 25, 1995.  She occupies the position of Interpreter, thus she 
is unfamiliar with the guidelines in handling court funds.  When she was
 designated in an acting capacity, she had no thorough knowledge nor had
 an orientation/seminar in administering Fiduciary Fund collections.  
When she encashed personal checks against court funds she violated 
Circular No. 50-95 which she readily admitted per explanation dated 
February 13, 1999.  These factors were considered as mitigating in 
evaluating the liability of Ms. Deseo.  Besides, this office found that 
the collections and deposits on other funds (JDF and General Fund) are 
in order and withdrawals of Fiduciary Funds are upon court order.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Court disagrees. Ms. Deseo's alleged lack of prior training and 
orientation in administering Fiduciary Fund collections cannot relieve 
her of administrative liability.  Her collections and deposits of other 
funds (Judiciary Development Fund and General Fund) are in order.  Her 
responsibilities for these funds are substantially the same as her 
responsibility for the Fiduciary Fund.  It is difficult to believe that 
she was ignorant of the provisions of Circular No. 50-95.  She might, in
 the beginning, have been unaware of the circular, but surely she could 
not have remained so for the three years that she was the OIC.  
Admonition, as recommended by the OCA, is not a penalty.  Her offense 
deserves more than a "gentle or friendly reproof, a mild rebuke, warning
 or reminder, counseling on a fault, error or oversight, an expression 
of authoritative advice or warning"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which is all that admonition amounts to.
</p><p>Indeed, Ms. Deseo is guilty of misconduct for which suspension 
for six (6) months and one (1) day without pay is the appropriate 
penalty.  It is no excuse that the funds of the court were all accounted
 for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
</p><p>This is where the responsibility of Judge Lerio Castigador comes 
in.  As Ms. Deseo's superior, Judge Castigador should have exercised 
direct and immediate supervision over her to ensure that she observed 
the provisions of Circular No. 50-95.  As the Court held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, clerks of court are the chief administrative officers of 
their respective courts; with regard to the collection of legal fees, 
they perform a delicate function as judicial officers entrusted with the
 correct and effective implementation of regulations thereon.  Even the 
undue delay, in the remittances of amounts collected by them at the very
 least constitutes misfeasance.  On the other hand, a vital 
administrative function of a judge is the effective management of his 
court, and this includes control of the conduct of the court's 
ministerial officers.  It should be brought home to both that the 
safekeeping of funds and collections is essential to the goal of an 
orderly administration of justice and no protestation of good faith can 
override the mandatory nature of the Circulars designed to promote full 
accountability for government funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judge Castigador cannot entirely wash his hands of responsibility by 
disclaiming knowledge of Ms. Deseo's activities.  He must, however, be 
given credit for getting wind of Ms. Deseo's activities and bringing 
them to the attention of the Court.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Court RESOLVED as follows:
</p><p>(1) To find Melinda Deseo, former Officer-in-Charge, Municipal 
Trial Court, General Trias, Cavite, guilty of MISCONDUCT and order her 
SUSPENSION for six (6) months and one (1) day without pay with WARNING 
that a repetition of this or a similar offense will be dealt with more 
severely;
</p><p>(2) to ADMONISH Judge Lerio C. Castigador to exercise effective 
supervision over the personnel of his court, especially those charged 
with collection of the Fiduciary Fund and other trust funds (Judiciary 
Development Fund and Trust Fund); and
</p><p>(3) to ADVISE Ms. Corazon Perez, Officer-in-Charge, to observe strictly Circular No. 50-95 and pertinent circulars of the Court.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.
