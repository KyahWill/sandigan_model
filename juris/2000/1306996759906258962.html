				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>C. G. DIZON CONSTRUCTION INC. and CENEN DIZON in this petition for review 
seek the reversal of the 24 July 1996 Decision of the Court of Appeals 
dismissing their appeal for lack of merit and affirming <i>in toto</i> the 
decision of the trial court holding them liable to Asia Pacific Finance 
Corporation in the amount of P87,637.50 at 14% interest per annum in addition to 
attorney's fees and costs of suit, as well as its 21 March 1997 Resolution 
denying reconsideration thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p>On 20 March 1981 Asia Pacific Finance Corporation (ASIA PACIFIC for short) 
filed a complaint for a sum of money with prayer for a writ of replevin against 
Teodoro Bañas, C. G. Dizon Construction and Cenen Dizon. Sometime in August 1980 
Teodoro Bañas executed a <i>Promissory Note</i> in favor of C. G. Dizon 
Construction whereby for value received he promised to pay to the order of C. G. 
Dizon Construction the sum of P390,000.00 in installments of "P32,500.00 every 
25th day of the month starting from September 25, 1980 up to August 25, 
1981."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p>
<p>Later, C. G. Dizon Construction endorsed with recourse the <i>Promissory 
Note</i> to ASIA PACIFIC, and to secure payment thereof, C. G. Dizon 
Construction, through its corporate officers, Cenen Dizon, President, and 
Juliette B. Dizon, Vice President and Treasurer, executed a <i>Deed of Chattel 
Mortgage</i> covering three (3) heavy equipment units of Caterpillar Bulldozer 
Crawler Tractors with Model Nos. D8-14A, D8-2U and D8H in favor of ASIA 
PACIFIC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Moreover, Cenen Dizon 
executed on 25 August 1980 a <i>Continuing Undertaking</i> wherein he bound 
himself to pay the obligation jointly and severally with C. G. Dizon 
Construction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p>
<p>In compliance with the provisions of the <i>Promissory Note</i>, C. G. Dizon 
Construction made the following installment payments to ASIA PACIFIC: P32,500.00 
on 25 September 1980, P32,500.00 on 27 October 1980 and P65,000.00 on 27 
February 1981, or a total of P130,000.00. Thereafter, however, C. G. Dizon 
Construction defaulted in the payment of the remaining installments, prompting 
ASIA PACIFIC to send a <i>Statement of Account</i> to Cenen Dizon for the unpaid 
balance of P267,737.50 inclusive of interests and charges, and P66,909.38 
representing attorney's fees. As the demand was unheeded, ASIA PACIFIC sued 
Teodoro Bañas, C. G. Dizon Construction and Cenen Dizon. </p>
<p>While defendants (herein petitioners) admitted the genuineness and due 
execution of the <i>Promissory Note</i>, the <i>Deed of Chattel Mortgage</i> and 
the <i>Continuing Undertaking</i>, they nevertheless maintained that these 
documents were never intended by the parties to be legal, valid and binding but 
a mere subterfuge to conceal the loan of P390,000.00 with usurious interests. 
</p>
<p>Defendants claimed that since ASIA PACIFIC could not directly engage in 
banking business, it proposed to them a scheme wherein plaintiff ASIA PACIFIC 
could extend a loan to them without violating banking laws: <i>first</i>, Cenen 
Dizon would secure a promissory note from Teodoro Bañas with a face value of 
P390,000.00 payable in installments; <i>second</i>, ASIA PACIFIC would then make 
it appear that the promissory note was sold to it by Cenen Dizon with the 14% 
usurious interest on the loan or P54,000.00 discounted and collected in advance 
by ASIA PACIFIC; and, <i>lastly</i>, Cenen Dizon would provide sufficient 
collateral to answer for the loan in case of default in payment and execute a 
continuing guaranty to assure continuous and prompt payment of the loan. 
Defendants also alleged that out of the loan of P390,000.00 defendants actually 
received only P329,185.00 after ASIA PACIFIC deducted the discounted interest, 
service handling charges, insurance premium, registration and notarial fees. 
</p>
<p>Sometime in October 1980 Cenen Dizon informed ASIA PACIFIC that he would be 
delayed in meeting his monthly amortization on account of business reverses and 
promised to pay instead in February 1981. Cenen Dizon made good his promise and 
tendered payment to ASIA PACIFIC in an amount equivalent to two (2) monthly 
amortizations. But ASIA PACIFIC attempted to impose a 3% interest for every 
month of delay, which he flatly refused to pay for being usurious. </p>
<p>Afterwards, ASIA PACIFIC allegedly made a verbal proposal to Cenen Dizon to 
surrender to it the ownership of the two (2) bulldozer crawler tractors and, in 
turn, the latter would treat the former's account as closed and the loan fully 
paid. Cenen Dizon supposedly agreed and accepted the offer. Defendants averred 
that the value of the bulldozer crawler tractors was more than adequate to cover 
their obligation to ASIA PACIFIC.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on 21 April 1981 the trial court issued a writ of replevin against 
defendant C. G. Dizon Construction for the surrender of the bulldozer crawler 
tractors subject of the <i>Deed of Chattel Mortgage</i>. Of the three (3) 
bulldozer crawler tractors, only two (2) were actually turned over by defendants 
- D8-14A and D8-2U - which units were subsequently foreclosed by ASIA PACIFIC to 
satisfy the obligation. D8-14A was sold for P120,000.00 and D8-2U for P60,000.00 
both to ASIA PACIFIC as the highest bidder.</p>
<p>During the pendency of the case, defendant Teodoro Bañas passed away, and on 
motion of the remaining defendants, the trial court dismissed the case against 
him. On the other hand, ASIA PACIFIC was substituted as party plaintiff by 
International Corporate Bank after the disputed <i>Promissory Note</i> was 
assigned and/or transferred by ASIA PACIFIC to International Corporate Bank. 
Later, International Corporate Bank merged with Union Bank of the Philippines. 
As the surviving entity after the merger, and having succeeded to all the rights 
and interests of International Corporate Bank in this case, Union Bank of the 
Philippines was substituted as a party in lieu of International Corporate 
Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p>
<p>On 25 September 1992 the Regional Trial Court ruled in favor of ASIA PACIFIC 
holding the defendants jointly and severally liable for the unpaid balance of 
the obligation under the <i>Promissory Note</i> in the amount of P87,637.50 at 
14% interest per annum, and attorney's fees equivalent to 25% of the monetary 
award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p>
<p>On 24 July 1996 the Court of Appeals affirmed <i>in toto</i> the decision of 
the trial court thus - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Defendant-appellants' contention that the instruments were executed merely as 
a subterfuge to skirt banking laws is an untenable defense. If that were so then 
they too were parties to the illegal scheme. Why should they now be allowed to 
take advantage of their own knavery to escape the liabilities that their own 
chicanery created? </p>
<p>Defendant-appellants also want us to believe their story that there was an 
agreement between them and the plaintiff-appellee that if the former would 
deliver their 2 bulldozer crawler tractors to the latter, the 
defendant-appellants' obligation would fully be extinguished. Again, nothing but 
the word that comes out between the teeth supports such story. Why did they not 
write down such an important agreement? Is it believable that seasoned 
businessmen such as the defendant-appellant Cenen G. Dizon and the other 
officers of the appellant corporation would deliver the bulldozers without a 
receipt of acquittance from the plaintiff-appellee x x x x In our book, that is 
not credible. </p></blockquote>
<p>The pivotal issues raised are: (a) Whether the disputed transaction between 
petitioners and ASIA PACIFIC violated banking laws, hence, null and void; and 
(b) Whether the surrender of the bulldozer crawler tractors to respondent 
resulted in the extinguishment of petitioners' obligation. </p>
<p>On the first issue, petitioners insist that ASIA PACIFIC was organized as an 
investment house which could not engage in the lending of funds obtained from 
the public through receipt of deposits. The disputed <i>Promissory Note</i>,<i> 
Deed of Chattel Mortgage </i>and <i>Continuing Undertaking</i> were not intended 
to be valid and binding on the parties as they were merely devices to conceal 
their real intention which was to enter into a contract of loan in violation of 
banking laws. </p>
<p>We reject the argument. An investment company refers to any issuer which is 
or holds itself out as being engaged or proposes to engage primarily in the 
business of investing, reinvesting or trading in <i>securities</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> As defined in Sec. 2, par. (a), of the 
<i>Revised Securities Act</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
securities "shall include x x x x commercial papers evidencing indebtedness of 
any person, financial or non-financial entity, irrespective of maturity, issued, 
<i>endorsed</i>, sold, transferred or in any manner conveyed to another <i>with 
or without recourse</i>, such as <i>promissory notes</i> x x x x" Clearly, the 
transaction between petitioners and respondent was one involving not a loan but 
purchase of <b>receivables at a discount</b>, well within the purview of 
"investing, reinvesting or trading in securities" which an investment company, 
like ASIA PACIFIC, is authorized to perform and does not constitute a violation 
of the General Banking Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Moreover, 
Sec. 2 of the <i>General Banking Act</i> provides in part - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sec. 2. Only entities duly authorized by the Monetary Board of the Central 
Bank may engage in the <u>lending of funds obtained from the public through the 
receipt of deposits </u>of any kind, and all entities regularly conducting such 
operations shall be considered as banking institutions and shall be subject to 
the provisions of this Act, of the Central Bank Act, and of other pertinent laws 
(<i>underscoring supplied</i>).</p></blockquote>
<p>Indubitably, what is prohibited by law is for investment companies to lend 
funds obtained from the public through receipts of deposit, which is a function 
of banking institutions. But here, the funds supposedly "lent" to petitioners 
have not been shown to have been obtained from the public by way of deposits, 
hence, the inapplicability of banking laws. </p>
<p>On petitioners' submission that the true intention of the parties was to 
enter into a contract of loan, we have examined the <i>Promissory Note</i> and 
failed to discern anything therein that would support such theory. On the 
contrary, we find the terms and conditions of the instrument clear, free from 
any ambiguity, and expressive of the real intent and agreement of the parties. 
We quote the pertinent portions of the <i>Promissory Note</i> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>- FOR VALUE RECEIVED, I/We, hereby promise to pay to the order of C.G. Dizon 
Construction, Inc. the sum of THREE HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND ONLY (P390,000.00), 
Philippine Currency in the following manner: </p>
<p>P32,500.00 due every 25th of the month starting from September 25, 1980 up to 
August 25, 1981.</p>
<p>I/We agree that if any of the said installments is not paid as and when it 
respectively falls due, all the installments covered hereby and not paid as yet 
shall forthwith become due and payable at the option of the holder of this note 
with interest at the rate of 14% per annum on each unpaid installment until 
fully paid. </p>
<p>If any amount due on this note is not paid at its maturity and this note is 
placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, I/We agree to pay in addition 
to the aggregate of the principal amount and interest due, a sum equivalent to 
TEN PERCENT (10%) thereof as Attorney's fees, in case no action is filed, 
otherwise, the sum will be equivalent to TWENTY FIVE (25%) of the said principal 
amount and interest due x x x x</p>
<p>Makati, Metro Manila, August 25, 1980. </p></blockquote>

<p>Likewise, the <i>Deed of Chattel Mortgage</i> and <i>Continuing 
Undertaking</i> were duly acknowledged before a notary public and, as such, have 
in their favor the presumption of regularity. To contradict them there must be 
clear, convincing and more than merely preponderant evidence. In the instant 
case, the records do not show even a preponderance of evidence in favor of 
petitioners' claim that the Deed of <i>Chattel Mortgage</i> and <i>Continuing 
Undertaking</i> were never intended by the parties to be legal, valid and 
binding. Notarial documents are evidence of the facts in clear and unequivocal 
manner therein expressed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p>
<p>Interestingly, petitioners' assertions were based mainly on the self-serving 
testimony of Cenen Dizon, and not on any other independent evidence. His 
testimony is not only unconvincing, as found by the trial court and the Court of 
Appeals, but also self-defeating in light of the documents presented by 
respondent, i.e., <i>Promissory Note</i>, <i>Deed of Chattel Mortgage</i> and 
<i>Continuing Undertaking</i>, the accuracy, correctness and due execution of 
which were admitted by petitioners. Oral evidence certainly cannot prevail over 
the written agreements of the parties. The courts need only rely on the faces of 
the written contracts to determine their true intention on the principle that 
when the parties have reduced their agreements in writing, it is presumed that 
they have made the writings the only repositories and memorials of their true 
agreement.</p>
<p>The second issue deals with a question of fact. We have ruled often enough 
that it is not the function of this Court to analyze and weigh the evidence all 
over again, its jurisdiction being limited to reviewing errors of law that might 
have been committed by the lower court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> At any rate, while we are not a trier of 
facts, hence, not required as a rule to look into the factual bases of the 
assailed decision of the Court of Appeals, we did so just the same in this case 
if only to satisfy petitioners that we have carefully studied and evaluated the 
case, all too mindful of the tenacity and vigor with which the parties, through 
their respective counsel, have pursued this case for nineteen (19) years.</p>
<p>Petitioners contend that the parties already had a verbal understanding 
wherein ASIA PACIFIC actually agreed to consider petitioners' account closed and 
the principal obligation fully paid in exchange for the ownership of the two (2) 
bulldozer crawler tractors.</p>
<p>We are not persuaded. Again, other than the bare allegations of petitioners, 
the records are bereft of any evidence of the supposed agreement. As correctly 
observed by the Court of Appeals, it is unbelievable that the parties entirely 
neglected to write down such an important agreement. Equally incredulous is the 
fact that petitioner Cenen Dizon, a seasoned businessman, readily consented to 
deliver the bulldozers to respondent without a corresponding receipt of 
acquittance. Indeed, even the testimony of petitioner Cenen Dizon himself 
negates the supposed verbal understanding between the parties -</p>

just that (underscoring ours).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>In other words, there was no binding and perfected contract between 
petitioners and respondent regarding the settlement of the obligation, but only 
a conditional one, a mere conjecture in fact, depending on whether the value of 
the tractors to be surrendered would equal the balance of the loan plus 
interests. And since the bulldozer crawler tractors were sold at the foreclosure 
sale for only P180,000.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which was 
not enough to cover the unpaid balance of P267,637.50, petitioners are still 
liable for the deficiency.</p>
<p>Barring therefore a showing that the findings complained of are totally 
devoid of support in the records, or that they are so glaringly erroneous as to 
constitute serious abuse of discretion, we see no valid reason to discard them. 
More so in this case where the findings of both the trial court and the 
appellate court coincide with each other on the matter.</p>
<p>With regard to the computation of petitioners' liability, the records show 
that petitioners actually paid to respondent a total sum of P130,000.00 in 
addition to the P180,000.00 proceeds realized from the sale of the bulldozer 
crawler tractors at public auction. Deducting these amounts from the principal 
obligation of P390,000.00 leaves a balance of P80,000.00, to which must be added 
P7,637.50 accrued interests and charges as of 20 March 1981, or a total unpaid 
balance of P87,637.50 for which petitioners are jointly and severally liable. 
Furthermore, the unpaid balance should earn 14% interest per annum as stipulated 
in the <i>Promissory Note</i>, computed from 20 March 1981 until fully paid.</p>
<p>On the amount of attorney's fees which under the <i>Promissory Note</i> is 
equivalent to 25% of the principal obligation and interests due, it is not, 
strictly speaking, the attorney's fees recoverable as between the attorney and 
his client regulated by the Rules of Court. Rather, the attorney's fees here are 
in the nature of liquidated damages and the stipulation therefor is aptly called 
a penal clause. It has been said that so long as such stipulation does not 
contravene the law, morals and public order, it is strictly binding upon the 
obligor. It is the litigant, not the counsel, who is the judgment creditor 
entitled to enforce the judgment by execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p>
<p>Nevertheless, it appears that petitioners' failure to fully comply with their 
part of the bargain was not motivated by ill will or malice, but due to 
financial distress occasioned by legitimate business reverses. Petitioners in 
fact paid a total of P130,000.00 in three (3) installments, and even went to the 
extent of voluntarily turning over to respondent their heavy equipment 
consisting of two (2) bulldozer crawler tractors, all in a <i>bona fide</i> 
effort to settle their indebtedness in full. Article 1229 of the New Civil Code 
specifically empowers the judge to equitably reduce the civil penalty when the 
principal obligation has been <i>partly</i> or <i>irregularly</i> complied with. 
Upon the foregoing premise, we hold that the reduction of the attorney's fees 
from 25% to 15% of the unpaid principal plus interests is in order.</p>
<p>Finally, while we empathize with petitioners, we cannot close our eyes to the 
overriding considerations of the law on obligations and contracts which must be 
upheld and honored at all times. Petitioners have undoubtedly benefited from the 
transaction; they cannot now be allowed to impugn its validity and legality to 
escape the fulfillment of a valid and binding obligation. </p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, no reversible error having been committed by the Court of 
Appeals, its assailed Decision of 24 July 1996 and its Resolution of 21 March 
1997 are AFFIRMED. Accordingly, petitioners C.G. Construction Inc. and Cenen 
Dizon are ordered jointly and severally to pay respondent Asia Pacific Finance 
Corporation, substituted by International Corporate Bank (now known as Union 
Bank of the Philippines), P87,637.50 representing the unpaid balance on the 
<i>Promissory Note</i>, with interest at fourteen percent (14%) per annum 
computed from 20 March 1981 until fully paid, and fifteen percent (15%) of the
