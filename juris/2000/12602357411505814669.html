				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Petitioners assail the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC RAB-III-03-2673-92, which modified the ruling of the Labor Arbiter, by deleting the award of moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorneys’ fees and costs of litigation.<br><br>The facts, as found <i>a quo,</i> are as follows:<br><br>Petitioners Reynaldo Fajardo, Ernesto Marin, Ever Guevarra, Petronilo Baguisa, Victorino Carillo, and Erdie Javate were permanent employees of respondent Nueva Ecija I Electric Cooperative (NEECO I). They were members of petitioner NEECO I Employees Association, a labor organization established for the mutual aid and protection of its members. Petitioner Rodolfo Jimenez was the president of the association.<br><br>Respondent NEECO I is an electric cooperative under the general supervision and control of the National Electrification Administration (NEA). The management of NEECO I is vested on the Board of Directors. Respondent Patricio dela Peña was NEECO’s general manager on detail from NEA.<br><br>On February 7, 1987, the Board of Directors adopted Policy No. 3-33, which set the guidelines for NEECO I’s retirement benefits. On October 28, 1987, all regular employees were ordered by NEECO I to accomplish Form 87, which were applications for either retirement, resignation, or separation from service.<br><br>On October 5, 1991 and February 28, 1992, the applications of Petronilo Baguisa and Ever Guevarra, respectively, were approved. They were paid the appropriate separation pay.<br><br>These successive events, followed by the promotion of certain union officers to supervisory rank, caused apprehension in the labor association. They were considered as harassment threatening the union members, and circumventing the employees’ security of tenure. On February 29, 1992, to strengthen and neutralize management’s arbitrary moves, the union held a "snap election" of officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Reynaldo Fajardo was elected Treasurer, while Evaristo Guevarra, Victorino Carillo and Ernesto Marin were elected Public Relations Officers for Jaen, Gapan A and Gapan B, respectively.<br><br>On March 3, 1992, petitioner labor association passed a resolution withdrawing the applications for retirement of all its members, thus:<br><blockquote>"Upon popular request of all members and officers of the association their manifestation of willingness to retire on optional basis is hereby WITHDRAWN by the ASSOCIATION for and in behalf of all its members, EXCEPT those who are willing to avail their retirement benefits with all their hearts and mind. To avoid what had happened to EVARISTO GUEVARRA. The union officers and its members, claimed their right to be protected under the <u>security of tenure clause</u> under the Labor Code of the Philippines. No employee shall be retired without his/her consent or approval of the union.<br><br>On motion and duly seconded. Approved unanimously. Let copies of the resolution be furnished NEECO I PS/AGM Patricio S. dela Peña, for his information and appropriate action."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>On March 4, March 17, and April 7, 1992, petitioners Ernesto Marin, Reynaldo Fajardo and Victorino Carillo were compulsorily retired by management. They received their separation pay under protest on March 16, March 18, and April 15, 1992, respectively.<br><br>On August 21, 1991, Erdie Javate was terminated from employment allegedly due to misappropriation of funds and dishonesty. He was not paid separation or retirement benefits.<br><br>On March 29, 1992, petitioners and Erdie Javate instituted a complaint for illegal dismissal and damages with the NLRC Regional Arbitration Branch in San Fernando. They alleged they were purposely singled out for retirement from a listing of employees who were made to submit retirement forms, even if they were not on top of the list because they were union officers, past officers or active members of the association. Further, petitioners claimed that their acceptance of the money offered by NEECO I did not constitute estoppel nor waiver, since their acceptances were with vehement objections and without prejudice to all their rights resulting from an illegal dismissal.<br><br>Additionally, Javate averred he was framed up and dismissed without due process.<br><br>On December 21, 1992, the labor arbiter decided the case as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing considerations, judgment is hereby rendered, as follows:<br></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>Declaring respondents NEECO I and PS/AGM Engr.

But herein petitioners filed an omnibus motion to dismiss on the ground of late appeal, claiming that insufficient bond was filed by NEECO I only on January 5, 1993. The bond excluded the award of moral and exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs of litigation.<br><br>Respondent NLRC denied the motion and instead gave due course to the appeal. On July 16, 1993, the NLRC modified the decision, as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appealed Decision is modified by deleting the awards of moral and exemplary damages, attorney’s fees and cost of litigation.

Hence, no appeal was perfected.<br><br>Indisputable is the legal doctrine that the appeal of a decision involving a monetary award in labor cases may be perfected "only upon the posting of a cash or surety bond."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The Labor Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 6715, clearly provides:<br><blockquote>"<i>Art. 223. Appeal</i> - Decisions, awards or orders of the Labor Arbiter are final and executory unless appealed to the Commission by any or both parties within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of such decisions, awards, or orders. . .<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>In case of a judgment involving a monetary award, an appeal by the employer may be perfected only upon the posting of a cash or surety bond issued by a reputable bonding company duly accredited by the Commission in the amount equivalent to the monetary award in the judgment appealed from.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center></blockquote>Also, the perfection of an appeal within the reglementary period and in the manner prescribed by law is jurisdictional, and noncompliance with such legal requirement is fatal and effectively renders the judgment final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>However, in a number of cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> this Court relaxed the rule to resolve controversies on the merits,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> specifically, when there are special meritorious circumstances and issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> We relaxed the requirement of posting a supersedeas bond for the perfection of an appeal, when there was substantial compliance with the rule, so that on balance, we made technical considerations to give way to equity and justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In the case before us, the decision of the labor arbiter was issued on December 21, 1992. Private respondents filed their appeal on December 28, 1992, barely seven days from receipt thereof. The bonding company issued the bond dated January 4, 1993, the last day for filing an appeal. However, it was forwarded to respondent NLRC only on the following day, January 5, 1993. Considering these circumstances and the holiday season, we find it equitable to ease the rules and consider that there was substantial compliance with the requirements of the law.<br><br>As to the amount of bond, we note that there had been changes in the Rules promulgated by the NLRC. Previously the computation of the cash or surety bond to be posted by an employer who wishes to appeal contained in the original rules was "exclusive of moral and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It was later deleted sometime in 1991 and 1992, then restored on November 20, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>It may be noted that while respondent NLRC in its Resolution No. 11-01-91 dated November 7, 1991 deleted the phrase "exclusive of moral and exemplary damages as well as attorney’s fees" in the determination of the amount of the bond, it provided a safeguard against the imposition of excessive bonds providing "(T)he Commission may, in meritorious cases and upon Motion of the Appellant, reduce the amount of the bond."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In the case of <i>Cosico, Jr. vs. NLRC,</i> 272 SCRA 583, we ruled:<br><blockquote>"In the case at bar, the backwages and thirteenth month pay awarded to petitioner amounted only to <strike>P</strike>270,000.00, but the moral and exemplary damages, plus 10% attorney’s fees, totalled <strike>P</strike>2,497,000.00. In other words, the moral and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees are almost ten (10) times greater than the basic monetary judgment. Private respondents posted a supersedeas bond of <strike>P</strike>270,000.00, obviously, on the honest belief that the amount was sufficient. At the very least, therefore, there was substantial compliance with the requirement of appeal bond. For to rule otherwise would negate the interest of justice and deviate from the mandate of the Labor Code that the rules of procedure should be liberally construed, . . .<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>Since private respondents filed a bond which they honestly believed sufficient for purposes of their appeal, respondent NLRC should have called their attention that the bond was inadequate, which it did not."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>The unreasonable and excessive amount of bond would be oppressive and unjust and would have the effect of depriving a party of his right to appeal. Besides, private respondents stress that the petitioners were paid their retirement benefits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and that the cooperative has sufficient assets from which the other claims for damages and attorney’s fees may be obtained.<br><br>We come next to the issue of the propriety of the award of moral and exemplary damages.<br><br>To warrant an award of moral damages, it must be shown that the dismissal of the employee was attended to by bad faith, or constituted an act oppressive to labor, or was done in a manner contrary to morals, good customs or public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The Labor Arbiter ruled that there was unfair labor practice:<br><blockquote>"As a backdrop, complainants alleged, and this is supported by documentary evidence, that on 7 February 1987, the then NEECO I Board of Directors adopted their own Policy No. 3-33 under Resolution No. 47, series of 1987 requiring all employees to avail of the retirement benefits. All regular employees, including the complainants were ordered to file their application for retirement/resignation and/or separation from the service under NEECO I Form 87. All NEECO I employees have no choice but to manifest their willingness to retire.<br><br>However, the complainants pointed out that the approval of the employees’ application for retirement was not done in succession according to the list, but according to the choice of the respondents, and for which, complainants were singled out from the list because they were union officers, past officers and active members of the complainant Association."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>"Clearly, therefore, complainants have established the fact that they were illegally dismissed by the respondents and their illegal dismissal was even tainted with unfair labor practice act. ..."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Unfair labor practices violate the constitutional rights of workers and employees to self-organization, are inimical to the legitimate interests of both labor and management, including their right to bargain collectively and otherwise deal with each other in an atmosphere of freedom and mutual respect; and disrupt industrial peace and hinder the promotion of healthy and stable labor-management relations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> As the conscience of the government, it is the Court’s sworn duty to ensure that none trifles with labor rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>For this reason, we find it proper in this case to impose moral and exemplary damages on private respondent. However, the damages awarded by the labor arbiter, to our mind, are excessive. In determining the amount of damages recoverable, the business, social and financial position of the offended parties and the business and financial position of the offender are taken into account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It is our view that herein private respondents had not fully acted in good faith. However, we are cognizant that a cooperative promotes the welfare of its own members. The economic benefits filter to the cooperative members. Either equally or proportionally, they are distributed among members in correlation with the resources of the association utilized. Cooperatives help promote economic democracy and support community development. Under these circumstances, we deem it proper to reduce moral damages to only <strike>P</strike>10,000.00 payable by private respondent NEECO I to each individual petitioner. We also deem it sufficient for private respondent NEECO I to pay each individual petitioner <strike>P</strike>5,000.00 to answer for exemplary damages, based on the provisions of Articles 2229 and 2232 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Having been illegally dismissed, individual petitioners are entitled to reinstatement from the time they were illegally dismissed, until they were reinstated on March 16, 1993.
