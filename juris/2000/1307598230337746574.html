				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> seeks to annul and set aside 
the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals 
dated 24 May 1999 affirming the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the National Labor Relations Commission 
dated 20 May 1997 which declared that private respondents were constructively 
terminated when forced to resign under the retirement program of petitioner 
company. </p>
<p>Progressive Development Corporation (PDC) is a corporation organized and 
existing under the laws of the Philippines and its co-petitioners Judy A. Roxas 
and Dante P. Verayo are its Senior Vice President and former Manager of its 
Human Resources Division, respectively. </p>
<p>In 1980 PDC implemented its Employees' Non-Contributory Retirement Plan 
(<i>The Plan</i>) which took effect on 1 April 1980. Thereafter, a number of 
employees was retired pursuant to the <i>optional retirement</i> provision of 
<i>The Plan</i> - </p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Section 3. </i><u><strong>Optional Retirement</strong></u>. - <i>Any 
participant with twenty (20) years of service, regardless of age, may be retired 
at his option or at the option of the Company and shall be entitled to the 
following benefits x x x x</i> </p></blockquote>
<p>On 8 October 1990, upon request by PDC, Director Augusto G. Sanchez of the 
Bureau of Working Conditions, Department of Labor and Employment, confirmed the 
validity of <i>The Plan</i>, particularly its provision on optional 
retirement.</p>
<p>On 28 November 1994 PDC notified its employees who had rendered more than 
twenty (20) years of service in the Company of its decision to retire them 
effective 31 December 1994. On 7 December 1994, Jose Riego and private 
respondent Rholanda Andres, two (2) of those who were retired, filed a complaint 
for illegal retirement and unfair labor practices against petitioners. </p>
<p>Private respondent Rholanda Andres started in the employ of petitioner PDC on 
22 October 1971 as a payroll clerk and was billing assistant with a monthly 
salary of P5,972.00 when petitioners decided to retire her from employment. She 
was then forty-five (45) years old with twenty-three (23) years of service in 
the company. </p>
<p>On 2 January 1995 private respondent Roy Romano also filed a similar 
complaint against petitioners. He started working with PDC as an elevator 
operator on 2 January 1974 and was a tender mechanic at its maintenance 
department with a monthly salary of P4,820.00 when he was retired. He was then 
thirty-eight (38) years old with twenty (20) years of service in the 
company.</p>
<p>The two (2) cases were consolidated. During the pendency of these cases, 
complainant Jose Riego desisted from pursuing his claim and accepted his 
retirement benefits. In addition, he executed a <i>Release and Quitclaim</i> 
that effectively relieved PDC and its officers from obligations under and in 
connection with his employment. </p>
<p>Private respondent Andres was Chairman of the Board of Directors of 
PDW-LIKHA, a union of rank-and-file employees of PDC, while private respondent 
Romano was a member of the union. They contended that their retirement from PDC 
was done by the latter as a retaliatory measure for their union activities. They 
assailed the validity of <i>The Plan</i> under which they were retired claiming 
lack of knowledge thereof absent any collective bargaining agreement and any 
applicable employment contract.</p>
<p>On 14 August 1995 petitioners filed a <i>Manifestation and Motion</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> for the presentation of evidence by both 
parties to settle certain factual issues. On 24 August 1995 private respondents, 
without denying the early retirement of their co-employees, opposed petitioners' 
motion to present evidence and moved to submit the consolidated cases for 
resolution on the basis of the pleadings so far submitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<p>On 25 October 1995 the Labor Arbiter upheld the validity of the retirement of 
private respondents and dismissed their consolidated complaints.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> He ruled that the retirement plan of PDC 
was consistent with Art. 287 of the Labor Code as amended which provides that 
<i>"[a]ny employee <u>may be retired</u> upon reaching the retirement age 
established in the collective bargaining agreement or other applicable 
employment contract." </i>He explained that the phrase <i>"may be retired"</i> 
connotes an option given to an employer to retire an employee and such option, 
he further declared, was within the discretion of the employer to exercise. The 
Labor Arbiter also held that the discretion of the employer extended to the 
choice of employees to be retired and choosing private respondents to retire 
could not be attributed to their union activities as the other members of the 
union who were similarly situated were not retired by PDC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p>On appeal the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) modified the 
decision of the Labor Arbiter. It declared private respondents to be 
constructively terminated when forced to resign under the retirement program of 
PDC, ordered their reinstatement with payment of their full wages computed from 
the time they were forcibly resigned until actually reinstated, but dismissed 
the complaint for unfair labor practice for lack of substantial basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p>
<p>On 4 July 1997 petitioners filed a <i>Motion for Reconsideration</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which was denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> by the NLRC on 10 July 1997.</p>
<p>On 24 October 1997 petitioners filed with this Court a petition for 
<i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On 25 January 1999, after respondents had 
filed their comments, the Court referred the petition to the Court of Appeals 
for appropriate action and disposition. </p>
<p>On 24 May 1999 the Court of Appeals denied the petition and affirmed the 
decision of the NLRC. Hence, this petition. </p>
<p>Clearly, the resolution of the issue on whether private respondents were 
illegally retired rests upon the determination of whether the retirement program 
of petitioner company is valid. </p>
<p>As a general rule, the factual findings and conclusions of 
<i>quasi-judicial</i> agencies such as the NLRC are accorded great weight and 
respect upon appeal, and even finality, as long as they are supported by 
substantial evidence or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable man 
might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. But this is true only when 
they do not come under the established exceptions. One of these is where the 
findings of the NLRC and the Labor Arbiter are contrary to each other, as in the 
instant case. Consequently, there is a necessity for this Court to examine the 
records and the evidence presented to determine which findings of the NLRC and 
the Labor Arbiter should be preferred as more conformable with the evidentiary 
facts. </p>
<p>Accordingly, a careful examination of the records shows that the findings of 
the Labor Arbiter are more in harmony with the evidence on record. The 
retirement plan under which private respondents were retired is valid for it 
forms part of the employment contract of petitioner company. Director Augusto G. 
Sanchez of the Bureau of Working Conditions of the DOLE recognized and affirmed 
the validity of <i>The Plan</i>. Thus - </p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Considering therefore the fact that your client's retirement plan now 
<u>forms part of the employment contract since it is made known to the employees 
and accepted by them, </u>and such plan has an express provision that the 
company has the choice to retire an employee regardless of age, with twenty (20) 
years of service, said policy is within the bounds contemplated by the Labor 
Code. Moreover, the manner of computation of retirement benefits depends on the 
stipulation provided in the company retirement plan</i> </p></blockquote>
<p>This pronouncement made by no less than the DOLE must be given substantial 
weight, as what the Labor Arbiter did, in the absence of any contrary evidence. 
Moreover, the undisputed fact that a number of employees of petitioner company 
had availed of <i>The Plan</i> since its effectivity only confirms that <i>The 
Plan</i> has already been part of the employment contract of petitioner company 
for a long time. Private respondents, particularly Andres, may not now feign 
ignorance of <i>The Plan</i> considering that she was the chairman of the union 
of rank-and-file employees of petitioner company and, as such, was considered to 
be familiar with the policies of the company.</p>
<p>Obviously, private respondents failed to substantiate their allegation that 
<i>The Plan</i> was invalid. The NLRC was thus incorrect in ruling in their 
favor by declaring that they were illegally retired. Hence, the affirmation by 
the Court of Appeals of the Decision of the NLRC must likewise be declared 
erroneous. </p>
<p>The Court notes that private respondents, in attacking the validity of <i>The 
Plan</i>, might have been motivated by their belief that they were retired by 
reason of their union activities. But, both the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC 
dismissed their allegation of unfair labor practice for apparent lack of 
substantial basis. </p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <strong>GRANTED</strong>. The Decision of 
the Court of Appeals affirming the Resolution of the NLRC is 
<strong>MODIFIED</strong>. The dismissal of the complaint for unfair labor 
practice <strong>STANDS</strong> while its declaration that private respondents 
were illegally retired is <strong>SET ASIDE</strong>. The Decision of the Labor 
Arbiter declaring the validity of the retirement plan of petitioner company and 
ordering the dismissal of the consolidated complaints of private respondents is 
<strong>REVIVED</strong> and <strong>AFFIRMED</strong>. </p>
<p>SO ORDERED. </p>
