Lumabas charged accused-appellant as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"That in or about the month of December 1996 at Brgy. Balut II, Pilar, Bataan, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused thru force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie and succeed to have sexual intercourse with the offended party, Kristina L. Pecayo, a 14 year old minor girl, who is his daughter, against the will and consent of the latter, to her damage and prejudice."</blockquote><br>Appellant, duly assisted by Counsel Joey V. Saldaña, was arraigned on August 11, 1997.&nbsp; To both charges, he pleaded "not guilty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> On August 26, 1997, he waived his right to pretrial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Trial proper thence proceeded with dispatch.<br><br>On December 9, 1997, the trial court promulgated its Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the guilt of the accused having been established beyond reasonable doubt, he is sentenced in each of Criminal Cases Nos. 6595 and 6596 to the penalty of death and to indemnify the victim in the amount of P50,000.00, with costs."<br></blockquote><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br><i><b><u>Version of the Prosecution</u></b></i><br></center><br>The solicitor general sums up the People's version of the facts as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"At about 3:00 a.m. of January, 1996, Cristina Pecayo, x x x was asleep in her room with her youngest sister (p. 7, supra).&nbsp; Suddenly, Cristina sensed that her father, Felipe Pecayo, entered the room, stripped off her clothes, her shorts and panty.&nbsp; Felipe then removed his shorts, went on top of Cristina and inserted his organ into hers.&nbsp; When Felipe saw her daughter's sex organ ble[e]d, he wiped it off and left (supra).&nbsp; Cristina did nothing as she was afraid of her father, Felipe, who, when drunk, always threatened to kill his family (supra).<br><br>Sometime in December, 1996, at about 3:00 a.m., Felipe again entered Cristina's room.&nbsp; After removing his shorts, Felipe stripped off Cristina's clothing then went on top of her and inserted his sex organ into Cristina's.&nbsp; When Cristina's sex organ bled, Felipe wiped off the blood and left. Cristina, aware that her father always carried a knife in his pocket, could only cry (p. 9, supra).<br><br>Dr. Marissa Mallari examined Cristina on June 20, 1997.&nbsp; The result of said examination which was reduced into writing (Exhibit A) showed a positive deep-healed hymenal laceration at 5:00 o'clock; x x x positive superficial healed hymenal lacerations at 2:00, 4:00 o'clock positions which hymenal lacerations could have been caused by penetration, masturbation, strenuous exercise [or] instrumentation (p. 3, tsn, August 26, 1997)."</blockquote><br><u><center><i><b>Version of the Defense</b></i><br></center></u><br>The version of accused-appellant, the lone defense witness, is as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"When asked what could be the reason why Kristina charged him of raping her, he said that she resent[s] him because he gets angry with her everytime she comes home late from school.&nbsp; There was even a time when he spanked her in the presence of several persons.<br><br>During cross-examination, Felipe Pecayo, Sr., described himself as a good father and provider.&nbsp; According to him, however, his children do not want him to work anymore because he is already old.&nbsp; He affirmed that his daughter Maricris works in Mariveles starting at 5:00 a.m., prompting her to leave the house as early as 4:00 o'clock in the morning.&nbsp; Felipe, Jr., on the other hand, goes to sea and sometimes leaves at 4:00 o'clock in the morning and returns after two or three hours. As far as he knows, Kristina filed these cases against him because he spanked her prior to December 1996 and after January 1996.&nbsp; (TSN, November 11, 1997, pp. 2-10)."</blockquote><br><u><center><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b>&nbsp; </center></u><br><br>Assessing the credibility of the private complainant as well as her testimony in open court, Judge Lorenzo R. Silva Jr. wrote as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"It is obvious that the testimony of Cristina that she was raped by her father in January and December, 1996 is positive, direct, straight forward and unadorned.&nbsp; The Presiding Judge was observing her while testifying and observed that she narrated the terrible ordeal she had to bear with anguished and pained sincerity coupled with dread of her defiler, her own father.&nbsp; There was no reason for the Court to doubt any whit her testimony given with a spat[e] of tears.&nbsp; The defense of the father was one of undiluted denial; innuendo that she filed the case out of revenge because he&nbsp; x x x scolded her several times and spanked her once after the first rape and before the second rape; and insinuat[ed] that he could not have raped her because she was sleeping with her siblings at least with Maricris, Angie and Rolly after Felipe, Jr. went to sea and Maricris left for work in Mariveles. On this score, the testimony of Cristina was clear that it was only the youngest, aged eleven who was near her when she was ravished.&nbsp; The Supreme Court has held that lust is no respecter of time and place and rape can be committed even in places where people congregate in parks, along the roadside, within school premises, inside a house where there are other occupants, and even in the same room where other members of the family are also sleeping. (People vs. Cura, 240 SCRA 234) While there seem[ed] to be no resistance by the daughter when she was raped by her father, the Court is convinced that the lack of resistance was due to fear or to the novelty of a harrowing experience.&nbsp; Moreover, in rape committed by a father against his own daughter, the father's moral ascendancy and influence over the latter substitutes for violence and intimidation x x x.&nbsp; The cross-examination of the complainant did not dent any bit her credible testimony given in a forthright manner. The simple answers of this witness on the stand exude candor and sincerity.&nbsp; Since the complainant is of tender years and not exposed to the ways of the world, it is improbable that she would impute a crime as serious as rape to her own father if it were not true."</blockquote><br>The lower court concluded that, without doubt, "the accused father had carnal knowledge of his daughter against her will[,] taking advantage of his moral ascendancy and influence."<br><br>Hence, this Court's automatic review of the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><u><center><b>Issues</b><br></center></u><br>In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> accused-appellant assigns the following errors to the court <i>a quo</i>:<br><br><blockquote><center>"I<br></center><br>The trial court gravely erred in giving full weight and credence to the testimony of the private complainant and disregarding the theory of the defense.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>The trial court erred in adopting the prosecution's theory which is incongruous and contradicts human experience and ordinary behavior of men.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>The trial court gravely erred in holding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt in both charges."</blockquote><br>In brief, these issues boil down to the sufficiency of the prosecution evidence to convict appellant.<br><br><u><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center></u><br><br>We affirm the conviction of appellant for two counts of rape, but reduce his penalty in each count to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for failure of the prosecution to present sufficient proof of the victim's age.<br><br><center><u><b>Main Issue:</b><br><i><b>Sufficiency of the Prosecution Evidence</b></i></u><br></center><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br></span></span></span>Appellant contends that the testimony of Kristina Pecayo has "too many loose ends,&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; resulting in the failure of her case to meet the test of moral certainty [in establishing the] guilt of the accused." <i>First, </i>it was allegedly improbable for the rapes to have taken place in an 8-by-12-foot room where the victim's siblings were also sleeping.&nbsp; <i>Second, </i>Kristina did not shout for help or awaken her siblings who were in the same room where she was being raped.&nbsp; <i>Third, </i>nearly a year passed between the alleged two instances of rape, during which the victim failed to report the matter to anyone.&nbsp; There was no showing, however, that in the interval, appellant continued to intimidate or instill fear in the victim.&nbsp; <i>Finally, </i>the uncorroborated testimony of the private complainant allegedly failed to support the conviction of appellant.<br><br>After a careful scrutiny of the evidence for both the prosecution and the defense, the Court finds that the objections raised by appellant are unworthy of belief.&nbsp; The testimony of Kristina Pecayo, as corroborated by the medical findings, are sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of Felipe Pecayo Sr.&nbsp; Her testimony was straightforward, spontaneous and convincing, thereby manifesting truth.&nbsp; We quote it at length, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td colspan="2"><div align="JUSTIFY">"PROS.

She vividly recounted her humiliating experiences at the hands of her own father.&nbsp; Even during cross-examination, she remained steadfast in her testimony.&nbsp; Unless she was telling the truth, she could not have admitted in public that she had been defiled by her own father, thereby compromising her own honor and dignity.&nbsp; Needless to state, it is undeniable that an incestuous sexual assault is a psychosocial deviance that inflicts a social stigma upon the victim and her family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>It has also been oft said that a rape victim's testimony against her parent is entitled to great weight since, customarily, Filipino children revere and respect their elders.&nbsp; These values are so deeply ingrained in Filipino families<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> that it is unthinkable for a daughter to concoct brazenly a story of rape against her father, if such were not true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Indeed, no woman, especially one of tender age, would contrive a tale of defilement and undergo the humiliating ordeal and indignity of testifying on the sordid details of the crime, if she has not in fact been raped or been motivated by a desire to obtain justice and vindicate her honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> When straightforward and unflawed by any material or significant inconsistency, her testimony deserves full faith and credit and can sustain a conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Credibility is surely enhanced when the accusing words are directed against a close relative, especially the father as in the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Well-settled is the rule that the lone testimony of the rape victim, if credible, is sufficient to support a conviction.&nbsp; This is so because, from the nature of the offense, oftentimes the only evidence that can be offered to establish the guilt of the appellant is the private complainant's testimony.&nbsp; Rape, by its very nature, is normally committed away from public view, without witnesses save for the perpetrator and the victim themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Thus, the fact that Kristina was the only eyewitness presented in court and her testimony was therefore uncorroborated is not fatal to the prosecution's case.&nbsp; Credibility does not go with numbers.&nbsp; The faithful testimony of a single credible witness suffices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>As the trial judge noted, the victim "narrated the terrible ordeal she had to bear with anguished and pained sincerity coupled with dread of her defiler, her own father.&nbsp; There was no reason for the [c]ourt to doubt any whit her testimony given with a spat[e] of tears."<br><br>We find no reason to deviate from the general rule that factual findings of trial courts should not be disturbed on appeal, unless they are found to be clearly arbitrary or unfounded; or some substantial fact or circumstance that could materially affect the disposition of the case was overlooked, misunderstood or misinterpreted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> This rule is rooted in the fact that a trial judge had the unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and to note their demeanor and manner of testifying under grilling examination.&nbsp; Undeniably, these factors are significant in evaluating a witness' honesty, sincerity and credibility.&nbsp; Having observed the entire proceedings, the trial court can be expected to have determined reasonably whose testimony to accept and which witness to disbelieve.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Conversely, the reviewing magistrate has none of the advantages peculiar to the trial judge's position and therefore relies only on the cold records of the case and on the trial judge's discretion.<br><br>Another time-honored doctrine is that lust is no respecter of time and place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Rape can be committed even in places where people congregate, in parks, within school premises, inside a house where there are other occupants, and even in the same room where there are other members of the family who are sleeping.&nbsp; Thus, deserving scant consideration is appellant's allegation that it was improbable for the rape to have taken place in an 8-by-12-foot room where the victim's siblings were also sleeping.<br><br>Under the circumstances of the case, the victim's failure to shout for help while she was being ravished is of no moment.&nbsp; The aggressor was the victim's own father, who naturally had moral and physical ascendancy over her.&nbsp; He even threatened to kill not only her, but likewise her siblings. Kristina was also aware that her father had the habit of carrying a knife with him.&nbsp; Time and again, this Court has ruled that physical resistance need not be established in rape when intimidation is exercised upon the victim, who then submits herself against her will to the rapist's lust because of fear for her life.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Resistance on her part need not be carried to the point of inviting death or sustaining physical injuries in the hands of the rapist.&nbsp; It suffices that the offense is consummated against her will or that she yields because of a genuine fear of great harm.<br><br>It has been consistently held that no standard form of behavior has been observed when a person is confronted by a shocking or a harrowing and unexpected incident, for the workings of the human mind, when placed under emotional stress, are unpredictable.&nbsp; Some people may cry out, some may faint, some may be shocked into insensibility, while others may yet appear to yield to the intrusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The moral ascendancy of appellant, coupled with his threats against the lives of the victim and her siblings, also adequately explain the delay in reporting the crime to the authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The silence of a rape victim or her failure to disclose immediately her debasing ordeal does not prove that her charges are unfounded and fabricated. It is not uncommon for a young girl like Kristina to conceal for some time the beastly assault on her virtue.
