				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated July 19, 1993 and August 15, 1995, respectively, which reinstated the entire Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated February 18, 1991 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 8, holding, among others, petitioner Banco do Brasil liable to private respondent Cesar Urbino, Sr. for damages amounting to $300,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>At the outset, let us state that this case should have been consolidated with the recently decided case of <i>Vlason Enterprises Corporation v. Court of Appeals and Duraproof Services, represented by its General Manager, Cesar Urbino Sr.</i><i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></i>, for these two (2) cases involved the same material antecedents, though the main issue proffered in the present petition vary with the <i>Vlason</i> case.<br><br>The material antecedents, as quoted from the <i>Vlason</i><i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></i> case, are:<br><blockquote>Poro Point Shipping Services, then acting as the local agent of Omega Sea Transport Company of Honduras &amp; Panama, a Panamanian Company (hereafter referred to as Omega), requested permission for its vessel M/V Star Ace, which had engine trouble, to unload its cargo and to store it at the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) compound in San Fernando, La Union while awaiting transhipment to Hongkong. The request was approved by the Bureau of Customs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Despite the approval, the customs personnel boarded the vessel when it docked on January 7, 1989, on suspicion that it was the hijacked M/V Silver Med owned by Med Line Philippines Co., and that its cargo would be smuggled into the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The district customs collector seized said vessel and its cargo pursuant to Section 2301, Tariff and Customs Code. A notice of hearing of SFLU Seizure Identification No. 3-89 was served on its consignee, Singkong Trading Co. of Hongkong, and its shipper, Dusit International Co., Ltd. of Thailand.<br><br>While seizure proceedings were ongoing, La Union was hit by three typhoons, and the vessel ran aground and was abandoned. On June 8, 1989, its authorized representative, Frank Cadacio, entered into salvage agreement with private respondent to secure and repair the vessel at the agreed consideration of $1 million and "fifty percent (50%) [of] the cargo after all expenses, cost and taxes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Finding that no fraud was committed, the District Collector of Customs, Aurelio M. Quiray, lifted the warrant of seizure on July 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> However, in a Second Indorsement dated November 11, 1989, then Customs Commissioner Salvador M. Mison declined to issue a clearance for Quiray's Decision; instead, he forfeited the vessel and its cargo in accordance with Section 2530 of the Tariff and Customs Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Accordingly, acting District Collector of Customs John S. Sy issued a Decision decreeing the forfeiture and the sale of the cargo in favor of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>To enforce its preferred salvor's lien, herein Private Respondent Duraproof Services filed with the Regional Trial Court of Manila a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, Prohibition and <i>Mandamus</i><i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></i> assailing the actions of Commissioner Mison and District Collector Sy. Also impleaded as respondents were PPA Representative Silverio Mangaoang and Med Line Philippines, Inc.<br><br>On January 10, 1989, private respondent amended its Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> to include former District Collector Quiray; PPA Port Manager Adolfo Ll. Amor, Jr.; x Vlason Enterprises as represented by its president, Vicente Angliongto; Singkong Trading Company as represented by Atty. Eddie Tamondong; Banco Du Brasil; Dusit International Co.; Thai-Nan Enterprises Ltd., and Thai-United Trading Co., Ltd.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> x x x<br><br>Summonses for the amended Petition were served on Atty. Joseph Capuyan for Med Line Philippines: Anglionto (through his secretary, Betty Bebero), Atty. Tamondong and Commissioner Mison.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Upon motion of the private respondent, the trial court allowed summons by publication to be served upon defendants who were not residents and had no direct representative in the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On January 29, 1990, private respondent moved to declare respondents in default, but the trial court denied the motion in its February 23, 1990 Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>, because Mangaoang and Amor had jointly filed a Motion to Dismiss, while Mison and Med Line had moved separately for an extension to file a similar motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Later it rendered an Order dated July 2, 1990, giving due course to the motions to dismiss filed by Mangaoang and Amor on the ground of litis pendentia, and by the commissioner and district collector of customs on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In another Order, the trial court dismissed the action against Med Line Philippines on the ground of litis pendentia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On two other occasions, private respondent again moved to declare the following in default: [Vlason], Quiray, Sy and Mison on March 26, 1990;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and Banco [do] Bra[s]il, Dusit International Co., Inc., Thai-Nan Enterprises Ltd. and Thai-United Trading Co., Ltd. on August 24, 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> There is no record, however, that the trial court acted upon the motions. On September 18, 1990, [private respondent] filed another Motion for leave to amend the petition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> alleging that its counsel failed to include "necessary and/or indispensable parties": Omega represented by Cadacio; and M/V Star Ace represented by Capt. Nahon Rada, relief captain. Aside from impleading these additional respondents, private respondent also alleged in the Second (actually, third) Amended Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> that the owners of the vessel intended to transfer and alienate their rights and interest over the vessel and its cargo, to the detriment of the private respondent.<br><br>The trial court granted leave to private respondent to amend its Petition, but only to exclude the customs commissioner and the district collector.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Instead, private respondent filed the "Second Amended Petition with Supplemental Petition" against Singkong Trading Company; and Omega and M/V Star Ace,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> to which Cadacio and Rada filed a Joint Answer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Declared in default in an Order issued by the trial court on January 23, 1991, were the following: Singkong Trading Co., Commissioner Mison, M/V Star Ace and Omega.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Private respondent filed, and the trial court granted, an ex parte Motion to present evidence against the defaulting respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Only private respondent, Atty. Tamondong, Commissioner Mison, Omega and M/V Star Ace appeared in the next pretrial hearing; thus, the trial court declared the other respondents in default and allowed private respondent to present evidence against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Cesar Urbino, general manager of private respondent, testified and adduced evidence against the other respondents, x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On December 29, 1990, private respondent and Rada, representing Omega, entered into a Memorandum of Agreement stipulating that Rada would write and notify Omega regarding the demand for salvage fees of private respondent; and that if Rada did not receive any instruction from his principal, he would assign the vessel in favor of the salvor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On February 18, 1991, the trial court disposed as follows:<br><br>"WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, based on the allegations, prayer and evidence adduced, both testimonial and documentary, the Court is convinced, that, indeed, defendants/respondents are liable to [private respondent] in the amount as prayed for in the petition for which it renders judgment as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">1.</td><td colspan="2" align="justify">Respondent M/V Star Ace, represented by Capt.

For their part, respondents-movants agreed not to appeal the Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> On March 8, 1991, private respondent moved for the execution of judgment, claiming that the trial court Decision had already become final and executory. The Motion was granted and a Writ of Execution was issued. To satisfy the Decision, Sheriffs Jorge Victorino, Amado Sevilla and Dionisio Camañgon were deputized on March 13, 1991 to levy and to sell on execution the defendants vessel and personal property.<br><br>x x x<br><br>On March 18, 1991, the Bureau of Customs also filed an ex parte Motion to recall the execution, and to quash the notice of levy and the sale on execution. Despite this Motion, the auction sale was conducted on March 21, 1991 by Sheriff Camañgon, with private respondent submitting the winning bid. The trial court ordered the deputy sheriffs to cease and desist from implementing the Writ of Execution and from levying on the personal property of the defendants. Nevertheless, Sheriff Camañgon issued the corresponding Certificate of Sale on March 27, 1991.<br></blockquote>On April 10, 1991, petitioner Banco do Brasil filed, by special appearance, an Urgent Motion to Vacate Judgement and to Dismiss Case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> on the ground that the February 18, 1991 Decision of the trial court is void with respect to it for having been rendered without validly acquiring jurisdiction over the person of Banco do Brasil. Petitioner subsequently amended its petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> to specifically aver that its special appearance is solely for the purpose of questioning the Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction.<br><br>On May 20, 1991, the trial court issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> acting favorably on petitioner's motion and set aside as against petitioner the decision dated February 18, 1991 for having been rendered without jurisdiction over Banco do Brasil's person. Private respondent sought reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of the Order dated May 20, 1991. However, the trial court in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> dated June 21, 1991 denied said motion.<br><br>Meanwhile, a <i>certiorari</i> petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> was filed by private respondent before public respondent Court of Appeals seeking to nullify the cease and desist Order dated April 5, 1991 issued by Judge Arsenio M. Gonong. Two (2) more separate petitions for <i>certiorari</i> were subsequently filed by private respondent. The second petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> sought to nullify the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dated June 26, 1992 setting aside the Deputy Sheriff's return dated April 1, 1991 as well as the certificate of sale issued by Deputy Sheriff Camañgon. The third petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> sought to nullify the Order dated October 5, 1992 of the Court of Tax Appeals directing the Commissioner of Customs to place Bureau of Customs and PNP officers and guards to secure the M/V Star Ace and its cargoes, make inventory of the goods stored in the premises as indicated to belong to the private respondent. Likewise challenged was the Order dated August 17, 1992 authorizing the sale of M/V Star Ace and its cargoes.<br><br>These three (3) petitions were consolidated and on July 19, 1993, the appellate court rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> granting private respondent's petitions, thereby nullifying and setting aside the disputed orders and effectively "<i>giving way to the entire [decision dated February 18, 1991 of the x x x Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 8, in Civil Case No. 89-51451 which <ins>remains valid, final and executory,</ins> if not yet wholly executed.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Private respondent Urbino, Vlason Enterprises and petitioner Banco do Brasil filed separate motions for reconsideration. For its part, petitioner Banco do Brasil sought reconsideration, insofar as its liability for damages, on the ground that there was no valid service of summons as service was on the wrong party - the ambassador of Brazil. Hence, it argued, the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over petitioner Banco do Brasil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Nonetheless, the appellate court denied the motions for reconsideration in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> dated August 15, 1995.<br><br>Hence, the instant petition.<br><br>Petitioner Banco do Brasil takes exception to the appellate court's declaration that the suit below is <i>in rem</i>, not <i>in personam,</i><i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></i> thus, service of summons by publication was sufficient for the court to acquire jurisdiction over the person of petitioner Banco do Brasil, and thereby liable to private respondent Cesar Urbino for damages claimed, amounting to $300,000.00. Petitioner further challenges the finding that the February 18, 1991 decision of the trial court was already final and thus, cannot be modified or assailed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Petitioner avers that the action filed against it is an action for damages, as such it is an action <i>in personam</i> which requires personal service of summons be made upon it for the court to acquire jurisdiction over it. However, inasmuch as petitioner Banco do Brasil is a <i>non-resident foreign corporation, not engaged in business in the Philippines</i>, unless it has property located in the Philippines which may be attached to convert the action into an action <i>in rem</i>, the court cannot acquire jurisdiction over it in respect of an action <i>in personam</i>.<br><br>The petition bears merit, thus the same should be as it is hereby granted.<br><br>First. When the defendant is a nonresident and he is not found in the country, summons may be served extraterritorially in accordance with <i>Rule 14, Section 17</i><i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></i><i> </i><i>of the Rules of Court.</i> Under this provision, there are only four (4) instances when extraterritorial service of summons is proper, namely: "(1) when the action affects the personal status of the plaintiffs; (2) when the action relates to, or the subject of which is property, within the Philippines, in which the defendant claims a lien or interest, actual or contingent; (3) when the relief demanded in such action consists, wholly or in part, in excluding the defendant from any interest in property located in the Philippines; and (4) when the defendant non-resident's property has been attached within the Philippines."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In these instances, service of summons may be effected by (a) personal service out of the country, with leave of court; (b) publication, also with leave of court; or (c) any other manner the court may deem sufficient.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Clear from the foregoing, extrajudicial service of summons apply only where the action is <i>in rem</i>, an action against the thing itself instead of against the person, or in an action <i>quasi in rem</i>, where an individual is named as defendant and the purpose of the proceeding is to subject his interest therein to the obligation or loan burdening the property. This is so inasmuch as, in <i>in rem</i> and <i>quasi in rem</i> actions, jurisdiction over the person of the defendant is not a prerequisite to confer jurisdiction on the court provided that the court acquires jurisdiction over the <i>res</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>However, where the action is <i>in personam</i>, one brought against a person on the basis of his personal liability, jurisdiction over the person of the defendant is necessary for the court to validly try and decide the case. When the defendant is a <i>non-resident</i>, personal service of summons within the state is essential to the acquisition of jurisdiction over the person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> This cannot be done, however, if the defendant is not physically present in the country, and thus, the court cannot acquire jurisdiction over his person and therefore cannot validly try and decide the case against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, private respondent's suit against petitioner is premised on petitioner's being one of the claimants of the subject vessel M/V Star Ace.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Thus, it can be said that private respondent initially sought only to exclude petitioner from claiming interest over the subject vessel M/V Star Ace. However, private respondent testified during the presentation of evidence that, for being a nuisance defendant, petitioner caused irreparable damage to private respondent in the amount of $300,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Therefore, while the action is <i>in rem</i>, by claiming damages, the relief demanded went beyond the <i>res</i> and sought a relief totally alien to the action.<br><br>It must be stressed that any relief granted <i>in rem</i> or <i>quasi in rem</i> actions must be confined to the <i>res</i>, and the court cannot lawfully render a personal judgment against the defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Clearly, the publication of summons effected by private respondent is invalid and ineffective for the trial court to acquire jurisdiction over the person of petitioner, since by seeking to recover damages from petitioner for the alleged commission of an injury to his person or property<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> caused by petitioner's being a nuisance defendant, private respondent's action became <i>in personam</i>. Bearing in mind the <i>in personam</i> nature of the action, personal or, if not possible, substituted service of summons on petitioner, and not extraterritorial service, is necessary to confer jurisdiction over the person of petitioner and validly hold it liable to private respondent for damages. Thus, the trial court had no jurisdiction to award damages amounting to $300,000.00 in favor of private respondent and as against herein petitioner.<br><br>Second. We settled the issue of finality of the trial court's decision dated February 18, 1991 in the <i>Vlason</i> case, wherein we stated that, considering the admiralty case involved multiple defendants, "each defendant had a different period within which to appeal, depending on the date of receipt of decision."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Only upon the lapse of the reglementary period to appeal, with no appeal perfected within such period, does the decision become final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>In the case of petitioner, its Motion to Vacate Judgment and to Dismiss Case was filed on April 10, 1991, only six (6) days after it learned of the existence of the case upon being informed by the Embassy of the Federative Republic of Brazil in the Philippines, on April 4, 1991, of the February 18, 1991 decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Thus, in the absence of any evidence on the date of receipt of decision, other than the alleged April 4, 1991 date when petitioner learned of the decision, the February 18, 1991 decision of the trial court cannot be said to have attained finality as regards the petitioner.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the subject petition is hereby GRANTED.
