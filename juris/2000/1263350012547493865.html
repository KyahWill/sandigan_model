At the time the original action for quieting of title was filed in the trial court, petitioner had an unpaid balance of P1,000.00 as to Lot No. 9 and P3,020.00 as to Lot No. 10. The titles to the said lots remained in the name of respondent Galeos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> As emphasized by the Court of Appeals, the contract of sale involving Lot No. 10 expressly provided that "the parties both agree that a final deed of sale shall be executed, in favor of the buyer upon full and complete payment of the total purchase price agreed upon."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>After the sale, petitioner introduced certain improvements on the said lots and started to reside therein in 1970.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Since then petitioner has been in actual and physical possession of the two (2) lots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>However, on December 7, 1968, about two (2) months from the date of the previous sale to petitioner, respondent Galeos sold the entire subdivision, including the two (2) lots, to his co-respondent Eugenio Amores.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Subsequently, petitioner was informed by respondent Galeos about the sale to respondent Amores and was advised to pay the balance of the purchase price of the two (2) lots directly to respondent Amores.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>After the sale of the entire subdivision to respondent Amores, he allegedly took possession thereof and developed the same for residential purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Respondent Amores registered the deed of sale covering the entire subdivision on February 13, 1969,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> secured the transfer of the title to the same in his name, subdivided the entire land, and acquired individual titles to the subdivided lots in his name, including the title of the two (2) lots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> TCT No. 20016 was issued for Lot No. 9 and TCT No. 20017 for Lot No. 10, both in the name of respondent Amores.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On December 27, 1974, respondent Amores sold the two (2) lots to the spouses Mariano and Felisa Nemenio, two of the respondents herein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Prior to the sale, however, petitioner was informed through a letter by respondent Amores about the impending sale of the two (2) lots but the former failed to respond.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The respondent spouses Nemenio caused the transfer of the titles<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> to the said lots and the issuance of tax declarations in their names. Thereafter, the respondent spouses Nemenio demanded from petitioner to vacate the said lots but the latter refused to do so.<br><br>Thus, a complaint for quieting of title was filed by the respondent spouses Nemenio against petitioner in the Regional Trial Court of Cebu, Branch V, docketed as Civil Case No. R-15442.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, respondents Galeos and Amores were impleaded by petitioner as third-party defendants.<br><br>On November 27, 1986, the trial court rendered a decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> declaring the respondent spouses Nemenio as the owners of Lot Nos. 9 and 10.

This Court is not a trier of facts. It is a settled doctrine that findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are binding and conclusive upon this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Such factual findings shall not be disturbed, unless: (1) the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmise and conjecture; (2) the inference made is manifestly mistaken; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case and its findings are contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellees; (7) the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) said findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> After a careful scrutiny of the records and the pleadings submitted by the parties, we find exception to the general rule that factual findings by the trial court, especially when affirmed by the appellate court, are binding and conclusive upon this Court and hold that the lower courts misappreciated the evidence proffered. Certain relevant facts were overlooked by the respondent court, which facts, if properly appreciated, would justify a different conclusion from the one reached in the assailed decision.<br><br>Regarding the nature of the action filed before the trial court, quieting of title is a common law remedy for the removal of any cloud upon or doubt or uncertainty with respect to title to real property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Originating in equity jurisprudence, its purpose is to secure "...an adjudication that a claim of title to or an interest in property, adverse to that of the complainant, is invalid, so that the complainant and those claiming under him may be forever afterward free from any danger of hostile claim."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In an action for quieting of title, the competent court is tasked to determine the respective rights of the complainant and other claimants, "...not only to place <i>things in their proper place</i>, to make the one who has no rights to said immovable <i>respect and not disturb</i> the other, but also for the <i>benefit of both</i>, so that he who has the right would see every <i>cloud of doubt</i> over the property dissipated, and he could afterwards without fear <i>introduce the improvements</i> he may desire, to <i>use</i>, and even to <i>abuse</i> the property as he deems best (citation omitted)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Such remedy may be availed of under the circumstances enumerated in the Civil Code:<br><blockquote>"ART. 476. Whenever there is a cloud on title to real property or any interest therein, by reason of any instrument, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding which is apparently valid or effective but is in truth and in fact invalid, ineffective, voidable, or unenforceable, and may be prejudicial to said title, an action may be brought to remove such cloud or to quiet the title.<br><br>An action may also be brought to prevent a cloud from being cast upon title to real property or any interest therein."<br></blockquote>With these in mind, we now proceed to resolve the merits of the instant controversy.<br><br>In this petition, petitioner emphatically contends that respondent Amores, the second buyer, cannot be categorized as a purchaser in good faith, arguing on the basis of the letter which the latter sent to the petitioner, reminding the petitioner of his overdue account and warning him that if he could not come up with the proper solution, it would be his last chance before respondent Amores does other remedies before the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The respondent court, in its decision dated April 30, 1992, rejected this contention and adopted the finding of the trial court that "...at the time of the sale to [respondent] Amores by the previous registered owner Constantino Galeos sometime in 1968, [respondent] Amores found no improvements established on the land subject of the sale, and [respondent] Galeos’ title to the lots was clean and unencumbered, and that [respondent] Amores came to know of the sale by installment executed between [respondent] Galeos and [petitioner] Baricuatro only after the sale of said lots to him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The respondent court discarded petitioner’s argument and ruled that "[t]he fact that [respondent] Amores subsequently tried to collect the balance of the purchase price from [petitioner] Baricuatro as shown by his letter to [petitioner] Baricuatro dated November 10, 1972 does not by itself prove that he was aware of the previous transaction with [petitioner] Baricuatro at the time of the sale to him in 1968, that would place him in the category of a buyer in bad faith."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>We do not agree. Article 1544 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>"ART. 1544. If the same thing should have been sold to different vendees, the ownership shall be transferred to the person who may have first taken possession thereof in good faith, if it should be movable property.<br><br><b>Should it be immovable property, the ownership shall belong to the person acquiring it who <u>in good faith first recorded it in the Registry of Property</u>.</b><br><br>Should there be no inscription, the ownership shall pertain to the person who in good faith was first in the possession; and, in the absence thereof, to the person who presents the oldest title, provided there is good faith." (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Under article 1544, the ownership of an immovable property shall belong to the purchaser who <b>in good faith registers it first</b> in the registry of property. As we ruled in the case of <b><i>Uraca vs. Court of Appeals:</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><blockquote><center>"xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;xxx<br></center><br>...the prior registration of the disputed property by the second buyer does not by itself confer ownership or a better right over the property. <b>Article 1544 requires that such registration must be coupled with good faith.</b> Jurisprudence teaches us that "(t)he governing principle is <i>primus tempore, potior jure</i> (first in time, stronger in right). Knowledge gained by the first buyer of the second sale cannot defeat the first buyer's rights except where the second buyer registers in <i>good faith</i> the second sale <i>ahead</i> of the first, as provided by the Civil Code. Such knowledge of the first buyer does not bar her from availing of her rights under the law, among them, to register <i>first</i> her purchase as against the second buyer. But in <i>converso</i>, knowledge gained by the second buyer of the first sale defeats his rights even if he is first to register the second sale, since such knowledge taints his prior registration with bad faith. <b>This is the price exacted by Article 1544 of the Civil Code for the second buyer being able to displace the first buyer; that before the second buyer can obtain priority over the first, <i>he must show that he acted in good faith throughout (i.e. in ignorance of the first sale and of the first buyer's rights) — from the time of acquisition until the title is transferred to him by registration or failing registration, by delivery of possession.</i></b> xxx xxx."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br><br><b>"The second buyer must show continuing good faith and innocence or lack of knowledge of the first sale until his contract ripens into full ownership through prior registration as provided by law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48] </sup></b>(Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>For a second buyer to successfully invoke the protection provided by article 1544 of the Civil Code, he must possess good faith from the time of acquisition of the property until the registration of the deed of conveyance covering the same.<br><br>In the instant case, both lower courts attributed good faith to respondent Amores, the second buyer of the disputed lots, particularly at the consummation of the second sale on December 7, 1968 when respondents Amores and Galeos executed a deed of absolute sale,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> after observing that respondent Amores "found no improvements established on the land subject of the sale" at the time of the sale in December 1968 and "[respondent] Galeos’ title to the lots was clean and unencumbered," and that "[respondent] Amores came to know of the sale by installment executed between [respondent] Galeos and [petitioner] Baricuatro only after the sale of said lots to him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that respondent Amores was in good faith when he bought the entire subdivision, including the two (2) disputed lots, from respondent Galeos on December 7, 1968, there is no showing in the assailed decision that he continued to act in good faith until the title to the property was transferred to him by registration in the Register of Deeds on February 13, 1969, as required by Article 1544, hence the need for a reevaluation of the factual findings of the respondent court.<br><br>A careful and thorough scrutiny of the records of this case reveals that respondent Amores did not act in good faith when he registered his title to the disputed lots on February 13, 1969. Assuming that respondent Amores was in good faith when he bought the disputed lots on December 7, 1968, however, when he registered his title on February 13, 1969, the preponderance of evidence supports the finding that he already had knowledge of the previous sale of the disputed lots to petitioner. Such knowledge tainted his registration with bad faith. To merit protection under article 1544, the second buyer must act in good faith from the time of the sale until the registration of the same.<br><br><b>First</b>, as culled from the records of this case, respondent Galeos disclosed to the trial court that it was his agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> with respondent Amores that those who have obligations with respect to the disputed lots would continue to pay to respondent Amores, thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">&nbsp; </td><td valign="top" width="90%"> <div align="justify">"xxx xxx <br><br></div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"> ATTY.

In the said letter, respondent Galeos stated that "...he has been informed that collections effected on the contracts I have assigned to Mr. Eugenio V. Amores has (sic) not been moving for reasons known only to you" and that "[i]t appears on his [respondent Amores’] record and confirmed to be correct that all the contracts have gone beyond the limitations and restrictions pertinent thereto."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Consistent with our finding that respondent Amores was not without knowledge of the previous sale to petitioner when he acquired and registered the disputed lots, is the tone and contents of respondent Amores’ letter dated November 10, 1972 and addressed to petitioner, written allegedly to verify the truth about the previous sale from petitioner. As found by respondent court, the said letter obviously shows an intent to collect the balance of the purchase price of the disputed lots from petitioner which presupposes knowledge of the previous sale by respondent Amores. Such an attempt to collect the balance of the purchase price supports our finding that respondent Amores had knowledge of the previous sale when he bought the disputed lots.<br><br><b>Third</b> and most enlightening is respondent Amores’ testimony on cross-examination which contradicts his own testimony on direct examination regarding the time when he first learned of the transaction between respondent Galeos and petitioner.
