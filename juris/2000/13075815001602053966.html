Dagulo talked with the bank manager and was told to accompany accused-appellant Vidal Valdez inside the bank manager's office. Inside the bank manager's office, accused-appellant Vidal Valdez showed a folder to the bank manager but the latter could not accommodate him because she had not received such letter. While Dagulo was inside the bank manager's office with accused-appellant Vidal Valdez, the other security guard, Romeo Aganon was posted at the main door of the bank.

The trial court rejected the defense of alibi interposed by accused-appellants, relying instead on the positive identification of accused-appellants as two (2) of the perpetrators of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Regarding the .22 caliber revolver which was recovered by the police authorities upon information obtained from accused-appellant Vidal Valdez, the trial court ruled that there was no evidence on record showing that the said firearm was used during the commission of the robbery with homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> However, with regard to the .45 caliber revolver taken from accused-appellant Sales Sabadao upon his arrest, the trial court ruled that the said firearm was used in the fatal shooting of security guard Romeo Aganon and Pfc. Arnulfo Valera.</p> <p>Hence, this appeal. In their appellants' brief, accused-appellants raise the following assignment of errors:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> </p> <p align="center">I</p> <blockquote> <p>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN ADMITTING THE .45 CALIBER PISTOL IN EVIDENCE AGAINST SALES SABADAO IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. 2549-18.</p></blockquote> <p align="center">II</p> <blockquote> <p>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN ADMITTING THE .22 CALIBER REVOLVER AGAINST VIDAL VALDEZ IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. 2548-18.</p></blockquote> <p align="center">III</p> <blockquote> <p>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN CONVICTING SALES SABADAO AND VIDAL VALDEZ OF ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF FIREARMS IN CRIMINAL CASE NOS. 2548-18 AND 2549-18 RESPECTIVELY, INSPITE OF THE ABSENCE OF ANY CERTIFICATION FROM THE FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES UNIT OF THE PNP THAT THE SEIZED FIREARMS WERE UNLICENSED.</p></blockquote> <p align="center">IV</p> <blockquote> <p>THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED SALES SABADAO AND VIDAL VALDEZ OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO ESTABLISH THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.</p></blockquote> <p>The appeal is partly meritorious. The Court finds accused-appellants liable for robbery with homicide, but not for illegal possession of firearm and ammunition.</p> <p>In view of the enactment of Republic Act No. 8294 on July 6, 1997, amending certain provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1866, thereby considering the use of an unlicensed firearm simply as an aggravating circumstance in the murder or homicide case, and not as a separate offense;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the Court sees no need to discuss the first three (3) issues raised by accused-appellants. We reiterate that there can be no separate conviction for illegal possession of firearm under Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended, if homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, such use of an unlicensed firearm being merely considered as an aggravating circumstance in the murder or homicide case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></p> <p>Coming now to the fourth assigned error, accused-appellants contend that the trial court erred in convicting them of robbery with homicide despite the failure of the prosecution to establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt. As stated at the outset, we are not persuaded by accused-appellants' arguments on this point. Robbery with homicide, a special complex crime, is primarily a crime against property and not against persons, homicide being a mere incident of the robbery with the latter being the main purpose and object of the criminal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The essential elements of robbery with homicide are: (a) the taking of personal property with the use of violence or intimidation against a person; (b) the property thus taken belongs to another; (c) the taking is characterized by intent to gain or <i>animus lucrandi</i>; and (d) on the occasion of the robbery or by reason thereof, the crime of homicide which is therein used in a generic sense, was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> </p> <p>Upon a careful scrutiny of the records, the Court is convinced beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellants were indeed guilty of the crime of robbery with homicide. As aptly observed by the trial court:</p> <blockquote> <p>"xxx xxx.</p> <p>"Certain conclusions are inevitable from the appraisal and evaluation of the facts narrated in the respective testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution. First is the fact of loss by the bank in the amount of P4,200.00 and the divestment, although momentarily, of the firearm issues of Security Guards Flordelino Dagulo and the deceased Romeo Aganon, a .38 Caliber Revolver and a shot gun, respectively, both valued in the amount of P14,000.00. Pat. Arnulfo Valera and Security Guard Romeo Aganon were fatally shot on the occasion of the forcible taking of the cash and firearm(s) and the more adventurous purpose of looting the volume of fortune kept in the vault. Vidal Valdez was proved to be in possession of, without any license or authority therefor, the .22 Caliber Magnum Tell Revolver bearing number 143852 with live ammunitions in its chamber. Also, Sales Sabadao was in illegal possession of the .45 Caliber Pistol with trademark "Ithaca" and with serial No. 2099911. Four armed robbers intruded into the RCBC in Batac, Ilocos Norte that June 23, 1987.</p> <p>"xxx xxx."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></p></blockquote> <p>Accused-appellants argue that they were not adequately identified as the perpetrators of the robbery with homicide, claiming that there was no clear and convincing proof that either of them caused the death of any of the victims, and "the prosecution was not able to establish who actually shot who during the melee which accompanied the robbery."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The argument is unacceptable. The rule is well-established that whenever homicide has been committed as a consequence of or on the occasion of the robbery, all those who took part as principals in the robbery will also be held guilty as principals of the special complex crime of robbery with homicide although they did not actually take part in the homicide, unless it clearly appears that they endeavored to prevent the homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> In the case at bar, it has not been shown that accused-appellants tried to prevent the shooting of the three (3) fatalities. Moreover, the finding of conspiracy made by the trial court is well-grounded. Conspiracy can be inferred from the acts of the malefactors before, during, and after the commission of the crime which are indicative of a joint purpose, concerted action, and concurrence of sentiments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> In the instant case, the cooperative acts of accused-appellants toward their common criminal objective render them equally liable as conspirators. We quote with approval the following observation by the trial court: </p> <blockquote> <p>"xxx xxx.</p> <p>"Various episode[s] or chapter[s] in the RCBC raid depict in vivid and clear details the existence or manifestation of a conspiracy. Such details reveal a previously designed scheme of entry and plan of operation, first, Vidal Valdez gaining foothold by holding in captivity Evangeline Rubio, the Manager and also one of the security guards, Flordelino Dagulo. Further deployment of reinforcement is shown by the concerted entry of two (2) more of the conspirators then followed by the fourth [conspirator] to complete [the] strength of force that constituted the conspiracy and calculated to make effective their nefarious venture. With this entry and beachhead in place, the implementation of the plan of action then started with the taking of valuables, first, divesting the two (2) security guards of their firearms to weaken, if not to destroy the capability of the captives and then thereafter effecting their final mission or purpose, grabbing of (sic) bundles of cash and the opening of the vault. This taking of the cash of (sic) P4,200.00 by the dead robber, Charles Bayed and then thereafter by the fourth robber, Charlo Mayo [should be Albert Abangon], and the taking of the firearms of the two (2) security guards completed the act constituting robbery though a more extensive loot would have been gained in (sic) the opening of the vault of the bank."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></p></blockquote> <p>Hence, in view of the presence of conspiracy, all the perpetrators of the crime shall bear equal responsibility.</p> <p>Furthermore, accused-appellants insist that they should be held liable only for attempted robbery because they "were not able to perform all the acts of execution,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and "the prosecution was not able to concretely establish that the accused robbers were able to take any money away."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> The contention is untenable. Well-settled is the rule that generally, the factual findings of the trial court will not be disturbed since it is in a better position to appreciate the conflicting testimonies of the witnesses, having observed their deportment and manner of testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Applying the foregoing principle to this case, no cogent reasons appear for this Court to depart from the findings of the trial court that the malefactor took P4,200.00 in cash and the service firearms of the bank's security guards, which findings are final and conclusive. Besides, we find no circumstance of weight or significance that would impair the correctness and validity of the findings of fact and conclusions of the trial court.</p> <p>Accused-appellants also fault two (2) prosecution witnesses for, either giving incomplete statements or not giving any statement to the police authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> We are not persuaded. It is a matter of judicial experience that an affidavit, being taken <i>ex-parte</i>, is almost always incomplete and often inaccurate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> To be sure, a sworn statement taken <i>ex parte </i>is generally considered to be inferior to a testimony given in open court as the latter is subject to the test of cross examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></p> <p>As to the civil liability imposed by the trial court, some modifications are in order. The trial court erred in not awarding in favor of the victims' heirs civil indemnity under Article 2206 of the Civil Code, which current jurisprudence has fixed at P50,000.00. The award for actual damages in favor of the heirs of Romeo Aganon, in the amount of P7,617.50 is reduced to P7,217.50; and in favor of the heirs of Pfc. Arnulfo Valera, in the amount of P24,000.00 is reduced to P13,500.00; for such were the amounts duly proved and supported by receipts presented in the course of the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> With regard to the other funeral and burial expenses allegedly incurred by the heirs of the victims, the prosecution merely presented a list of the said expenses without producing any receipt or other evidence to support such claim. Be that as it may, accused-appellants should pay the heirs of the victims temperate damages in the amount of P10,000.00. Under Article 2224 of the Civil Code, temperate damages "may be recovered when the court finds that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its amount cannot, from the nature of the case, be proved with certainty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> As to exemplary damages, the same may be granted in criminal cases as part of the civil liability if the crime was committed with one or more aggravating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> As found by the trial court, the commission of the robbery with homicide was attended by the aggravating circumstance of band, having been perpetrated by more than three (3) armed malefactors who acted together in the commission thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Thus, an award of P20,000.00 as exemplary damages in favor of the heirs of the victims is in order. </p> <p><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the assailed decision of Regional Trial Court of Batac, Ilocos Norte, Branch 18, in Criminal Case No. 2547-18 convicting accused-appellants Vidal Valdez and Sales Sabadao of the crime of robbery with homicide and sentencing each of them to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>is hereby <strong>AFFIRMED</strong>, subject to the modification that the said accused-appellants are hereby <strong>ORDERED</strong> to pay, jointly and severally: (1) the heirs of Romeo Aganon, the sums of P50,000.00 as indemnity; P7,217.50 as actual damages; P50,000.00 as moral damages; P10,000.00 as temperate damages; and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages.
