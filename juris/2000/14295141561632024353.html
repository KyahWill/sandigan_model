				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Because prosecutions involving illegal drugs depend largely on the credibility of the police officers who conducted the "buy-bust" operation, the Court relies on the rule that the weighing of evidence, particularly conflicts in the testimonies of witnesses, is best left to the discretion of the trial court, which had the unique opportunity to observe their demeanor, conduct and manner while testifying. Hence, its factual findings are accorded respect, even finality, absent any showing that certain facts of weight and substance bearing on the elements of the crime have been overlooked, misapprehended or misapplied. Once the elements of the crime are established, the hackneyed defense of frame-up or "<i>hulidap</i>" must be clearly proven by the appellants. Again, the defense being factual, its tenability depends largely on the trial court's assessment of the credibility of the testimonial evidence of the accused. In the present appeal, the defense has failed to convince us that the trial court's Decision should be disbelieved or modified, much less reversed. On the contrary, we believe that the said Decision is clear, convincing and correct.<br><br><center><b><i>The Case</i></b><br></center><br>Before the Court is an appeal by Chen Tiz Chang and Chen Jung San, also known as Willy Tan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> challenging the October 16, 1997 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City (Branch 95) in Criminal Case No. Q-96-68250-51, finding them guilty of <i>illegal possession</i> and sale of shabu<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and sentencing each of them to two counts of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.

Upon receipt of such classified information, Police Superintendent Purisima ordered the surveillance of two (2) Chinese nationals who were reportedly members of a drug syndicate. With the assistance of an informant, members of Task Force Spider were able to establish contact with suspected members of the drug syndicate (TSN, December 18, 1996, p. 7), two (2) of whom are herein appellants.<br><br>"In the early morning of October 31, 1996, through the informant, members of Task Force Spider were able to get in touch with appellants with a use of a cellular phone and negotiate a drug deal with them. Appellant agreed to deliver and sell two (2) kilos of shabu at the parking lot of the Maalikaya Health Palace located at Quezon Avenue, Quezon City (<i>Ibid.</i>, 7).<br><br>"PO2 Hilarion Juan, a member of Task Force Spider, testified that on October 31, 1996, at 7:00 o'clock in the morning, Police Superintendent Allan Purisima conducted a briefing at Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig, Metro Manila. The subject of the briefing was the buy-bust operation involving the sale of shabu by appellants at the Maalikaya Health Palace parking lot at Quezon City (<i>Ibid.</i>, 5-7; TSN, December 16, 1996, p. 4). The members of the task force were assigned to observe and monitor the suspects at Maalikaya Health Palace (TSN, December 16, 1998, p. 3-4). The briefing, which lasted for around 30 minutes, was attended by four police officers, namely: PO2 Hilarion Juan, SPO2 Jesus Bernal Camacho, SPO2 Bernardito Lagdameo and PO2 Jose Bernadino Jr. (<i>Ibid.</i>, 5-6). PO2 Hilarion Juan was designated to act as the poseur-buyer together with the informant, while the three (3) other police officers were tasked to position themselves at some distance from the poseur-buyers and assist in the buy-bust operation (TSN, December 18, 1996, p. 7).<br><br>"After the briefing, the members of the team prepared the buy-bust money made of genuine P100.00 peso bills and P500.00 peso bills in the amount P700,000.00, while the rest were photocopied money (<i>Ibid.</i>, 7), all of which totaled P2,000,000.00 (TSN, April 8, 1997, p. 9). From their office at Bagong Diwa, Taguig, Metro Manila, they proceeded to the Maalikaya Health Palace, in Quezon City.<br><br>"At 11:00 o'clock that morning, PO2 Juan, the informant and other police officers positioned themselves at the Maalikaya Health Palace parking area. After thirty (30) minutes, a red-colored Daihatsu Feroza bearing plate No. TBU-479 (Exhibits 'L' to 'L-3') (hereinafter described as Feroza) arrived with the appellants on board (TSN, December 16, 1996, p. 5). PO2 Juan and the informant approached appellants who were then on board the Feroza. Appellants conversed with PO2 Juan (TSN, December 16, 1996, p. 6) and the informant introduced PO2 Juan to appellants as an interested buyer (TSN, December 16, 1996, p. 8). Chen Jung San left the place and drove the Feroza towards EDSA while Chen Tiz Chang was left behind (TSN, December 16, 1996, pp. 6-7). Later, the Feroza reappeared (<i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 5-7). Appellant Chen Tiz Chang emerged from the Feroza and initiated conversation about the sale of shabu (TSN, December 18, 1996, p.11).<br><br>"The informant instructed PO2 Juan to hand over the suitcase containing buy-bust money to Chen Tiz Chang (<i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 11-12) which Juan did and in return Chen Tiz Chang handed to PO2 Juan a black bag (Exhibit 'D') which contained 2 plastic transparent bags of shabu (<i>Ibid.</i>, 12). (Exhibits 'E' and 'F'). After the exchange, PO2 Juan opened the black bag (Exhibit 'D'), examined the two (2) plastic bags (<i>Ibid.</i>, id) and signaled his companions to approach him. PO2 Juan introduced himself as a police officer (<i>Ibid.</i>, 13) and tried to arrest appellant Chen Tiz Chang who, after Juan took hold of him, resisted (<i>Ibid.</i>, 13-14). Appellant Chen Tiz Chang was able to free himself from PO2 Juan and ran towards a nearby car about five (5) meters away from where the buy-bust operation took place, and passed the suitcase containing the buy-bust money to an unidentified person on board (<i>Ibid.</i>, 14). Then, the car sped away with the buy-bust money (<i>Ibid.</i>, id; TSN, April 8, 1997, p. 7). Due to Chen Tiz Chang's attempt to evade arrest (TSN, December 18, 1996, p. 14) a commotion ensued prompting the three (3) other members of the team to respond in order to assist PO2 Juan in subduing Chen Tiz Chang (TSN, April 8, 1997, p. 7,16). The three (3) other police officers who were positioned about 5 to 10 meters away (TSN, December 18, 1996, p. 13), after announcing themselves as police officers (TSN, December 16, 1996, pp. 8-9), helped PO2 Juan in affecting the arrest of Chen Tiz Chang by handcuffing him (TSN, December 18, 1998, p. 14). The police officers could not pursue the person [i]n the vehicle with the buy-bust money, because the team was only composed of four members (TSN, December 18, 1998, p. 15) and between the money and the shabu recovered from appellants, the police officers chose to ensure the custody of the shabu which would be used as evidence against appellant (TSN, April 8, 1997, p. 18). PO2 Juan observed that the unidentified person who fled with the buy-bust money was already at the parking area when the members of the Task Force Spider arrived for the buy-bust operation (TSN, December 18, 1998, p. 15). As PO2 Juan and SPO2 Camacho took Chen Tiz Chang to the Feroza, the other members of the team, namely, SPO2 Bernardito Lagdameo and PO2 Jose Bernardito Jr., were posted by the Feroza to guard the other passenger, appellant Chen Jung San, who himself had been arrested (TSN, December 18, 1996, 15). The police officers searched the Feroza and found underneath the driver's seat another plastic bag containing shabu weighing 943.5 grams [Exhibit 'G'] (<i>Ibid.</i>, 16). Whereupon, appellants, the seized shabu and the Feroza were brought to the office of the Task Force Spider (<i>Ibid.</i>, 17) for investigation. The team turned over appellants to SPO2 Lagdameo. Then, the police officers executed a Joint Affidavit of Apprehension (Exhibits 'K' to 'K2') and prepared the routine Booking Sheet Information Sheet and Arrest Report (Exhibits 'M' to 'M-1' and 'N' to 'N-1'). The following day they prepared the corresponding letter to the NBI requesting examination of the shabu they had recovered (Exhibits 'E', 'F' and 'G').<br><br>"Aida Pascual, Forensic Chemist in the Forensic Chemistry Division of the National Bureau of Investigation, testified that on November 1, 1996, at 1:10 p.m., she received from the Task Force Spider headed by Police Superintendent Purisima a letter request dated November 1, 1996, (Exhibit 'B', 'B-1', TSN, December 9, 1996, pp. 9-10) with [the] stamp mark of the Forensic Chemistry Division indicating that the following specimens had been received for examination (<i>Ibid.</i>, 9-11): two (2) kilos of white crystalline substance placed in transparent plastic packs marked CTC-1, (Exhibit 'E') to CTC-2 (Exhibit 'F'), and approximately one (1) kilo of white crystalline substance suspected to be shabu contained in one (1) transparent plastic pack marked CJS (Exhibit 'G') placed in a black bag (Exhibit 'D') (<i>Ibid.</i>, 13) which was in turn wrapped and sealed in an improvised brown bag with the markings DD-96-5012, DD-96-5013 re: Chen Tiz Chang; Chen Jung San; 11/1/96 (<i>Ibid.</i>, 11). The letter request was delivered to the NBI by PO2 Jose Bernardino, Jr. (Exhibit 'B-2').<br><br>"Aida Pascual weighed each of the specimens and recorded them as follows: Exhibit 'E'-971.7 grams; Exhibit 'F'-1,046 grams, Exhibit 'G'.-943.5 grams (<i>Ibid.</i>, 16), all of which were subjected to chemical and chromatographic examination by extracting representative samples from each specimen and spotting it on a chromatographic plate (<i>Ibid.</i>, 17), and then comparing it with the chromatographic plate spotted with a known methamphetamine hydrochloride (<i>Ibid.</i>, 32). On the same date, she issued her Certification (Exhibits 'H' to 'H-2') detailing her findings on the specimens which were found positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride, a regulated drug. On November 6, 1996, she issued Dangerous Drugs Report No. Dd-96-5012 (Exhibit 'I' to 'I-4'; <i>Ibid.</i>, 21) indicating therein her findings that the substance contained in the two (2) transparent plastic bags with a total weight of 2,017.7 grams (Exhibits 'E' and 'F') and respectively marked as CTC-1 and CTC-2 were found positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride, a regulated drug. She also issued Dangerous Drugs Report No. DD-96-5013 (Exhibits 'J' to 'J-4') where she indicated that the substance found in the transparent plastic bag marked as CJS (Exhibit 'G') which weighed 943.5 grams was positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><i>The Defense’s Version</i><br></div><br>On the other hand, the appellants<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> narrated the facts in this manner:<br><blockquote>"The cases at bar involve the much talked about and most commonly utilized method of apprehending alleged drug users and pushers by the law enforcing personalities, the so-called 'buy-bust' operation.<br><br>"Accused-appellant Chen Tiz Chang is a Taiwanese businessman engaged in the manufacture of watches and in the export and import of rattan products and seafoods. Sometime in October, 1996, he came to the Philippines from Taiwan, for a business venture and x x x he was to charter an airplane together with his business associates from Manila to Marshall Islands for the purpose of looking for supplies of seafoods to be shipped to Japan and Taiwan. In support of these claims, he presented several documents issued by the government of Taiwan (Exhs. '15' to '21', inclusive of submarkings.)<br><br>"The other accused-appellant, Chen Jung San, is a nephew of Chen Tiz Chang, and is likewise in the Philippines to pursue a business of melting scrap coppers and mold[ing] the same into other products like water pipes. He started this business in 1993 in association with some business partners but did not register his outfit in his name because of his Taiwan citizenship. He was involved [a] great deal with the technical side of his business concerns, the management of the affairs of his business being undertaken by his other partners. He had his company situs at Sta. Rosa, Marilao, Bulacan. He is married to a Filipina [with] the name of Ma. Luisa Santos with whom he has a son and was living with her in Caloocan City up to the time of his arrest.<br><br>"On October 30, 1996 at 11:00 a.m., the two accused-appellants went to the Maalikaya Health Complex along Quezon Avenue, Quezon City on board a Feroza car which was borrowed from a friend of accused-appellant Chen Jung San. They were to have lunch with a friend of Chen Tiz Chang, a certain Mr. Chua, who was at the nearby Mayflower restaurant along Timog Avenue, Quezon City. Said Mr. Chua called up accused-appellant Chen Tiz Chang advising him to wait for him for a while. It was while waiting for the arrival of Mr. Chua at the parking lot of Maalikaya Health Complex that three (3) unidentified males suddenly arrived and poked their guns at the two accused-appellants. With nary a word, both accused-appellant[s] were handcuffed and were forced to board a vehicle en route to the Anito Lodge along EDSA.<br><br>"While they were held in captivity inside the motel, some of the valuables of the accused-appellants were taken by their captors like an 18-karat gold Rolex watch studded with diamonds worth P3,000,000.00 belonging to accused-appellant Chen Tiz Chang, a cell-phone of Chen Jung San, and some cash. Whereupon, these supposed arresting officers demanded P20,000,000.00 from the two accused-appellants in exchange for their freedom, with the threat that should they fail, they [would] pursue the charges against them.<br><br>"In the afternoon of the following day, at about 4:00 p.m., after their plea for release was refused and their inability to produce the demanded amount became more real, they were brought to the office of the Task Force Spider where they were ordered not to talk to anybody, and if someone would ever ask what [was] their business in that office, they would just say, 'to visit a friend'. Chen Tiz Chang was then ordered by these 'officers' to call up his wife in Taiwan or anybody who could put up the necessary amount demanded by the men of Task Force Spider to buy their freedom. But because the two accused-appellants could not really come up with the demanded amount, they were told that they [would] be charged for violation of the Dangerous Drugs law and were thereupon brought to a room where several media men with cameras feasted on them.<br><br>"Thus, the two helpless and ill-fated accused were finally charged and brought to court to answer the charges they ha[d] never probably dreamt of committing."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>The Trial Court’s Ruling</i></b><br></div><br>In convicting appellants, the trial court relied on the testimonies of PO2 Hilarion Juan and SPO2 Jesus Camacho. It dismissed the inconsistencies in their testimonies as trivial. It likewise excused the non-presentation in court of the buy-bust money, which was not indispensable to the prosecution of the case. Upholding the prosecution, the lower court explained as follows:<br><blockquote>"Culled from the evidence, the Court rules that the prosecution was able to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>"The prosecution witnesses, specifically PO2 Hilarion Juan, categorically and candidly related to the Court [the] circumstances that led to the buy-bust operation involving the two (2) accused. Al[though] it may appear surprising that the P700,000.00 buy-bust money was never recovered as the same was allegedly taken away by another person riding in another vehicle, the same does not in [any way] affect the credibility of PO2 Juan. Persons in illegal drug activities, in view of the risk and the large amount of money involved, now adopt ways and means in order to ensure a successful operation and protect the buy money. It is not, therefore, surprising for drug pushers to employ other persons (not usually known to would be buyers) who are tasked to protect the buy-bust money in case something wrong might take place during the sale, like in these cases where the accused were apprehended. In fact, newspaper accounts show that drug pushers, although already behind bars, are still able to continue to ply their wares inside the detention cells with the use of cellular phones and even computers.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>"Furthermore, the non-presentation of the buy-bust money does not in any way prejudice the cause of the prosecution. In a catena of cases, the Honorable Supreme Court has ruled that the non-presentation of the buy-bust money is not indispensable in the offense of 'Drug Pushing' as long as there is actual delivery of the drugs, as what happened in these cases. x x x<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>"The Court is not likewise persuaded that the inconsistencies in the testimony of the prosecution's principal witness, PO2 Hilarion Juan, cast doubt on his credibility. For, if indeed there were inconsistencies, the same refer to trivial matters not sufficient to tarnish the credibility of his testimony; in fact, they serve to strengthen the credibility of his testimony. x x x<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>"The seeming contradiction between the testimony of PO2 Hilarion Juan that accused Chen Tiz Chang was the one who delivered the shabu and accused Chen Jung San remained in the vehicle and the testimony of PO2 Jesus Camacho that it was accused Chan Tiz Chang who remained in the vehicle and accused Chen Jung San was the one who delivered the stuff, does not substantially affect the credibility of PO2 Juan, the pos[eu]r-buyer. Except for this inconsistency, all the other material and substantial testimonies of these two (2) witnesses corroborate each other. Hence, the above-stated statements of the two (2) prosecution witnesses should not be considered to impair the credibility of each other's testimony considering that their testimonies are identical in all other aspects and they establish the essential requirements/elements of the offenses with the two (2) accused participating in the commission of the offenses.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>"The defense of denial of the accused cannot prevail over the positive assertions of the prosecution witnesses, as denial is a self-serving negative evidence.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>"The contention of the accused that their arrest was made on October 30, 1996 and not on October 31, 1996 is preposterous and a last futile attempt to convince the Court that the prosecution witnesses cannot be believed. A telephone call thru the cellular phone of accused Chen Jung San on October 30, 1996 as appearing in the billing statement (Exhs. '2' &amp; '2-A') of said cellular phone is not a conclusive evidence that the accused were actually arrested on October 30, 1996. For all we know, accused Chen Jung San himself made the call on October 30, 1996, when he was not yet arrested, [to] somebody in the office of the Task Force Spider. It is no longer unnatural for those involved in illegal drug activities to have friends within and outside police establishments. Moreover, the accused could have asked for the issuance of a subpoena <i>ad testificandum</i> on this Filosopo to compel him to testify and support the claim of both accused that he was one of the arresting officers [to] whom some of the calls were made on October 30, 1996, as appearing on the said [billing].<br><br>"It is interesting to note that the accused Chen Jung San, as admitted by him, has been using different names while in the country, thus inviting reasonable suspicion that he did so for ulterior motive. If this accused, a Taiwanese citizen, who was afforded the privilege of staying in the country to engage in business, can openly or brazenly disregard our laws pertaining to the use of several names, it is not far-fetched for him to commit other violation[s] of Philippine laws and hide his true identity by the mere expedient of using several names like Chen Jung San, Willy Tan, Chan Bim Seng and Philip Chan or Philip Chen.<br><br>"The argument of the accused that the Task Force Spider has been involved in anomalies involving the arrest of Chinese nationals which appeared in the Philippine Star (Exh. '27') is puerile considering that no other evidence was offered to substantiate said claim. And, finally, the argument that the allegations in the Affidavit of Apprehension in these cases (Exhs. 'K' to 'K-2) are identical to that of the allegations in the Affidavit of Apprehension involving another Chinese national (Exh. '1') does not necessarily mean that the allegations in both affidavits are not true.<br><br>"It is an accepted practice in police buy-bust operations that the manners of their conduct are almost always identical. To argue, therefore, that similarity in operation in two different buy-bust operations is an indicium of falsehood is a mere speculation or conjecture which can not provide basis for the exculpation of the accused from liability."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><i>Assignment of Errors</i></b><br></div><br>In their first Brief, appellants attribute to the trial court the following alleged errors:<br><blockquote><center>"I<br></center><br>The lower court erred in finding that the prosecution was able to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>The lower court erred in its appreciation of evidence leading to the conviction of the accused given the gross inconsistencies and stark incredibility of the prosecution’s witnesses<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>The lower court erred in holding that the accused conspired and confederated in selling and possessing several grams of shabu<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>The lower court erred in not at all affording the testimonies of the accused the slightest of probative weight not only to demonstrate their innocence but more importantly, to invariably show that theirs was a simple case of kidnap and extortion"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On the other hand, their second Brief cites this sole error for our consideration:<br><blockquote>"The verdict of guilty against appellants is a legal error in that the prosecution’s evidence failed to establish the required quantum of proof beyond reasonable doubt to overthrow the constitutional presumption of innocence in appellant’s favor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>In resolving this appeal, the Court will discuss two main questions: (1) the sufficiency of the prosecution evidence and (2) the merits of the <i>hulidap</i> defense.<br><br><center><b><i>The Court’s Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>The appeal has no merit.<br><br><center><i><b>Main Issue:</b><br>Sufficiency of Prosecution’s Evidence</i><br></center><br>In <i>People v.

Here, we see no reason to depart from the general rule."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>In the present case, the appellants have not convinced us to exempt them from the general rule.<br><br><i>Proven Elements of the Crimes</i><br><br>In every prosecution, the guilt of the accused has to be established invariably by proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The elements of the crime must be shown to exist and be adequately proven.

In <i>People v. Tang Wai Lan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Court held:<br><blockquote>"A sample taken from one (1) of the packages is logically presumed to be representative of the entire contents of the package unless proven otherwise by accused-appellant. Therefore, a positive result for the presence of drugs is indicative that there is 1.1 kilogram of drugs in the plastic package from which the sample was taken."<br></blockquote>We are not persuaded by the argument that the samples examined were not taken from the drugs seized. On the contrary, the testimonies of <i>all</i> the prosecution witnesses fairly established that the shabu taken from the appellants is the same substance examined by the forensic chemist and later presented as evidence in court. Verily, the presumption of regularity must prevail over appellants’ unfounded allegations and speculations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Appellants’ behavior during the entrapment showed that there was conspiracy between them and a third person who got away with the buy-bust money. It is an established rule that <i>direct proof is not essential to establish conspiracy, as it may be inferred from the acts of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime</i>, all of which indubitably point to or indicate a joint purpose, a concert of action and a community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of the crime and, consequently, appellants’ guilt. As a result of a valid buy-bust operation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> appellants were caught <i>in flagrante</i> selling two packs of shabu to the poseur-buyer. As a consequence of a search incident to a lawful arrest, a third pack also containing shabu was likewise found inside their vehicle. Moreover, the substance seized from them was confirmed to be shabu.<br><br><i>Alleged Inconsistencies</i><br><br>Appellants enumerate certain inconsistencies in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses that supposedly manifested lack of credibility: the alleged discrepancies regarding the source of information of their alleged illegal activities, the failure to present the informant, the surveillance conducted, the buy-bust money, the members of the buy-bust team and the time of the team's arrival at the Maalikaya Health Palace.<br><br>We agree with the trial court, however, that most of these points refer to trivial matters that have no bearing on the elements of the crime. <i>First</i>, these are peripheral matters that do not detract from what has been established by the evidence for the prosecution. Hence, we have consistently held that the prior surveillance of the suspected offender<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and the presentation of the informant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and the buy-bust money<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> are not indispensable to the prosecution of drug cases.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the records show that the alleged inconsistencies as to the source of information and the time of the team's arrival at the place of arrest were supplied by the appellants rather than implied from the prosecution witnesses' testimonies. Likewise, we find no merit in appellants’ argument regarding the surveillance, the informant and the buy-bust money. We observe that SPO2 Jesus Bernal Camacho <i>failed to mention</i> the existence of the informant and the buy-bust money,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> but he did not deny their presence either. In like manner, he did not state that PO2 Hilarion Juan never conducted a surveillance of the appellants.<br><br>To secure a reversal of the appealed judgment, the inconsistencies should have pertained to the actual buy-bust itself -- that crucial moment when the appellants were caught selling or in possession of shabu -- not to peripheral matters. On this point, appellants stress that the two police officers, who conducted the buy-bust operation, narrated two conflicting tales, as allegedly shown by the following:<br><blockquote>1. Camacho claimed that Chen Jung San left the place for around thirty minutes while Chen Tiz Chang was conversing with the poseur-buyer; Juan did not mention this.<br><br>2. According to Camacho, it was Appellant Chen Jung San who handed the two packs of shabu to Juan; Juan said that it was Chen Tiz Chang who had done so.<br><br>3. Juan claimed that the informant was with him during the exchange; Camacho never mentioned this informant.<br><br>4. Juan testified that after the exchange, when he and Camacho introduced themselves as police officers, Chen Tiz Chang <i>resisted arrest</i> and managed to pass on to a third person the "boodle" money; Camacho merely claimed that he and Juan had <i>invited</i> the appellants, but did not mention any third person getting away with the loot.<br><br>5. Lastly, Juan stated that they discovered a third pack of shabu under a seat of the vehicle used by appellants; Camacho did not mention the existence of this third pack.<br></blockquote>As the trial court correctly pointed out, Camacho acted merely as a back-up to Juan. This explains why the account of Camacho was rather hazy compared to the unclouded narration of Juan. Unlike the poseur-buyer who had direct contact with the appellants during the entrapment, Camacho was standing about ten to fifteen meters away from the scene and was thus hindered in his appreciation of the incident. Furthermore, his attention was divided between watching Chen Tiz Chang with the poseur-buyer and keeping an eye on Chen Jung San. We must stress that the assessment of the credibility of the two prosecution witness is best left to the discretion of the trial judge, who had observed their demeanor, conduct and manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Salinas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> we held:<br><blockquote>"The alleged contradictions and inconsistencies are, in the main, minor and immaterial since the sale of the regulated drug was clearly and categorically established by the testimony of the poseur-buyer, PO2 Benito Basilio, Jr. The testimony of SPO3 Ely Ramos regarding the sale of ‘shabu’ by the accused Rodolfo Salinas to PO2 Basilio cannot be expected to be as detailed and as accurate as the latter’s account because it was only Basilio who actually approached and transacted with Salinas while SPO3 Ely Ramos stayed some distance away and strategically positioned himself so he could see Basilio make the pre-arranged signal for the arrest of Salinas. The minor inconsistencies as to the details of the sale of ‘shabu’ may be considered as badges of truth rather than of falsehood."<br></blockquote>In view of all the foregoing, we find that appellants failed to overthrow the presumption of regularity accorded the police officers in the performance of their official duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><center><i><b>Second Issue:</b><br>Defense of Hulidap</i><br></center><br>As adverted to at the beginning of this <i>ponencia</i>, appellants raise the defense of frame-up or <i>hulidap</i>.<br><br>We expressed our disdain for the hackneyed defense of <i>hulidap</i> in <i>People v. Cheng Ho Chua</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> in which we said:<br><blockquote>"Courts generally view with disfavor this defense commonly raised in drug cases, for it is easy to concoct and difficult to prove. Moreover, there is a presumption that public officers, including the arresting officers, regularly perform their official duties. In the present case, the defense failed to overcome this presumption or to present clear and convincing evidence to prove ‘<i>hulidap</i>.’"<br></blockquote>In the present case, we agree with the solicitor general that appellants’ defense has not been established. They fail to describe the individuals allegedly responsible for the extortion. As to the phone calls traced to one Myrna Pilosopo and to the office of Task Force Spider, we agree with the People's counsel that these are mere speculations, since no proof was presented to show any connection between them and the kidnappers. Indeed, appellants merely gave general descriptions of these alleged kidnappers. Moreover, no charges, criminal or administrative, were ever filed against these alleged scalawags. In other words, we find no clear and convincing evidence to support the appellants’ allegation.<br><br>In closing, we reiterate that the "[i]llegal drug trade is the scourge of society."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Equally reprehensible is the police practice of using the law as a tool in extorting money from hapless victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In this case, however, appellants' theory of extortion was not sufficiently proven.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appeal is <i>DENIED</i> and the appealed Decision <i>AFFIRMED</i>.
