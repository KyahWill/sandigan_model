				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">CRISANTO DIGMA Y UBAY was charged in separate Informations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> with three (3) counts of rape allegedly committed on 1 March, 24 October and 27 November 1994 against his fourteen (14)-year old sister-in-law Adora Balce filed before the Regional&nbsp; Trial Court of Daet, Camarines Norte.<br><br>On 23 October 1996 the accused was convicted as charged and sentenced to three (3) death penalties.&nbsp; In addition, he was ordered to indemnify Adora Balce P50,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count, or a total award of P210,000.00 for the three (3) counts of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <br><br>The factual backdrop:&nbsp; At about eight o'clock in the evening of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1 March 1994</span> fourteen (14)-year old Adora Balce was sleeping on the edge of a mat inside a house she had been sharing for three (3) years with her eldest sister Maria Julieta Digma and the latter's family in Poblacion 2, Basud, Camarines Norte.&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside Adora were her five (5)-year old niece Maricris, four (4)-year old nephew Christian and Maria Julieta who was then pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the opposite edge was Maria Julieta's husband Crisanto Digma.<br><br>At about nine o'clock that evening Adora was awakened when she felt somebody holding her hands.&nbsp; As their house was dark at that time, she thought it was either of the children until she realized that the hand holding hers was quite big.&nbsp; Then her mouth was covered by someone who ordered her to keep quiet otherwise someone would be in trouble.&nbsp; It was the voice of her brother-in-law Crisanto. She was so terrified that she did not attempt to shout or awaken the children and Maria Julieta.&nbsp; She tried to struggle but she was no match to his huge frame that was now on top of her.&nbsp; He removed her shorts and panty.&nbsp; He lowered his short pants and brief then penetrated her.&nbsp; As he sexually assaulted her he kept warning her not to tell anybody about the incident or he would kill all the members of her family.&nbsp; Then he went out of the house. She was not able to go back to sleep because of the extreme pain.&nbsp; She merely covered herself with a blanket.&nbsp; She was not able to stand up the following morning.&nbsp; She remained lying on the mat and did not go to school. When asked by Maria Julieta why she did not attend her classes she simply replied that she had a headache. She did not report the incident to anyone because she was afraid of Crisanto who forewarned her earlier.<br><br>Crisanto and his family later transferred residence about a kilometer away at the instance of Adora's mother Nilda.<br><br>On <span style="text-decoration: underline;">24 October 1994</span>, at around three o'clock in the afternoon, while Adora was alone watching the parade at the Basud Elementary School on the occasion of the town fiesta, Crisanto approached her saying that Maria Julieta was sending for her.&nbsp; But upon reaching the Digma residence, Adora discovered that Maria Julieta was not there.&nbsp; He dragged her immediately into the kitchen and repeated his warning that she should not tell anyone or he would kill all the members of her family.&nbsp; He removed her skirt and panty.&nbsp; He also took off his pants.&nbsp; She could not free herself since he was holding her arms.&nbsp; He forced her to bend forward and then succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her from behind in a standing position.&nbsp; He held her waist with one hand and his penis with the other.&nbsp; Her vagina bled.&nbsp; She felt much pain.&nbsp; She was allowed to go home afterwards but not without warning her again not to tell anyone.&nbsp; When she arrived at their house, she saw her sister but she could not tell her what happened to her because, again, she was afraid of Crisanto. So she stayed inside the bathroom and cried helplessly.<br><br>On 26 November 1994 Adora went to Sta. Milagrosa, Jose Panganiban, Camarines Norte, in time for the town fiesta the next day.&nbsp; She was accompanied by her brother Anton and sister Nora.&nbsp; They stayed in the house of their brother whom they called <i>Kuya Ilo</i>.&nbsp; At around nine o'clock in the evening the following day, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">27 November 1994</span>, she and her cousin Rona Trampe watched the coronation night at the Barangay Plaza.&nbsp; Crisanto was also there.&nbsp; He approached them, threatened Rona and ordered her to go home.&nbsp; Crisanto and Adora walked towards the bridge.&nbsp; Upon reaching the bridge he asked her why her parents were mad at him.&nbsp; She answered him that it was because he was a drunkard and jobless.&nbsp; As if to scare Adora he told her that he was used to killing people and threatened anew to kill her parents, brothers or sisters should she reveal what happened to her.&nbsp; Then he dragged her down the bridge.&nbsp; While there he lifted her skirt and pulled down her panty.&nbsp; He pulled down his pants and brief then forced her to bend forward.&nbsp; With one hand holding his penis and the other holding her waist from behind, he inserted his penis again into her vagina in a standing position.&nbsp; She could not do anything but cry because of fear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards, they went up the bridge.&nbsp; At this juncture, they were seen by her sister Nora who asked her what Crisanto did to her.&nbsp; Adora was reluctant to tell her the truth because Crisanto was there.&nbsp; Adora went back to the Barangay Plaza.&nbsp; At around ten o'clock that same evening, she went home to the house of her <i>Kuya Ilo</i>. She found Crisanto there sleeping beside her brother.&nbsp; When Crisanto left at about midnight, she told the truth to Nora.&nbsp; She told her straight that she had been raped by Crisanto ten (10) times from 1 March to 27 November 1994.&nbsp; She remembered only those that occurred on 1 March, 24 October and 27 November 1994 while the exact dates of the rest were beyond her recollection.<br><br>The following day, Adora and Nora returned to Basud and reported the matter to the police.&nbsp; Thereafter, Adora proceeded to the Camarines Norte Provincial Hospital. The physician noted that the genital of Adora admitted one (1) finger easily; and that there were old hymenal lacerations at 3:00, 4:00, 6:00 and 9:00 o'clock positions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The physician opined that the cause of the lacerations could be an object or an erect penis.<br><br>Nilda Balce corroborated the assertion of Adora that Crisanto was "<i>sanay pumatay</i>." Nilda knew that before he and Maria Julieta left his hometown in Cavite he had been charged in court with homicide or murder. When he became a member of their family, they covered up for him.<br><br>Crisanto Digma, twenty-eight (28) years old, claimed that he initially played jokes on Adora, such as telling her that had he met her earlier than Maria Julieta she would have been his wife.&nbsp; They in fact became sweethearts.&nbsp; He admitted that on 1 March 1994 he had sexual intercourse with Adora despite Maria Julieta's presence in the same room.&nbsp; He asserted that it was Adora who invited him to where she was lying down, caressed and kissed him, touched his breasts and uttered that she liked him.&nbsp; At first, he was reluctant but when she told him she was responsible enough, he immediately removed&nbsp; her skirt and panty, pulled down his short pants and brief, then performed the sexual act.&nbsp; Their sexual encounter was repeated several times in the same house and it was always she who initiated the moves.<br><br>On 24 October 1994, according to the accused, Adora arrived at his house informing him that Maria Julieta was being summoned by their mother, so the sisters proceeded to their parents' house.&nbsp; After a while, however, Adora returned.&nbsp; She kissed him which caused him to be sexually aroused. Wearing a skirt, she pulled down her panty as he also pulled down his short pants.&nbsp; She bent forward while he went behind her in a dog-style fashion. They both reached their orgasm in ten (10) minutes.&nbsp; Afterwards, she left the house while he laid down to rest.<br><br>With respect to the 27 November 1994 incident, the version of the accused was that Adora asked him to accompany her to watch the coronation at Sta. Milagrosa.&nbsp; At eleven o'clock in the evening, they went to the site but after a short period she suggested that they go under the bridge where they kissed and made love again in a dog-style standing position.&nbsp; Thereafter, they decided to go home.&nbsp; Along the way, they met Nora who became suspicious that there was something that happened between them.&nbsp; Nora pulled Adora and they hurriedly left.&nbsp; On that same night, in the house in Sta. Milagrosa, he was awakened by Nora who forced him and Adora to confess.&nbsp; Apprehensive that Adora's relatives might harm him, he proceeded to the bus terminal.<br><br>The accused submitted in court a "love letter" supposedly sent by "Bing" during his confinement at the provincial jail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> He claimed that he called Adora "Bing" and sometimes "Bi," although Adora vigorously denied being the author of the letter or that she was the sender.&nbsp; She submitted her high school spelling booklet and test papers showing her penmanship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Moreover, she asserted that her nickname was "Babes" and not "Bing" nor "Bi."<br><br>While the trial court believed Adora Balce, it was totally unconvinced of the version of the defense; hence, the conviction of accused Crisanto Digma.<br><br>Accused-appellant maintains that his series of sexual congresses with Adora was consensual.&nbsp; As regards the first alleged rape incident, he argues that it is hard to believe that she was not able to create some noise nor move her body to awaken her sister and thus prevent the rape.&nbsp; With regard to the alleged second and third rape incidents, he submits that the voluntariness in the sexual acts is evident from the fact that they were executed in an unusual manner, i.e., dog-style fashion and in a standing position.&nbsp; He proffers that lovers resort to such position to discover and attain extraordinary delight and satisfaction. He explains that a rapist would normally refrain from this position because of difficulty and the amount of time involved in the execution, especially if the victim repels the act. Moreover, he invites attention to the established circumstance that in the three (3) alleged rape incidents, he was not armed&nbsp; with a deadly&nbsp; weapon.&nbsp; Lastly, he banks on the circumstance that Adora finally disclosed the incident to her family only after they were caught by Nora.<br><br>Accused-appellant fails to persuade.&nbsp; By the very nature of the crime of rape, conviction or acquittal depends almost entirely on the credibility of the complainant's testimony because of the fact that usually only the participants can testify as to its occurrence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> We recall Adora Balce's narrations that she was awakened at about nine o'clock in the evening of 1 March 1994 when she felt somebody holding&nbsp; her&nbsp; hands and&nbsp; then covering her mouth with his hand.&nbsp; She was ordered to remain silent otherwise somebody would be in trouble. At that time, their house was dark but she recognized the voice to be that of accused-appellant.<br><br>Pertinent portions of her testimony read -<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%"

explained&nbsp; -<br><br><blockquote>The Court finds credible the testimony of Adora, a naivete whose simple answers to questions that reveal spontaneity and an unrehearsed testimony can very well exude candor and sincerity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noteworthy are the direct, positive and categorical assertions made by the offended party on the witness stand.&nbsp; The delay in reporting the rape incidents due to threat cannot be taken against her (<i>People v. Lagrosa, Jr.,</i> 230 SCRA 298).&nbsp; Such delay is understandable and does not affect her credibility (<i>People v. Lucas</i>, 232 SCRA 537).&nbsp; It is not uncommon for young girls to conceal for sometime the assaults on their virtue because of the rapist's threats on their lives (<i>People v. Errojo</i>, 229 SCRA 49).<br><br>The Court, totally appalled by accused's contention that Adora was his sweeheart and that the carnal acts were mutually desired by both of them, outrightly dismisses the defense's posture.&nbsp; Accused's testimony is bereft of credit being improbable and circumstantially dubious. The&nbsp; declarations of Crisanto were unbelievable and contrary to common experience.&nbsp; Considering the modesty and timidity of a typical Filipina, especially one in her tender&nbsp; years but obviously mindful of the virtues transcending our culture, it is hardly conceivable for Adora to seduce the accused and initiate the sexual acts between them.&nbsp; Accused, being the brother-in-law of the victim, exerted a strong moral influence over her that she helplessly submitted herself to his bestial desires.&nbsp; A simple-minded barrio lass only fourteen years of age cannot be expected to offer resistance to the horrendous experience she went through in the fiendish hands of her brother-in-law.&nbsp; As honestly and candidly revealed in her testimony, she was threatened by the accused not only once but on several occasions while the violations on her chastity were being committed (TSN March 11, 1996, pp. 8, 10-11, 13, 16, 18-19, 21, 23, 26, 46-59).&nbsp; Past sexual relationship between the parties does not constitute a defense in a rape case if it is established that the particular instance of coitus took place against the woman's will (<i>People v. Sarellana</i>, 233 SCRA 31).&nbsp; The sexual acts with force and intimidation have been sufficiently shown in the cases at bench.&nbsp; It is not necessary that the force or intimidation employed in accomplishing it be so great or of such character as could not be resisted, as it is only necessary that the force or intimidation be sufficient to consummate the purpose which the accused had in mind (<i>People v. Antonio</i>, 233 SCRA 283). Failure to shout or offer resistance did not make voluntary private complainant's submission to the criminal acts of the accused (<i>People v. Dupali,</i> 230 SCRA 62).&nbsp; Under the circumstances, the threat made to Adora could have engendered in her mind a well-grounded fear that if she reported the matter to her family or the authorities, something worse could happen to them x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </blockquote><br>In rape cases, the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge whose conclusion thereon deserves much weight and respect<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> because the judge had the direct opportunity to observe them on the stand and ascertain if they were telling the truth or not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Trial&nbsp; courts assess the credibility of witnesses on two (2) aspects:&nbsp; demeanor of witnesses as they deliver their testimonies and contents of their testimonies.&nbsp; As to the first, appellate courts generally yield to the trial court's conclusion because, as aforementioned, it had the advantage of observing first hand the witnesses' deportment on the stand then assess their performance accordingly. As to the second, appellate courts make their own independent evaluation, based on the transcript of stenographic notes, to be tested against human nature and ordinary habits of life and to be scrutinized for consistency, among other criteria.&nbsp; The result of the evaluation may render illusory the trial court's conclusion on the first aspect or it may not.&nbsp; Having discharged such duty, no reason compels us to substitute a finding different from that of the trial court.&nbsp; The qualities of being categorical, candid and spontaneous are discernible from each and every page of the transcript of stenographic notes containing Adora's testimonies both on direct and cross examinations.&nbsp; We note that she was subjected to rigid and lengthy cross examination on the same day her direct examination was concluded. She remained unshaken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <br><br>Accused-appellant insists that Adora consented to their sexual intercourse on subject dates as shown by the circumstance that during the claimed first rape incident, she did not create a stir nor move her body to awaken her sister while during the claimed second and third rape incidents, they performed the sexual act in a&nbsp; position resorted to only by lovers, to wit, dog-style and in a standing position.<br><br>Adora explained that during the first rape, she was not able to shout because the left hand of accused-appellant covered her mouth<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and he&nbsp; told her to be quiet otherwise somebody would be involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> While he was removing her panty, she kept on moving but her efforts proved useless because he was too big.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> She was not able to get to her sister because he was already on top of her<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and we must not lose sight of the presence of the two (2) children between them. We thus find Adora's explanation satisfactory.&nbsp; The evil in man has no conscience - he bears no respect for time and place, driving him to commit rape anywhere, even in places where people converge such as in parks, along the roadside, within school premises, inside a house where there are other occupants<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> or in the same room where other members of the family are sleeping<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> including the rapist's own spouse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> <br><br>In <i>People v. Castro</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> <i> </i>a six (6)-year old girl was made to stand on the toilet bowl and lean on the wall by her uncle, a college student, then raped in that position.&nbsp; This Court said that sexual intercourse in a standing position while perhaps uncomfortable is not improbable.&nbsp; In People v. Travero,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> a college student rapist held his thirteen (13)-year old victim against the steel portion of a cargo truck, then engaged in sexual intercourse also while in a standing position.&nbsp; The accused therein contended that it was improbable to have sexual intercourse in a standing position unless both parties acted in concert. This Court resolved his contention by citing <i>Castro.&nbsp; </i>It has been established thus that sexual intercourse against the woman's will is not limited to a position where the victim is lying on the ground.<br><br>For some, consented sexual intercourse is normally performed with both partners assuming a horizontal position.&nbsp; Others defy the earth's gravitational pull by having sexual intercourse in a vertical position.&nbsp; Still, others resort to variations by trying combinations of positions to depict different angles, as in the present case, canine style and in a standing position.&nbsp; In short, sexual intercourse in positions other than horizontal are abnormal for some.&nbsp; For the rest, any position of consented sexual intercourse is normal. Accused-appellant belongs to the first group.&nbsp; He claims that his sexual intercourses with Adora during the alleged second and third rape incidents were done in a peculiar manner, resorted to only by lovers to discover and attain extraordinary delight and satisfaction and, similar to the claim of the accused in <i>Travero</i>, contends that a rapist would normally refrain from this position because of difficulty and the amount of time involved in its execution, especially if the victim repels the act.<br><br>Going along with accused-appellant's view that sexual intercourse in a dog-style fashion and in a standing position is unnatural, this Court is convinced that although the sexual intercourses between accused-appellant and Adora on 24 October and 27 November 1994 were performed in such manner, nevertheless, rape was committed each time.&nbsp; To begin with, a rapist's mind functions in a deviant manner so it is not farfetched that he would resort to an equally aberrant mode of sexual gratification to discover and attain, in accused-appellant's own words, extraordinary pleasure and satisfaction, although only on his part.&nbsp; Stated differently, the animal in man may come out when he commits rape such that it is not unlikely that in the process of his immersion and transformation into another character, he would prefer to mate in the way lower creatures do.&nbsp; We culled from Adora's testimonies that accused-appellant did not encounter any difficulty in that upright position nor was a considerable amount of time involved in its performance.&nbsp; The records do not even hint that there was a significant disparity between their heights as to have made sexual intercourse in that stance laborious and time-consuming.&nbsp; And accused-appellant himself volunteered the information that they used such position everytime they copulated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <br><br>Although <i>Castro </i>and<i> Travero </i>are slightly different in the sense that the victims and rapists therein were facing each other during the sexual act whereas accused-appellant was behind Adora, the principle therein that sexual intercourse in a standing position is probable is applicable to the present case.&nbsp; All that accused-appellant had to do was to compel her to facilitate his intrusion.&nbsp; In the process, she became his passive aide utterly incapable of repelling the act as she had been cowed into submission because of his menacing death threats against her family.<br><br>Accused-appellant claims that another indication of voluntary sexual intercourse with Adora was the established circumstance that in the three (3) alleged rape incidents, he was not armed with a deadly weapon. Such circumstance is irrelevant. Adora's complete obedience to his commands, her lack of struggle against him, and the studied silence she kept about her terrible ordeal were all compelled by her genuine fear of&nbsp; him who needed no weapon to instill it in her. In her mind, she was convinced of the real danger he posed&nbsp; to her and her family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Adora's dread&nbsp; that sprang from the initial rape was magnified during the subsequent rape incidents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The continuous threats on her overpowered and stifled any attempt to resist his sexual assault.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Moreover, she knew that accused-appellant was used to killing people and in Cavite where he hailed from, he was facing several criminal cases. She received this information from accused-appellant himself and her sister Maria Julieta.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> This aspect of Adora's testimony was corroborated by her mother.&nbsp; Even accused-appellant admitted that Maria Julieta had told Adora he was a suspect in crimes against persons in Cavite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <br><br>Finally, accused-appellant faults Adora for waiting to break her silence until they were seen by Nora.&nbsp; No, we rule that Adora is blameless.&nbsp; Delay in reporting rape does not by itself undermine the charge when it is grounded on death threats from the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Adora was raised in the&nbsp; province,&nbsp; inexperienced&nbsp; in worldly ways, and whose actuations under such immensely arduous and trying situations were dominated more by fear rather than by reason.&nbsp; She could not have been expected to have the courage to disregard the threats to her family.<br><br>The defense that Adora was the sweetheart of accused-appellant and that she always initiated the foreplay in their lovemaking could have only been concocted by a person utterly devoid of&nbsp; moral fiber and whose mind is saturated with lechery.&nbsp; As this Court had said that a father's claim that he and his daughter were living together as husband and wife is an affront to Filipino values, assault on the intelligence and offends sensibilities,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the same can be said of sexual relationships between in-laws.&nbsp; It is inconceivable that Adora with her innocence, against whom no proof of sexual perversity or loose morality had been shown, could seduce accused-appellant who was already twenty-eight (28) years old at the time of the incident<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and who happened to be her brother-in-law.&nbsp; In fact, such claims of accused-appellant on the witness stand so infuriated her that she threw her bag at him and branded him a liar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> His self-serving declarations cannot prevail over her positive assertions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Regarding the alleged "love letter" sent by "Bing," Adora refuted it by showing samples of her handwriting found on her high school spelling booklet and test papers which were hardly similar to that on the "love letter." Thus, she convincingly denied authorship of the letter. At any rate, the burden of proof was on accused-appellant to demonstrate that the handwriting was Adora's. He did not bother to do so. Having failed in this regard, the supposed&nbsp; "love letter" is worthless.&nbsp; More importantly, his name as addressee was not even distinctly stated therein; rather, the letter was addressed, "<i>To Love</i>."<br><br>Rape is punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> but attendance of the following circumstance, among other circumstances, justifies the imposition of the death penalty:&nbsp; "<i>When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Of late, we have emphasized the need for independent proof of the age of the victim, aside from testimonial evidence from the victim or her relatives, even though her age is not contested by the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Adora and her mother merely testified that she was born on 25 July 1980<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> without presenting independent proof thereof such as a birth certificate. Neither was there a showing that the birth certificate was lost or destroyed to justify non-presentation thereof. The trial court's conviction of accused-appellant for rape in its qualified form punished by death is therefore erroneous.&nbsp; He should be held liable only for simple rape punished by <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><br><br>As to the civil indemnity, the trial court correctly awarded P50,000.00 as moral damages for each count of rape.&nbsp; In rape cases, an award for moral damages is made without need for pleading or proof as to the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The award of P20,000.00 as exemplary&nbsp; damages is also proper.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exemplary damages may be imposed when the crime was committed with one (1) or more aggravating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> We appreciate accused-appellant's relationship to Adora as her brother-in-law as a generic aggravating&nbsp; circumstance.&nbsp; However, the trial court failed to award civil indemnity to her.&nbsp; Civil indemnity of P50,000.00 is also automatically given to the offended party for the fact of the commission of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> <br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision appealed from finding accused-appellant Crisanto Digma y Ubay guilty of three (3) counts of rape and sentencing him to three (3) death penalties and ordering him to indemnify Adora Balce y Trampe P50,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count or a total of P210,000.00 for the three (3) counts of rape is MODIFIED as to the penalty and awards.&nbsp; He is instead sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua </i>for each count or three (3) <i>reclusion perpetua</i> for all counts of rape and ordered to pay the victim P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, another P50,000.00 as moral damages and P20,000.00 as exemplary damages for each count or a total of P360,000.00 for all the three (3) counts of rape.&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs against accused-appellant.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, Ynares-Santiago,</i> and <i>De Leon, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Mendoza, J.,</i> on leave.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Informations dated 5 January 1995, docketed as Crim.
