				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for review on certiorari of the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals affirming the conviction by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 9, Aparri, Cagayan, of petitioner Eligio Madrid<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and his co-accused Arsenio Sunido of the crime of homicide, for the killing on May 21, 1992 of Angel Sunido in Buguey, Cagayan.<br><br>The information against them charged --<br><blockquote>That on or about May 21, 1992, in the municipality of Buguey, province of Cagayan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, Arsenio Sunido y Silos and Eligio (Melencio) Madrid, armed with a sharp pointed instrument, conspiring together and helping each other, with intent to kill did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab one Angel Sunido and inflicting upon hi[m] stab wounds on his body which caused his death.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<br></blockquote>When arraigned on October 6, 1992, petitioner and Arsenio Sunido pleaded "not guilty" to the crime charged,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> whereupon trial ensued. The prosecution presented three witnesses, namely: Remedios Sunido, wife of the victim; Merdelyn Sunido, the victim’s daughter; and Dr. Teddy Unida, medico-legal examiner.<br><br>Remedios Sunido adopted as her testimony on direct examination, the affidavit executed by her at the Buguey Police Station on June 1, 1992. In said affidavit, she narrated that Arsenio and Angel Sunido were brothers who, previous to May 21, 1992, had a quarrel over a fighting cock which Arsenio claimed was his. At around 12 noon of May 21, 1992, Angel Sunido and Jerry Escobar had drinks in the former’s house. Under the influence of alcohol, Angel provoked a fight with Arsenio. As a result, as Angel was walking back to his house after taking Escobar home, he was stopped by Arsenio and two companions, one of whom was petitioner. Arsenio’s companions held Angel by the arms as Arsenio stabbed him several times on different parts of the body. Arsenio and his companions afterwards fled using petitioner’s tricycle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Remedios Sunido was cross-examined on the basis of her affidavit. She testified that Arsenio did not pass by their house on May 21, 1992. On further questioning, however, she testified that Arsenio came to their house at around seven o’clock in the morning of that day as Angel and some friends were having drinks. It was during that visit that Angel provoked a quarrel with Arsenio concerning the fighting cock.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> On re-direct examination, it was stipulated that the family of Angel incurred P4,000.00 as expenses for his death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Merdelyn Sunido also executed an affidavit before the police on June 2, 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> She stated that her father, her uncle Arsenio, and some visitors were drinking in their house on May 21, 1992. The brothers quarrelled over a fighting cock which she claimed Arsenio took from their yard. Angel then accompanied Jerry Escobar to his home. Because of the bad blood between the brothers, on his way back from Escobar’s house, Angel was attacked by Arsenio Sunido, with the help of petitioner and an unidentified man, and stabbed Angel to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> On the witness stand, Merdelyn testified that at around noon of May 21, 1992, her father Angel and the latter’s friends, Jerry Escobar and a certain Rudy, were in their house having drinks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> At 12 noon, Angel took Jerry Escobar home. Either on the way to or back from Escobar’s house, Angel was stopped by Arsenio Sunido who was with petitioner and another person. Petitioner and his companion held Angel’s hands, raising them upwards, with petitioner holding him by the right hand, while his companion held Angel by the left hand. And then, Arsenio started attacking Angel with a knife. After seriously wounding Arsenio, the three fled. Merdelyn said she witnessed the incident because she was just approximately five meters away from the place where it happened.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The other witness for the prosecution was Dr. Teddy A. Unida, municipal health officer of Buguey, who conducted the autopsy on the body of Angel Sunido. His findings were embodied in a medical certificate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which showed the following wounds suffered by Angel Sunido:<br><blockquote>DIAGNOSIS:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">1.</td><td width="90%" align="justify">Incised wound - 6 cm. in length - 1 cm. deep, located at the left temporal region.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2.</td><td align="justify">Stab wound - 3 cm. in length, 8 cm. deep, located at right anterior lower thorax.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3.</td><td align="justify">Stab wound - 4 cm. in length - 6 cm. deep, located at right anterior lower thorax.

Direction - Left to right.</td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote>Dr. Unida testified that based on these wounds, it could be concluded that the assailant was in front of the victim and that he used a sharp-edged instrument, like a bolo with a pointed tip, in killing the latter. It is possible that either the assailant and the victim were in a standing position facing each other or the victim was lying on the ground with his face upwards. Stab wound nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were fatal injuries causing the victim’s death in the absence of medical attendance. As to how many assailants were responsible for the wounds, he said that judging from the variance in the size and shape of the wounds, it was possible that there was more than one assailant or that more than one weapon was used. However, Dr. Unida stressed that there was no certainty as to this because the elasticity of the skin makes it difficult to conclude exactly what type of instrument was used on the basis of the length of the stab wounds alone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the defense presented as witnesses Jerry Escobar,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> petitioner, Arsenio Sunido and Alipio Valdez.<br><br>Jerry Escobar was the person who, according to the wife and daughter of the victim, the latter took home after having drinks in their house. Jerry testified that he dropped by the house of Angel Sunido between six and seven o’clock in the morning of May 21, 1992, on his way to buy chicken feeds. According to Jerry, he and Angel had drinks until 12 o’clock noon with another persons whom Angel introduced as guests from the Ilocos province. At around 10 o’clock in the morning, Arsenio Sunido and petitioner arrived in Arsenio’s house in a Tamaraw vehicle. Angel’s house was located behind that of Arsenio, approximately 10 meters away. Upon seeing his brother and his companion, Angel provoked Arsenio to a fight over a fighting cock which Angel claimed belonged to him. He drew a line on the ground with his knife as he continued to provoke Arsenio. The two brothers then grappled with each other and fell to the ground. Arsenio was able to land on top of Angel and from this vantage point was able to wrest the knife with which he stabbed Angel several times. Jerry said he then ran away. Petitioner was near the Tamaraw vehicle at the time of the incident. Jerry denied Remedios Sunido’s claim that Angel accompanied him (Jerry) to his house. He said Angel was too drunk to have done so. He further belied Remedios’ claim that petitioner held Angel by the arm while Arsenio stabbed Angel. Jerry said that he was bothered in his conscience by allegations of other witnesses that Angel took him home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> When cross-examined, Jerry clarified that neither Arsenio nor petitioner drank liquor with them. He only saw Arsenio and petitioner at around 10 o’clock in the morning when they went to Arsenio’s house on their way to haul palay. It was then that Angel challenged Arsenio to a fight as Angel took out his knife. Several people witnessed the fight between the two brothers, but no one intervened because of fear. Jerry further clarified that petitioner ran to the Tamaraw vehicle when the brothers started fighting. Jerry said that he did not report what he witnessed to anyone because he was not directly involved in the case. But he decided to testify and relate what he witnessed as his conscience bothered him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Petitioner testified next. He said he was a businessman with seven children, all of whom finished college. His business consisted of three rice mills, one located in Maddalero and two in Cabanbunan, Gonzaga. The manager of the Maddalero rice mill was Arsenio Sunido. On May 21, 1992, at around 10 o’clock in the morning, Arsenio informed him that they needed to buy palay, for which reason they got into his Tamaraw jeep, with Arsenio driving. They proceeded to Arsenio’s house in Maddalero. Arsenio parked the vehicle in front of his house. When Arsenio alighted from the vehicle, Angel ran towards him with a knife. When he saw this, petitioner said he ran away from the scene and toward the farm. While in hiding, he heard the brothers arguing. Petitioner denied that he held Angel’s hands as Arsenio stabbed Angel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> During cross-examination, petitioner explained that he only knew Angel as the brother of Arsenio. He reiterated that he ran away because he was frightened by the sight of the knife. He never saw what happened to the brothers. Nor did he inquire about the incident. He just heard from other people what had happened since he did not return to Maddalero until a month later.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The other defense witness was Arsenio Sunido, who testified that he managed the rice mill of petitioner in Maddalero, Buguey, Cagayan. On May 21, 1992, at around 10 o’clock in the morning, he left his house to see petitioner. He noticed several persons, including Angel, drinking gin in the yard outside the latter’s house. Angel saw him and began challenging him to a fight. It appears that Arsenio had lost a fighting cock about two weeks before. He claimed that the fighting cock in Angel’s yard belonged to him. Despite provocation from his brother, Arsenio simply went about his way and left the house to fetch petitioner in Gonzaga, Cagayan where the latter was residing. Upon arriving in petitioner’s house, Arsenio informed him that they needed money to buy palay. For this reason, petitioner dispatched his Tamaraw jeepney and accompanied Arsenio to Sta. Teresita where they bought palay. They then proceeded to Arsenio’s house in Maddalero, arriving there at around 11 to 12 o’clock noon. They were met by Angel Sunido who was drunk. Armed with a knife, Angel rushed towards Arsenio with intent to kill the latter, saying "I will kill you now." When Angel was around two meters away from him, Arsenio alighted from the vehicle and charged toward Angel.<br><br>On cross-examination, Arsenio testified that he did not see petitioner anymore during the incident because the latter ran away. After alighting from the Tamaraw, Arsenio slipped and fell. A struggle ensued and Arsenio was able to wrest the knife away from Angel. Arsenio then stabbed Angel several times. When he realized what he did, Arsenio dropped the knife, wanting to embrace his dead brother for he never really intended to kill him. He immediately surrendered to Alipio Valdez, the vice mayor, who brought him to the police precinct of Buguey.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> On further cross-examination, Arsenio explained that the misunderstanding between him and his brother arose out of a fighting cock then in Angel’s possession. He claimed that the fighting cock, a breeder, was his but he no longer paid any attention to his brother’s claim, being aware of the latter’s temperament. However, on the date in question, Angel challenged him to a fight as he was leaving his house. When Arsenio returned to his house, together with petitioner, Angel met them and threatened to kill Arsenio as the latter was about to alight from the vehicle. With his back against the Tamaraw jeepney, Arsenio lost his balance and fell down. Angel jumped on him. After taking the knife away from his brother, Arsenio stabbed Angel. Angel ran towards a mango tree and died there. Arsenio then went to Vice Mayor Valdez’ house and told Valdez that he stabbed his brother. Upon request of Arsenio, Vice Mayor Valdez accompanied him to the police station. On re-direct examination, Arsenio reiterated that his brother was an ex-convict, having been convicted of rape with homicide. He, on the other hand, had never been charged of any crime before the present case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Alipio Valdez, vice mayor of Buguey, Cagayan, testified that Arsenio went to his house on May 21, 1992, informing him that he stabbed someone. Since Arsenio was willing to surrender himself to the proper authorities, hence, Vice Mayor Valdez accompanied him to the Buguey Police Department.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> When cross-examined, Valdez repeated that Arsenio asked for his protection and, thus, he personally accompanied him to the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>For purposes of rebuttal, Remedios Sunido denied Arsenio’s claim that the knife used in killing Angel belonged to the latter. She explained that it could not have been her husband’s knife because Angel did not carry a knife when he accompanied Jerry home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>After trial, the lower court rendered a decision convicting Arsenio Sunido and Eligio Madrid of the crime of homicide. The dispositive portion reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court hereby finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of homicide, the penalty for which is reclusion temporal (Art. 249, Revised Penal Code) attended by evident premeditation, abuse of superior strength and availment of means to weaken the defense (Art. 14, pars. 13 and 15, R.P.C.). There is more than ample evidence to establish conspiracy. Therefore, the act of one is the act of all (People v. Noguero, Jr., 218 SCRA 85, 96). The accused are hereby sentenced to serve imprisonment of nineteen (19) years; seven (7) months; and nine (9) days to twenty (20) years of reclusion temporal maximum, including all its accessory, penalties. They are further directed to indemnify the heirs of the deceased jointly and severally P50,000.00 for the latter’s death; P25,000.00 for moral damages; and P50,000.00 for exemplary damages, there being more than one aggravating circumstance and considering the manner the crime was committed, to serve as deterrent to others, with prejudice to the grant of parole or pardon.<br><br>Costs against the accused.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals which rendered a decision, dated September 17, 1997, affirming the trial court’s decision, subject to modifications, <em>viz.</em>:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, foregoing considered, the appealed decision is hereby AFFIRMED with the following modification:<br><br>1. The accused-appellant Arsenio Sunido is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum, with the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender appreciated in his favor thus offsetting the aggravating circumstance of use of superior strength; and<br><br>2. The accused-appellant Madrid is sentenced to suffer the indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal as maximum with the aggravating circumstance of the use of superior strength considered against him.<br><br>The appealed decision is AFFIRMED in all other aspects.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner assigns the following issues in his petition:<br><blockquote>1. Did the Cagayan RTC bolt so far from SC bearings<br><blockquote>(a) in not satisfying the constitutional standard of <em>clear and distinct articulation of the facts and law</em> in trial court decision writing?<br><br>(b) in not correctly interpreting Sec. 1, Rule 132 of the Revised Rules on Evidence by saying it heard the prosecution witnesses’ testimonies even when all the prosecution offered for Remedios and Merdelyn’s direct examination were their affidavits and in setting aside the <em>requirement of oral testimony for direct examination</em> (which, unlike affidavits, gives occasion for judicial observation of witness deportment?<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">(a)</td><td width="90%" align="justify">in failing to apply the SC’s <em>time gap</em> test?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(b)</td><td align="justify">in disregarding the SC’s <em>natural tendency</em> rule?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(c)</td><td align="justify">in glossing over the SC’s <em>unacceptable identification</em> test?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(d)</td><td align="justify">in ignoring the SC’s <em>common experience</em> standard?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(e)</td><td align="justify">in passing over the SC’s <em>motive</em> test?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(f)</td><td align="justify">in neglecting the <em>relative’s contra-testimony</em> test pointed out by the SC?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(g)</td><td align="justify">in not making a <em>statement versus physical evidence comparison</em> ordained by the SC?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(h)</td><td align="justify">in not applying the SC’s <em>chronology</em> test?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(i)</td><td align="justify">in overlooking the <em>no hide, no appearance, no surrender</em> factors pointed out by the SC?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(j)</td><td align="justify">in slighting the <em>victim of identification</em> by association possibility singled out in a SC decision before?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(k)</td><td align="justify">in not applying the SC’s <em>equipoise</em> test in favor of petitioner?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(l)</td><td align="justify">in not adhering to the SC’s <em>search for truth</em> standard?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(m)</td><td align="justify">in not recognizing the <em>operative legal effect of a plea of self-defense</em> by co-accused Arsenio Sunido in that he alone owned up to the killing?</td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote></blockquote>2. Did the Court of Appeals so far sanction all those 15 departures by the Cagayan RTC as to call for the Supreme Court’s exercise of the power of supervision?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>As is often the case, the question here is whether the prosecution evidence is sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt petitioner’s guilt. In general, we adhere to the principle that the assessment made by the trial judge of the credibility of witnesses will not be disturbed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Having heard the testimony of the witnesses and observed their demeanor on the witness stand, the judge is in a better position to determine the issue of credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> However, where there is a showing that some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which would have affected the result of the case have been overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied, we will not hesitate to make our own evaluation of the evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Such is the case here.<br><br><strong>First.</strong> The trial court’s decision, for all its length - 23 pages - contains no analysis of the evidence of the parties nor reference to any legal basis in reaching its conclusion. It contains nothing more than a summary of the testimonies of the witnesses of both parties. The only discussion of the evidence is be found in the following paragraphs:<br><blockquote>Their testimony convinced the Court. On the other hand, accused’s evidence bears the indicia of fabrication. Defense witnesses from their demeanor, manner of testifying and evasive answers were far from credible.<br><br>From the evidence on record, the Court believes and so hold that the prosecution has satisfactorily proved the accused <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[guilty]</sup> beyond reasonable doubt. Prosecution’s witnesses testified in a straightforward manner.<br><br>Considering the circumstances immediately prior to the commission of the crime, and the manner the same was committed, the Court believes that the aggravating circumstances of evidence premeditation and abuse of superior strength, as well as availment of means to prevent the deceased from defending himself were sufficiently established. The severality, location and severity of the injuries inflicted as well as their nature, proved that there were more than one assailants. Murder should have been the proper offense charged. However, we can only convict the accused for homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>The decision does not indicate what the trial court found in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses to consider the same "straightforward" when, as will presently be shown, they are in fact contradictory and confused. Nor does the decision contain any justification for the appreciation of aggravating circumstances against the accused, much less some basis for finding conspiracy among them.<br><br>In view of the weight given to its assessment of a witness’ credibility on appeal, the trial court should exert effort to ensure that its decisions present a comprehensive analysis or account of the factual and legal findings which would substantially address the issues raised by the parties.<br><br>Art. VIII, §14 of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>No decision shall be rendered by any court without expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based.<br><br>No petition for review or motion for reconsideration of decision of the court shall be refused due course or denied without stating the basis therefor.<br></blockquote>In the same vein, Rule 120, §2 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:<br><blockquote><em>Form and contents of judgments.</em> -- The judgment must be written in the official language, personally and directly prepared by the judge and signed by him and shall contain clearly and distinctly a statement of the facts proved or admitted by the accused and the law upon which the judgment is based.<br><br>If it is of conviction, the judgment shall state (a) the legal qualification of the offense constituted by the acts committed by the accused, and the aggravating or mitigating circumstances attending the commission thereof, if there are any; (b) the participation of the accused in the commission of the offense, whether as principal, accomplice, or accessory after the fact; (c) the penalty imposed upon the accused; and (d) the civil liability or damages caused by the wrongful act to be recovered from the accused by the offended party, if there is any, unless the enforcement of the civil liability by a separate action has been reserved or waived.<br></blockquote>In case of acquittal, unless there is a clear showing that the act from which the civil liability might arise did not exist, the judgment shall make a finding on the civil liability of the accused in favor of the offended party.<br><br>The decision fails to comply with these constitutional and statutory requirements. As we said in our decision in <em>People v. Bugarin</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><blockquote>The requirement that the decisions of courts must be in writing and that they must set forth clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which they are based serves many functions. It is intended, among other things, to inform the parties of the reason or reasons for the decision so that if any of them appeals, he can point out to the appellate court the finding of facts or the rulings on points of law with which he disagrees. More than that, the requirement is an assurance to the parties that, in reaching judgment, the judge did so through the processes of legal reasoning. It is, thus, a safeguard against the impetuosity of the judge, preventing him from deciding by ipse dixit. Vouchsafed neither the sword nor the purse by the Constitution but nonetheless vested with the sovereign prerogative of passing judgment on the life, liberty or property of his fellowmen, the judge must ultimately depend on the power of reason for sustained public confidence in the justness of his decision. The decision of the trial court in this case disrespects the judicial function.<br></blockquote><strong>Second.</strong> The Court of Appeals sustained petitioner’s conviction on the strength of the testimonies given by Remedios and Merdelyn Sunido. No independent evidence, however, incriminating petitioner on the death of Arsenio Sunido has been presented by the prosecution. Although they claimed that petitioner held the victim’s right hand while Arsenio stabbed him, their testimony should have been given the strictest scrutiny in view of the fact that Remedios and Merdelyn Sunido are the wife and daughter, respectively, of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In fact, Merdelyn Sunido gave contradictory accounts of how her father was stabbed by Arsenio while petitioner allegedly held the victim. These contradictions raise doubts on whether she really witnessed the incident and on the part allegedly played by petitioner. More specifically, the contradictions and inconsistencies relate to the following questions: Did Arsenio go to the victim’s house in the morning of May 21, 1992? Did the victim provoke his brother Arsenio into a quarrel? Was there or was there not a quarrel? When was the victim attacked by Arsenio and the latter’s companions, which allegedly included petitioner, while allegedly taking Jerry Escobar to his house or after he had done so and the victim was returning to his house? After the incident, what vehicle did the assailant use while fleeing, Arsenio’s Tamaraw vehicle or a tricycle?<br><br>In her affidavit before the Buguey police which formed her direct examination, Merdelyn stated:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">Q04 -</td><td width="90%" align="justify">Why did your uncle Arsenio Sunido, stab your father?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A -</td><td align="justify">Before the incident my uncle Arsenio Sunido, came to our house and forcibly took the rooster (fighting cock) inside our poultry and there when my father Angel Sunido arrived my mother told him that his rooster place[d] inside our poultry was taken by his brother Arsenio, so on <u>May 21, 1992, my father and uncle Arsenio and some visitors have drinking session at our residence and there not long after, my father inquire my uncle regarding the rooster which was taken by my uncle which begun their quarrel and after the drinking spree, my father accompanied his friend Jerry Escobar to his house and when my father return that was the time when when (sic) Melencio Madrid and one companion hold my father while uncle Arsenio Sunido stabbed several times that causes his death along the road near the house of my uncle.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote>However, Merdelyn also testified and her testimony is shot through and through with contradictions and inconsistencies, as the following portions of the transcript of stenographic notes show:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But, several times during her cross-examination, Merdelyn testified that her uncle was not present during her father’s drinking session with his friends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> When confronted with the discrepancy in her affidavit and her testimony, Merdelyn answered that her statement in her affidavit was the truth, that her uncle was indeed in their house in the morning of May 21, 1992,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> only to deny later that her uncle was in their house from six o’clock to 11 o’clock in the morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> That was not the end of her answer to the question. In the next breath, Merdelyn asserted her uncle was present at the drinking session, although he stayed for a short while only at around 10:30 in the morning of that date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Merdelyn showed the same tendency to vacillate between two contradictory statements with regard to the quarrel which arose between her father and her uncle. In her affidavit, Merdelyn stated that during the drinking session, her father inquired about the rooster which Arsenio had taken, thus provoking a quarrel between the two brothers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> But when asked later whether her father and uncle had an altercation over the same subject matter, Merdelyn denied that they had. When asked again whether her father and uncle quarrelled, Merdelyn later replied that they, in fact, quarrelled for a long while.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Even the vehicle allegedly used by Arsenio Sunido and petitioner in fleeing from the scene of the crime is uncertain. Merdelyn narrated in her affidavit that after the incident, petitioner took a tricycle to escape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> However, nowhere in her testimony did she mention the tricycle. Instead, she said she saw petitioner’s Tamaraw jeepney parked in front of Arsenio’s house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Considering that Merdelyn testified that she was only five meters away from the place where her father was allegedly stabbed,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> she could not have failed to notice that petitioner alighted from a jeepney.<br><br>Even more telling is the inconsistency in Merdelyn’s testimony when Arsenio Sunido, allegedly with the assistance of petitioner and another companion, attacked Angel. In her affidavit, Merdelyn narrated that her father was attacked while returning to their house after accompanying Jerry Escobar home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> However, on the stand, Merdelyn changed her story and testified that it was on the way to Jerry Escobar’s house that her father was assaulted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Several times more after this in her testimony, Merdelyn vacillated as to the actual time her father was attacked, whether before or after Angel allegedly brought Jerry Escobar home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Inconsistencies on negligible details do not destroy the truth of a witness’ testimony, so long as they refer only to collateral or incidental matters. But by no means can the inconsistencies and contradictions in Merdelyn’s testimony be characterized as trivial or insignificant. Her propensity to make contradictory statements reflects her own uncertainty as to the actual events leading to her father’s death. It is clear that she speaks not from memory or experience. She cannot even give a definite chronology of the events that transpired before her father was killed. We are convinced that she was simply fashioning her story and making spur-of-the-moment improvisations in an attempt to render her testimony credible. Instead of so doing, she exhibited a disposition to fabricate that makes her testimony unworthy of belief and credence.<br><br>We have held that sworn statements executed before police officers are usually incomplete and, therefore, contradictions in the sworn statement of a witness and her testimony are frequently brushed aside as inconsequential so long as they refer to minor and reconcilable matters. But this rule does not apply when the discrepancies touch on substantial matters as in the case at bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Further eroding Merdelyn’s testimony is her recital of petitioner’s participation in the killing of her father. She claimed that petitioner and another person held the victim by raising his arms, with petitioner holding the right hand while his companion held the left hand of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Petitioner is an old man, almost 64 years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It taxes one’s credulity to be told that petitioner could hold the much younger victim so that the latter could be more easily attacked by Arsenio. It is noteworthy that no attempt was even made to identify the third person who allegedly held the other arm of the victim to facilitate the attack by Arsenio. Merdelyn did not even describe his appearance. Indeed, the information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> only mentions Arsenio Sunido and Eligio Madrid as having conspired to kill Angel Sunido. No mention was made of this mysterious man, even as a John Doe, leading us to think that he exists only as a figment of Merdelyn and Remedios Sunido’s imagination.<br><br>Evidence, to be believed, must not only proceed from the mouth of a trustworthy witness but must likewise be credible in itself.

Her answers oftentimes are not responsive to the questions propounded to her. She even committed a mistake as to the date when the provocation was made by her husband, stating a date which is a day after he died.<br><br>Moreover, in her affidavit, she stated that petitioner took a tricycle in escaping after the incident. But, as stated earlier, it has already been proven that petitioner used a Tamaraw jeepney for transportation. Considering that Remedios testified that she was only seven to 10 meters away from the place where her husband was attacked, she could not have failed to notice what type of vehicle petitioner was using if she actually witnessed the event. Remedios’ dubious narrative of her husband’s killing fails to convince us. The tenor of her testimony suggests that it is based not on what she remembers but more on what she imagines to have occurred at the time her husband was killed. In <em>People v. Lucero</em>, we held that the unnatural and contradictory testimony of a witness, coupled with substantial discrepancies between his testimony and his sworn statement, makes him unreliable as a witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Likewise, the considerable length of time which lapsed before Merdelyn and Remedios Sunido made their statements before the police puts into question the claim that they actually witnessed the killing of Angel Sunido. It is true that delay in reporting a crime, if adequately explained, is not sufficient to cast doubt on the truthfulness of a witness’ testimony as, for instance, the delay may be explained by the natural reticence of most people and their abhorrence to get involved in a criminal case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>But the eyewitnesses involved in this case are the wife and daughter of the victim. One would naturally expect that they would not be anxious to help the police arrest the person or persons responsible for the killing of their loved one. Instead of doing so, however, Remedios and Merdelyn Sunido only made their statements to the police on June 1, 1992<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> and June 2, 1992,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> respectively, more than one week after the incident they allegedly witnessed. This fact is made even more strange by the statements of Remedios and Merdelyn Sunido that not long after the incident, Barangay Councilman Amor de los Santos arrived followed by members of the Buguey Police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> In a similar case where a daughter delayed in reporting to the proper authorities who was responsible for her father’s death, the Court held:<br><blockquote>. . . She had a very early opportunity to do so because the police officers of the town were there at the scene of the crime, where she was also, just two hours after her father was shot and killed. The most natural reaction of a witness to such an incident, indeed a <em>res gestae</em>, would have been to tell her mother about it, and subsequently the police authorities, who had, as earlier adverted to, responded to the summons for help two hours after the reported murder. Human nature would have compelled her to declare that she had seen, and in fact, could identify, the assailant of her father. But she withheld that vital information from everybody for an unreasonable length of time (at least four days after the commission of the crime, by her own statement), which makes her testimony suspect. Teresita’s testimony smacks of fabrication and, therefore, can not support a conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote>The testimonies of Merdelyn and Remedios Sunido do not prove beyond reasonable doubt that petitioner participated in the killing of Angel Sunido. We cannot accept such testimonies as establishing the guilt of petitioner. As we said in <em>People v. Comesario:</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><blockquote>. . . An accused enjoys the presumption of innocence. He need not prove what is legally presumed. If he so desires he may present evidence on his behalf, but no matter how weak it is, he still deserves an acquittal. This is because the prosecution must not rely on the weakness of the evidence for the defense but on the strength of its own evidence. Unless the prosecution has overturned the presumption of innocence, acquittal is inevitable.<br></blockquote>Indeed, Arsenio Sunido admitted that he was solely responsible for the death of his brother Angel Sunido.

There was animosity between him and the deceased concerning the loss of a fighting cock. The deceased provoked him and he reacted by stabbing the victim. The quarrel was thus between brothers. There is nothing in the record to suggest that petitioner had any part in that quarrel. He was Arsenio’s employer. He had no reason to feel aggrieved by the loss of the fighting cock. And if, as the prosecution tried to prove, Arsenio had merely been provoked by the deceased who was then drunk, how could Arsenio and petitioner have conspired to commit the crime? The fact is that petitioner and Arsenio happened to drop by Angel’s house because they were buying palay to mill. Petitioner was the owner of three rice mills, and Arsenio was the manager of one of the rice mills. Whatever business ties existed between Arsenio and petitioner have no bearing on the fight between the brothers Angel and Arsenio. Not having participated in any manner in the fight between the brothers, petitioner cannot be held responsible for Angel’s death.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby REVERSED and petitioner is hereby ACQUITTED of the crime of homicide.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><em>Bellosillo, (Chairman),</em> and <em>Buena, JJ.,</em> concur.<br><br><em>Quisumbing,</em> and <em>De Leon, Jr., JJ.,</em> on leave.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Per Justice Eugenio S.
