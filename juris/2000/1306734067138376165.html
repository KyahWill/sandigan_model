				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>Petitioners Isagani Cruz and Cesar Europa brought this suit for prohibition and mandamus as citizens and taxpayers, assailing the constitutionality of certain provisions of Republic Act No. 8371 (R.A. 8371), otherwise known as the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997 (IPRA), and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (Implementing Rules).<br><div align="JUSTIFY"><br>In its resolution of September 29, 1998, the Court required respondents to comment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In compliance, respondents Chairperson and Commissioners of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), the government agency created under the IPRA to implement its provisions, filed on October 13, 1998 their Comment to the Petition, in which they defend the constitutionality of the IPRA and pray that the petition be dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br>On October 19, 1998, respondents Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and Secretary of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) filed through the Solicitor General a consolidated Comment.&nbsp; The Solicitor General is of the view that the IPRA is partly unconstitutional on the ground that it grants ownership over natural resources to indigenous peoples and prays that the petition be granted in part.<br><br>On November 10, 1998, a group of intervenors, composed of Sen. Juan Flavier, one of the authors of the IPRA, Mr. Ponciano Bennagen, a member of the 1986 Constitutional Commission, and the leaders and members of 112 groups of indigenous peoples (Flavier, et. al), filed their Motion for Leave to Intervene.&nbsp; They join the NCIP in defending the constitutionality of IPRA and praying for the dismissal of the petition.<br><br>On March 22, 1999, the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) likewise filed a Motion to Intervene and/or to Appear as Amicus Curiae.&nbsp; The CHR asserts that IPRA is an expression of the principle of parens patriae and that the State has the responsibility to protect and guarantee the rights of those who are at a serious disadvantage like indigenous peoples.&nbsp; For this reason it prays that the petition be dismissed.<br><br>On March 23, 1999, another group, composed of the Ikalahan Indigenous People and the Haribon Foundation for the Conservation of Natural Resources, Inc. (Haribon, et al.), filed a motion to Intervene with attached Comment-in-Intervention.&nbsp; They agree with the NCIP and Flavier, et al. that IPRA is consistent with the Constitution and pray that the petition for prohibition and mandamus be dismissed.<br><br>The motions for intervention of the aforesaid groups and organizations were granted.<br><br>Oral arguments were heard on April 13, 1999. Thereafter, the parties and intervenors filed their respective memoranda in which they reiterate the arguments adduced in their earlier pleadings and during the hearing.<br><br>Petitioners assail the constitutionality of the following provisions of the IPRA and its Implementing Rules on the ground that they amount to an unlawful deprivation of the State's ownership over lands of the public domain as well as minerals and other natural resources therein, in violation of the regalian doctrine embodied in Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">"(1)</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Section 3(a) which defines the extent and coverage of ancestral domains, and Section 3(b) which, in turn, defines ancestral lands;</div></td> </tr> <tr><td style="vertical-align: top;"><br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">"(2)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Section 5, in relation to section 3(a), which provides that ancestral domains including inalienable public lands, bodies of water, mineral and other resources found within ancestral domains are private but community property of the indigenous peoples;</div></td> </tr> <tr><td style="vertical-align: top;"><br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">"(3)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Section 6 in relation to section 3(a) and 3(b) which defines the composition of ancestral domains and ancestral lands;</div></td> </tr> <tr><td style="vertical-align: top;"><br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">"(4)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Section 7 which recognizes and enumerates the rights of the indigenous peoples over the ancestral domains;</div></td> </tr> <tr><td style="vertical-align: top;"><br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">"(5)</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Section 8 which recognizes and enumerates the rights of the indigenous peoples over the ancestral lands;</div></td> </tr> <tr><td style="vertical-align: top;"><br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">"(6)</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Section 57 which provides for priority rights of the indigenous peoples in the harvesting, extraction, development or exploration of minerals and other natural resources within the areas claimed to be their ancestral domains, and the right to enter into agreements with nonindigenous peoples for the development and utilization of natural resources therein for a period not exceeding 25 years, renewable for not more than 25 years;

Justice Kapunan filed an opinion, which the Chief Justice and Justices Bellosillo, Quisumbing, and Santiago join, sustaining the validity of the challenged provisions of R.A. 8371.&nbsp; Justice Puno also filed a separate opinion sustaining all challenged provisions of the law with the exception of Section 1, Part II, Rule III of NCIP Administrative Order No. 1, series of 1998, the Rules and Regulations Implementing the IPRA, and Section 57 of the IPRA which he contends should be interpreted as dealing with the large-scale exploitation of natural resources and should be read in conjunction with Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution.&nbsp; On the other hand, Justice Mendoza voted to dismiss the petition solely on the ground that it does not raise a justiciable controversy and petitioners do not have standing to question the constitutionality of R.A. 8371.<br><br>Seven (7) other members of the Court voted to grant the petition.&nbsp; Justice Panganiban filed a separate opinion expressing the view that Sections 3 (a)(b), 5, 6, 7 (a)(b), 8, and related provisions of R.A. 8371 are unconstitutional.&nbsp; He reserves judgment on the constitutionality of Sections 58, 59, 65, and 66 of the law, which he believes must await the filing of specific cases by those whose rights may have been violated by the IPRA.&nbsp; Justice Vitug also filed a separate opinion expressing the view that Sections 3(a), 7, and 57 of R.A. 8371 are unconstitutional. Justices Melo, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, and De Leon join in the separate opinions of Justices Panganiban and Vitug.<br><br>As the votes were equally divided (7 to 7) and the necessary majority was not obtained, the case was redeliberated upon.&nbsp; However, after redeliberation, the voting remained the same.&nbsp; Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 56, Section 7 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, the petition is DISMISSED.<br><br>Attached hereto and made integral parts thereof are the separate opinions of Justices Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, and Panganiban.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, Ynares-Santiago,</i> and <i>De Leon, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza</i> and <i>Panganiban JJ.,</i> see separate opinion<br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><sup> </sup>Rollo, p. 114.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><sup> </sup>Petition, Rollo, pp. 16-23.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><sup> </sup><i>Id</i>. at 23-25.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><sup> </sup>Section 1, Article III of the Constitution states:&nbsp; "No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><sup> </sup>Rollo, pp. 25-27.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><sup> </sup><i>Id</i>. at 27-28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><sup> </sup>Transcript of Stenographic Notes of the hearing held on April 13, 1999, pp. 5-6.<br><br><br><hr align="CENTER" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><br><br><center><b>SEPARATE OPINION</b></center><br><br>PUNO, <i>J</i>.:<br><br><center><b><u>PRECIS</u></b></center><br><br>A classic essay on the <b>utility of history</b> was written in 1874 by Friedrich Nietzsche entitled "On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life."

Plaintiffs appealed the judgment, asserting that their 30-year adverse possession, as an extraordinary period of prescription in the <b><i>Partidas</i></b> and the Civil Code, had given them title to the land as against everyone, including the State; and that the State, not owning the land, could not validly transmit it.<br><br>The Court, speaking through Justice Willard, decided the case on the basis of "those special laws which from earliest time have regulated the disposition of the public lands in the colonies."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The question posed by the Court was: "Did these special laws recognize any right of prescription as against the State as to these lands; and if so, to what extent was it recognized?"<br><br>Prior to 1880, the Court said, there were no laws specifically providing for the disposition of land in the Philippines.&nbsp; However, it was understood that in the absence of any special law to govern a specific colony, the Laws of the Indies would be followed.&nbsp; Indeed, in the Royal Order of July 5, 1862, it was decreed that until regulations on the subject could be prepared, the authorities of the Philippine Islands should follow strictly the Laws of the Indies, the <b><i>Ordenanza</i></b> of the <b><i>Intendentes</i></b> of 1786, and the Royal Cedula of 1754.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Quoting the preamble of Law 14, Title 12, Book 4 of the <b><i>Recopilacion de Leyes de las Indias</i></b>, the court interpreted it as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"In the preamble of this law there is, as is seen, a distinct statement that all those lands belong to the Crown which have not been granted by Philip, or in his name, or by the kings who preceded him.&nbsp; <b>This statement excludes the idea that there might be lands not so granted, that did not belong to the king. It excludes the idea that the king was not still the owner of all ungranted lands</b>, because some private person had been in the adverse occupation of them.&nbsp; By the mandatory part of the law all the occupants of the public lands are required to produce before the authorities named, and within a time to be fixed by them, their title papers.&nbsp; And those who had good title or showed prescription were to be protected in their holdings.&nbsp; It is apparent that it was not the intention of the law that mere possession for a length of time should make the possessors the owners of the land possessed by them without any action on the part of the authorities."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br>The preamble stated that all those lands which had not been granted by Philip, or in his name, or by the kings who preceded him, belonged to the Crown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> For those lands granted by the king, the decree provided for a system of assignment of such lands.&nbsp; It also ordered that all possessors of agricultural land should exhibit their title deed, otherwise, the land would be restored to the Crown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The Royal Cedula of October 15, 1754 reinforced the <b><i>Recopilacion</i></b> when it ordered the Crown's principal subdelegate to issue a general order directing the publication of the Crown's instructions:<br><br><blockquote>"x x x to the end that any and all persons who, since the year 1700, and up to the date of the promulgation and publication of said order, shall have occupied royal lands, whether or not x x x cultivated or tenanted, may&nbsp; x x x appear and exhibit to said subdelegates the titles and patents by virtue of which said lands are occupied. x x x.&nbsp; Said subdelegates will at the same time warn the parties interested that in case of their failure to present their title deeds within the term designated, without a just and valid reason therefor, they will be deprived of and evicted from their lands, and they will be granted to others."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>On June 25, 1880, the Crown adopted regulations for the adjustment of lands "wrongfully occupied" by private individuals in the Philippine Islands.&nbsp; <b><i>Valenton</i></b> construed these regulations together with contemporaneous legislative and executive interpretations of the law, and concluded that plaintiffs' case fared no better under the 1880 decree and other laws which followed it, than it did under the earlier ones.&nbsp; Thus as a general doctrine, the Court stated:<br><br><blockquote>"While the State has always recognized the right of the occupant to a deed if he proves a possession for a sufficient length of time, yet it <b>has always insisted that he must make that proof before the proper administrative officers, and obtain from them his deed, and until he did that the State remained the absolute owner.</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote><br>In conclusion, the Court ruled:&nbsp; "We hold that from 1860 to 1892 there was no law in force in these Islands by which the plaintiffs could obtain the ownership of these lands by prescription, without any action by the State."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Valenton had no rights other than those which accrued to mere possession. Murciano, on the other hand, was deemed to be the owner of the land by virtue of the grant by the provincial secretary.&nbsp; In effect, Valenton upheld the Spanish concept of state ownership of public land.<br><br>As a fitting observation, the Court added that <b>"[t]he policy pursued by the Spanish Government from earliest times, requiring settlers on the public lands to obtain title deeds therefor from the State, has been continued by the American Government in Act No. 926.</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><b>C. <u>The Public Land Acts and the Torrens System</u></b><br><br><b>Act No. 926</b>, the first Public Land Act, was passed in pursuance of the provisions of the the Philippine Bill of 1902.&nbsp; The law governed the disposition of lands of the public domain.&nbsp; It prescribed rules and regulations for the homesteading, selling, and leasing of portions of the public domain of the Philippine Islands, and prescribed the terms and conditions to enable persons to perfect their titles to public lands in the Islands.&nbsp; It also provided for the "issuance of patents to certain native settlers upon public lands," for the establishment of town sites and sale of lots therein, for the completion of imperfect titles, and for the cancellation or confirmation of Spanish concessions and grants in the Islands." In short, the Public Land Act operated on the assumption that title to public lands in the Philippine Islands remained in the government;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and that the government's title to public land sprung from the Treaty of Paris and other subsequent treaties between Spain and the United States.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The term "public land" referred to all lands of the public domain whose title still remained in the government and are thrown open to private appropriation and settlement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and excluded the patrimonial property of the government and the friar lands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><b>Act No. 926 was superseded in 1919 by Act 2874, the second Public Land Act.</b>&nbsp; This new law was passed under the Jones Law.&nbsp; It was more comprehensive in scope but limited the exploitation of agricultural lands to Filipinos and Americans and citizens of other countries which gave Filipinos the same privileges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> After the passage of the 1935 Constitution, Act 2874 was amended in 1936 by <b>Commonwealth Act No. 141</b>.

He claimed that this land had been possessed and occupied by his ancestors since time immemorial; that his grandfather built fences around the property for the holding of cattle and that his father cultivated some parts of the land.&nbsp; Cariño inherited the land in accordance with Igorot custom.&nbsp; He tried to have the land adjusted under the Spanish land laws, but no document issued from the Spanish Crown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> In 1901, Cariño obtained a possessory title to the land under the Spanish Mortgage Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> The North American colonial government, however, ignored his possessory title and built a public road on the land prompting him to seek a Torrens title to his property in the land registration court.&nbsp; While his petition was pending, a U.S. military reservation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> was proclaimed over his land and, shortly thereafter, a military detachment was detailed on the property with orders to keep cattle and trespassers, including Cariño, off the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><br>In 1904, the land registration court granted Cariño's application for absolute ownership to the land.&nbsp; Both the Government of the Philippine Islands and the U.S. Government appealed to the C.F.I. of Benguet which reversed the land registration court and dismissed Cariño's application.&nbsp; The Philippine Supreme Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> affirmed the C.F.I. by applying the <b><i>Valenton</i></b> ruling.&nbsp; Cariño took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> On one hand, the Philippine government invoked the Regalian doctrine and contended that Cariño failed to comply with the provisions of the Royal Decree of June 25, 1880, which required registration of land claims within a limited period of time.&nbsp; Cariño, on the other, asserted that he was the absolute owner of the land <i>jure gentium</i>, and that the land never formed part of the public domain.<br><br>In a unanimous decision written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, the U.S. Supreme Court held:<br><br><blockquote>"It is true that Spain, in its earlier decrees, embodied the universal feudal theory that all lands were held from the Crown, and perhaps the general attitude of conquering nations toward people not recognized as entitled to the treatment accorded to those in the same zone of civilization with themselves.&nbsp; It is true, also, that in legal theory, sovereignty is absolute, and that, as against foreign nations, the United States may assert, as Spain asserted, absolute power. But it does not follow that, as against the inhabitants of the Philippines, the United States asserts that Spain had such power.&nbsp; When theory is left on one side, sovereignty is a question of strength, and may vary in degree.&nbsp; How far a new sovereign shall insist upon the theoretical relation of the subjects to the head in the past, and how far it shall recognize actual facts, are matters for it to decide."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup></blockquote><br>The U.S. Supreme Court noted that it need not accept Spanish doctrines. The choice was with the new colonizer.

The court declared:<br><br><blockquote>"The acquisition of the Philippines was not like the settlement of the white race in the United States.&nbsp; Whatever consideration may have been shown to the North American Indians, the dominant purpose of the whites in America was to occupy land.&nbsp; It is obvious that, however stated, the reason for our taking over the Philippines was different.&nbsp; No one, we suppose, would deny that, so far as consistent with paramount necessities, our first object in the internal administration of the islands is to do justice to the natives, not to exploit their country for private gain.&nbsp; By the Organic Act of July 1, 1902, chapter 1369, section 12 (32 Statutes at Large, 691), all the property and rights acquired there by the United States are to be administered 'for the benefit of the inhabitants thereof.'&nbsp; It is reasonable to suppose that the attitude thus assumed by the United States with regard to what was unquestionably its own is also its attitude in deciding what it will claim for its own.&nbsp; The same statute made a bill of rights, embodying the safeguards of the Constitution, and, like the Constitution, extends those safeguards to all.&nbsp; It provides that 'no law shall be enacted in said islands which shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or deny to any person therein the equal protection of the laws.' In the light of the declaration that we have quoted from section 12, it is hard to believe that the United States was ready to declare in the next breath that "any person" did not embrace the inhabitants of Benguet, or that it meant by "property" only that which had become such by ceremonies of which presumably a large part of the inhabitants never had heard, and that it proposed to treat as public land what they, by native custom and by long association,-- of the profoundest factors in human thought,-- regarded as their own."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup></blockquote><br>The Court went further:<br><br><blockquote>"[E]very presumption is and ought to be against the government in a case like the present.&nbsp; <b>It might, perhaps, be proper and sufficient to say that when, as far back as testimony or memory goes, the land has been held by individuals under a claim of private ownership, it will be presumed to have been held in the same way from before the Spanish conquest, and never to have been public land.</b> Certainly in a case like this, if there is doubt or ambiguity in the Spanish law, we ought to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup></blockquote><br>The court thus laid down the <b>presumption </b>of a certain title held (1) as far back as testimony or memory went, and (2) under a claim of private ownership.&nbsp; Land held by this title is presumed to "never have been public land."<br><br>Against this presumption, the U.S. Supreme Court analyzed the Spanish decrees upheld in the 1904 decision of<i> <b>Valenton v.

Murciano, 3 Philippine 537, while it commands viceroys and others, when it seems proper, to call for the exhibition of grants, directs them to confirm those who hold by good grants or <i>justa prescripcion</i>.&nbsp; <b>It is true that it begins by the characteristic assertion of feudal overlordship and the origin of all titles in the King or his predecessors. That was theory and discourse.&nbsp; The fact was that titles were admitted to exist that owed nothing to the powers of Spain beyond this recognition in their books."</b> (Emphasis supplied).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup></blockquote><br>The court further stated that the Spanish "adjustment" proceedings never held sway over unconquered territories.&nbsp; The wording of the Spanish laws were not framed in a manner as to convey to the natives that failure to register what to them has always been their own would mean loss of such land.&nbsp; The registration requirement was "not to confer title, but simply to establish it;" it was "not calculated to convey to the mind of an Igorot chief the notion that ancient family possessions were in danger, if he had read every word of it."<br><br>By recognizing this kind of title, the court clearly <b>repudiated</b> the doctrine of <b><i>Valenton</i></b>.&nbsp; It was frank enough, however, to admit the possibility that the applicant might have been deprived of his land under Spanish law because of the inherent ambiguity of the decrees and concomitantly, the various interpretations which may be given them.&nbsp; <b>But precisely because of the ambiguity and of the strong "due process mandate" of the Constitution, the court validated this kind of title.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> This title was sufficient, even without government administrative action, and entitled the holder to a Torrens certificate.&nbsp; Justice Holmes explained:<br><br><blockquote>"It will be perceived that the rights of the applicant under the Spanish law present a problem not without difficulties for courts of a legal tradition. We have deemed it proper on that account to notice the possible effect of the change of sovereignty and the act of Congress establishing the fundamental principles now to be observed. Upon a consideration of the whole case we are of the opinion that law and justice require that the applicant should be granted what he seeks, and should not be deprived of what, by the practice and belief of those among whom he lived, was his property, through a refined interpretation of an almost forgotten law of Spain."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup></blockquote><br><b>Thus, the court ruled in favor of Cariño and ordered the registration of the 148 hectares in Baguio Municipality in his name.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup><br><br>Examining <b><i>Cariño</i></b> closer, the U.S. Supreme Court did not categorically refer to the title it upheld as "native title." It simply said:<br><br><blockquote><b>"The Province of Benguet was inhabited by a tribe that the Solicitor-General, in his argument, characterized as a savage tribe that never was brought under the civil or military government of the Spanish Crown.

Grants made by the discoverer to her subjects of lands occupied by the Indians were held to convey a title to the grantees, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy. Once the discoverer purchased the land from the Indians or conquered them, it was only then that the discoverer gained an absolute title unrestricted by Indian rights.<br><br>The court concluded, in essence, that a grant of Indian lands by Indians could not convey a title paramount to the title of the United States itself to other parties, saying:<br><br><blockquote>"It has never been contended that the Indian title amounted to nothing. <b>Their right of possession has never been questioned.&nbsp; The claim of government extends to the complete ultimate title, charged with this right of possession, and to the exclusive power of acquiring that right."</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup></blockquote><br>It has been said that the history of America, from its discovery to the present day, proves the universal recognition of this principle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup><br><br>The <b><i>Johnson</i></b> doctrine was a compromise.&nbsp; It protected Indian rights and their native lands without having to invalidate conveyances made by the government to many U.S. citizens.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup><br><br><b><i>Johnson</i></b> was reiterated in the case of <b><i>Worcester v.

One view, generally linked to Professor Otley H. Beyer, suggests the "wave theory"--a series of arrivals in the archipelago bringing in different types and levels of culture.&nbsp; The Negritos, dark-skinned pygmies, came between 25,000 to 30,000 B.C.&nbsp; Their cultural remains are preserved by the Negrito-type Filipinos found in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.&nbsp; Their relatively inferior culture did not enable them to overcome the pressures from the second wave of people, the Indonesians A and B who came in 5,000 and 3,500 B.C.&nbsp; They are represented today by the Kalinga, Gaddang, Isneg, Mangyan, Tagbanua, Manobo, Mandaya, Subanon, and Sama.&nbsp; The first group was pushed inland as the second occupied the coastal and downriver settlements.&nbsp; The last wave involved Malay migrations between 500 B.C. and 1,500 A.D.&nbsp; they had a more advanced culture based on metal age technology.&nbsp; They are represented by the Christianized and Islamized Filipinos who pushed the Indonesian groups inland and occupied much of the coastal, lowland and downstream areas.<br><br>A second view is postulated by Robert Fox, F. Landa Jocana, Alfredo Evangelista, and Jesus Peralta.&nbsp; Jocano maintains that the Negritos, Indonesians and Malays stand co-equal as ethnic groups without any one being dominant, racially or culturally.&nbsp; The geographic distribution of the ethno-linguistic groups, which shows overlapping of otherwise similar racial strains in both upland and lowland cultures or coastal and inland communities, suggests a random and unstructured advent of different kinds of groups in the archipelago--Samuel K.

However, petitioners maintain that the doctrine merely states that title to lands of the public domain may be acquired by prescription.&nbsp; The Solicitor General, for his part, argues that the doctrine applies only to alienable lands of the public domain and, thus, cannot be extended to other lands of the public domain such as forest or timber, mineral lands, and national parks.<br><br>Fourth<i>,</i> the Solicitor General asserts that even assuming that native title over ancestral lands and ancestral domains existed by virtue of the <i>Cariño</i> doctrine, such native title was extinguished upon the ratification of the 1935 Constitution.<br><br>Fifth, petitioners admit that Congress is mandated under Section 5, Article XII of the Constitution to protect that rights of indigenous peoples to their ancestral lands and ancestral domains.&nbsp; However, they contend that the mandate is subject to Section 2, Article XII and the theory of <i>jura regalia</i> embodied therein.&nbsp; According to petitioners, the recognition and protection under R.A. 8371 of the right of ownership over ancestral lands and ancestral domains is far in excess of the legislative power and constitutional mandate of Congress.<br><br>Finally, on the premise that ancestral lands and ancestral domains are owned by the State, petitioners posit that R.A. 8371 violates Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution which prohibits the alienation of non-agricultural lands of the public domain and other natural resources.</blockquote><br>I am not persuaded by these contentions.<br><br>Undue reliance by petitioners and the Solicitor General on the theory of <i>jura regalia</i> is understandable.&nbsp;

In contrast, ownership of land by acquisitive prescription against the State involves a conversion of the character of the property from&nbsp; alienable public land to private land, which presupposes a transfer of title from the State to a private person.&nbsp; Since native title assumes that the property covered by it is private land and is deemed never to have been part of the public domain, the Solicitor General's thesis&nbsp; that native title under <i>Cariño </i>applies only to lands of the public domain is erroneous.&nbsp; Consequently, the classification of lands of the public domain into agricultural, forest or timber, mineral lands, and national parks under the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> is irrelevant to the application of the <i>Cariño</i> doctrine because the Regalian doctrine which vests in the State ownership of lands of the public domain&nbsp; does not cover ancestral lands and ancestral domains.<br><br>Legal history supports the <i>Cariño</i> doctrine.<br><br>When Spain acquired sovereignty over the Philippines by virtue of its discovery and occupation thereof in the 16th century and the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494&nbsp; which it entered into with Portugal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> the continents of Asia, the Americas and Africa were considered as <i>terra nullius</i> although already populated by other peoples.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> The discovery and occupation by the European States, who were then considered as the only members of the international community of civilized nations, of lands in the said continents were deemed sufficient to create title under international law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Although Spain was deemed to have acquired sovereignty over the Philippines, this did not mean that it acquired title to <b>all</b> lands in the archipelago.

Stated otherwise, Section 1, Article XII of the 1935 Constitution cannot be construed to mean that vested right which had existed then were extinguished and that the landowners were divested of their lands, all in the guise of "wrest[ing] control of those portions of the natural resources [which the State] deems absolutely necessary for social welfare and existence." On the contrary, said Section restated the fundamental rule against the diminution of existing rights by expressly providing that the ownership of lands of the public domain and other natural resources by the State is "subject to any existing right, grant, lease, or concessions."

In light of this provision, does&nbsp; Congress have the power to decide whether ancestral domains shall be private property or part of the public domain?&nbsp; Also, does Congress have the power to determine whether the "extent" of ancestral domains shall include the natural resources found therein?<br><br>It is readily apparent from the constitutional records that the framers of the Constitution did not intend Congress to decide whether ancestral domains shall be public or private property.&nbsp; Rather, they acknowledged that ancestral domains shall be treated as private property, and that customary laws shall merely determine whether such private ownership is by the entire indigenous cultural community, or by individuals, families, or clans within the community.

DAVIDE.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is exactly the reason, Madam President, why we will leave it to Congress to make the necessary exception to the general law on property relations.<br><br>MR. REGALADO.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was thinking if Commissioner Bennagen could give us an example of such a customary law wherein it is the property rights and relations that determine the ownership and the extent of that ownership, unlike the basic fundamental rule that it is the ownership and the extent of ownership which determine the property rights and relations arising therefrom and consequent thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, these customary laws may have a different provision or thrust so that we could make the corresponding suggestions also by way of an amendment.<br><br>MR. DAVIDE.&nbsp; That is exactly my own perception.<br><br>MR. BENNAGEN.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me put it this way.<br><br>There is a range of customary laws governing certain types of ownership.&nbsp; <b>There would be ownership based on individuals, on clan or lineage, or on community.</b>&nbsp; And the thinking expressed in the consultation is that this should be codified and should be recognized in relation to existing national laws.

R.A. 7076 expressly provides that should an ancestral land be declared as a people's small-scale mining area, the members of the indigenous peoples living within said area shall be given&nbsp; <b>priority in the awarding of small-scale mining contracts</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> R.A. 7942 declares that <b>no ancestral land shall be opened for mining operations without the prior consent of the indigenous cultural community concerned</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup><b> </b>and in the event that the members of such indigenous cultural community give their consent to mining operations within their ancestral land, <b>royalties shall be paid to them</b> by the parties to the mining to the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br>In any case, a careful reading of Section 7(b) would reveal that the rights given to the indigenous peoples are duly circumscribed. These rights are limited only to the following: "<b>to manage and conserve</b> natural resources within territories and <b>uphold</b> it for future generations; <b>to benefit and share the profits</b> from allocation and utilization of the natural resources found therein; <b>to negotiate the terms and conditions for the exploration</b> of natural resources in the areas for the purpose of ensuring ecological, environmental protection and the conservation measures, pursuant to national and customary laws; <b>to an informed and intelligent participation</b> in the formulation and implementation of any project, government or private, that will affect or impact upon the ancestral domains and <b>to receive just and fair compensation</b> for any damages which they may sustain as a result of the project, and the right <b>to effective measures</b> by the government to prevent any interference with, alienation and encroachment of these rights."<br><br>It must be noted that the right to negotiate terms and conditions granted under Section 7(b) pertains only to the <b>exploration</b> of natural resources. The term "exploration" refers only to the search or prospecting of&nbsp; mineral resources,&nbsp; or&nbsp; any other means for the purpose of determining the existence and the feasibility of mining them for profit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> The exploration, which is merely a preliminary activity, cannot be equated with the entire process of "exploration, development and utilization" of natural resources which under the Constitution belong to the State.<br><br>Section 57, on the other hand, grants the indigenous peoples "priority rights" in the utilization of natural resources and not absolute ownership thereof. Priority rights does not&nbsp; mean exclusive rights. What is granted is merely the right of preference or first consideration in&nbsp; the award of privileges provided by existing laws and regulations, with due regard to the needs and welfare of indigenous peoples living in the area.<br><br>There is nothing in the assailed law which implies an automatic or mechanical character in the grant of concessions.&nbsp; Nor does the law negate the exercise of sound discretion by government entities.&nbsp; Several factors still have to be considered.&nbsp; For example, the extent and nature of utilization and the consequent impact on the environment and on the indigenous peoples' way of life are important considerations.&nbsp; Moreover, the indigenous peoples must show that they live in the area and that they are in the best position to undertake the required utilization.<br><br>It must be emphasized that the grant of said priority rights to indigenous peoples is not a blanket authority to disregard pertinent laws and regulations. The utilization of said natural resources is always subject to compliance by the indigenous peoples with existing laws, such as R.A. 7076 and R.A. 7942 since it is not they but the State, which owns these resources.<br><br>It also bears stressing that the grant of priority rights does not preclude the State from undertaking activities, or entering into co-production, joint venture or production-sharing agreements with private entities, to utilize the natural resources which may be located within the ancestral domains. There is no intention, as between the State and the indigenous peoples, to create a hierarchy of values; rather, the object is to balance the interests of the State for national development and those of the indigenous peoples.<br><br>Neither does the grant of priority rights to the indigenous peoples exclude non-indigenous peoples from undertaking the same activities within the ancestral domains upon authority granted by the proper governmental agency. To do so would unduly limit the ownership rights of the State over the natural resources.<br><br>To be sure, the act of the State of giving preferential right to a particular sector in the utilization of natural resources is nothing new.&nbsp; As previously mentioned, Section 7, Article XIII of the Constitution mandates the protection by the State of&nbsp; "the rights of subsistence fishermen, especially of local communities, to the preferential use of communal marine and fishing resources, both inland and offshore."<br><br>Section 57 further recognizes the possibility that the exploration and exploitation of natural resources within the ancestral domains may disrupt the natural environment as well as the traditional activities of the indigenous peoples therein.&nbsp; Hence, the need for the prior informed consent of the indigenous peoples before any search&nbsp; for or utilization of the natural resources within their ancestral domains is undertaken.<br><br>In a situation where the State intends to directly or indirectly undertake such activities, IPRA requires that the prior informed consent of the indigenous peoples be obtained.&nbsp;&nbsp; The State must, as a matter of policy and law, consult the indigenous peoples in accordance with the intent of the framers of the Constitution that national development policies and programs should involve a systematic consultation to balance local needs as well as national plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As may be&nbsp; gathered from the discussion of the framers of the Constitution on this point, the national plan presumably takes into account the requirements of the region after thorough consultation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> To this end, IPRA grants to the indigenous peoples the right to an informed and intelligent participation in the formulation and implementation of any project, government or private, and the right not to be removed therefrom without their free and prior informed consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> As to non-members, the prior informed consent takes the form of a formal and written agreement between the indigenous peoples and non-members under&nbsp; the&nbsp; proviso in&nbsp; Section&nbsp; 57 in case&nbsp; the&nbsp; State enters&nbsp; into a co-production, joint venture, or production-sharing agreement with Filipino citizens, or corporations.&nbsp; This requirement is not peculiar to IPRA.&nbsp; Existing laws and regulations such as the Philippine Environmental Policy,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> the Environmental Impact System,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> the Local Government Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> and the Philippine Mining Act of 1995<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup>already require increased consultation and participation of stakeholders, such as indigenous peoples, in the planning of activities with significant environment impact.<br><br>The requirement in Section 59 that prior written informed consent of the indigenous peoples must be procured before the NCIP can issue a certification for the "issuance, renewal, or grant of any concession, license or lease, or to the perfection of any production-sharing agreement," must be interpreted, not as a grant of the power to control the exploration, development and utilization of natural resources, but merely the imposition of an additional requirement for such concession or agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; The clear intent of the law is to protect the rights and interests of the&nbsp; indigenous peoples which may be adversely affected by the operation of such entities or licensees.<br><br><center><b><br>Corollary Issues</b><br><br><i>A.&nbsp; IPRA does not violate the Due Process clause.</i></center><br><br>The first corollary issue raised by petitioners is whether IPRA violates Section 1, Article III of the Constitution, which provides that "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be deprived the equal protection of the laws."<br><br>Petitioners maintain that the broad definition of ancestral lands and ancestral domains under Section 3(a) and 3(b) of IPRA includes private lands.

Following their interpretation, IPRA, under Section 56, recognizes the rights of indigenous peoples to their ancestral lands and ancestral domains, <b>subject to the vested rights of the same communities to such ancestral lands and ancestral domains.</b> Such interpretation is obviously incorrect.<br><br>The "property rights" referred to in Section 56 belong to those acquired by individuals, whether indigenous or non-indigenous peoples. Said provision makes no distinction as to the ethnic origins of the ownership of these "property rights." The IPRA thus recognizes and respects "vested rights" regardless of whether they pertain to indigenous or non-indigenous peoples. Where the law does not distinguish, the courts should not distinguish.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> What IPRA only requires is that these "property rights" already exist and/or vested upon its effectivity.<br><br>Further, by the enactment of IPRA, Congress did not purport to annul any and all Torrens titles within areas claimed as ancestral lands or ancestral domains.

Notably,&nbsp; the use of customary laws under IPRA is not absolute, for the law speaks merely of <b>primacy of use</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> The IPRA prescribes the application of such customary laws where these present a workable solution acceptable&nbsp; to the parties, who are members of the same indigenous group.

lands of the public domain, because said ancestral lands and domains are considered as private land, and never to have been part of the public domain, following the doctrine laid down in <i>Cariño vs. Insular Government</i>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[195]</sup><br><br>(2) The constitutional provision vesting ownership over minerals, mineral lands and other natural resources in the State is not violated by Sections 3, 5, 7, 56, 57, 58 and 59 of the IPRA which grant certain rights to the indigenous peoples over the natural resources found within the ancestral domains, e.g., to benefit from and share in the profits from the allocation and utilization of the same, as well as priority rights in the harvesting, extraction, development or exploitation thereof.&nbsp; The State retains full control over the exploration, development and utilization of natural resources even with the grant of said rights to the indigenous peoples, through the imposition of requirements and conditions for the utilization of natural resources under existing laws, such as the Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[196]</sup>and the Philippine Mining Act of 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[197]</sup> Moreover, the rights&nbsp;

While the IPRA recognizes the rights of indigenous peoples with regard to&nbsp; their ancestral&nbsp; lands and&nbsp; domains,&nbsp; it also protects the vested rights of persons, whether indigenous or non-indigenous peoples,&nbsp;

The Due Process Clause of the Constitution is not violated by the provisions (Sections 40, 51-54, 62, 63, 65 and 66) of the IPRA which, among others,&nbsp; establish the composition of the NCIP, and prescribe the application of customary law in certain disputes involving indigenous peoples.&nbsp; The fact&nbsp; the NCIP is composed wholly of indigenous peoples does not mean that it is incapable of being impartial.&nbsp; Moreover, the use of customary laws is sanctioned by paragraph 2, Section 5 of Article XII of the Constitution; and<br><br>(5) The provision of the Implementing Rules characterizing the NCIP as an independent agency under the Office of the President does not infringe upon the President's power of control under Section 17, Article VII of the Constitution, since said provision as well as Section 40 of the IPRA expressly places the NCIP under the Office of the President, and therefore under the President's control and supervision with respect to its administrative functions.

However, the open and free exploration, occupation and purchase of mineral deposits and the land where they may be found were allowed under the Philippine Bill of 1902.&nbsp; Section 21 thereof stated:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 21.&nbsp; That all valuable mineral deposits in public lands in the Philippine Islands, both surveyed and unsurveyed, are hereby declared to be free and open to exploration, occupation and purchase, and the land in which they are found, to occupation and purchase, by citizens of the United States, or of said Islands: <i>Provided</i>, That when on any lands in said Islands entered and occupied as agricultural lands&nbsp;&nbsp; under the provisions of this Act, but not patented, mineral deposits have been found, the working of such mineral deposits is hereby forbidden until the person, association, or corporation who or which has entered and is occupying such lands shall have paid to the Government of said Islands such additional sum or sums as will make the total amount paid for the mineral claim or claims in which said deposits are located equal to the amount charged by the Government for the same as mineral claims.</blockquote><br>Other natural resources such as water and forests were similarly regarded as belonging to the State during both the Spanish and American rule in the Philippines, viz:<br><br>Article 33 of the Law of Waters of August 3, 1866 defined waters of public ownership as (1) the waters springing continuously or intermittently from lands of the public domain; (2) the waters of rivers; and (3) the continuous or intermittent waters of springs and creeks running through their natural channels.<br><br>Article 1 of the same law states:<br><br><blockquote>The following are also part of the national domain open to public use:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coasts or maritime frontiers of the Philippine territory with their coves, inlets, creeks, roadsteads, bays and ports<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coast of the sea, that is, the maritime zone encircling the coasts, to&nbsp; the full width recognized by international law.&nbsp; The state provides for and regulates the police supervision and the uses of this zone as well as the right of refuge and immunity therein, in accordance with law and international treaties.</blockquote><br>With respect to forests, there are references made regarding State-ownership of forest lands in Supreme Court decisions (See Director of Forestry vs. Munoz, 23 SCRA 1183, 1198-1199 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1968]</span>; Director of Lands vs. Abanzado, 65 SCRA 5, 11 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1975]</span>; Mapa vs. Insular Government, 10 Phil. 175, 184 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1908]</span>; Montano vs. Insular Government, 12 Phil 572, 584 <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1909]</span>).<br><br>The State's ownership over natural resources was embodied in the 1935, 1973 and 1987 Constitutions. Section 1, Article XII of the 1935 Constitution declared:<br><br><blockquote>All agricultural, timber and mineral lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, and other natural resources of the Philippines belong to the State, and their disposition, exploitation, development, or utilization shall be limited to citizens of the Philippines, or to corporations or associations at least sixty per centum&nbsp; of the capital&nbsp; of which&nbsp; is owned by such citizens, subject to any existing right, grant, lease or concession at the time of the inauguration of the Government established under this Constitution.&nbsp; Natural resources, with the exception of public agricultural land, shall not be alienated, and no license, concession, or lease for the exploitation, or utilization of any of the natural resources shall be granted for a period exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for another twenty -five years, except as to water rights for irrigation, water supply, fisheries, or industrial uses other than the development of water power, in which cases beneficial use may be the measure and the limit of the grant.</blockquote><br>Section 8, Article XIV of the 1973 Constitution provided:<br><br><blockquote>All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries, wildlife, and other natural resources of the Philippines belong to the State.&nbsp; With the exception of agricultural, industrial or commercial, residential, and resettlement lands of the public domain, natural resources shall not be alienated, and no license, concession, or lease for the exploration, development, exploitation, or utilization of any of the natural resources shall be granted for a period exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for&nbsp; not more than twenty-five years, except as to water rights for irrigation water supply, fisheries, or industrial uses other than the development of water power, in which cases, beneficial use may be the measure and limit of the grant.</blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup><sup> </sup>NOBLEJAS, PHILIPPINE LAW ON NATURAL RESOURCES 1961 Revised Ed., p. 6<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><sup style="font-style: italic;"> </sup><span style="font-style: italic;">See</span> LAUREL (ED.), PROCEEDINGS OF THE PHILIPPINE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, VOL.

Garcia.</i><br><br>Indeed, the judicial power cannot be extended to matters which do not involve actual cases or controversies without upsetting the balance of power among the three branches of the government and erecting, as it were,&nbsp; the judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court, as a third branch of Congress, with power not only to invalidate statutes but even to rewrite them.&nbsp; Yet that is exactly what we would be permitting in this case were we to assume jurisdiction and decide wholesale the constitutional validity of the IPRA contrary to the established rule that a party can question the validity of a statute only if, as applied to him, it is unconstitutional.&nbsp; Here the IPRA is sought to be declared void on its face.<br><br>The only instance where a facial challenge to a statute is allowed is when it operates in the area of freedom of expression. In such instance,&nbsp; the overbreadth doctrine permits a party to challenge the validity of&nbsp; a statute even though as applied to him it is not unconstitutional but it might be if applied to others not before the Court whose activities are constitutionally protected.&nbsp; Invalidation of the statute "on its face" rather than "as applied" is permitted in the interest of preventing a "chilling" effect on freedom of expression. But in other cases, even if it is found that a provision of a statute is unconstitutional, courts will decree only partial invalidity unless the invalid portion is so far inseparable from the rest of the statute that a declaration of partial invalidity is not possible.<br><br>For the Court to exercise its power of review when there is no case or controversy is not only to act without jurisdiction but also to run the risk that, in adjudicating abstract or hypothetical questions, its decision will be based on speculation rather than experience.&nbsp; Deprived of the opportunity to observe the impact of the law, the Court is likely to equate questions of constitutionality&nbsp; with questions of wisdom and is thus likely to intrude into the domain of legislation. Constitutional adjudication, it cannot be too often repeated, cannot take place in a vacuum.<br><br>Some of the brethren contend that not deciding the constitutional issues raised by petitioners will be a "galling cop out"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> or an "advocacy of timidity, let alone isolationism."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> To decline the exercise of jurisdiction in this case is no more a "cop out" or a sign of "timidity" than it was for Chief Justice Marshall in <i>Marbury v.

Madison</i> is remembered for the institution of the power of judicial review, and so that there can be no doubt of this power of our Court, we in this country have enshrined its principle in Art.

Under this concept, the entire earthly territory known as the Philippine Islands was acquired and held by the Crown of Spain.&nbsp; The King, as then head of State, had the supreme power or exclusive dominion over all our lands, waters, minerals and other natural resources. By royal decrees, though, private ownership of real property was recognized upon the showing of (1) a title deed; or (2) ancient possession in the concept of owner, according to which a title could be obtained by prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Refusal to abide by the system and its implementing laws meant the abandonment or waiver of ownership claims.<br><br>By virtue of the 1898 Treaty of Paris, the Philippine archipelago was ceded to the United States.&nbsp; The latter assumed administration of the Philippines and succeeded to the property rights of the Spanish Crown.&nbsp; But under the Philippine Bill of 1902, the US Government allowed and granted patents to Filipino and US citizens for the "free and open&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; exploration, occupation and purchase [of mines] and the land in which they are found."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> To a certain extent, private individuals were entitled to own, exploit and dispose of mineral resources and other rights arising from mining patents.<br><br>This US policy was, however, rejected by the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935 when it crafted and ratified our first Constitution.

XIII].&nbsp; All agricultural, timber, and mineral lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, and other natural resources of the Philippines belong to the State, and their disposition, exploitation, development, or utilization shall be limited to citizens of the Philippines, or to corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of the capital of which is owned by such citizens, subject to any existing right, grant, lease, or concession at the time of the inauguration of the Government established under this Constitution.&nbsp; Natural resources, with the exception of public agricultural land, shall not be alienated, and license, concession, or lease for the exploitation, development, or utilization of any of the natural resources shall be granted for a period exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for another twenty-five years, except as to water rights for irrigation, water supply, fisheries, or industrial uses other than the development of water power, in which cases beneficial use may be the measure and the limit of the grant."</blockquote><br>The concept was carried over in the 1973 and the 1987 Constitutions.&nbsp; Hence, Sections 8 and 9, Article XIV of the 1973 Constitution, state:<br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 8.&nbsp; All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries, wildlife, and other natural resources of the Philippines belong to the State.&nbsp; With the exception of agricultural, industrial or commercial, residential, and resettlement lands of the public domain, natural resources shall not be alienated and no license, concession, or lease for the exploration, development, exploitation, utilization of any of the natural resources shall be granted for a period exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for not more than twenty-five years, except as to water rights for irrigation, water supply, fisheries, or industrial uses other than the development of water power, in which cases beneficial use may be the measure and the limit of the grant.<br><br>SEC. 9.&nbsp; The disposition, exploration, development, exploitation, or utilization of any of the natural resources of the Philippines shall be limited to citizens of the Philippines, or to corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of the capital of which is owned by such citizens.&nbsp; The National Assembly, in the national interest, may allow such citizens, corporations, or associations to enter into service contracts for financial, technical, management, or other forms of assistance with any foreign person or entity for the exploration, development, exploitation, or utilization of any of the natural resources.&nbsp; Existing valid and binding service contracts for financial, technical, management, or other forms of assistance are hereby recognized as such."</blockquote><br>Similarly, Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution, provides:<br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 2.&nbsp; All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum, and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries, forests or timber, wildlife, flora and fauna, and other natural resources are owned by the State. With the exception of agricultural lands, all other natural resources shall not be alienated.&nbsp; The exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources shall be under the full control and supervision of the State. The State may directly undertake such activities, or it may enter into co-production, joint venture, or production-sharing agreements with Filipino citizen, or corporations or associations at least sixty <i>per centum</i> of whose capital is owned by such citizens. Such agreements may be for a period not exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for not more than twenty-five years, and under such terms and conditions as may be provided by law.

In such agreements, the State shall promote the development and use of local scientific and technical resources.<br><br>"The President shall notify the Congress of every contract entered into in accordance with this provision, within thirty days from its execution."</blockquote><br>The adoption of the Regalian Doctrine by the Philippine Commonwealth was initially impelled by the desire to preserve the nation's wealth in the hands of the Filipinos themselves.&nbsp; Nationalism was fervent at the time, and our constitutional framers decided to embody the doctrine in our fundamental law.&nbsp; Charging the State with the conservation of the national patrimony was deemed necessary for Filipino posterity.&nbsp; The arguments in support of the provision are encapsulated by Aruego as follows: "[T]he natural resources, particularly the mineral resources which constituted a great source of wealth, belonged not only to the generation then but also to the succeeding generation and consequently should be conserved for them."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Thus, after expressly declaring that all lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, all forces of energy and other natural resources belonged to the Philippine State, the Commonwealth absolutely prohibited the alienation of these natural resources.&nbsp; Their disposition, exploitation, development and utilization were further restricted only to Filipino citizens and entities that were 60 percent Filipino-owned. The present Constitution even goes further by declaring that such activities "shall be under the full control and supervision of the State."&nbsp; Additionally, it enumerates land classifications and expressly states that only agricultural lands of the public domain shall be alienable.&nbsp; We quote below the relevant provision:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 3.&nbsp; Lands of the public domain are classified into agricultural, forest or timber, mineral lands, and national parks.&nbsp; Agricultural lands of the public domain may be further classified by law according to the uses to which they may be devoted.&nbsp; Alienable lands of the public domain shall be limited to agricultural lands. Private corporations or associations may not hold such alienable lands of the public domain except by lease, for a period not exceeding twenty-five years, renewable for not more than twenty-five years, and not to exceed one thousand hectares in area.&nbsp; x x x."</blockquote><br>Mr. Justice Kapunan upholds private respondents and intervenors in their claim that all ancestral domains and lands are outside the coverage of public domain; and that these properties -- including forests, bodies of water, minerals and parks found therein -- are private and have never been part of the public domain, because they have belonged to the indigenous people's ancestors since time immemorial.<br><br>I submit, however, that all Filipinos, whether indigenous or not, are subject to the Constitution.&nbsp; Indeed, no one is exempt from its all-encompassing provisions. Unlike the 1935 Charter, which was subject to "any existing right, grant, lease or concession," the 1973 and the 1987 Constitutions spoke in absolute terms.&nbsp; Because of the State's implementation of policies considered to be for the common good, all those concerned have to give up, under certain conditions, even vested rights of ownership.<br><br>In <i>Republic v.

Such owner would be entitled to just compensation for the loss sustained.<br><br>In <i>Atok Big-Wedge Mining Company v.

They cannot be more privileged simply because they have chosen to ignore state laws.&nbsp; For having chosen not to be enfolded by statutes on perfecting land titles, ICCs/IPs cannot now maintain their ownership of lands and domains by insisting on their concept of "native title" thereto.&nbsp; It would be plain injustice to the majority of Filipinos who have abided by the law and, consequently, deserve equal opportunity to enjoy the country's resources.<br><br>Respondent NCIP claims that IPRA does not violate the Constitution, because it does not grant ownership of public domains and natural resources to ICCs/IPs.&nbsp; "Rather, it recognizes and mandates respect for the rights of indigenous peoples over their ancestral lands and domains that had never been lands of the public domain."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> I say, however, that such claim finds no legal support.&nbsp; Nowhere in the Constitution is there a provision that exempts such lands and domains from its coverage.&nbsp; Quite the contrary, it declares that <i>all</i> lands of the public domain and natural resources "are owned by the State"; and "with the exception of agricultural lands, all other natural resources shall not be alienated."<br><br>As early as <i>Oh Cho v.

Rather, it is a tribal community that preserves the property for the common but nonetheless exclusive and perpetual benefit of its members, without the attributes of alienation or disposition. <i>This concept, however, still perpetually withdraws such property from the control of the State and from its enjoyment by other citizens of the Republic.&nbsp; The perpetual and exclusive character of private respondents' claims simply makes them repugnant to basic fairness and equality.&nbsp; </i><br><br>Private respondents and intervenors trace their "ownership" of ancestral domains and lands to the pre-Spanish conquest.&nbsp; I should say that, at the time, their claims to such lands and domains was limited to the surfaces thereof since their ancestors were agriculture-based.&nbsp; This must be the continuing scope of the indigenous groups' ownership claims: limited to land, excluding the natural resources found within.<br><br>In any event, if all that the ICCs/IPs demand is preferential <i>use -- not ownership</i> -- of ancestral domains, then I have no disagreement.&nbsp; Indeed, consistent with the Constitution is IPRA's Section 57<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>-- without the too-broad definitions under Section 3 (a) and (b) -- insofar as it grants them priority rights in harvesting, extracting, developing or exploiting natural resources within ancestral domains.<br><br>The concerted effort to malign the Regalian Doctrine as a vestige of the colonial past must fail.&nbsp; Our Constitution vests the ownership of natural resources, not in colonial masters, but in <i>all the Filipino people</i>.&nbsp; <i>As the protector of the Constitution, this Court has the sworn duty to uphold the tenets of that Constitution -- not to dilute, circumvent or create exceptions to them.&nbsp; </i><br><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cariño v.

However, a simple reading of the very wordings of the law belies this statement.<br><br>Section 3 (a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> defines and delineates ancestral domains as "all areas generally belonging to ICCs/IPs comprising lands, inland waters, coastal areas, and <i>natural resources</i> therein, held under a claim of ownership, occupied or possessed by ICCs/IPs, by themselves or through their ancestors, communally or individually since time immemorial, continuously to the present except when interrupted by war, <i>force majeure</i> or displacement x x x.&nbsp; It shall include ancestral lands, forests, pasture, residential, agricultural, and other lands individually owned whether alienable and disposable or otherwise, hunting grounds&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; bodies of water, <i>mineral and other natural resources</i>&nbsp; x x x."&nbsp; (Emphasis ours.)<br><br>Clearly, under the above-quoted provision of IPRA, ancestral domains of ICCs/IPs encompass the natural resources found therein.&nbsp; And Section 7 guarantees recognition and protection of their <i>rights</i> of <i>ownership and possession </i>over such domains.<br><br>The indigenous concept of ownership, as defined under Section 5 of the law, "holds that ancestral domains are the ICC's/IP's private but community property which belongs to all generations and therefore cannot be sold, disposed or destroyed."&nbsp; Simply put, the law declares that ancestral domains, including the natural resources found therein, are <i>owned</i> by ICCs/IPs and cannot be sold, disposed or destroyed.&nbsp; Not only does it vest ownership, as understood under the Civil Code; it adds perpetual exclusivity.&nbsp; This means that while ICCs/IPs could own vast ancestral domains, the majority of Filipinos who are not indigenous can never own any part thereof.<br><br>On the other hand, Section 3 (b)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> of IPRA defines ancestral lands as referring to "lands occupied, possessed and utilized by individuals, families and clans of the ICCs/IPs since time immemorial&nbsp; x x x, under claims of individual or traditional group ownership,&nbsp; x x x&nbsp; including, but not limited to, residential lots, rice terraces or paddies, private forests, swidden farms and tree lots."&nbsp; Section 8 recognizes and protects "the right of ownership and possession of ICCs/IPs to their ancestral lands." Such ownership need not be by virtue of a certificate of title, but simply by possession since time immemorial.<br><br>I believe these statutory provisions directly contravene Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution, more specifically the declaration that the State owns all lands of the public domain, minerals and natural resources - none of which, except agricultural lands, can be alienated. In several cases, this Court has consistently held that non-agricultural land must first be reclassified and converted into alienable or disposable land for agricultural purposes by a positive act of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Mere possession or utilization thereof, however long, does not automatically convert them into private properties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The presumption is that "all lands not appearing to be clearly within private ownership are presumed to belong to the State.&nbsp; Hence, x x x all applicants in land registration proceedings have the burden of overcoming the presumption that the land thus sought to be registered forms part of the public domain.&nbsp; Unless the applicant succeeds in showing by clear and convincing evidence that the property involved was acquired by him or his ancestors either by composition title from the Spanish Government or by possessory information title, or any other means for the proper acquisition of public lands, the property must be held to be part of the public domain.&nbsp; The applicant must present competent and persuasive proof to substantiate his claim; he may not rely on general statements, or mere conclusions of law other than factual evidence of possession and title."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Respondents insist, and the <i>ponencia</i> agrees, that paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sections 3 are merely definitions and should not be construed independently of the other provisions of the law.&nbsp; But, precisely, a definition is "a statement of the meaning of a word or word group."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It determines or settles the nature of the thing or person defined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Thus, after defining a term as encompassing several items, one cannot thereafter say that the same term should be interpreted as excluding one or more of the enumerated items in its definition.&nbsp; For that would be misleading the people who would be bound by the law.&nbsp; In other words, since RA 8371 defines ancestral domains as including the natural resources found therein and further states that ICCs/IPs own these <i>ancestral domains</i>, then it means that ICCs/IPs can own natural resources.<br><br>In fact, Intervenors Flavier et al. submit that <i>everything above and below </i>these ancestral domains, with no specific limits, likewise belongs to ICCs/IPs.&nbsp; I say that this theory directly contravenes the Constitution.&nbsp; Such outlandish contention further disregards international law which, by constitutional fiat, has been adopted as part of the law of the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><i style="text-decoration: underline;">No Land Area Limits Are<br>Specified by RA 8371</i><br><br>Under Section 3, Article XII of the Constitution, Filipino citizens may acquire no more than 12 hectares of alienable public land, whether by purchase, homestead or grant.&nbsp; More than that, but not exceeding 500 hectares, they may hold by lease only.<br><br><i>RA 8371, however, speaks of no area or term limits to ancestral lands and domains.&nbsp; </i>In fact, by their mere definitions, they could cover vast tracts of the nation's territory.&nbsp; The properties under the assailed law cover everything held, occupied or possessed "by themselves or through their ancestors, communally or individually since time immemorial."&nbsp; It also includes all "lands which may no longer be exclusively occupied by [them] but from which they traditionally had access to for their subsistence and traditional activities, particularly the home ranges of ICCs/IPs who are still nomadic and/or shifting cultivators."<br><br>Nomadic groups have no fixed area within which they hunt or forage for food.&nbsp; As soon as they have used up the resources of a certain area, they move to another place or go back to one they used to occupy.&nbsp; From year to year, a growing tribe could occupy and use enormous areas, to which they could claim to have had "traditional access." If nomadic ICCs/IPs succeed in acquiring title to their enlarging ancestral domain or land, several thousands of hectares of land may yet be additionally delineated as their private property.<br><br>Similarly, the Bangsa Moro people's claim to their ancestral land is not based on compounded or consolidated title, but "on a collective stake to the right to claim what their forefathers secured for them when they first set foot on our country."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> They trace their right to occupy what they deem to be their ancestral land way back to their ancient sultans and datus, who had settled in many islands that have become part of Mindanao.&nbsp; This long history of occupation is the basis of their claim to their ancestral lands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Already, as of June 1998, over 2.5 million hectares have been claimed by various ICCs/IPs as ancestral domains; and over 10 thousand hectares, as ancestral lands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Based on ethnographic surveys, the solicitor general estimates that ancestral domains cover 80 percent of our mineral resources and between 8 and 10 million of the 30 million hectares of land in the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> <i>This means that four fifths of its natural resources and one third of the country's land will be concentrated among 12 million Filipinos constituting 110 ICCs,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><i> while over 60 million other Filipinos constituting the overwhelming majority will have to share the remaining.&nbsp; </i>These figures indicate a violation of the constitutional principle of a "more equitable distribution of opportunities, income, and wealth" among Filipinos.<br><br><i style="text-decoration: underline;">RA 8371 Abdicates the<br>State Duty to Take Full Control<br>and Supervision of Natural Resources </i><br><br>Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution, further provides that "[t]he exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources shall be under the full control and supervision of the State." The State may (1) directly undertake such activities; or (2) enter into co-production, joint venture or production-sharing agreements with Filipino citizens or entities, 60 percent of whose capital is owned by Filipinos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Such agreements, however, shall not exceed 25 years, renewable for the same period and under terms and conditions as may be provided by law.<br><br>But again, RA 8371 relinquishes this constitutional power of <i>full control</i> in favor of ICCs/IPs, insofar as natural resources found within their territories are concerned.&nbsp; Pursuant to their rights of ownership and possession, they may develop and manage the natural resources, benefit&nbsp;&nbsp; from&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; share&nbsp;&nbsp; in the&nbsp;&nbsp; profits&nbsp;&nbsp; from the&nbsp; allocation&nbsp; and the utilization thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> And they may exercise such right without any time limit, unlike non-ICCs/IPs who may do so only for a period not exceeding 25 years, renewable for a like period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Consistent with the Constitution, the rights of ICCs/IPs to exploit, develop and utilize natural resources must also be limited to such period.<br><br>In addition, ICCs/IPs are given the right to negotiate directly the terms and conditions for the exploration of natural resources,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> a right vested by the Constitution only in the State.&nbsp; Congress, through IPRA, has in effect abdicated in favor of a minority group the State's power of ownership and full control over a substantial part of the national patrimony, in contravention of our most fundamental law.<br><br>I make clear, however, that to the extent that ICCs/IPs may undertake small-scale utilization of natural resources and cooperative fish farming, I absolutely have no objection.&nbsp; These undertakings are certainly allowed under the third paragraph of Section 2, Article XII of the Constitution.<br><br>Having already disposed of the two major constitutional dilemmas wrought by RA 8371 - (1) ownership of ancestral lands and domains and the natural resources therein; and (2) the ICCs/IPs' control of the exploration, development and utilization of such resources - I believe I should no longer tackle the following collateral issues petitioners have brought up:<br><br>1. Whether the inclusion of private lands within the coverage of ancestral domains amounts to undue deprivation of private property<br><br>2. Whether ICCs/IPs may regulate the entry/exit of migrants<br><br>3. Whether ancestral domains are exempt from real property taxes, special levies and other forms of exaction<br><br>4. Whether customary laws and traditions of ICCs/IPs should first be applied in the settlements of disputes over their rights and claims<br><br>5. Whether the composition and the jurisdiction of the National Commission of Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) violate the due process and equal protection clauses<br><br>6. Whether members of the ICCs/IPs may be recruited into the armed forces against their will<br><br>I believe that the first three of the above collateral issues have been rendered academic or, at least, no longer of "transcendental importance," in view of my contention that the two major IPRA propositions are based on unconstitutional premises.&nbsp; On the other hand, I think that in the case of the last three, it is best to await specific cases filed by those whose rights may have been injured by specific provisions of RA 8371.<br><br><center><u>Epilogue</u></center><br><br>Section 5, Article XII of the Constitution, provides:<br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 5.&nbsp; The State, subject to the provisions of this Constitution and national development policies and programs, shall protect the rights of indigenous cultural communities to their ancestral lands to ensure their economic, social, and cultural well being.<br><br>"The Congress may provide for the applicability of customary laws governing property rights and relations in determining the ownership and extent of ancestral domain."</blockquote><br>Clearly, there are two parameters that must be observed in the protection of the rights of ICCs/IPs:&nbsp; (1) the provisions of the 1987 Constitution and (2) national development policies and programs.<br><br>Indigenous peoples may have long been marginalized in Philippine politics and society.&nbsp; This does not, however, give Congress any license to accord them rights that the Constitution withholds from the rest of the Filipino people.&nbsp; I would concede giving them <i>priority </i>in the use, the enjoyment and the preservation of their ancestral lands and domains.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> But to grant <i>perpetual</i> ownership and control of the nation's substantial wealth to them, to the exclusion of other Filipino citizens who have chosen to live and abide by our previous and present Constitutions, would be not only unjust but also subversive of the rule of law.<br><br>In giving ICCs/IPs rights in derogation of our fundamental law, Congress is effectively mandating "reverse discrimination."&nbsp; In seeking to improve their lot, it would be doing so at the expense of the majority of the Filipino people.&nbsp; Such short-sighted and misplaced generosity will spread the roots of discontent and, in the long term, fan the fires of turmoil to a conflagration of national proportions.<br><br>Peace cannot be attained by brazenly and permanently depriving the many in order to coddle the few, however disadvantaged they may have been. Neither can a just society be approximated by maiming the healthy to place them at par with the injured.&nbsp; Nor can the nation survive by enclaving its wealth for the exclusive benefit of favored minorities.<br><br><i>Rather, the law must help the powerless by enabling them to take advantage of opportunities and privileges that are open to all and by preventing the powerful from exploiting and oppressing them.&nbsp; This is the essence of social justice - empowering and enabling the poor to be able to compete with the rich and, thus, equally enjoy the blessings of prosperity, freedom and dignity.</i><br><br>WHEREFORE, I vote to partially<i> GRANT </i>the Petition and to <i>DECLARE</i> as <i>UNCONSTITUTIONAL</i> Sections 3(a) and (b), 5, 6, 7(a) and (b), 8 and related provisions of RA 8371<i>.</i><br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><sup> </sup><i>Kilosbayan v.
