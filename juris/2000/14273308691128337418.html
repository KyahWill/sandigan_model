"[C]onspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it. The agreement may be deduced from the manner in which the offense was committed;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> or from the acts of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime indubitably pointing to and indicating a joint purpose, a concert of action and a community of interest."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> It is not essential that there be proof of the previous agreement to commit the crime. It is sufficient that the form and manner in which the attack was accomplished clearly indicate unity of action and purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Conspiracy is undoubtedly present in the case at bar since all the accused performed concerted acts in pursuit of a joint purpose: they lay in wait for the two (2) victims, captured, hog-tied and gagged them and finally took turns in stabbing and hacking them to death with bolos – at the instigation of herein accused-appellant who promised and, in fact, paid Agustin Luyong @ <i>Jack</i> and Rolando Tano @ <i>Brando/Boy Negro</i> sums of money enclosed in small envelopes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Parenthetically, the records show that accused-appellant even took active part in trussing up the victims before they were brought to the place where they were killed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Conspiracy having been established, ‘[a]ll the conspirators are liable as co-principals regardless of the manner and extent of their participation since in the contemplation of law, the act of one is the act of all."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Treachery, likewise, attended the killing of the two (2) victims. There is treachery when the offender commits the crime employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from any defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> For treachery to be appreciated, it must be shown that: 1.] the means of execution employed gave the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or retaliate; and 2.] the means of execution was <i>deliberately</i> or <i>consciously adopted</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>In this case, the means, method and form of execution employed gave the victims no opportunity to defend themselves or to retaliate; they, likewise, were deliberately adopted by the malefactors to ensure that their persons would not be endangered<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> considering that the victims’ hands were tied behind their backs with nylon ropes and their mouths were gagged with their shirts before the accused commenced taking turns in hacking them with bolos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> The obvious helplessness of the victims when they were killed and even as they pleaded for their lives need not be overemphasized.<br><br>The aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength, although alleged, is absorbed in treachery and can no longer be appreciated separately.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> In this connection, it bears stressing that when treachery qualifies the crime to murder, the generic aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength is necessarily included in the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Stated differently, when treachery qualifies the crime to murder, it absorbs abuse of superior strength and the latter can not be appreciated even as a generic aggravating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>Evident premeditation must likewise be appreciated in the commission of the offenses. Evident premeditation can be presumed where, as in this case, conspiracy is directly established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> The essence of evident premeditation is that the execution of the criminal act is preceded by cool thought and reflection upon the resolution to carry out the criminal intent during the space of time sufficient to arrive at a calm judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Its requisites are: 1.] the time the accused determined to commit the crime; 2.] an act manifestly indicating that the accused has clung to his determination; 3.] a sufficient lapse of time between such determination and execution to allow him to reflect upon the circumstances of his act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>In this case, when accused-appellant was informed by Francisco Salva in the morning of that fateful day of November 1, 1986 that he saw the two (2) victims gathering young coconuts at the <i>hacienda</i> grounds, appellant promptly ordered Salva and some others, including Edgar Gibone, to board a jeep which he drove to the place where the victims were seen gathering coconuts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> with the intention of pursuing them. Although they gave chase, appellant and his group failed to catch the two (2) boys who were already on the crest of a hill at the time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> The chase was then called off and the pursuers returned to appellant’s house where he sent somebody to fetch Agustin Luyong @ <i>Jack</i> and Rolando Tano @ <i>Boy Negro/Brando</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>Later in the afternoon, <i>Jack</i> and <i>Boy Negro/Brando</i> arrived at appellant’s house where the latter ordered them to catch the victims and to kill them<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> should they return.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> The two boys indeed returned and were caught by <i>Jack</i> and <i>Boy Negro/Brando</i> who "hand-tied" them and brought them to the house of Joaquin Reyes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Appellant was then fetched from his house upon the capture of the victims,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> where, after castigating the two boys and calling them thieves,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> ordered <i>Jack</i> and <i>Boy Negro/Brando</i> to kill them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>Evident premeditation indicates deliberate planning and preparation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> The foregoing facts show too clearly that the killing of the victims were calculated and premeditated. In this case, accused-appellant had more than ample time to coolly reflect upon the consequences of his act when the victims were able to escape the first time they were pursued by appellant and his group. Instead, appellant had <i>Jack</i> and <i>Boy Negro/Brando</i> summoned and ordered them to catch the victims and kill them if they returned. Appellant was afforded even more time to contemplate on the repercussions of his deed when <i>Jack</i> and <i>Boy Negro/Brando</i> set out to do his bidding. However, instead, of desisting from his murderous inclinations, accused-appellant clung to his resolve when <i>Jack</i> and <i>Boy Negro/Brando</i> returned with the two victims and ordered them killed.<br><br>Likewise, there can be no question that the crimes were committed in consideration of a price promise or reward (<i>precio promesa o recompensa</i>) considering that Agustin Luyong @ Jack was hired by accused-appellant for a price of P5,000.00 to kill the two (2) victims and in fact received P200.00 contained in an airmail envelope as down payment with the assurance that the balance would be paid after the job.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> However while this circumstance is qualifying in murder, it would merely be generic aggravating if it concurs with other qualifying circumstances like treachery,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>The aggravating circumstance of ignominy (<i>ignominia</i>), although alleged can not be appreciated in this case. Ignominy is a circumstance pertaining to the moral order which adds disgrace and obloquy to the material injury caused by the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> The clause "Which add ignominy to the natural effects of the act" contemplates a situation where the means employed or the circumstances tend to make the effects of the crime <i>more humiliating or to put the offended party to shame</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> In this case, there is no showing that the offenses were perpetrated in a manner which tended to make its effects more humiliating to the victims.<br><br>Neither can the act of slicing the left leg of Napoleon Aldeguer’s lifeless body nor the stabbing of Mateo Aldeguer’s corpse in the stomach be considered indications of ignominia because what is required is that the crime be committed in a manner that tends to make its effects more humiliating to the victim, that is, <i>add to his moral suffering</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> Thus, it was held that the fact that the accused sliced and took the flesh from the thighs, legs and shoulders of the victim with a knife <i>after killing the victim</i> did not add ignominy to the natural effects of the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>Before its amendment by R. A. No. 7659, Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code reads:<br><blockquote>"ART. 248. <i>Murder</i>. – Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246 shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period to death if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><br>1. With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity.<br><br>2. In consideration of a price, reward or promise.<br><br>3.

On occasion of nay of the calamities enumerated in the preceding paragraph, or of an earthquake, eruption of a volcano, destructive cyclone, epidemic or public calamity.<br><br>5. With evident premeditation.<br><br>6.With cruelty, by deliberately and inhumanly augmenting the suffering of the victim, or outraging or scoffing at his person or corpse."<br></blockquote>Considering the presence of several aggravating circumstances with no mitigating circumstance the penalty in its maximum period which is death<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> would be imposable under Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code. Fortunately for accused-appellant, since the crimes were committed during the suspension of the imposition of the death penalty and prior to its reimposition under Republic Act No. 7659, the imposable penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> This penalty is single and indivisible, thus, it shall be imposed regardless of any attending aggravating or mitigating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br>The civil indemnity which is awarded without need of further proof other than the death of the victim is affirmed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Conformably, however, with controlling jurisprudence, the civil indemnity should be increased to P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><br><br>The trial court, in sentencing the accused-appellant, erroneously equated <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to life imprisonment. This Court once again reiterates that the penalties of life imprisonment and <i>reclusion perpetua</i> are not the same.<br><br>"While ‘life imprisonment’ may appear to be the English translation of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, in reality, it goes deeper than that. First, ‘life imprisonment’ is invariably imposed for serious offenses penalized by special laws, while <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is prescribed under the Revised Penal Code. Second, ‘life imprisonment’, unlike <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, does not carry with it any accessory penalty. Third, ‘life imprisonment’ does not appear to have any definite extent or duration, while <i>reclusion perpetua</i> entails imprisonment for at least thirty (30) years after which the convict becomes eligible for pardon, although the maximum period thereof shall in no case exceed forty (40) years."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> with the sole modification that the civil indemnity for the heirs of the victims be increased to Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00), the Decision appealed from is hereby <i>AFFIRMED</i> in all other respects.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno, Kapunan</i>, and <i>Pardo, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Record, pp. 223, 234, 238.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 297-299.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> TSN, 20 May 1987, pp. 9-10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> TSN, 1 September 1987, pp. 8-11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Exhibit A.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Exhibits B and D.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Record, pp. 521-535.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Record, pp. 1388-1389; RTC Decision, pp. 29-30.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> TSN, 02 August 1988, p. 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 8.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 9.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 10-11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i>, p. 15, Exh.
