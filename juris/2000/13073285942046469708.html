				<BR><BR><p align="justify">Before us is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the 
Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated September 7, 1993, as 
well as the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated November 
9, 1993, of the Sandiganbayan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> finding 
herein petitioner PO1 Eduardo P. Balanay of the Philippine National Police 
(PNP), guilty beyond reasonable doubt of homicide in the killing of Diomercio 
Antabo.</p>
<p align="justify">On September 26, 1991, Special Prosecution Officer Gregorio G. 
Pimentel filed with the Sandiganbayan an Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>charging petitioner Eduardo Balanay with 
murder committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">That on or about the 12th day of June, 1991, in the 
Municipality of Leon B. Postigo, Zamboanga del Norte, Philippines, and within 
the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, a public 
officer, being then a member of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and 
assigned as Station Guard in the Municipal Building of Leon B. Postigo, 
Zamboanga del Norte, thus committing the offense in relation to his office, 
armed with his issued firearm and with intent to kill by means of treachery and 
evident premeditation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously 
attack, assault and shoot one Diomercio Candes Antabo, a detention prisoner, 
thereby inflicting upon him gunshot wound on the vital part of his body which 
caused his instantaneous death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the 
victim in such amount as will be proven during the trial of the above-entitled 
case.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Contrary to law.</p>
<p align="justify">Duly arraigned on November 25, 1991, petitioner Eduardo Balanay 
pleaded "Not Guilty" to the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p>
<p align="justify">When the court heard the case, the prosecution presented only 
one witness in the person of Dr. Proceso L. Benlot, who at the time material to 
the case was the Municipal Health Officer of Leon Postigo and Siayan, Zamboanga 
del Norte. He declared that after medical school, he did not take any special 
training in medico legal examination although he attended several seminars 
conducted by their chief of office; and that he had also examined about 50 
cadavers for medico legal purposes.</p>
<p align="justify">Dr. Benlot testified that on June 12, 1991 at about 1:00 
o'clock in the afternoon, he conducted a post mortem examination on the dead 
body of Diomercio C. Antabo, upon the request of the PNP Station Commander, 
Pedro Bao, of the Municipality of Leon B. Postigo, Zamboanga del Norte. 
According to Dr. Benlot, Bao identified the cadaver as that of Diomercio C. 
Antabo.</p>
<p align="justify">When the cadaver was found, the deceased was wearing a dark 
blue T-shirt and maong pants. He was lying on his chest, with his right face on 
the ground. Because the area was sloping downward, his feet were elevated 
towards the municipal building. Blood was mostly found on the area where his 
head laid. The blood was still fresh, as his body was still soft. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">Dr. Benlot found the following wounds on the cadaver of 
Antabo:</p>
<ol><li>Old scald area at the lateral side of the arm near the elbow joint. Must 
have been sustained by the deceased about 24 hours before he conducted the 
examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <br><br>
</li><li>Old scald area on the right chest, which might have been inflicted at the 
time, more, or less, the injury on the right elbow was suffered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <br><br>
</li><li>Linear abrasion at the edge of the right eyebrow.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <br><br>
</li><li>Fresh gunshot wound of entry, more or less half an inch in diameter, and 
about 1 inch above the right eyebrow, lateral end.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <br><br>
</li><li>Exit wound about 3-4 inches in diameter, at the back of the head, behind 
the left ear and above the lobe, particularly on the temporo occipital area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </li></ol>
<p align="justify">Based on Dr. Benlot's assessment, the immediate cause of death 
of the victim was cerebral injury and acute blood loss. The gunshot entry wound 
was about half an inch in diameter, approximately one inch above the lateral end 
of the right eyebrow, and the gunshot exit wound was about three to four inches 
in diameter behind and above the left ear lobe. Dr. Benlot further declared that 
in his opinion, the trajectory of the bullet was going downwards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">On cross-examination, Dr. Benlot testified that under normal 
condition, and considering the location of the gunshot entry wound, his opinion 
was that the assailant, at the time he pulled the trigger, was in front of the 
deceased, or if not directly in front, somewhere in front.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">Dr. Benlot also declared that the information given him by Bao 
was that the deceased Antabo a detention prisoner, was shot in order to stop him 
from escaping. Dr. Benlot stated that if this information was true, there was a 
great possibility that the deceased, when shouted at, turned his back and faced 
the assailant, and at that moment, was fired upon. Hence, the gunshot entry 
wound was on the right side of the head of the victim and the exit wound was at 
the left side of the back of the head.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">Dr. Benlot likewise declared it was impossible that while 
Antabo was moving downward, he must have turned his back partially when he heard 
somebody shouting and at that precise moment, he was hit. In that instant, the 
trajectory of the bullet would somewhat be parallel to the shoulder of the 
deceased and in line with the assailant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">Defense witness Casiano Dagayluan testified that he is a PNP 
member assigned to the Investigation Section of the Municipality of Leon B. 
Postigo, Zamboanga del Norte Police Station; that the Investigation Section was 
located at the ground floor of the municipal building; and that at the back of 
the said office is a window.</p>
<p align="justify">On June 12, 1991 at around 8:00 to 12:00 o'clock in the 
morning, Dagayluan reported for work. Petitioner Balanay, a fellow PNP member, 
also reported for work and was assigned to the detention cell which was just 
beside his office. He overheard Antabo, the lone detention prisoner, asking 
Balanay for permission to go to the comfort room. Since the comfort room inside 
the municipal building was out of order, petitioner Balanay escorted Antabo to 
the back of the municipal building where he could answer the call of nature. 
While passing his office, Dagayluan heard Balanay saying "Do not run away if you 
want to move your bowel outside".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> 
</p>
<p align="justify">When Antabo and Balanay were already outside the building, 
Dagayluan heard a burst of shots. Dagayluan was then at his desk doing some 
paper work when he heard the first shot. After the first shot, he looked at the 
window and saw Balanay about 10 meters away from him while Antabo was about 20 
meters away from Balanay. He saw Balanay aimed his armalite rifle and fired the 
third shot, but he did not see Antabo fall to the ground. Thereafter, he saw 
Balanay, together with Eyas, verifying the dead body. Dagayluan informed Station 
Commander Bao about the incident upon arrival of the latter and they immediately 
went to the crime scene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">Defense witness PO1 Julito Eyas testified that he is also a 
member of the PNP stationed at Leon B. Postigo Police Station, Zamboanga del 
Norte; and that on June 12, 1991, he reported for duty as a radio operator. Only 
three policemen reported for work on that day; the two others were Dagayluan and 
Balanay who was detailed as jail guard. Station Commander Bao was then at the 
gym, watching the program in connection with the Independence Day's 
celebration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">Defense witness Eyas testified that he is also a policeman 
assigned in the said Police Station of Leon B. Postigo; that at about 11:00 
o'clock in the morning of June 12, 1991, Antabo pretended to defecate. While 
outside, at the back portion of the municipal building, he saw Antabo ran away 
until he reached the sloping area. Balanay fired a warning shot and he heard 
Balanay saying "Stop, don't run" but Antabo continued running. Upon reaching the 
sloping area, Balanay fired another shot and hit the victim. At that time, he 
(Eyas) was about 10 meters from Balanay and 30 meters from the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">On cross-examination, Eyas stated that he was in his office 
when he heard the three shots. After hearing the two shots, he looked at the 
window and saw Antabo lying on the ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Responding to clarificatory questions 
from the court, Eyas declared that three warning shots were fired in succession. 
He was already at the window when the second shot was fired. It was then that he 
saw Antabo running toward the sloping area. Between the time he first saw Antabo 
to the time the latter was hit, Antabo was able to run about 40 meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">Eyas likewise stated that, as police officer, he underwent 
training on how to handle prisoners and use a gun, and that if he were to 
disable a person, he would aim just at the foot or leg.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner Eduardo Balanay testified that at the time material 
to the case, he was a Private First Class of the PNP, and stationed at the 
municipal jail of Leon B. Postigo, Zamboanga del Norte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In his entire career as a police officer, 
he served as jail guard several times inasmuch as their post were rotated. When 
the shooting incident happened, he served as a jail guard for seven days because 
on the 13th of June, the day after he shot the victim, he was relieved from his 
duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">From June 7 to 12, 1991, he was detailed as building and jail 
guard at the Leon B. Postigo Municipal Building. During that period, Diomercio 
C. Antabo was already a detention prisoner and accused of robbery with homicide 
before Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Sindangan, Siayan and Leon B. Postigo, 
Zamboanga del Norte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">On June 12, 1991, at around 11:40 in the morning, Antabo asked 
permission from petitioner to defecate. The comfort room inside the municipal 
building was out of order, thus petitioner escorted Antabo to the rear of the 
municipal building. Upon reaching that area, Antabo walked fast. Balanay fired a 
warning shot with his M-16 rifle because the place where Antabo passed was 
sloping downward and there were plenty of tall grasses. Antabo ran away from 
Balanay, moved towards his left and looked back at him by glancing to the right. 
Balanay told him not to run, but Antabo continued running towards the sloping 
area where tall grasses grew. Balanay fired a second warning shot, but Antabo 
did not heed his warning. Antabo merely looked back at him while running fast, 
and while doing so, the petitioner fired the third shot, and hit Antabo, causing 
him to fall down. The distance between the place where the petitioner fired his 
M-16 rifle and the spot where Antabo was hit was about 30 to 40 meters, more or 
less. Balanay claimed that he merely intended to hit Antabo on the left leg to 
stop him from running, but Antabo was instead hit on the head.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">After Antabo fell, Eyas accompanied a frightened Balanay to 
check on the victim but found the latter already dead. Dagayluan and other PNP 
went to the rear portion of the municipal building and saw the deceased. Eyas 
and Dagayluan brought cameras to take pictures.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner Balanay also declared that, in connection with the 
shooting incident, Carmelita Antabo, wife of the victim, filed a complaint 
against him. The People's Law Enforcement Board (PLEB) investigated the 
complaint and on the basis of the evidence presented, the PLEB found him not 
guilty of the administrative charge. Likewise, the Sangguniang Bayan of Leon B. 
Postigo passed a resolution on July 8, 1991, commending him for "his act of 
courage to prevent a prisoner [Antabo] to escape." The resolution expressly 
stated that the members of the Sangguniang Bayan support the petitioner against 
the criminal complaint filed by the family of Antabo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">On cross-examination, petitioner stated that he received his 
M-16 rifle only on the first week of May 1991. He did not undergo any training 
on how to operate the same. However, on clarificatory questions asked by the 
Court, petitioner stated that he had training in using a .38 caliber handgun and 
M-16 rifle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">On September 7, 1993, the Sandiganbayan rendered its decision, 
convicting petitioner Balanay of Homicide, the dispositive portion of which 
reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">WHEREFORE, the Court finds EDUARDO BALANAY Y PENADOS guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of homicide defined in Art. 
249 of the Revised Penal Code and included in the offense charged in the 
Information and, there being the aggravating circumstance of taking advantage of 
public position without any mitigating circumstance in offset, imposes upon him 
the indeterminate penalty ranging from TEN (10) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of 
<i><u>prision mayor</u></i>, as minimum, to SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS, FOUR (4) 
MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of <i><u>reclusion temporal</u></i>, as maximum.</p>
<p align="justify">He is ordered to indemnify the heirs of Diomercio Antabo y 
Candes in the amount of P50,000.00, Philippine Currency.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On September 21, 1993, petitioner filed a Motion for 
Reconsideration and/or New Trial but the Sandiganbayan in its Resolution dated 
November 9, 1993 denied it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Hence, this appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner faults the Sandiganbayan in holding 
that:</p></blockquote>
<ol><li>The victim was shot in front;<br><br>
</li><li>The accused was guilty of the crime of homicide; and<br><br>
</li><li>There was suppression of evidence. </li></ol>
<p align="justify">Petitioner contends that he should not have been required to 
present his evidence and that the case should have been dismissed outright 
because the testimony of the lone prosecution witness, Dr. Benlot, does not 
prove his alleged guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner likewise contends that the evidence of the 
prosecution is weak because Dr. Benlot testified only on his post-mortem 
examination of the cadaver of Antabo and not on the circumstances leading to the 
shooting of the victim. He argues that the prosecution had no testimonial 
evidence from an eyewitness that he (petitioner) was allegedly in front of the 
victim when he shot the latter. On the other hand, defense witness Dagayluan 
testified that while the victim was running, petitioner fired two warning shots 
which the victim ignored, thereby forcing the petitioner to fire the third and 
fatal shot. Defense witness Eyas testified that the victim was shot while trying 
to escape. In other words, petitioner argues that he should not be held 
accountable for his act of shooting the detention prisoner, Antabo, as it was 
done in the lawful discharge of his official duty.</p>
<p align="justify">The appeal, not being meritorious, must fail.</p>
<p align="justify">It is a settled jurisprudence that in criminal cases the 
prosecution has the <i>onus probandi</i> in establishing the guilt of the 
accused. <i>Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non que negat</i>., <i>i.e</i>., he 
who asserts, not he who denies, must prove.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> However, once the defendant admits the 
crime charged but raises a justification for its commission, the burden of proof 
is shifted to him to prove justification to relieve himself of any criminal 
liability or mitigate its gravity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> To 
prove justification, the defendant must rely on the strength of his own evidence 
and not on the weakness of the prosecution, for even if it were weak, it could 
not be disbelieved after the accused had admitted the killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In the instant case, by invoking the 
justifying circumstance of fulfillment of a duty under Article 11 of the Revised 
Penal Code, petitioner had the burden of proving that: (a) as the offender, he 
acted in the performance of a duty, and (b) the injury or offense committed was 
the necessary consequence of the due performance or lawful exercise of such 
duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Sadly, however, he failed to 
prove that these requisites were present to justify his killing of Diomercio 
Antabo.</p>
<p align="justify">After a thorough review of the transcript of stenographic notes 
in this case, this Court entertains no doubt as to the proper weight and 
appreciation accorded by the Sandiganbayan to the testimonies of the lone 
prosecution witness and the witnesses for the defense.</p>
<p align="justify">On the witness stand, petitioner Balanay declared that he shot 
detention prisoner Antabo while at a distance of 30 to 40 meters from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Defense witnesses Dagayluan and Eyas 
corroborated his statement on that point. Dagayluan stated that:</p>

<p align="justify">Considering the testimony of Dr. Benlot that the cadaver of 
Antabo was found about 20 meters only from the municipal building, it appeared 
that Antabo was not in the act of escaping when he was shot by petitioner. The 
testimony of Dr. Benlot commands credence considering that he was a 
disinterested witness while defense witnesses Dagayluan and Eyas had a motive to 
testify in favor of petitioner Balanay who was their co-employee and brother 
policeman for almost ten years. They were biased in favor of the petitioner. A 
witness is said to be biased when his relation to the cause or to the parties is 
such that he has an incentive to exaggerate or give false color to his 
statements, or to suppress or to pervert the truth, or to state what is false. 
Bias is that which excites the disposition to see and report matters as they are 
wished for rather than as they are.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>

considering the location of the gunshot entry wound located approximately one 
inch above the lateral end of the right eyebrow and the gunshot exit wound 
behind and above the left ear lobe, he strongly believed and opined that the 
assailant, at the time he pulled the trigger, was in front of the deceased, or

<p align="justify">For the victim to sustain a gunshot wound about one inch above 
the lateral end of the right eyebrow, and at the back of the head behind the 
left ear and above the lobe, the victim must turn the upper part of his body by 
about 180 degrees from his front to his right such that his shoulder would be 
more or less parallel to the path of the bullet. It would be physically 
impossible for the victim to do this considering that the victim was running 
fast, away from the accused and towards a sloping area. Besides petitioner 
Balanay and defense witness Dagayluan clearly stated that the victim, when 
ordered to stop, merely glanced at the petitioner.</p>
<p align="justify">Significantly, the petitioner initially testified that when he 
fired his M-16 rifle at Antabo, he merely intended to hit him on the left leg to 
paralyze and stop him from running. However, in response to clarificatory 
questions of the court, the petitioner admitted that his intention was also to 
kill the victim. The said testimony of the petitioner which is a judicial 
admission of guilt for the crime of homicide as charged in the information in 
this case, is quoted, thus -</p>

<p align="justify">Although petitioner Balanay was then on duty, his act of 
shooting detention prisoner Antabo was not justified since the latter was not 
committing any offense. As aptly held in People v. De la Cruz,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> "Performance of duties does not include 
murder." Hence, in the case at bench, the Sandiganbayan correctly rejected 
petitioner's plea that he was acting in the performance of his official duty as 
a policeman/jail guard.</p>
<p align="justify">With regard to the third assigned error, petitioner contends 
that he should be granted a new trial because two other defense witnesses, 
namely, Gemma Velos and Anita Elumbra, failed to testify, and that their 
testimonies together with certain pictures constitute new and material evidence, 
which if introduced and admitted, would probably change the judgment of 
conviction rendered against him.</p>
<p align="justify">Rule 121, Sec. 2 (b) of the Revised Rules of Court, 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Grounds for a new trial. - The court shall grant a new trial on 
any of the following grounds:</p></blockquote>

<div align="center">xxx </div></td>

<div align="center">xxx </div></td>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">b.) That new and material evidence has been discovered which 
the accused could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at 
the trial, and which if introduced and admitted, would probably change the 
judgment.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The Sandiganbayan extensively discussed petitioner's motion for 
new trial and found the same to be defective and without merit, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The accused has not made out a case for new trial. The motion 
is not supported by the affidavits of the proposed witnesses, in disregard of 
the requirements of Section 4, Rule 121, 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure. The 
motion, which is not under oath, does not even give a brief narration of the 
facts to which the alleged witnesses will testify. No statement whatever is made 
in the motion explaining even in a sketchy manner what picture (Annexes A, B, 
and C) are all about. The man shown in two of the pictures is not identified as 
Antabo. Consequently, the Court could not tell whether the testimony of the said 
witness and the pictures would probably change the judgment, if admitted in 
evidence. (Sec. 2(b), Rule 121).</p>
<p align="justify">No efforts appear to have been exerted to contact the alleged 
witnesses before the rendition of the decision. The record is bereft of any 
attempt to subpoena them during the trial. Another requirement for the granting 
of new trial is that the evidence could not with reasonable diligence have been 
discovered and produced at the trial.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the pictures, the accused himself testified in court that 
his witnesses, Casiano J. Dagayluan and Jualito M. Eyas, were each armed with a 
camera to take pictures when they went to the scene where Antabo, fell, but none 
was produced during the trial (see Decision, page 27). It is only now that 
pictures are proposed to be presented. In short, the pictures are not newly 
discovered evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">Assuming the man depicted in the pictures was Antabo, his 
T-shirt appears to have been rolled up to his chest. If, as claimed during the 
trial, he ran fast for about 30 to 40 meters before he was fired upon, the lower 
part of the T-shirt would rolled down below his waistline. He could not have 
been rolling up his T-shirt while allegedly running away. Needless to say, this 
circumstance militates against the case of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">We agree with the foregoing observations of the 
Sandiganbayan.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, the commendation given to petitioner by the 
Sangguniang Panglungsod of Leon Postigo, Zamboanga del Norte "for his act of 
courage in preventing detention prisoner from escaping" does not prove his 
alleged innocence or justify his admitted killing of Antabo in the light of his 
judicial admission to kill the victim and the prosecution's credible 
evidence.</p>
<p align="justify">In view of all the foregoing, we find no reversible error in 
the appealed decision. </p>
