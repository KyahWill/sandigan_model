				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>YNARES-SANTIAGO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Petitioner Wenifredo Farrol was employed as station cashier at respondent RCPI’s Cotabato City station. On June 18, 1993, respondent RCPI’s district manager in Cotabato City informed their main office that "Peragram funds"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> from said branch were used for the payment of retirement benefits of five employees. On October 1, 1993, petitioner verified as correct RCPI’s Field Auditor’s report that there was a shortage of P50,985.37 in their branch’s Peragram, Petty and General Cash Funds. Consequently, petitioner was required by the Field Auditor to explain the cash shortage within 24 hours from notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The next day, petitioner paid to RCPI P25,000.00 of the cash shortage.<br><br>On October 16, 1993, RCPI required petitioner to explain why he should not be dismissed from employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Two days thereafter, petitioner wrote a letter to the Field Auditor stating that the missing funds were used for the payment of the retirement benefits earlier referred to by the branch manager and that he had already paid P25,000.00 to RCPI. After making two more payments of the cash shortage to RCPI, petitioner was informed by the district manager that he is being placed under preventive suspension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Thereafter, he again paid two more sums on different dates to RCPI leaving a balance of P6,995.37 of the shortage.<br><br>Respondent RCPI claims that it sent a letter to petitioner on November 22, 1993 informing him of the termination of his services as of November 20, 1993 due to the following reasons:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">"a)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> Your allegation that part of your cash shortages was used for payment of salaries/wages and retirement benefits is not true because these have been accounted previously per auditor’s report;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">"b)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> As Station Cashier you must be aware of our company Circular No. 63 which strictly requires the daily and up-to-date preparation of Statistical Report and depositing of cash collections twice a day.

However, RCPI informed petitioner that his employment had already been terminated earlier as contained in the letter dated November 22, 1993. The conflict was submitted to the grievance committee. Despite the lapse of more than two years, the case remained unresolved before the grievance committee, hence, it was submitted for voluntary arbitration.<br><br>After hearing, the Voluntary Arbitrator ruled that petitioner was illegally dismissed from employment and ordered RCPI to pay him backwages, separation pay, 13<sup>th</sup> month pay and sick leave benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Aggrieved, RCPI filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the Court of Appeals (CA), which reversed the ruling of the arbitrator and dismissed the complaint for illegal dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Upon denial of petitioner’s motion for reconsideration by the CA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> he filed the instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> on the grounds that his dismissal was illegal because he was not afforded due process and that he "cannot be held liable for the loss of trust and confidence reposed in him" by RCPI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The Court is called upon to resolve the validity of petitioner’s dismissal. In cases involving the illegal termination of employment, it is fundamental that the employer must observe the mandate of the Labor Code, <i>i.e.</i>, the employer has the burden of proving that the dismissal is for a cause provided by the law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and that it afforded the employee an opportunity to be heard and to defend himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Anent the procedural requirement, Book V, Rule XIV, of the <i>Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code</i> existing at the time petitioner was discharged from work, outlines the procedure for termination of employment, to wit:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 1. <i>Security of tenure and due process</i>. - No worker shall be dismissed except for a just or authorized cause provided by law and after due process.<br><br>"Sec. 2. <i>Notice of Dismissal</i>. - Any employer who seeks to dismiss a worker shall furnish him a <i>written notice stating the particular acts or omissions</i> constituting the grounds for his dismissal. In cases of abandonment of work, the notice shall be served at the worker’s last known address.<br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br>"Sec. 5. <i>Answer and hearing</i>. - The worker may answer the allegations stated against him in the notice of dismissal within a reasonable period from receipt of such notice. The <i>employer shall afford the worker ample opportunity to be heard and to defend himself</i> with the assistance of his representatives, if he so desires.<br><br>"Sec. 6. <i>Decision to dismiss</i>. - The employer shall immediately notify a worker in writing of a decision to dismiss him <i>stating clearly the reasons</i> therefor.<br><br>"Sec. 7. <i>Right to contest dismissal</i>. - Any decision taken by the employer shall be without prejudice to the right of the worker to contest the validity or legality of his dismissal by filing a complaint with the Regional Branch of the Commission.<br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br>"Sec. 11. <i>Report on dismissal</i>. - The employer shall submit a monthly report to the Regional Office having jurisdiction over the place of work all dismissals effected by him during the month, specifying therein the names of the dismissed workers, the reasons for their dismissal, the dates of commencement and termination of employment, the positions last held by them and such other information as may be required by the Ministry (Department) for policy guidance and statistical purposes." (Italics supplied).<br></blockquote>As set forth in the foregoing procedures, the employer must comply with the twin requirements of two notices and hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The first notice is that which apprises the employee of the particular acts or omissions for which his dismissal is sought, and after affording the employee an opportunity to be heard, a subsequent notice informing the latter of the employer’s decision to dismiss him from work.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>As regards the first notice, RCPI simply required petitioner to "explain in writing why he failed to account" for the shortage and demanded that he restitute the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On the assumption that the foregoing statement satisfies the first notice, the second notice sent by RCPI to petitioner does not "clearly" cite the reasons for the dismissal, contrary to the requirements set by the above-quoted Section 6 of Book V, Rule XIV of the <i>Omnibus Rules</i>.<br><br>A perusal of RCPI’s dismissal notice reveals that it merely stated a conclusion to the effect that the withholding was deliberately done to hide alleged malversation or misappropriation without, however, stating the facts and circumstances in support thereof. It further mentioned that the position of cashier requires utmost trust and confidence but failed to allege the breach of trust on the part of petitioner and how the alleged breach was committed. On the assumption that there was indeed a breach, there is no evidence that petitioner was a managerial employee of respondent RCPI. It should be noted that the term "trust and confidence" is restricted to managerial employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It may not even be presumed that when there is a shortage, there is also a corresponding breach of trust. Cash shortages in a cashier’s work may happen, and when there is no proof that the same was deliberately done for a fraudulent or wrongful purpose, it cannot constitute breach of trust so as to render the dismissal from work invalid.<br><br>Assuming further that there was breach of trust and confidence, it appears that this is the first infraction committed by petitioner. Although the employer has the prerogative to discipline or dismiss its employee, such prerogative cannot be exercised wantonly, but must be controlled by substantive due process and tempered by the fundamental policy of protection to labor enshrined in the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Infractions committed by an employee should merit only the corresponding sanction demanded by the circumstances. The penalty must be commensurate with the act, conduct or omission imputed to the employee<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and imposed in connection with the employer’s disciplinary authority.<br><br>RCPI alleged that under its rules, petitioner’s infraction is punishable by dismissal. However, employer’s rules cannot preclude the State from inquiring whether the strict and rigid application or interpretation thereof would be harsh to the employee. Petitioner has no previous record in his twenty-four long years of service - this would have been his first offense. The Court thus holds that the dismissal imposed on petitioner is unduly harsh and grossly disproportionate to the infraction which led to the termination of his services. A lighter penalty would have been more just, if not humane. In any case, petitioner paid back the cash shortage in his accounts. Considering, however, that the latter is about to retire or may have retired from work, it would no longer be practical to order his reinstatement.<br><br>Accordingly, in lieu of reinstatement, the award of separation pay computed at one-month salary for every year of service, with a fraction of at least six (6) months considered as one whole year, is proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In the computation of separation pay, the period wherein backwages are awarded must be included.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> in view of the foregoing, the assailed decision of the Court of Appeals is <i>REVERSED</i> and <i>SET ASIDE</i> and new one entered <i>REINSTATING</i> the decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator subject to the <i>MODIFICATION</i> that petitioner’s separation pay be recomputed to include the period within which backwages are due. For this purpose, this case is <i>REMANDED</i> to the Voluntary Arbitrator for proper computation of backwages, separation pay, 13<sup>th</sup> month pay, sick leave conversion and vacation leave conversion.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Puno, Kapunan</i>, and <i>Pardo, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Amounting to P232,250.83<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Letter dated October 14, 1993 directed to Petitioner from RCPI’s Field Auditor; (<i>Rollo</i>, p. 158).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Annex "F"; <i>Rollo</i>, p. 107.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Annex "H’; <i>Rollo</i>, p. 162.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Annex "O"; <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 169-170.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The dispositive portion of the Decision dated March 25, 1996 of Voluntary Arbitrator George C.
