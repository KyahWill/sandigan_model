She immediately closed the gate (pp. 4, 7 and 10, TSN, March 14, 1995).<br><br>"Thereafter, Editha's father, Francisco Pe, who was a Barangay Kagawad of Barangay Kauswagan, Iloilo City, asked her about the gunshots.&nbsp; She informed him that people were running in the alley.&nbsp; Francisco wanted to go out of the house to see what was happening but Editha advised him not to go out. Despite the advice, Francisco went out [of] their house towards Valeria Street.&nbsp; Editha followed him (pp. 7-8, ibid.).<br><br>"Francisco talked to people passing at Valeria Street. Suddenly, Editha, who was then more or less 8 meters from her father, saw people running towards her father.&nbsp; Then, she saw Victorio and Anthony, both surnamed Mana-ay, carrying guns (pp. 10-11, ibid.). Victorio shouted:&nbsp; "[S]ons of bitches, you are too much!" Francisco turned around while the people whom he was talking to moved away.&nbsp; Then, Victorio shot Francisco followed by Anthony with another shot.&nbsp; Wounded, Francisco leaned on the gate of the CRES.&nbsp; Still, Anthony approached Francisco and pointed his gun at the latter's head.&nbsp; Francisco held Anthony's arm and they grappled for possession of the gun. (pp. 13-14, ibid.)<br><br>"Editha then heard successive shots and saw Victorio jump on her father while appellants Julius and Emmanuel Mana-ay, Nilbert Banderado with 2 or 3 others ganged up on her father and stabbed him (p. 14, ibid).<br><br>"Editha ran towards their house and sought help.&nbsp; Her husband, Romulo Tan, responded and they went out of the house.

He never executed an affidavit containing the things that he is testifying [to] in court during the preliminary investigation at the City Prosecutor's Office in connection with this case.&nbsp; He said he never told his lawyer about what he is [saying] in the court on the witness stand.&nbsp; He personally knows the victim Francisco Pe being a kagawad member in their barangay and his daughter Editha Pe Tan. So far he does not know of any reason [why] Editha Pe Tan would pinpoint him and the other accused as the killer of her father, since he knows of no misunderstanding or grudge whatsoever between him and the family of Editha Pe Tan or with the late Francisco Pe.&nbsp; He admits tha[t] [o]n the afternoon of January 21, 1995, he saw Victorio Mana-ay drinking beer at his mother's house with his friends.&nbsp; In the same [breath], he is sure he also went to the place where Victorio Mana-ay was allegedly shot [while] already lying on his back. From his mother's house where he was boarding, CRES can be negotiated in a matter of three (3) minutes more specifically to the place where he saw his brother lying fifteen (15) meters afar.[sic]&nbsp; When he saw his brother lying on his back it never entered his mind to inquire who shot his brother, but he learned from the people that it was Francisco Pe who shot his brother."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote><br>In his 20-page Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Anthony Mana-ay denied any participation in the killing of Francisco Pe and presented the following facts:<br><br><blockquote>"1.&nbsp; On or about 4:30 o'clock [o]n the afternoon of January 21, 1995, accused-appellant Anthony Mana-ay was [waiting] for a ride of trisikad at Block 6, Barangay Sinikway, Lapuz, Iloilo City (TSN, p. 3, November 17, 1997);<br><br>"2.&nbsp; However, there was no available trisikad at the time, so, he was forced to walk to Block 8 of the same Barangay.&nbsp; While he was walking, he met Alberto Fabellar who was likewise going to the city proper and [so], they went together by riding in a jeep (Ibid; also TSN, pp. 7-8, November 10, 1997);<br><br>"3.&nbsp; They alighted at Ledesma Street and walked towards the house of her grandmother Leonisa located at Valeria Street, Barangay Kauswagan.&nbsp; While they were walking, Alberto Alvior called them up and offered a bottle of beer x x x which they willingly accepted (TSN, p. 9, November 10, 1997);<br><br>"4.&nbsp; All of a sudden, appellant Anthony Mana-ay heard three (3) gunshots, but he did not mind [them] considering that it was then Dinagyang Festival (TSN, p. 11, November 10, 1997);<br><br>"5.&nbsp; After a minute or two, he heard again several gunshots emanating from the alley of Central Radio and Electronic School (CRES, for brevity).&nbsp; There were noises that were heard and people all over the place were running towards Valeria and De Leon Streets.&nbsp; And somebody shouted that a shooting incident [was] taking place (TSN, p. 11-12, November 1997);<br><br>"6.&nbsp; When the commotion started to calm down, he, together with Alberto Fabellar, slowly edged towards the alley because they have to pass through it in going to his lola's house.

His father was in the act of falling down when he saw Francisco Pe shoot his father at a distance of four (4) meters). He was about to help his father stand up when he saw a knife beside the place where his father fell.&nbsp; Seized with anger, Julius Mana-ay took the knife and stabbed Francisco Pe.&nbsp; However, he cannot recall how many times he stabbed the latter.&nbsp; After he stabbed Francisco Pe, the latter shot him thereby hitting him at the level of his right nipple, then he felt that somebody was shooting him from behind when the back part of his right arm was hit.&nbsp; Later, he saw that the person shooting him from the back was Romulo Tan, the son-in-law of Francisco Pe."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>Lastly, Nilbert Banderado's Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> contained the following narration of facts:<br><blockquote>"On January 21, 1995, at around 5:30 in the afternoon, the accused Nilbert Banderado was at his boarding house at Barangay Kauswagan, Quezon St., Iloilo City preparing for dinner.&nbsp; At the same boarding house, he was with Emmanuel Mana-ay who was eating his dinner. While there at the time, Nilbert Banderado heard shouts coming from way outside that Victoria Mana-ay met an accident. Nilbert Banderado followed Emmanuel Mana-ay, the brother of Victorio Mana-ay, who went through the footwalk towards the alley connecting Quezon Street and Valeria Street, Iloilo City. At the corner of the foot walk and the alley where there was a post, he saw Victorio Mana-ay lying in his back and covered with blood over his body surrounded by people.&nbsp; Upon seeing Victorio Mana-ay in such condition, Nilbert Banderado and Emmanuel Mana-ay carried Victorio Mana-ay, with the help of two other persons, to the tricycle and brought him to St. Paul's Hospital.&nbsp; After Victorio Mana-ay was brought to the emergency room, Nilbert Banderado took some rest and later went back to his boarding house to tell his "Lola" - Leonisa Mana-ay - that they brought Victorio Mana-ay to St. Paul's Hospital.&nbsp; About five minutes later, the policeman came and brought Nilbert Banderado to the police station for investigation and later charged him for the killing of Francisco Pe."</blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Trial Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>The trial court upheld Editha Pe Tan's testimony identifying appellants as the persons responsible for the death of her father.

cross-examination, the lawyers for appellants harped on several points to discredit Editha.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, they pointed out that she did not mention Julius Mana-ay as one of the malefactors in the direct examination.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, they denounced her seemingly selective recollection of people and faces, as she could not remember the people whom her father was talking to just before he was attacked.&nbsp; <i>Third</i>, they insisted that she had learned of the names of appellants, only because the police investigators had given these to her beforehand.<br><br>After a careful scrutiny of the records, the court is convinced that Editha's answers were cohesive and candid.&nbsp; She clearly testified that Julius Mana-ay was one of those who had stabbed her father.&nbsp; Moreover, she explained that she was able to identify appellants because they had passed in front of her just before they assaulted him.&nbsp; She emphatically averred that although she did not know the names of appellants, she was familiar with them.&nbsp; Having seen them in their neighborhood before the incident, she clearly remembered them as her father's attackers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In this light, we sustain the trial court's ruling that Editha's positive and straightforward testimony sufficiently established appellants' identities as the culprits.<br><br>No improper or ill motive was attributed to Editha. That she was the daughter of the victim did not render her testimony dubious.&nbsp; On the contrary, her chief interest as such was to seek justice for her father's death.&nbsp; Hence, in the normal course, she would not testify falsely against appellants, for doing so would exculpate the real culprits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Second Issue:&nbsp; </span><i style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>Alibi and Denial</i><br></div><br>Appellants Emmanuel Mana-ay, his nephew Anthony and Nilbert Banderado deny any participation in the killing of Francisco Pe.<br><br>Emmanuel insists that he was eating supper at his mother's house when the incident in question happened.&nbsp; He went to the crime scene, only because he had been summoned to bring his older brother Victorio to the hospital.&nbsp; Nilbert corroborates this assertion, adding that he went to the scene of the crime, only to help Emmanuel do so.&nbsp; On the other hand, Anthony confirms his presence at the crime scene, but declares that he had in fact tried to prevent his cousin, Julius, from further harming Francisco.<br><br>Their arguments are not convincing.&nbsp; At the outset, we must stress that denial and alibi are the weakest defenses.&nbsp; Appellants must prove that it was physically impossible for them to be present at the scene of the crime or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission. In this case, their defenses must fail because of their proximity to the <i>locus criminis</i> at the time. Emmanuel and Nilbert said that they were in a house in Quezon Street, Barangay Kauswagan, which was accessible by foot to the crime scene.&nbsp; Anthony who was near the place allegedly even witnessed the tail end of the incident.
