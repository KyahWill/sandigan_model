</p>The case under consideration is a petition for review on <em>certiorari </em>of a decision of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>,
 which modified the ruling of the Regional Trial Court, Roxas City 
regarding seven parcels of land located in Barangay Hipona, Pontevedra, 
Capiz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><p>
During the lifetime of Iluminada Abiertas, she designated one of her 
sons, Rufo Distajo, to be the administrator of her parcels of land 
denoted as Lot Nos. 1018, 1046, 1047, and 1057 situated in Barangay 
Hipona, Pontevedra, Capiz.
</p><p>
On May 21, 1954, Iluminada Abiertas sold a portion of Lot No. 1018 
(1018-A) to her other children, namely, Raul Distajo, Ricardo Distajo, 
Ernesto Distajo, Federico Distajo, and Eduardo Distajo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
</p><p>
On May 29, 1963, Iluminada Abiertas certified to the sale of Lot Nos. 1046 and 1047 in favor of Rufo Distajo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
</p><p>
On June 4, 1969, Iluminada Abiertas sold Lot No. 1057 to Rhodora Distajo, the daughter of Rufo Distajo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
</p><p>
On July 12, 1969, Iluminada Abiertas sold Lot No. 1018 to Rufo Distajo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Justo Abiertas, Jr., the brother of Iluminada Abiertas, died 
leaving behind his children, Teresita, Alicia, Josefa and Luis Abiertas.
  Teresita paid for the real estate taxes of the following properties, 
which she inherited from her father: Lot Nos. 1001, 1048, 1049, and a 
portion of Lot No. 1047, all located in Capiz.  On May 26, 1954, 
Teresita Abiertas sold Lot No. 1001 in favor of Rufo Distajo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 On June 2, 1965, Teresita Abiertas, for herself and representing her 
sisters and brother, sold Lot Nos. 1048, 1049, and a portion of Lot No. 
1047 to Rufo Distajo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
</p><p>
After purchasing the above-mentioned parcels of land, Rufo Distajo took 
possession of the property and paid the corresponding real estate taxes 
thereon.  Rhodora Distajo likewise paid for the real estate taxes of Lot
 No. 1057.
</p><p>
When Iluminada Abiertas died in 1971, Zacarias Distajo, Pilar Distajo-Tapar, and Rizaldo Distajo,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> demanded possession of the seven parcels of land from Lagrimas S. Distajo, and her husband, Rufo Distajo.  The latter refused.
</p><p>
Consequently, on June 5, 1986, Ricardo Distajo, with the other heirs of 
Iluminada Abiertas, namely, Ernesto Distajo, Raul Distajo, Federico 
Distajo, Zacarias Distajo, Eduardo Distajo, and Pilar Distajo, filed 
with the Regional Trial Court, Roxas City a complaint for recovery of 
possession and ownership of Lot No. 1018, partition of Lot Nos. 1001, 
1018-B, 1046, 1047, 1048, 1049, 1057, and damages.
</p><p>
On September 4, 1986, private respondent Lagrimas Distajo<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> filed an answer with counterclaim.
</p><p>
On April 9, 1990, the trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of 
cause of action, laches and prescription.  The counterclaim was likewise
 dismissed.  The parties appealed to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
</p><p>
On August 21, 1992, the Court of Appeals rendered its decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the dispositive portion of which states as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “PREMISES CONSIDERED, the decision appealed from is hereby SET ASIDE and a new judgment rendered, as follows: </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, the Court decides the case in favor of the defendant and 
dismisses the plaintiffs’ complaint for lack of cause of action except 
with regard to the plaintiffs’ claim over a 238 sq. m. portion of Lot 
No. 1018 (the portion adjoining the market site and measuring seventeen 
meters and that adjoining the property of E. Rodriguez measuring 14 
meters).  The Court hereby Orders the partition of Lot No. 1018 to 
conform to the following: 238 sq. m. as above specified to belong to the
 plaintiffs as prayed for by them while the rest is declared property of
 the defendant.
</p><p>
Upon partition of Lot No. 1018 in accordance with this Court’s Order, 
the City Assessor of Roxas City is hereby Ordered to cancel Tax 
Declaration 2813 in the name of Rufo Distajo (or any subsequent tax 
declaration/s issued relative to the above-cited Tax Declaration No. 
2813) and forthwith to issue the corresponding tax declarations in the 
names of the respective parties herein.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.”
</p><p>
On September 10, 1992, Ricardo Distajo filed a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> On December 9, 1993, the Court of Appeals denied the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
</p><p>
Hence, this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
</p><p>
Petitioner alleges that Iluminada Abiertas exclusively owns the seven 
parcels of land delineated as Lot Nos. 1001, 1018, 1046, 1047, 1048, 
1049, and 1057, all of which should be partitioned among all her heirs. 
 Furthermore, Rufo Distajo cannot acquire the subject parcels of land 
owned by Iluminada Abiertas because the Civil Code prohibits the 
administrator from acquiring properties under his administration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
 Rufo Distajo merely employed fraudulent machinations in order to obtain
 the consent of his mother to the sale, and may have even forged her 
signature on the deeds of sale of the parcels of land.
</p><p>
In her comment dated May 13, 1994, private respondent Lagrimas S. 
Distajo contends that Rufo Distajo rightfully owns the subject parcels 
of land because of various deeds of sale executed by Iluminada Abiertas 
selling Lot Nos. 1018-B, 1047 and 1046 in favor of Rufo Distajo and Lot 
No. 1057 in favor of Rhodora Distajo.  Private respondent also avers 
that petitioner cannot claim any right over Lot Nos. 1001, 1048 and 
1049, considering that such lands belong to the brother of Iluminada 
Abiertas, namely, Justo Abiertas, Jr., whose heirs sold said parcels of 
land to Rufo Distajo.
</p><p>
The petition lacks merit.
</p><p>
Factual findings of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal 
unless the court has overlooked or ignored some fact or circumstance of 
sufficient weight or significance, which, if considered, would alter the
 result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> When 
there is no conflict between the findings of the trial and appellate 
courts, a review of the facts found by the appellate court is 
unnecessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
</p><p>
Since the trial court and the Court of Appeals agree that Iluminada 
Abiertas owned Lot Nos. 1046, 1057 and a portion of Lot No. 1047, and 
that Justo Abiertas Jr. owned Lot Nos. 1001, 1048, and 1049, such 
findings are binding on this Court, which is not a trier of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 However, the record shows that Lot No. 1018 should be divided into Lot 
No. 1018-A and 1018-B, the delineation of which the Court of Appeals 
clarified in its decision.
</p><p>
The issues in this case, therefore, are limited to those properties 
which were owned by Iluminada Abiertas, ascendant of petitioner, 
consisting of Lot Nos. 1018-A, 1046, 1057, and a portion of 1047.
</p><p>
In his petition, Ricardo Distajo assails the genuineness of the 
signatures of Iluminada Abiertas in the deeds of sale of the parcels of 
land, and claims that Rufo Distajo forged the signature of Iluminada 
Abiertas.  However, no handwriting expert was presented to corroborate 
the claim of forgery.  Petitioner even failed to present a witness who 
was familiar with the signature of Iluminada Abiertas. Forgery should be
 proved by clear and convincing evidence, and whoever alleges it has the
 burden of proving the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
</p><p>
Petitioner likewise contends that the sale transactions are void for 
having been entered into by the administrator of the properties.  We 
disagree.  The pertinent Civil Code provision provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “Art. 1491.  The following persons cannot acquire by purchase, 
even at a public or judicial auction, either in person or through the 
mediation of another: </p>
  <p>
    (1) The guardian, the property of the person or persons who may be under guardianship;
  </p>
  <p>
    (2) Agents, the property whose administration or sale may have been 
entrusted to them, unless the consent of the principal has been given;
  </p>
  <p> (3) Executors and administrators, the property of the estate under administration;” x x x </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Under paragraph (2) of the above article, the prohibition against agents
 purchasing property in their hands for sale or management is not 
absolute.  It does not apply if the principal consents to the sale of 
the property in the hands of the agent or administrator.  In this case, 
the deeds of sale signed by Iluminada Abiertas shows that she gave 
consent to the sale of the properties in favor of her son, Rufo, who was
 the administrator of the properties.  Thus, the consent of the 
principal Iluminada Abiertas removes the transaction out of the 
prohibition contained in Article 1491(2).
</p><p>
Petitioner also alleges that Rufo Distajo employed fraudulent 
machinations to obtain the consent of Iluminada Abiertas to the sale of 
the parcels of land.  However, petitioner failed to adduce convincing 
evidence to substantiate his allegations.
</p><p>
In the absence of any showing of lack of basis for the conclusions made 
by the Court of Appeals, this Court finds no cogent reason to reverse 
the ruling of the appellate court.
</p><p>
<strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the Court DENIES the petition and AFFIRMS the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 30063.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED. </strong></p>
