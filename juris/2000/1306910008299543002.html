				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The case is an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Camarines Norte, Branch 40, Daet<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> finding accused Pedro Taliman, Basilio Baybayan and Amado Belano guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, sentencing each of them to <i>reclusion perpetua </i>and ordering them to pay the heirs of the victim, Renato Cuano, indemnity of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00), funeral expenses of ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) and actual damages for unrealized income in the amount of one million forty six thousand pesos (P1,046,000.00). The trial court also ordered that <i>alias </i>warrants of arrest be issued against accused Danilo Obenia and Rufino Valera, Jr. who are at large.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>We state the facts.<br><br>The victim was Renato Cuano (hereinafter referred to as "Renato"). Prosecution witness Ernesto Lacson (hereinafter referred to as "Lacson") was the uncle and employer of Renato, who was the caretaker of his gravel and sand truck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On July 21, 1990, Renato came to see Lacson and informed him that armed and hooded persons<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> were asking for money amounting to six thousand pesos (P6,000.00). The amount was reduced to six hundred pesos (P600.00) and finally to two hundred pesos (P200.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On July 22, 1990, Lacson arrived home from church. His wife handed him a letter delivered to her by a child. In the letter, purportedly members of the N.P.A. demanded eight thousand pesos (P8,000.00) from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> We quote the letter:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><blockquote><i>"Sayo TaTay Erning</i><br><br><i>"Rebolusyonaryong pagbati sa yo/</i><br><br><i>sa inyo layunin ng sulat kong ito upang ipahiwatig sa yo na ang pakikibaka pang kalawakang pakikibaka ay humihingi ng tulong sa iyo Tay "Erning" Siguro alam mo na amg aming pakay lalo na sa aming pangangailangan pinansyal upang magamit sa kilusan bigyan mo po kami ng halagang 8,000.00 at ito po ang aming inaasahan "okey" inaasahan ko po at maghihintay kami doon sa kabilang ilog papuntang nalisbitan dalhin mo ang "jeep" mo iyan ang aming palatandaan alas 4:00 p.m. July 22,90 inaasahan po namin ang iyong pakikipakaupira at inaasahan po namin na walang ibang makakaalam.</i><br><br><i>"Okey salamat sigi po maghihintay kami alas 4:00 mamaya.</i><br><br><div style="text-align: right;">&nbsp;<i>MELCO GROUP</i><br><i>KA BONG</i><br><br><i>MABUHAY ANG N.P.A."</i><br></div></blockquote>On the same day, at around eight o'clock in the morning (8:00 a. m.), Lacson instructed Renato to take his passenger jeep and to proceed to his "gold field" in Nalisbitan to get his collectibles from the field. This was the last time Lacson saw Renato alive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Also on the same day, Lacson told his employee,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> prosecution witness Elizer Obregon (hereinafter referred to as "Elizer"), to go to the crossing of Nalisbitan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the place mentioned in the letter to investigate who the persons demanding money were.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Elizer complied and reached the place at around five o'clock in the afternoon (5:00 p.m.) of the same day.<br><br>Upon reaching the place, Elizer saw Renato and spoke with him. In the vicinity, Elizer saw accused Basilio Baybayan, Pedro Taliman and Amado Belano. At that time, accused Sgt. Pedro Taliman and C1C Basilio M. Baybayan were members of the Camarines Norte Constabulary/Integrated National Police Command.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Elizer saw two other civilians in their company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Elizer then saw accused Pedro Taliman and Basilio Baybayan take Renato<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to a hilltop, where he was guarded by accused who were armed. Elizer heard one of the accused say that Renato must be taken as "he must be acting as a lookout (for Lacson)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Elizer then proceeded to Bagong Silang and reported to Lacson that Renato was taken by accused Pedro Taliman, Basilio Baybayan and Amado Belano.<br><br>A custodial investigation was conducted.<br><br>On July 23, 1990, Attorney Nicolas V. Pardo was mayor of Labo, Camarines Norte. He went to the police station upon invitation of police corporal Cereno to "assist" accused during their custodial investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Accused executed extra-judicial statements, confessing to the commission of the crime.<br><br>It was during this custodial investigation that accused Basilio Baybayin confessed to prosecution witness Sgt. Bonifacio Argarin that he participated in the killing of Renato because Renato did not give them the money they were demanding. This confession was given without the assistance of counsel and was not reduced to writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On July 23, 1990, police authorities, accompanied by accused Basilio Baybayan went to the place indicated in a sketch prepared by accused Pedro Taliman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It was in the place indicated that they found the cadaver of Renato.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> This was the same place or hilltop where prosecution witness Elizer saw Renato being guarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On July 24, 1990, a medical officer of Labo, Camarines Norte issued a certificate of death of Renato Lacson Cuaño, stating as cause of death, the following:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><blockquote>"Immediate cause : a. Irreversible shock due to massive hemorrhages&nbsp; <br><br> "Antecedent cause : b. Internal and External secondary to <br><br>"Underlying cause : c. Gunshot wound and multiple stab wounds."</blockquote>On December 18, 1990, Provincial Prosecutor Pascualita Duran-Cereno filed with the Regional Trial Court, Camarines Norte an information for murder against accused Pedro Taliman, Basilio Baybayan, Amado Belano, Danilo Obenia and Rufino Valera, Jr. alleging:<br><blockquote>"That on or about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of July 22, 1990, at Crossing of sitio Malisbitan, Brgy. Exiben, municipality of Labo, province of Camarines Norte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with deliberate intent to kill, with treachery, evident premeditation and taking advantage of superior strength, assault, attack, stab and shoot one RENATO CUAÑO alias LAPOY, thereby inflicting upon the latter gunshot wound and multiple stab wounds on the different parts of his body, and which injuries were the proximate cause of the death of said Renato Cuano alias Lapoy, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the victim.<br><br>"CONTRARY TO LAW." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>On February 26, 1991, accused Pedro G. Taliman, Basilio M. Baybayan and Amado B. Belano were arraigned. They pleaded "not guilty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Accused Danilo Obenia<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and Rufino Valero, Jr. were not arraigned because they remained at large.<br><br>On March 21, 1991, accused waived the pre-trial conference<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and trial ensued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On May 29, 1992, the trial court declared the case submitted for decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>On September 24, 1992, the trial court rendered a decision, the decretal portion of which provides:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the accused Pedro Taliman, Basilio Baybayan and Amado Delano are all found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder as charged, and are hereby each sentence (<i>sic</i>) to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua (or life imprisonment) (<i>sic</i>). The accused are furthermore jointly and severally ordered to pay the heirs of the victim for his death the amount of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00) and for funeral expenses the amount of ten thousand (P10,000.00) pesos, and considering that the deceased victim was only 27 years old when killed and applying the formula (2/3 x [80-27] - life expectancy of the American Table of Mortality, said deceased victim has still 44 years more to live were he not killed by the accused. Therefore, since he was employed and receiving monthly salary of P2,000.00 his unrealized income for the 44 more years of his life is P1,046,000.00 for which the accused likewise are jointly and severally ordered to pay.<br><br>"Considering that accused Danilo Obenis and Rufino Valera, Jr., are still at large, let an alias Warrant of Arrest be issued against them. In the meantime, let the records of the case be archived and reinstated as soon as they are apprehended.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>On October 28, 1992, the decision was promulgated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> However, accused Basilio M. Baybayan was not present,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> despite due notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>On October 30, 1992, the trial court issued a warrant for the arrest of accused Basilio M. Baybayan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The warrant of arrest was returned unserved as he could not be found.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>On November 11, 1992, accused Pedro G. Taliman filed a notice of appeal with the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On May 26, 1993, we resolved to accept the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>We state at the onset that while counsel for accused represents all five accused in this appeal, the benefit of this appeal is only accorded accused-appellants Pedro G. Taliman, Basilio M. Baybayan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and Amado B. Belano.<br><br>The other two accused Danilo Obenia and Rufino Valera, Jr., were not arraigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Thus, the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over their persons.<br><br>The rule on trial <i>in absentia</i> cannot apply to Danilo Obenia and Rufino Valera, Jr. In <i>People v. Salas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the Court declared that one of the requisites for trial to proceed <i>in absentia</i> is that the accused had been arraigned.<br><br>Now, the merits.<br><br>Accused-appellants submit that the extra-judicial confessions on which the trial court relied were inadmissible in evidence because they were obtained in violation of their constitutional rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> We agree with accused-appellants on this point. The extra-judicial statements alone cannot be a basis for conviction.<br><br>Article III, Section 12 (1) of the Constitution provides:<br><blockquote>"Any person under custodial investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent and to have competent and <u>independent counsel</u> preferably of his own choice. If the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one. These rights cannot be waived <u>except in writing and in the presence of counsel</u> (<i>underscoring ours</i>)."<br></blockquote>Mayor Pardo cannot be considered as an independent counsel for accused during their custodial investigation.<br><br>In <i>People v. Culala</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> we held that the extra-judicial confession of the accused-appellant was inadmissible as he was "assisted" by the incumbent municipal attorney. In <i>People vs. Bandula</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> we held that a municipal attorney could not be an independent counsel as required by the Constitution. We reasoned that as legal officer of the municipality, he provides legal assistance and support to the mayor and the municipality in carrying out the delivery of basic services to the people, including the maintenance of peace and order. It is therefore seriously doubted whether he can effectively undertake the defense of the accused without running into conflict of interests.<br><br>Besides, lawyers engaged by the police, whatever testimonials are given as proof of their probity and supposed independence, are suspects. In many areas, even less obvious than that obtaining in the present case, the relationship between lawyers and law enforcement authorities can be symbiotic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>If in the aforecited cases, we disregarded the extra-judicial statements of the accused, how much more must we do so now, given that it was the mayor himself, and not just the provincial attorney, that assisted accused-appellants?<br><br>Even assuming that the right to counsel was orally waived during custodial investigation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> still the defect was not cured. The Constitution expressly provides that the waiver must be in writing and in the presence of counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> This, accused-appellants did not do.<br><br>However, while we agree that the extra-judicial statements of the accused are inadmissible in evidence, we find that there is still sufficient evidence to convict.<br><br>While no one saw the actual killing of Renato, circumstantial evidence proved its commission. Resort to circumstantial evidence is essential, when to insist on direct testimony would set felons free.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Rule 133, Section 4 of the 1989 Revised Rules on Evidence provides:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><blockquote>"SEC. 4. Circumstantial evidence, when sufficient - Circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if:<br><br>"(a) There is more than one circumstance;<br><br>"(b) The facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and<br><br>"(c) The combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce conviction beyond reasonable doubt."<br></blockquote>In the present case, we find the following circumstances attendant:<br><br><b><u>First</u></b>, Renato was last seen alive in the company of accused-appellants. This was the substance of Elizer's testimony. The trial court did not find reason not to believe him. Neither do we.<br><br>It is the trial court and not this Court that had the opportunity to observe Elizer's manner of testifying, his furtive glances, his calmness, sighs or the scant or full realization of his oath.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The trial court's assessment of the credibility of witnesses is entitled to respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><b><u>Second</u></b>, accused-appellants, two other civilians, Renato and Elizer were the only persons present at the Nalisbitan crossing, on July 22, 1990, at five o'clock in the afternoon. The place and the time are significant. This was the very place, the very date and more or less the time of day indicated in the letter of demand that Lacson received.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> While Renato's and Elizer's presence in the area was explained, the presence of accused-appellants in that area and during that crucial time can be only explained by the fact that accused-appellants were the very ones demanding money from Lacson.<br><br>"Facts or circumstances which are not only consistent with the guilt of the accused but also inconsistent with his innocence, constitute evidence which, in weight and probative force, may surpass even direct evidence in its effect upon the court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><b><u>Third</u></b>, motive is apparent. Renato was first approached by accused-appellants with an oral demand. Renato relayed the demand to Lacson. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The oral demand was followed up with a written demand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>When Renato passed through the Nalisbitan crossing, he was driving Lacson's jeepney. This was the very jeepney indicated in the letter. The letter instructed Lacson to bring money and to drive a specific jeepney to Nalisbitan. Yet, when accused-appellants confronted Renato, he did not have the money they demanded.<br><br>The fact that Renato was the driver of the jeepney indicated in the letter can explain accused-appellants' reason for killing him.<br><br>This conclusion is supported by Elizer's testimony.
