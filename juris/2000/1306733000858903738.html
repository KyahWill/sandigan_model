				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The case before the Court is a petition for certiorari and prohibition with temporary restraining order seeking to annul the order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of respondent court that set aside its previous order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> granting withdrawal of&nbsp; respondent's application for registration of title and reinstating the decision of registration of a parcel of land located in barrio San Jose, Antipolo, Rizal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On December 4, 1980, Atlas Farms, Incorporated filed with the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Pasig an application for registration and confirmation of title over a parcel of land located in barrio San Jose, municipality of Antipolo, Rizal, with an area of 9,339 square meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On December 28, 1981, the trial court rendered a decision granting the application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On January 28, 1982, petitioner filed with the trial court a motion for reconsideration of the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Without the trial court resolving the motion for reconsideration of the petitioner, on October 18, 1982, Atlas filed with the trial court a motion to withdraw the application, copy of which motion was received by petitioner on October 21, 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On October 21, 1982, the trial court granted the motion to withdraw application for registration of title.&nbsp; Copy of the order was received by petitioner on October 29, 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>After seventeen years, on August 16, 1999, respondent Atlas Farms, Incorporated filed with the trial court a manifestation and motion to set aside the order granting the withdrawal of the application and to revive the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> On August 20, 1999, the trial court set aside its order dismissing the application, and reinstated the decision dated December 28, 1981.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On September 17, 1999, petitioner filed with the trial court an omnibus motion assailing the validity of the order reinstating the decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On December 28, 1999, the trial court denied petitioner's omnibus motion for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The issue raised is whether the trial court still has jurisdiction to reverse an order that declared the application for registration of title withdrawn which became final seventeen years ago, and revive the decision granting the application for registration of title of Atlas Farms, Incorporated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>We find the petition impressed with merit.&nbsp; The lower court no longer had jurisdiction over the case when it issued the order of August 20, 1999, reversing its previous order dated October 21, 1982 and reviving the decision of December 28, 1981.<br><br>When respondent Atlas Farms, Incorporated filed on August 16, 1999 with the trial court a manifestation and motion to set aside the order dated October 21, 1982, declaring the application withdrawn, the trial court no longer had jurisdiction over the case.&nbsp; Close to seventeen (17) years had lapsed after finality of the order. Of course, respondent Atlas pretends that it never received notice of the order.&nbsp; This pretension can not be true. Admittedly, during the interegnum of more than seventeen years since the court granted the application, Atlas Farms must have become aware of an application for registration of title over the same parcel of land filed by Francisco B. Javier and Victoria P. Javier on or about January 6, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> More, respondent Atlas also admitted that sometime in 1997, "respondent was informed that the case has been ordered withdrawn after its retained counsel has filed the motion to withdraw application."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Yet, respondent did nothing until August 16, 1999, two years later, when it filed a manifestation and motion to set aside the order, claiming that its counsel was not authorized to act for the corporation but remained silent when it learned of the order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Again, this pretense can not be true.&nbsp; The standing presumption is that counsel is authorized to represent any cause in which he appears.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Consequently, the order declaring the application for registration of title withdrawn could no longer be revoked and the decision reinstated.&nbsp; In&nbsp; fact,&nbsp; the decision has become stale and any action to enforce or revive it&nbsp; has prescribed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> A stale decision can not be the source of the issuance of a decree of registration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Thus, the orders dated August 20 and 26, 1999, reinstating the decision are void and considered non-existent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> A void order cannot give life to a decision that has lost its efficacy.&nbsp; It cannot affect, impair or create rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> A void order may be assailed or impugned at any time either directly or collaterally, by means of a petition filed in the same case or by means of a separate action, or by resisting such order in any action or proceeding where it is invoked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The rule is basic that the court loses jurisdiction upon the finality of the decision, except to order its execution within its lifetime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> A decision&nbsp; becomes final upon the expiration of the period to appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which is uniformly fixed at fifteen (15) days from notice to the parties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and no appeal is taken therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>What is more, the court may no longer set aside, alter or modify a final order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In this case, the trial court favorably acted on respondent's motion filed in 1999, long after the court had lost its jurisdiction over the case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTS </span>the petition for review on certiorari, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">SETS ASIDE </span>the orders dated August 20 and 26, 1999, and February 16, 1999 of the trial court in LRC Case No. N-10477.&nbsp; The Court orders respondent judge Alicia P. Mariño-Co to recall any decree of registration issued as a consequence of the void decision and orders, and the Land Registration Authority and/or the Register of Deeds of Antipolo City (Rizal)&nbsp; to set aside and nullify all titles, original and transfer issued and arising thereon.<br><br>The trial court and the Land Registration Authority shall inform this Court, within ten (10) days from notice, of their actions taken hereon.<br><br>Costs against respondent Atlas Farms, Incorporated.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno, Kapunan,</i> and <i>Ynares-Santiago, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 86-87.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Rollo, p. 38.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Petition, Rollo, pp. 2-3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Docketed as LRC Case No. N-10477, Petition, par. 2, Rollo, p. 4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Petition, Annex "B", Rollo, pp. 27- 29.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Petition, Annex "C", Rollo, pp. 30-36.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Petition, Annex "D", Rollo, p. 37.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Petition, Annex "E", Rollo, p. 38.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Comment, Annex "6",&nbsp; Rollo, pp. 80-85.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Ibid</i>., Annexes "7" &amp; "8", Rollo, pp. 86-87.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Petition, Annex "F", Rollo, pp. 39-46.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Petition, Annex "A", Rollo, pp. 22-26.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Filed on March 7, 2000, Rollo, pp. 2-16.&nbsp; On June 21, 2000, we gave due course to the petition. <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 102-103.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Petition, Rollo, p. 8; Memorandum, Rollo, p. 167.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Comment, par. 2.8, Rollo, pp. 50, <i>et seq</i>.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Comment, par. 2.12, Rollo, p. 52.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Comment, Annex "6", Rollo, pp. 80-95.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Rule 138, 1964 Revised Rules of Court, as amended.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Article 1144, Civil Code; Lizardo, Sr. v.
