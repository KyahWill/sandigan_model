				<BR><STRONG>PARDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The case before us is a petition for certiorari under Rule 64, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, to nullify the resolution of the Commission on Elections (Comelec), Second Division, promulgated on March 18, 1999 and resolution en banc, promulgated on July 27, 1999 reversing the decision of the Municipal Trial Court, Talavera, Nueva Ecija and declaring respondent Rafael M. Grospe as the duly elected Punong Barangay of Barangay Bantug Hacienda, Talavera, Nueva Ecija.<br><br>The facts are as follows:<br><br>Petitioner Dante B. Ferrer and private respondent Rafael M. Grospe were candidates for the position of Punong Barangay in Barangay Bantug Hacienda, Talavera, Nueva Ecija during the May 12, 1997 barangay elections.<br><blockquote>The final result of the canvassing was as follows:<br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="20%">DANILO B.

For Danilo B. Ferrer</strong><br><br><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">1.</td><td width="90%" align="justify">Exhibit "A-1" is counted in favor of petitioner since "FERRER" is the surname of petitioner and no other candidate has the same surname.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[ 8]</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2.</td><td align="justify">Exhibit "A-2", the vote is valid for "Danilo Ferrer" which was written on the first line for Kagawad leaving the line/space for Punong Barangay vacant under the neighborhood rule.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3.</td><td align="justify">Exhibit A-3, the vote "Prongcoran Danilo Ferrer" is valid for Danilo Ferrer regardless of the designation. There is no showing that the designation/appellation was used to identify the voter as to render the ballot marked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[ 9]</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4.</td><td align="justify">Exhibits "A-4" and "A-16" are valid votes for Danilo Ferrer. Unquestionably, in Exhibit "A-4", the vote "Danilo Ferrer" is valid. The words "Kamot Capitan" written in the fourth line of Kagawad does not invalidate the ballot nor invalidate the vote for Danilo Ferrer. Since the words "Kamot Capitan" do not sufficiently identify the candidate for whom it was intended, the same shall be considered as a stray vote for Kagawad but will not invalidate the whole ballot.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5.</td><td align="justify">Exhibits "A-5" to "A-9", "A-10", "A-14", "A-15" and "1" or a total of nine (9) votes are valid votes in favor of Danilo Ferrer since the votes indicate either the full name of Ferrer or his nickname Danny with his surname Ferrer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[ 10]</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">6.</td><td align="justify">Exhibits "11", "A-13", "5" and "8" are valid votes for Danilo Ferrer since the use of nicknames accompanied by the surname is valid and does not annul the vote.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[ 11]</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">7.</td><td align="justify">Exhibit "A-12", the vote "Danny F" is valid since under the law if the nickname is unaccompanied by the name or surname of the candidate and it is the one by which he was generally or popularly known in the locality, the name shall be counted in favor of said candidate, if there is no other candidate for the same office with the same nickname. Moreover, the intent of the voter is to vote for Danilo Ferrer since the initial of his surname is indicated.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">8.</td><td align="justify">.Exhibit "2", the ballot unmistakably indicates "Danny F" above illegible writings. We rule that these are not written by two (2) persons. Some unlettered voters in their effort and desire to make their will known end up making scribbles on their ballots absent any malice on their part. They are able to produce/write letters. Credit must be given to them. We hold that the voter intended to vote for Danilo Ferrer.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">9.</td><td align="justify">Exhibit "3", the ballot is valid for Danilo B. Ferrer. Since there is no other candidate with the same first name, the vote "Danilo" is properly credited to Ferrer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[ 12]</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">10.</td><td align="justify">Exhibits "5", "9" and "10", the vote "Danny" is valid in favor of petitioner for the same reason stated above. Under the idem sonam rule, "Danny" is likewise validated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[ 13]</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">11.</td><td align="justify">Exhibits "11" and "12", the votes "Danilo Ferrer" are valid in favor of petitioner under the neighborhood rule though the name of the candidate (Ferrer) is written on the first space provided for Kagawad but the space for Punong Barangay was left vacant.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">12.</td><td align="justify">Exhibit "13" is considered valid under the neighborhood and <em>idem sonam</em> rule. The word "Danig" could only refer to Ferrer since it sounds like his nickname. The fact that it is written on the first space for Kagawad leaving the space for Punong Barangay unfilled does not invalidate the vote.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">13.</td><td align="justify">Exhibits "6", "7" and "4" are valid votes for Danilo Ferrer. Under the neighborhood rule, even if the vote "Danilo Ferrer" or "Daniel Ferrer" is written on the space provided for the name of the barangay, but the space for Punong Barangay is vacant, the same would not invalidate the ballot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[ 14]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><br><strong>B.

Grospe</strong><br><br><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">1.</td><td width="90%" align="justify">Exhibits "A", "C" and "J" with votes "Ape" are valid votes for Rafael Grospe since it is his nickname.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[ 15]</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">2.</td><td align="justify">Exhibit "B" is a valid vote for Rafael Grospe since the vote "RAFAE APE GAOSPE" is unmistakably a vote for the candidate Rafael Grospe whose nickname is Ape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[ 16]</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">3.</td><td align="justify">Exhibits "E" and "I" "Ape Grospe" are valid votes for Rafael Grospe following the neighborhood rule, since they are written on the first space provided for the Kagawad and the space for Punong Barangay is left vacant.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">4.</td><td align="justify">Exhibits "G" and "H" are valid votes for Rafael Grospe since there is no other candidate for that position with the same first name "Rafael".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[ 17]</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5.</td><td align="justify">Exhibit "K" with the vote "Rapael Grospe" written on the second line provided for Kagawad is not valid. The neighborhood cannot apply since it appears that the voter's intention is to vote for Grospe as Kagawad and not as Punong Barangay.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">6.</td><td align="justify">Exhibits "D" and "F" are not valid votes for Grospe since "APF" is not his nickname plus the fact that in Exhibit "D", the vote is written between the space provided for Punong Barangay and the name of the Barangay.</td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote>To recapitulate, petitioner Danilo B. Ferrer garnered a total of twenty-nine (29) valid votes and no stray vote while respondent Rafael M. Grospe obtained eight (8) valid votes and three (3) stray votes.<br><br>Since the main issue at hand is the contested ballots claimed by the parties, the computation shall be based on the number of uncontested ballots after revision at the lower court. Thus, petitioner who garnered 251 uncontested ballots would be credited with 29 valid votes per findings above. He therefore has a total of 280 votes.<br><br>On the other hand, private respondent with 268 uncontested ballots shall be credited with 8 valid votes out of the 11 votes claimed, or a total of 276 votes. Exhibits "D", "F" and "K" or 3 votes are declared void as stray votes per discussion above.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Court <strong>GRANTS</strong> the petition, finding petitioner DANILO B. FERRER to be the duly elected <em>Punong Barangay</em> of Barangay Bantug Hacienda, Talavera, Nueva Ecija with a total of <strong>280</strong> votes against respondent Rafael M.
