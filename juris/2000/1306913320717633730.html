				<BR><STRONG>PANGANIBAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Section 9 of Rule 141 requires that the 
sheriff's estimate of expenses in the execution of a writ should be 
approved by the judge. The approved estimated amount shall be deposited 
with the clerk of court who, as ex officio sheriff, shall then disburse 
the same to the assigned sheriff. Hence, a sheriff who receives from the
 parties an amount that is not included in the approved estimate and is 
not deposited with the clerk of court is guilty of violating the said 
provision. <p align="center"> <b><u>The Case</u></b>&nbsp; </p><p> Armando M.
 Canlas and Ruby C. Dungca filed a sworn Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated January 18, 1998, accusing Sheriff 
Claude B. Balasbas, Regional Trial Court of Angeles City, of gross 
misconduct and dereliction of duty in connection with the execution of 
two Writs of Attachments.</p><p> On May 6, 1998, Court Administrator 
Alfredo L. Benipayo directed respondent to file a comment. In his May 
28, 1998 Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; 
respondent denied any wrongdoing.</p><p> Subsequently, the Court 
referred the case to Executive Judge Eliezer Delos Santos for 
investigation, report and recommendation.</p><p align="center"> <b><u>The
 Facts</u></b>&nbsp; </p><p> In his Report/Recommendation dated August 27, 
1999, the investigating judge made the following factual findings:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p> "On June 
30 and July 18, 1998, Branch 61 of the Regional Trial Court of Angeles 
City issued two writs of attachment in Civil Cases Nos. 8651 and 8659 
respectively. Both writs of attachment were assigned to respondent 
Sheriff Claude Balasbas for implementation.&nbsp; </p><p> In compliance with 
the Writ of Attachment issued in Civil Case No. 8651, respondent levied 
on attachment real and personal properties of the defendant on July 1 
and July 3, 1997 as follows:</p><blockquote><p> 1) Levy on attachment 
over a parcel of land in Angeles City (Exh. 'C' and Exh. '3')&nbsp; </p><p> 
2) Levy on attachment over a parcel of land in Mabalacat, Pampanga (Exh.
 ‘D’ and Exh. '4')&nbsp; </p><p> 3) Levy on attachment over two motor 
vehicles (Exh. 'B' and Exh. '2')&nbsp; </p><p> 4) Garnishment of deposits 
with the Landbank of the Philippines, Angeles City branch (Exh. 'E' and 
Exh. 'E-1' and Exh. '5' and '5-a')</p></blockquote><p> A Sheriff Report 
dated July 7, 1997 (Exh. ‘F’ and Exh. ‘6’) was accordingly submitted in 
Court.&nbsp; </p><p> In compliance with the Writ of Attachment issued on July
 18, 1997 in Civil Case No. 8659, respondent sheriff levied on 
attachment the real properties of the defendant located at Angeles City 
(Exh. 'T' and Exh. ‘9’) and over a parcel of land in Mabalacat, Pampanga
 (Exh. '5' and Exh. '10') on July 18 and 22, 1997 (Exh. 'K' and Exh. 
'11') respectively.&nbsp; </p><p> A Sheriff Report was accordingly submitted 
in court to show compliance with the said Writ.&nbsp; </p><p> It is the 
contention of complainant Armando Canlas that before implementing the 
writ, respondent Sheriff told them that he needed at least P2,000.00 for
 his gasoline allowance. The said amount was given by the complainant 
personally to the respondent in front of Mr. Rubio, complainant's 
neighbor and respondent's kumpadre. On July 2, 1997, respondent Sheriff 
again allegedly asked for an additional amount of P3,000.00 as sheriff's
 fee thru Mr. Rubio who in turn allegedly gave the amount to the 
respondent.&nbsp; </p><p> On the other hand, complainant Ruby Dungca alleges 
that respondent originally asked from her a sheriff's fee of P5,000.00 
but the said amount was later reduced to P2,500 upon her request, Later 
respondent thru Mr. Rubio asked for an additional amount of P5,000.00 
which she gave to Mr. Rubio. Mr. Rubio testified that he gave the said 
amount to the respondent.&nbsp; </p><p> Both complainants aver that although 
they were able to pinpoint to Sheriff Balasbas the whereabouts of the 
two cars owned by defendant Dolores Cruz, the latter failed to take 
possession of them. Hence on July 6, 1997, they decided to see 
respondent to inquire from him about the development of the case, 
specifically regarding the two aforementioned cars. The respondent told 
them that he already had talked to Mrs. Marie Balboa Gomez, a sister of 
defendant Dolores Cruz, who promised to surrender the cars the following
 week. On July 12, 1997, complainants again went to respondent's house 
to inform him where the cars could be found but the latter replied that 
the necessary papers were not with him at that time as he had left them 
at his desk in the office. On July 26, 1997, complainant Armando Canlas 
looked for the cars and found the Mitsubishi Galant car in the 
possession of Mr. Bon Jovi Maniti. He hurriedly went to respondent's 
house and relayed the information to him only to be informed by the 
latter that the papers were at his office.&nbsp; </p><p> Respondent stressed 
that at the very outset he had faithfully complied with the directives 
embodied in the Writ of Attachment dated 30 June 1997 (Exhibit 'A' and 
Exhibit ‘1’) issued in Civil Case No. 8651. The Writ of Attachment was 
issued for complainant Canlas' claim of P350,000.00.&nbsp; </p><p> In like 
manner, he alleged that he faithfully complied with the directives in 
the Writ of Attachment dated 18 July 1997 (Exhibit 'H' and Exhibit ‘8’) 
issued in Civil Case No.8659. Respondent with dispatch levied on real 
properties belonging to the defendant.&nbsp; </p><p> Respondent admitted that
 he received P2,000.00 from Armando Canlas but denied that he asked 
[for] and received an additional P3,000.00. He averred that he used the 
P2,000.00 for the levy on attachment and the remainder he used as his 
gasoline expenses and for food as he used his own car and Homer Rubio 
was always with him. He denied receiving P2,500.00 from Ruby Dungca and 
later demanded and received an additional P500.00. He however admitted 
that he received P1,500.00 from Mrs. Dungca when the latter went to his 
office. He used the money given to him by Dungca to have her claims 
annotated on the title of Dolores Cruz's property.&nbsp; </p><p> He denied 
the allegations of Armando Canlas insofar as the two vehicles of Dolores
 Cruz [were] concerned. He alleged that he was ready to take possession 
of the said two vehicles whenever and wherever he [would] find them. He 
just found difficulty locating them. In order to protect the interest of
 the complainant, he had the levy [i]n the latter's favor annotated on 
the registration papers of the two vehicles."</p></blockquote><p align="center"> <b><u>Recommendation of the Investigating Judge</u></b>&nbsp;
 </p><p> The investigating judge found that respondent violated Section 9
 of Rule 141 because he had accepted sums of money from complainants 
purportedly to cover his expenses in the execution of the Writs of 
Attachment. Hence, he recommended that respondent be found guilty of 
serious misconduct and fined in the amount of P5,000.</p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b>&nbsp; </p><p> We agree with 
the findings and the recommendation of the investigating judge.</p><p align="center"> <b><u>Liability of Respondent Sheriff</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>
 Respondent's duty in the present case is prescribed in Section 9 of 
Rule 141 of the Rules of Court, which states:&nbsp; </p><p> "SEC. 9. Sheriff,
 and other persons serving processes.&nbsp; </p><p align="center"> xxx xxx 
xxx&nbsp; </p><p> (c) For executing a writ of attachment against the property
 of defendant, fifty (P50.00) pesos;&nbsp; </p><p align="center"> xxx xxx 
xxx&nbsp; </p><p> (g) For executing a writ of process to place a party in 
possession of real estate, one hundred (P100.00) pesos;&nbsp; </p><p align="center"> xxx xxx xxx&nbsp; </p><p> (k) For issuing a notice of 
garnishment, for each notice, twenty (P20.00) pesos;&nbsp; </p><p> (l) For 
money collected by him by order, execution, attachment, or any other 
process, judicial or extrajudicial, the following sums, to wit:</p><blockquote><p>
 1. On the first four thousand P4,000.00 pesos, four (4%) per centum.&nbsp; </p><p>
 2. On all sums in excess of four thousand (P4,000.00) pesos two (2%) 
per centum.</p></blockquote><p> "In addition to the fees hereinabove 
fixed, the party requesting the process of any court, preliminary, 
incidental, or final, shall pay the sheriff's expenses in serving or 
executing the process, or safeguarding the property levied upon, 
attached or seized, including kilometrage for each kilometer of travel, 
guards' fees, warehousing and similar charges, in an amount estimated by
 the sheriff, subject to the approval of the court. Upon approval of 
said estimated expenses, the interested party shall deposit such amount 
with the clerk of court and ex-officio sheriff, who shall disburse the 
same to the deputy sheriff assigned to effect the process, subject to 
liquidation within the same period for rendering a return on the 
process. Any unspent amount shall be refunded to the party making the 
deposit. A full report shall be submitted by the deputy sheriff assigned
 with his return, and the sheriff's expenses shall be taxed as costs 
against the judgment debtor."</p></blockquote><p> The foregoing 
provision requires that the sheriff's estimate of the expenses to be 
incurred in the execution of a writ should be approved by the judge. It 
further directs that the approved estimate be deposited with the clerk 
of court and ex oficio sheriff, who shall then disburse the same to the 
sheriff assigned to implement the writ. Moreover, any unspent amount 
shall then be refunded to the party making the deposit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p><p> In this case, respondent
 admits that he did in fact ask for and receive P2,000 from Canlas and 
P1,500 from Dungca for gasoline and other expenses necessary to 
implement the two Writs of Attachment. The amount was not part of the 
approved estimate of expenses and was not deposited with the clerk of 
court, but came directly from complainants for the use of respondent. 
Clearly, respondent sheriff violated the aforecited provision.</p><p> 
The following pronouncement of the Court in <em>Ong v. Meregildo</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> is appropriate in this case:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>
 "Respondent [sheriff] failed grievously to comply with the above 
requirements of Section 9. Respondent knew, or should have known, that 
he had to present his cost estimates for implementation of the Writ of 
Demolition and Possession to the court issuing the Writ for its 
approval. He did not do so. Respondent Sheriff repeatedly charged and 
collected from complainant sums of money without approval of the Court. 
He did not deposit the sums received from complainant with the Clerk of 
Court who, under Section 9, was then authorized to disburse the same to 
respondent Sheriff to effect implementation of the writ. x x x."</p></blockquote><p>
 That the said amounts were given to respondent voluntarily did not make
 the misconduct less reprehensible. It has been held that sheriffs 
cannot receive gratuities or voluntary payments from parties they are 
ordered to assist in the course of their duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p><p> Once again we stress that high 
standards are expected of sheriffs, who play an important role in the 
administration of justice. As we explained in <em>Vda. de Abellera v. 
Dalisay</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>
 "At the grassroots of our judicial machinery, sheriffs and deputy 
sheriffs are indispensably in close contact with the litigants, hence, 
their conduct should be geared towards maintaining the prestige and 
integrity of the court, for the image of a court of justice is 
necessarily mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the men 
and women who work thereat, from the judge to the least and lowest of 
its personnel; hence, it becomes the imperative sacred duty of each and 
everyone in the court to maintain its good name and standing as a temple
 of justice."</p></blockquote><p> WHEREFORE, respondent sheriff is 
hereby found <em><strong>GUILTY</strong></em>&nbsp; of serious misconduct and<em><strong>
 FINED</strong></em> P5,000 with a stern warning that a repetition of 
the same or a similar infraction shall be dealt with more severely. </p><p>
