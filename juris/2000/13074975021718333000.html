</p>The administrative matter at bar stems from a sworn 
affidavit-complaint dated 22 March 1999, filed by herein complainant 
Luzviminda C. Comia, imputing to respondent Judge Conrado R. Antona of 
the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Batangas City, Branch 4, a plethora of
 charges involving <em>“gross ignorance of the law, by deliberately 
committing a mockery of judicial proceedings, (for) knowingly rendering 
an unjust judgment in favor of the accused, (for) capriciously allowing 
the accused in the custody of their counsel, (for) treating the private 
prosecutor in a despotic, tyrannical, oppressive and dictatorial manner 
during the January 6, 1999 hearing, (for) allowing accused to post bail 
despite the fact that the crime committed is a capital offense and a 
heinous crime, at that; (of) depriving the prosecution the procedural 
requirement of due process, (for) acting most prejudicial to the best 
interest, image, trust, confidence and integrity of the court, and (for)
 deliberately violating the existing doctrines and jurisprudence laid 
down by the Honorable Supreme Court.”</em><p>In a Memorandum dated 12 April 2000, Court of Appeals Justice 
Buenaventura J. Guerrero, who was tasked by this Court to conduct an 
investigation, and submit a report and recommendation on the instant 
administrative matter, classified the charges against respondent judge 
into three:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>A) Ignorance of the law;
  </p>
  <p>B) Conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the Court; and
  </p>
  <p>C) Deliberately violating existing doctrines and jurisprudence laid down by the Supreme Court.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As borne by the records, this administrative matter arose as a result
 of respondent judge‘s handling of Criminal Case No. 9309 for Murder, 
particularly the hearing and resolution of the petition for bail 
therein. 
</p><p>Based on the Memorandum submitted by Investigating Justice 
Buenaventura J. Guerrero, the material antecedents and proceedings in 
the instant administrative case are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“On 19 January 1998, an information for murder for the death of 
complainant’s husband, Numeriano Comia, was filed with the Regional 
Trial Court, Fourth judicial Region, and raffled to Branch 4, Batangas 
City, presided by respondent Judge. Docketed as Criminal Case No. 9309 
and entitled ‘People of the Philippines vs. Fajardo, et al.,’ accused 
were Dante Fajardo, Sr. and Filipina Fajardo-Arce, as principals, the 
latter’s husband Pio Arce as accomplice. </p>
  <p> “On 29 January 1998, counsels for accused Fajardo Sr., Filipina 
Arce and Pio Arce, filed an ‘Urgent Motion to Defer Issuance of the 
Warrants of Arrest with Supplemental Petition to Quash, Lift and or 
Dissolve Warrant of Arrest if Already Issued.’ Private Prosecutor Atty. 
Isabelita Bathan Manigbas with the conformity of 2nd Assistant City 
Prosecutor Leonardo Suyo of Batangas City submitted a 
comment/opposition. Taking cognizance that a petition for review against
 the resolution of the City Prosecutor had been filed by the accused 
with the Department of Justice, respondent judge held that ‘such fact 
does not in any way preclude the court from acting on the information 
already filed with the Court’ hence denied the urgent motion for lack of
 merit. Counsel for the accused filed a motion for reconsideration. On 
10 March 1998, respondent Judge granted the motion decreeing ‘that the 
efficacy of the said warrants of arrest against all the herein accused 
dated January 27, 1998 are hereby suspended until further order of the 
court.’
  </p>
  <p> “A motion for reconsideration was filed by the Private Prosecutor 
with the conformity of the 2nd Assistant City Prosecutor Leonardo Suyo. 
On 31 March 1998, respondent Judge denied the motion ruling, inter alia,
 that: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> ‘X X X In any case, a reading of the subsequent orders of the 
Secretary of Justice merely gave the justification for the prosecutors 
to file informations with the Court even if there were appeals and/or 
petitions for review of their resolutions seasonably filed. There is, 
however, nothing in these orders and/or circulars which in any way 
affects the discretion of the Court on whether or not warrants of arrest
 should be issued and although already issued, the Court may order its 
recall and as what had been made in this case, suspend the effectivity 
of said warrants of arrest. </p>
    <p> ‘Moreover, the right of an accused to appeal and/or petition for
 review resolutions of Prosecutors to the Secretary of Justice had not 
been removed but only qualified. It is unfortunate that what impressed 
the Private prosecutor was the apparently no longer effective Circular 
No. 17 of the Department of Justice. But as can be gleaned from the 
order of March 10, 1998, the suspension of the efficacy of warrants of 
arrest was primarily premised on the sense of fair play of the Court to 
give full meaning to the due process that should be accorded every 
person accused of a criminal offense and in the interest of substantial 
justice in the face of the existence of warrants of arrest which 
undoubtedly would affect the rights of the accused to ventillate (sic) 
their arguments and evidence before the Secretary of Justice.’
      </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> “On 04 November 1998, defense’s appeal to the Department of Justice was dismissed. </p>
  <p> “On 04 December 1998, respondent Judge issued the second warrants of arrest against accused Fajardo Sr., Filipina and Pio. <u><strong>While still at large</strong></u><strong>,
 Atty. Reynaldo P. Dimayacyac, Sr. filed an Urgent Petition for the 
Grant of Bail to Accused Dante Fajardo, Sr. and Filipina Arce with 
Supplemental Motion for Reduction of Bail Recommended for Accused Pio 
Arce, Jr. dated 14 December 1998</strong>. </p>
  <p><strong>On 16 December 1998, respondent Judge merely directed that 
the urgent petition be filed with the records it appearing the court has
 not yet acquired jurisdiction over the persons of all accused who are <u>still at large</u></strong>.
  </p>
  <p> “On 04 January 1999, acting on the manifestation/motion of counsel for the accused, respondent Judge issued an <strong>order setting tentatively the hearing of the petition for bail</strong>
 of Fajardo, Sr. and Filipina Arce and reduction of bail of Pio Arce, 
Jr. on 06 January 1999 at 9:30 a.m. In the same order, respondent judge 
directed that a copy thereof be furnished the City Prosecutor, and upon 
request of the defense counsel, subpoena ad testificandum be issued to 
three witnesses named in the request. </p>
  <p> “<strong>On 06 January 1999, the scheduled hearing of the petition for bail was held</strong>.
 First to speak was the private prosecutor who manifested they only 
learned ‘today’ of the return of the warrant dated January 6, 1999 
showing that the warrant was served by the PNP Criminal Investigation 
and Detection Group, Camp Crame, Quezon City in the evening on January 
5, 1999. Inasmuch as the accused were present, she continued that a 
commitment order be issued for their confinement at the City Jail of 
Batangas, adding that a representative of the PNP Batangas is present 
for the purpose. </p>
  <p> “Defense’s counsel retorted the proceedings was for petition for 
bail and since the court had ruled that the petition could not be heard 
without the accused-movants submitting themselves to the jurisdiction of
 the court, <strong>they surrendered themselves to the Criminal 
Investigation and Detection Group of the PNP, Camp Crame and were 
pressing (sic) for a speedy trial</strong>. </p>
  <p> “<strong>Respondent Judge then remarked that</strong> the matter to be heard as shown <strong>in the order setting the hearing, was <u>subject to the condition</u> that the accused voluntarily surrender themselves which they did</strong>.
 Regarding the plea of the private counsel that a commitment order for 
the confinement of the accused in Batangas City Jail be issued, he said 
it ‘will be resolved later on but first things first.’ Continuing, he 
observed that ‘the motion here set for hearing is the one for the 
movants to show their cause why this motion should be granted and in the
 matter of granting bail and with respect to the other accused in the 
matter of reduction of bail, so first things first.’
  </p>
  <p> “Private prosecutor then asserted that under the Rules of Criminal
 Procedure, in application for bail particularly for capital offense 
(the burden of) ‘showing (that the evidence of) the guilt of the accused
 is strong, lies in the prosecution. It is the prosecution who should 
present evidence to prove (that the evidence of) the guilt of accused is
 strong.’ Citing Section 8 of Rule 114, she argues that ‘all of the 
evidence presented by the prosecution shall [be] automatically form part
 (of) the trial on the merits of the case. So, it would be unprocedural 
(sic) Your Honor, with due respect to the Honorable Court and to defense
 counsel that this application for bail be conducted without first 
submitting the accused to the proper agency; that they be properly 
arraigned and the Prosecution then will be given the proper opportunity 
to file an opposition to the petition for bail and to give proper 
opportunity for the prosecution to present its evidence to prove that 
the evidence of guilt is strong; <strong>the accused here has not yet 
been arraigned; they had not been committed to the proper agency where 
they should had been properly detained, Your Honor</strong>.’” (Emphasis Ours) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the course of the bail hearing, the defense further moved – to
 the objection of the prosecution –  that the accused be held in custody
 at the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, Camp Crame, claiming
 that accused, Fajardo, Sr., was then scheduled for medical operation 
“as early as December 14th.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Respondent judge granted the motion of defense counsel.
</p><p>On 12 January 1999, the prosecution filed an “Omnibus Motion to 
(a) reconsider the order of custody of the accused; (b) declare the 
proceedings on the bail null and void; (c) inhibit; and, (d) defer 
further proceedings.”
</p><p>On 28 January 1999, the prosecution likewise filed a “Supplement 
to the Omnibus Motion dated December 14, 1998 with Additional Arguments 
to Support its Motion for Reconsideration Anent the order of January 6, 
1999.”
</p><p>In an order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated 01
 February 1999, respondent judge denied the Omnibus Motion to which the 
prosecution moved to reconsider said order. On 03 February 1999, 
respondent judge denied the Motion for Reconsideration of the 
prosecution and declared the bail hearings terminated. 
</p><p>Upon arraignment, accused Fajardo Sr. and Filipina Fajardo- Arce pleaded not guilty to the charge against them.
</p><p>In an order dated 15 February 1999,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 respondent judge granted the petition for bail and fixed the amount 
thereof at P200,000.00 each for accused Fajardo Sr. and Filipina 
Fajardo-Arce, and reduced the amount of bail to P100,000.00 for accused 
Pio Arce, Jr.
</p><p>On 25 February 1999, respondent judge inhibited himself from the hearing and trial of Criminal Case No. 9309.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
</p><p><strong><u>ADMINISTRATIVE CASE</u></strong>
</p><p>Acting on the sworn affidavit-complaint filed by herein 
complainant Luzviminda Comia and considering the gravity of the charges 
imputed therein, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) recommended
 to the High Court that the instant administrative matter be referred to
 the Court of Appeals for immediate raffle, investigation, report and 
recommendation.
</p><p>In a Resolution dated 06 December 1999, this Court referred the 
case to the Court of Appeals and, upon subsequent raffle, was assigned 
to Justice Buenaventura J. Guerrero for investigation, report and 
recommendation.
</p><p>On 23 February 2000, herein complainant, through counsel, filed a memorandum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> For his part, respondent judge submitted a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> on 06 March 2000, and a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> on 17 March 2000, to which complainant filed a Compliance with Reply-Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated 28 March 2000.
</p><p>In a Memorandum dated 12 April 2000, Investigating Justice 
Buenaventura J. Guerrero submitted to the High Court his findings and 
recommendations on the administrative matter, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“1. <strong>Ignorance of the law</strong>: On the basis of the foregoing, respondent Judge may be held administratively liable and ordered to pay a fine of P20,000.00 ; </p>
  <p> “2. <strong>Conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the Court</strong>:
 No Fraud, dishonesty or corruption has been charged much less proven 
against respondent Judge. Hence, he may be exonerated; and, </p>
  <p> “3. <strong>Deliberately violating existing doctrines and jurisprudence laid down by the Supreme Court</strong>:
 There is no evidence that respondent Judge was aware of herein 
aforecited jurisprudential doctrines on application for admission to 
bail in a capital offense. Not one of these cases—or any case for that 
matter involving petition for bail in a charge for a capital offense—was
 brought to the attention of respondent Judge by the prosecution to show
 that his order was in violation of existing jurisprudence. Hence, 
respondent Judge may be exonerated.”(Emphasis Ours) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><u><strong>THE COURT’S RULING </strong></u>
</p><p>The findings and recommendations of the investigating justice are
 well-taken. A thorough perusal of the records and evidence adduced by 
the complainant lend credible substantiation to the charge of gross 
ignorance of the law on the part of respondent judge. Verily, the 
actuation of respondent judge specifically in the handling, hearing and 
resolution of the petition for bail constitutes not only ignorance of 
fundamental rules relating to bail applications, but demands stern 
rebuke from this Court as well.
</p><p>Without doubt, the rules and principles relating to bail 
transgressed by respondent judge are – to say the least – basic that 
unfamiliarity therewith entails a finding of administrative liability 
and necessitates the imposition of the proper penalty.
</p><p> Section 8 of Rule 114 of the Rules of Court is explicit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“<strong>Sec. 8. Burden of Proof in Bail Application</strong>. – At the hearing of an application for admission to bail <strong>filed by any person who is in custody</strong> for the commission of an offense punishable by death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, <strong>the prosecution has the burden of showing that evidence of guilt is strong</strong>.
 The evidence presented during the bail hearings shall be considered 
automatically reproduced at the trial, but upon motion of either party, 
the court may recall any witness for additional examination unless the 
witness is dead, outside of the Philippines or otherwise unable to 
testify.” (Emphasis Ours) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, jurisprudence on the matter is crystalline. Bereft of any ambiguity of language, this Court, as early as <em>Feliciano vs. Pasicolan</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 articulated the principle in this jurisdiction that since bail is 
intended to obtain the provisional liberty of the accused, the same 
cannot be authorized or posted <strong>before custody</strong> of said accused has been acquired by the judicial authorities by his arrest or voluntary surrender.
</p><p>It is self evident that a court cannot authorize provisional 
liberty to one who is then actually in the enjoyment of his liberty, or 
as the Court quoted in <strong><em>Feliciano</em></strong>, “it would be incongruous to grant bail to one who is free.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 Stated differently, the right to bail can only be availed of by a 
person who is in custody of the law or otherwise deprived of his liberty
 and it would be premature, not to say incongruous, to <u><span class="style1">file</span></u><strong> a petition for bail</strong> for someone whose freedom has yet to be curtailed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
</p><p>Thus in <em>Borinaga vs. Tamin</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  the High Court in categorical terms enunciated:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“X X X Where admission to bail is a matter of discretion, the <u><strong>prosecution has the burden of showing that evidence of guilt is strong</strong></u>.
 X X X Admission to bail as a matter of discretion presupposes the 
exercise thereof in accordance with law and guided by the applicable 
legal principles. <u>The <strong>prosecution</strong> must first be accorded an <strong>opportunity to present evidence</strong> because by the very nature of deciding applications for bail, it is <strong>on
 the basis of such evidence that judicial discretion is weighed against 
in determining whether the guilt of the accused is strong</strong></u>. In other words, discretion must be exercised regularly, legally and within the confines of procedural due process, that is, <strong><u>after evaluation of the evidence submitted by the prosecution. X X X</u></strong> </p>
  <p> “X X X </p>
  <p> “<strong>In the first place, respondent judge did not have the authority to set the petition for bail for hearing</strong> in view of the fact that he had not even acquired jurisdiction over the criminal case X X X.” (Emphasis ours) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the present circumstances, respondent Judge Antona-- fully 
cognizant that the court had not yet acquired jurisdiction over the 
persons of the accused considering that the latter were “at large”-- 
still entertained the application for bail by setting a date of hearing 
therefor, albeit tentatively, and conditioned upon the voluntary 
surrender of the accused. In doing so, respondent judge indubitably 
violated settled jurisprudential doctrines regarding the purpose of bail
 which is to secure the temporary liberty of persons under the custody 
of the law, or otherwise deprived of freedom. 
</p><p>It is of no moment that the accused eventually surrendered to the
 police authorities on the same date “tentatively” scheduled for the 
hearing of the application for bail. To our mind, such supervening event
 is of no bearing and immaterial; it does not absolve respondent judge 
from administrative liability considering that he should not have 
accorded recognition to the application for bail filed on behalf of 
persons, who at that point, were devoid of personality to ask such 
specific affirmative relief from the court.
</p><p>The records reveal that at the time the application for bail was 
filed, the accused were, in fact, in the enjoyment of their liberty, 
having evaded the long arm of the law despite the existence of standing 
warrants for their arrest issued by no less than respondent Judge Antona
 himself. 
</p><p>Similarly, respondent judge is guilty of a procedural lapse in 
the hearing of the petition for bail inasmuch as the order and manner of
 presentation of evidence in the bail hearings were flawed and highly 
irregular. In the case before us, the defense adduced and presented its 
evidence even ahead of the prosecution despite the unequivocal provision
 of the Rules to the effect that in bail petitions, the burden of 
proving that the evidence of guilt is strong lies within the fence of 
the prosecution. The clear import of the foregoing pronouncements is 
that the prosecution should be accorded all the opportunity to adduce, 
submit and present proof to bolster its stand that the evidence of guilt
 is indeed strong so as to warrant the denial of the petition for bail 
addressed to the court. Moreover, as gleaned from the order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 dated 04 January 1999, only the defense witnesses were issued subpoenas
 Ad Testificandum to the exclusion of prosecution witnesses.
</p><p>Likewise, respondent judge transgressed the Rules in view of the 
fact that his order dated 15 February 1999, granting the petition for 
bail in favor of the accused Dante Fajardo, Sr. and Filipina 
Fajardo-Arce, and reducing the bail in favor of Pio Arce, Jr., failed to
 recite a summary of the evidence for the prosecution. The records show 
that said order merely made mention and invoked as its basis the 
evidence presented by the defense. Notably, respondent judge’s actuation
 is dissident to settled doctrine on this matter that the court’s order 
granting or refusing bail must contain a <strong>summary of the evidence for the prosecution</strong>,
 otherwise the order may be invalidated because the summary of the 
evidence for the prosecution, which contains the judge’s evaluation of 
the evidence, may be considered as an aspect of procedural due process 
for both prosecution and the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> 
</p><p>To appreciate the strength or weakness of the evidence of guilt, 
the prosecution must be consulted or heard. It is equally entitled, as 
the accused, to due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
 The concept of fairness must not be strained till it is narrowed to a 
filament. We are to keep the balance true. This norm is of the very 
essence of due process, as the embodiment of justice requires that the 
prosecution be given the opportunity to prove that there is strong 
evidence of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
</p><p>In the instant administrative matter, proof is extant that in the
 bail hearings the prosecution was not afforded adequate opportunity 
within a reasonable time to present evidence within its grasp to 
substantiate the degree and gravity of guilt of the accused, for 
purposes of resolving the bail petition. As gleaned from the order dated
 15 February 1999, respondent judge relied solely on, and made strict 
mention of the evidence adduced by the defense without incorporating in 
said order a recital of the evidence for the prosecution. Respondent 
judge ruled and concluded, albeit erroneously, that the prosecution 
waived its right to adduce evidence; in effect, the prosecution was 
denied the opportunity to submit all the evidence it desired to present.
</p><p>Evidently, respondent judge was remiss in performing the specific
 duty of reciting – in the subject order – the summary of evidence for 
the prosecution. For where the grant of bail is discretionary, as in the
 instant case, the issue of whether or not an accused should be admitted
 to bail lies on the strength of the prosecution’s evidence as to their 
guilt,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> without prejudice, however, to the right of the defense to cross-examine witnesses and introduce evidence in its own rebuttal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
</p><p>Worth stressing too, is that <strong>no reasonable notice</strong>
 was given to the prosecution regarding the hearing of the petition for 
bail. As shown by the records, the order setting the 06 January 1999 
bail hearing was received by the City Prosecutor and private prosecutor 
on 04 January 1999 and 05 January 1999, respectively. In this 
jurisdiction, whether bail is a matter of right or discretion, 
reasonable notice of hearing is required to be given to the prosecutor 
or fiscal, or at least, he must be asked for his recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
</p><p>Thus, in <em>Depamaylo vs. Brotarlo</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 the disregard by respondent judge of the mandatory three-day notice 
rule under Section 4, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court was deemed by the 
High Court to constitute “undue haste”:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“ The undue haste with which respondent judge granted bail also 
accounts for her disregard of the mandatory requirement in Rule 15, 
Section 4 that notice of a motion must be served on all parties at least
 three days in advance of the hearing.”  
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same vein, despite lack of proper substantiation and 
presentation of documentary evidence by the defense and over the 
vigorous objection of the prosecution, respondent judge allowed that 
custody of the accused be transferred from the Batangas City Jail to the
 Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, specifically under Senior 
Inspector Eduardo S. Villena, Chief of Prosecution Department, on the 
ground of “health and security reasons.” 
</p><p> As to the charge, however, of conduct prejudicial to the best 
interest of the court, we adopt the findings of the Investigating 
Justice that no fraud, dishonesty or corruption was imputed, nor proved 
by complainant; hence, respondent judge is not liable therefor.
</p><p>On the same score, this Court finds no compelling evidence on record to substantiate the charge that respondent judge <strong>deliberately</strong>
 violated existing doctrines and jurisprudence enunciated by the High 
Court. To our mind, the procedural lapses and irregularities in the bail
 hearings were not consciously, purposely, and intentionally perpetrated
 by respondent judge so as to render him liable for said charge. At the 
most, respondent judge’s actuation were borne by an ignorance of the 
pertinent rules and applicable jurisprudence and were not, in our 
considered view, products of a grand design to deliberately perpetrate 
injustice. 
</p><p>All told, this Court once again seizes the moment to remind 
judges to keep abreast of the rules and recent pronouncements of this 
Court, so they may evolve into more effective dispensers of justice — 
magistrates of the law in the truest sense of the word.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, in light of the foregoing 
disquisitions, the Court finds respondent Judge Conrado R. Antona  
liable for gross ignorance of the law. ACCORDINGLY, the Court hereby 
resolves to impose upon him a fine of P20,000.000 and sternly warns 
respondent judge  that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be
 dealt with more severely.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.
