Gille merely averred that appellant was one of the malefactors, but did not impute any specific act to him.&nbsp; He failed to identify who announced the holdup, who grabbed the bag, and who shot the victim.&nbsp; Verily, his testimony was bereft of any showing that appellant committed any act indicating participation in the criminal enterprise.<br><br>If at all, Gille merely established that appellant was inside the tricycle at the time.&nbsp; Mere presence, however, does not amount to conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It must also be shown that the accused performed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Indeed, it is axiomatic that conspiracy must be established beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It must be founded on facts, not on mere surmises or conjectures.<br><br>Furthermore, the witness himself admitted that he did not turn his head to look at the commotion at the back of the tricycle, but relied instead on the mirror.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Thus, according to him, he was able <i>to see</i> the incident. But his testimony was contrary to his earlier Sworn Statement, pertinent portions of which are reproduced hereunder:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><blockquote>"That to my surpris[e] when a commotion inside the tricycle occurred and I [felt] as if a fierce struggle had happened, and at that juncture I heard a voice pleading for mercy not to get on what on [sic] him and I heard that he said in [V]isayan dialect "AYAW UG KUHA-A NI, KAY AKO NING PANUWELDO SA AKONG MGA TAMO," then after that a single gunburst erupted and as I looked back I saw three persons who quickly r[a]n away from us.<br><br>That before I forget, before the scuffle happened inside the tricycle I heard that one of them announce[d] a HOLD-UP saying in [V]isayan dialect ["]AYAM MO UG LIHOK KAY HOLD-UP NI"[;] for fear I did what they ordered, until I noticed that [a] grappling inside happened for I [felt] that the tricycle was swaying.<br><br>That as we [felt] that they were not around anymore, we immediately help[ed] the wounded person x x x.<br><br>That last April 22, 1995, I learned that the suspects [i]n robbing and killing ELMO FERNANDEZ&nbsp; were arrested by the members of Police Precinct No. 1 (Sta. Ana) and there as I went to see them I positively identified the two of the three who r[a]n after the incident through their faces as MARCOS MUCAM alias ALLAN and the other one as ALDRIN TINOY alias BEBOY."</blockquote>The foregoing reveals that Gille did not<i> see</i> the commotion at the back of the tricycle; he did not <i>see</i> the victim plead with the holduppers; and he did not <i>see</i> who fired the gun.&nbsp; Rather, he merely <i>felt</i> a "fierce struggle" at the back and <i>heard</i> a plea for mercy, which was answered with a gunshot.&nbsp; Moreover, he and the others began to help the wounded only when "we f[elt] that [the robbers] were not around anymore."&nbsp; More significant, he was able to identify the appellant and the accused at the police station, because they were "two of the three who ran after the incident."<br><br>The lack of specific acts imputed to any of the three alleged robbers confirm that Gille did not <i>witness</i> the incident, but merely <i>heard and felt</i> the commotion at the back of the tricycle. Thus, he did not see appellant (or any of the other accused) grab the bag, fire the gun, or assist the malefactors. He merely saw the latter run away after the incident.&nbsp; To repeat, this act by itself did not prove that he was a conspirator.&nbsp; Verily, appellant's conduct may be explained by the natural tendency to run away from the source of one's fear.<br><br>Just as damning to the prosecution was the acquittal of Aldrin Tinoy, who had similarly been identified by Gille as one of the perpetrators.&nbsp; The trial court did not explain why it granted credence to Gille's identification of appellant, but not of Aldrin.&nbsp; Indeed, we have examined the records, and we find no justification for such discrimination in the ruling.<br><br>The solicitor general argues that Gille's identification of Aldrin Tinoy was "less than categorical and positive" because his involvement was allegedly denied by appellant himself, who instead implicated one Rasboy Tinoy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> This argument is utterly bereft of merit because it misunderstands the context in which appellant allegedly implicated Rasboy.&nbsp; It overlooks the fact that the appellant made the assertion while under police custody, subject to physical violence, and without the assistance of counsel.&nbsp; It is scarcely necessary to point out that such statement deserves no consideration at all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Thus, we find no justification for the acceptance by the trial court of Gille's testimony in regard to appellant whom it convicted, but not in regard to Tinoy whom it acquitted.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, we hold that Gille's testimony did not prove the guilt of either Tinoy or Mucam.<br><br><i><u>Lumosad's Testimony</u></i><br><br>The conclusion of the trial court was based also on two crucial factual findings, viz:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><blockquote>"10)&nbsp; That accused Mucam on April 9, 1995 invited Alvin Lumosad to drink saying he got a lot of money from a holdup<br><br>11)&nbsp; That Alvin Lumosad met [a] [p]oliceman and by chance, the Buhangin robbery killing was mentioned and Alvin Lumosad said accused Mucam mentioned the holdup and had lots of money"</blockquote>These findings, however, are erroneous.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, Lumosad testified that he was invited to drink, not by Appellant Mucam, but by Rickylito Diuyan who allegedly admitted to him his participation in the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> There was no basis, therefore, for the crucial finding of the trial court that it was appellant himself who had admitted his role in the robbery.<br><br>Furthermore, no credence should be given to the testimony of Lumosad, in which he alleged that Diuyan told him that appellant had conspired in committing the crime.&nbsp; It was hearsay evidence insofar as it sought to prove that appellant participated in the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In any event, it should be observed that Diuyan was originally charged in this case,&nbsp; but his name was subsequently dropped by the prosecution because "complainant and witnesses did not name accused-movant as one of the authors of [the] crime for which he stands charged."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><i><u>Police Officer's Testimony</u></i><br><br>The trial court further held that the testimony of the police officer was credible, because appellant did not impute any malice to him.<br><br>It should be stressed that PO3 Ariel Embalsado, one of the policemen who arrested appellant, had no personal knowledge that the latter committed the crime.&nbsp; According to Embalsado, the police acted only on the information given to them by Lumosad.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> But as discussed earlier, Lumosad himself had no personal knowledge that appellant was one of the malefactors, as the former merely received the information from one of the alleged robbers, Diuyan, who was however subsequently discharged by the prosecution.&nbsp; Thus, even assuming that the testimony of the police officer was credible, it did not contain anything that would implicate appellant in the crime.<br><br><i><u>Denial and Alibi</u></i><br><br>Denial, which was invoked by appellant, is a weak defense. Conviction, however,&nbsp; rests on the strength of the prosecution's own evidence, never on the weakness or even absence of that for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In the present case, none of the prosecution witnesses convincingly established that appellant was one of the malefactors. Once again, we stress that the prosecution had the burden of proof.&nbsp; This it failed to discharge.&nbsp; Accordingly, appellant must be acquitted.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is hereby <i>GRANTED</i> and the Decision of the court <i>a quo</i> <i>REVERSED</i> and <i>VACATED</i>.&nbsp; Appellant Marcos Mucam <i>y</i> Bandayanon is <i>ACQUITTED</i> on reasonable doubt. The director of the Bureau of Corrections is hereby directed to cause the release of appellant forthwith, unless the latter is being lawfully held for another cause; and to inform the Court of his release, or the reasons for his continued confinement, within ten days from notice.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Melo, (Chairman), Vitug, Purisima</i>, and <i>Gonzaga-Reyes, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Written by Judge Jesus V.
