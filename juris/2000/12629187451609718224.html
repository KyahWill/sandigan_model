				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is an appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Baguio City, Branch 6, finding accused-appellants Diolo Barita, Denver Golsing and Dionisio Cuison guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 4, Article II of Republic Act 6425 otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act as amended by Section 13 of Republic Act 7659.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Diolo Barita (BARITA), Denver Golsing (GOLSING) and Dionisio Cuison (CUISON) were charged with violation of Section 4, Article II of Republic Act 6425 in an information that reads:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 9th day of June 1994, in the City of Baguio, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually aiding one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell and deliver more or less 2,800 grams of dried marijuana leaves with flowering tops knowing fully well that said leaves of marijuana is a prohibited drug, in violation of the above mentioned provision of law.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>On October 25, 1984, all three accused were arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The lower court summarized the facts as follows:<br><blockquote>"The evidence shows that on June 9, 1994 at about 12:00 o’clock noon Police Supt. Felix Cadalli of the 14<sup>th</sup> Narcotics Regional Field Unit, Camp Bado Dangwa, La Trinidad, Benguet received a report from a civilian informer that one alias Jun, a taxi driver, who usually waits for passengers at Nelbusco Terminal, Otek St., Baguio City is the middleman of those selling marijuana at Justice Village, Baguio City.<br><br>After evaluating the information, P/Supt. Cadalli organized a buy-bust team composed of P/Insp. Virgilio Pelaez as team leader, PO3 Teofilo Juanata as poseur-buyer, SPO1 Edelfonso Sison as driver and PO3 Rolando Gamit as back-up. A briefing ensued wherein Insp. Pelaez, PO3 Gamit and SPO1 Sison were instructed to proceed to Justice Village, and wait and position themselves strategically thereat so that they could witness the transaction between their poseur-buyer and the drug pushers. Supt. Cadalli gave PO3 Juanata two pieces of <strike>P</strike>100.00 bills together with machine copies thereof and pieces of paper cut into the size of money bills such that if put together with one of the two <strike>P</strike>100.00 bills on top and the other at the bottom, the whole bunch will have the appearance of a bundle of money to be used in the purchase of marijuana for entrapment purposes. The two <strike>P</strike>100.00 bills were previously the subject of an Authentication (Exh. E) dated June 3, 1994 before Prosecutor Octavio Banta. Juanata was instructed by Cadalli to proceed with the civilian informer to the Nelbusco Terminal at Otek St., Baguio City to contact alias Jun, the middleman.<br><br>In accordance with instructions, Pelaez, Gamit and Sison left for Justice Village at about 3:00 p.m. on board the red car owned and driven by Sison. In turn, Juanata and the civilian informer boarded a passenger jeepney and proceeded to the Nelbusco Terminal. There, they were able to see alias Jun waiting for passengers inside his taxi. Juanata was introduced by the civilian informer to alias Jun, later identified as Dionisio Cuison, as a buyer of marijuana. And the latter told them that the stocks of marijuana were availabe at Justice Village. The three proceeded to Justice Village on board Jun’s taxicab.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Narcom team of Pelaez waited at the road junction of Justice Village and Marcos Highway. Not long after, they spotted the taxi driven by accused Cuison carrying Juanata and the civilian informer and followed it unnoticed. The taxi stopped by the side of the road at Justice Village. The red car of Sison following passed by the taxi and then took a U-turn at the dead end of the road such that when the red car was parked, those inside it were facing the taxi parked around 20 meters away.<br><br>Soon after he parked his taxi, accused Cuison alighted and talked to some persons. When he returned, he informed Juanata that they have to wait because the sellers of marijuana were not around yet. After about five minutes, two persons walked towards the taxi. Accused Cuison went out of the taxi to meet them. And they talked. After which Juanata was introduced by Cuison to the two as a marijuana buyer. Juanata introduced himself as Jojo while the two introduced themselves as Diolo, later identified as Diolo Barita and Denver, later identified as Denver Golsing. Juanata ordered three kilos of marijuana and was told by accused Golsing that a kilo costs <strike>P</strike>800.00. Then accused Barita and Golsing told them to wait as they will get the marijuana.<br><br>After about 5 minutes, accused Golsing and Barita returned. Accused Barita was carrying a transparent plastic bag which he handed to Juanata. After examining the contents of the plastic bag (Exh. G), consisting of three bundles (Exhs. H, I, J), two wrapped in a brown paper (Exhs. H and I) and the third wrapped in a newspaper page (Exh. J), and determining the contents thereof as marijuana, Juanata handed the boodle money to accused Golsing and immediately gave the pre-arranged signal by removing his cap.<br><br>Forthwith, the group of Insp. Pelaez rushed to where the transaction took place, identified themselves as Narcom agents, and arrested accused Barita, Golsing and Cuison. The accused together with the marijuana confiscated and the boodle money recovered were brought to the 14th Narcotics Regional Field Unit at Camp Dangwa. The accused were turned over for investigation while the marijuana was turned over to the evidence custodian after Juanata, Gamit and Sison inscribed and signed their initials on the transparent plastic bag (Exh. G) as well as on the wrappers of the three bundles (Exhs. H, I, J) contained therein to identify the confiscated items and avoid tampering. The Booking Sheet and Arrest Reports (Exhs. B, C, D) of the accused were made."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>On November 6, 1995, the RTC rendered its decision finding all the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violating Section 4, Article II of Republic Act 6425 as amended, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE the Court finds the accused Diolo Barita y Sacpa, Denver Golsing y Delfin and Dionisio Cuison y Fontanilla Guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principals by direct participation and/or by indispensable cooperation of the offense of Violation of Section 4, Article II of Republic Act 6425 as amended by Section 13 of Republic Act 7659 (Sale of 2.8 kilos of marijuana, a prohibited drug) as charged in the Information and hereby sentences each of them to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and to pay a fine of P500,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the proportionate costs.<br><br>The marijuana confiscated from the accuses (Exhs. G, H, I, J) being the subject and instrument of the crime is declared confiscated and forfeited in favor of the state and referred to the Dangerous Drugs Board for immediate destruction.<br><br>The accused Diolo Barita, Denver Golsing and Dionisio Cuison, being detention prisoners are entitled to be credited in the service of their sentence 4/5 of their preventive imprisonment in accordance with Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, this appeal where each of the accused-appellants filed their respective appellant’s briefs.<br><br>In support of his appeal, BARITA denies any participation in the alleged sale of marijuana. He claims that no buy-bust operation was conducted and that the accusation against him was all part of a frame-up. To prove this, BARITA alleges that the prosecution evidence is replete with numerous flaws and glaring inconsistencies considering that:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%"> 1.) </td><td valign="top" width="95%"> <div align="justify">Records (requests for physical examination made by P/Supt.

Considering that the prosecution witnesses made no explanation concerning this, their testimonies should not be given credence. Moreover, the prosecution witnesses attempted to hide the fact of the arrest of the other two who were arrested, SIBAYAN and BINDADAN.

BARITA also claims that the trial court convicted the accused-appellants based on the weakness of their defense and not on the strength of the prosecution’s evidence. Moreover, BARITA questions the identity of the marijuana presented in court considering that the description of the marijuana in the joint affidavit of arrest and the written request for laboratory examination differ and that the chain of custody of the confiscated marijuana leaves was not clearly established. Finally, BARITA alleges that the weight of the alleged marijuana leaves was not duly proved in light of the fact that the forensic chemist admitted that she only tested small quantities of the specimens given to her and that she could not determine whether the whole specimen was marijuana.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellants GOLSING and CUISON raise substantially identical arguments for the reversal of the decision of the RTC in their briefs. Thus, for the purpose of this appeal, we resolve to discuss their arguments jointly.<br><br>We find no merit in the appeal.<br><br>Accused-appellants’ defenses consist of questioning the credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution and "frame-up".<br><br>It is well established in this jurisdiction that the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are accorded great respect unless the court <i>a quo</i> overlooked substantial facts and circumstances which, if considered, would materially affect the result of he case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> We find no reason to depart from this rule in the present case.<br><br>Accused-appellants were arrested by virtue of a buy-bust operation conducted by the 14th Narcotics Regional Command Field Unit. The buy-bust operation was established by prosecution witnesses PO3 Teofilo S. Juanata, Jr. (JUANATA), Rolando Gamit (GAMIT) and Idelfonso Sison (SISON), the apprehending officers, who positively identified BARITA and GOLSING as the two men who sold the marijuana and CUISON (the taxi driver) as the middleman in the sale.

The alleged inconsistencies and/or flaws in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses pointed out by accused-appellants are insufficient to overturn the judgment of conviction against them inasmuch as the testimonies of these witnesses are consistent with each other on material points. Their testimonies sufficiently establish all the facts necessary for the conviction of the accused for what is material and indispensable is the submission of proof that the sale of the illicit drug took place between the seller and the poseur-buyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> At any rate, the inconsistencies pointed out by the accused-appellants are trivial in nature and do not prove that they did not commit the crime charged.<br><br>Furthermore, the testimonies of the three police officers carry with it the presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Accused-appellants failed to convincingly prove that in testifying against them, these witnesses were motivated by reasons other than their duty to curb the sale of prohibited drugs. In the absence of such ill motive, it is presumed that none exists.<br><br>Aside from proving the fact of the sale, the prosecution also successfully established the identity of the packages taken from the accused-appellants in court through the testimonies of JUANATA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> GAMIT,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>SISON<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and Forensic Chemist P/Ins. Alma Margarita Villaseñor (VILLASEÑOR).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In addition, JUANATA’s testimony traces the chain of custody of the packages to the effect that after arresting the accused-appellants, they were brought to Camp Dangwa together with the confiscated marijuana. The marijuana was turned over to the Investigation Division after the apprehending officers properly initialed the bags. Thereafter, a request for laboratory exam was prepared and SPO1 Modesto Carrera delivered the three packages to the PNP Crime Laboratory Service assigned to Camp Dangwa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The said office received the three packages, which were properly identified in court by VILLASEÑOR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>It was also proved that the substance sold by the accused-appellants was approximately 2,800 grams of marijuana. On the witness stand, VILLASEÑOR, who was qualified as an expert witness,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> testified that she subjected samples taken from the three packages to three examinations all of which resulted in a positive finding that the samples she tested were marijuana. She also weighed the packages and established that their total weight came out to 2,810.5 grams.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Her findings were placed in the chemistry report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>, which states that "Qualitative examination conducted on the above-stated specimen gave POSITIVE result to the test for the presence of Marijuana, a prohibited drug."<br><br>We are not persuaded by the claim of accused-appellants that in order for them to be convicted of selling 2,800 grams of marijuana, the whole specimen must be tested considering that Republic Act 7659 imposes a penalty dependent on the amount or the quantity of drugs seized or taken. This Court has ruled that a sample taken from one of the packages is logically presumed to be representative of the entire contents of the package unless proven otherwise by accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Likewise, accused-appellants’ defense of "frame-up" does not convince us of their innocence. Such defense has been invariably viewed by this Court with disfavor for it can easily be concocted but difficult to prove and is a common and standard line of defense in most prosecutions arising from violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> BARITA’s<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and GOLSING’s<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> attempt to prove the "frame-up" by claiming that they were abused by the police officers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> in order to confess to the crime is belied by the testimony of defense witness, Dr. Vladimir Villaseñor (DR. VILLASEÑOR). DR. VILLASEÑOR testified that BARITA, GOLSING and CUISON did not exhibit any signs that they were maltreated after he examined them and that none of them sustained any physical injuries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Similarly, BARITA’s claim that he was arrested by the police in order to extort P200,000.00 from him is not worthy of belief. No evidence aside from his bare assertions was presented to establish such as fact. Neither of his co-accused, GOLSING or CUISON substantiated this allegation. In the absence of clear and convincing evidence to prove the alleged "frame-up" or extortion, such defenses must fail.<br><br>Finally, the fact that the requests for physical examination show that five persons were examined does not discredit the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses that only three persons were arrested at Justice Village. As aptly observed by the trial court:<br><blockquote>"Apparently, only Barita, Golsing and Cuison were <u>caught in the actual act of the selling the marijuana along the road in Justice Village. Sibayan and Bindadan were not caught on the road as they were in their houses.</u> Sibayan and Bindadan were invited and taken into custody afterwards when implicated by Barita when the latter was asked to point to the house of his companions where thy got the marijuana.<br><br>This explains why Dr. Villaseñor examined five persons instead of only the three accused. This also explains why Juanata, Sison and Gamit insisted only three accused as they really arrested only the three accused in the actual act of selling marijuana.<br><br>This is supported by the fact that only Barita, Gosling and Cuison have booking sheet and arrest reports (Exh. B, C and D). There were no booking sheet and arrest reports of Sibayan and Bindadan presented by both the prosecution and the defense.<br><br>If there were any booking sheet and arrest reports of Sibayan and Bindadan, the defense would have demanded their production in court by Subpeona duces tecum. Why did not defendants do so?<br><br>Further, the two requests for physical examination (Exhs. 1 and 2) would show that Barita, Golsing and Cuison were arrested together as they were lumped together in one request for physical examination (Exh. 1 for defense). And that Sibayan and Bindadan were not taken together with the aforesaid 3 accused as the request for their physical examination was in a separate paper (Exh. 2 for defense).<br><br>In any event, a close scrutiny of the physical examination papers signed by Barita, Cuison, Golsing, Sibayan and Bindadan (Exh. 8 to 12) would show that the alleged case against them is ‘suspected drug pushers’ or ‘Violation of Section 4 Article II RA 6425.’<br><br><u>Hence, even assuming 5 persons were arrested for drug pushing, the 3 accused herein, Barita, Golsing and Cuison were definitely among those arrested. So, instead of contradicting or destroying the truth and veracity of the drug pushing charge against the 3 accused, the physical examination papers actually confirm and strengthen the case against them because the same would show that they were really arrested for drug pushing."</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote>Any person who sells or acts as a broker in the sale of marijuana shall be punished with <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death and a fine ranging from five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> if 750 grams or more of marijuana is sold.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In the present case, BARITA, GOLSING and CUISON (as broker) were correctly meted the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and a fine of five hundred thousand pesos (<strike>P</strike>500,000.00) by the RTC considering that the prosecution has clearly established that they delivered and sold 2,800 grams of marijuana to JUANATA, the poseur-buyer.
