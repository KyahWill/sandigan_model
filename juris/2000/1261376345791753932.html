He allegedly left his daughter Arlyn in the house of one Monding Estampador in the same barangay. After three days, he allegedly came back from the ricefield to pick up Arlyn only to be told that she had gone to the nearby barangay of Masimag. According to the accused-appellant, he searched for his daughter for several days to no avail. Finally, on October 20, 1996, he was arrested for the rape of his own daughter, herein complainant Arlyn Llamo.<br><br>In convicting the accused, the trial court chose to give credence to the testimony of 12-year-old Arlyn Llamo. Said court ruled:<br><blockquote>The court is fully convinced that accused Romeo Llamo had indeed raped his own daughter as charged. The court cannot give credence to the bare denial and unsubstantiated testimony of the accused. On the other hand, and despite her apparent low mental endowment, Arlene was able to give to the court a good account of the crime. In her simple but straightforward narration of the incident, the court cannot but be impressed that she bared painful truth. Certainly, it is difficult to believe and (sic) a girl her age would fabricate a shameful act committed by her own father whom she depended upon for all material and emotional needs. Moreover, the crime was witnessed by Dionesio Lora who, according to the accused himself, is his relative. Lora was a credible witness. He had no reason to invent a lie against the accused. Indeed, it was fortunate that Dionesio Lora, with two companions, happened to be out on patrol in the vicinity of the sugarcane field that evening performing the civic duty assigned to him as chairman of the Peace and Order Committee of his Purok. Had he not caught the accused committing the bestial act, Arlene may perhaps continued to suffer in total despair the degradation of her young body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The case is now before us on automatic review.<br><br>In his brief, accused-appellant makes a lone assignment of error, to wit:<br><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF RAPE DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant argues that the claim of witness Dionesio Lora that he caught the former raping his daughter on the evening of October 18, 1996 does not jibe with the medical findings of Dr. Venus Tagarda who examined the private complainant three (3) days after the alleged rape was committed or on October 21, 1996. Dr. Tagarda testified that he found an "old healed laceration" in the hymen of private complainant. According to accused-appellant, if it were true that the alleged rape was committed on October 18, 1996, then the laceration of the private complainant's hymen should still be fresh or not totally healed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant's argument is untenable. Well-settled is the rule that in rape cases, the absence of fresh lacerations in complainant's hymen does not prove that she was not raped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> A freshly broken hymen is not an essential element of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Healed lacerations do not negate rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In one case, this Court ruled that the testimony of the complainant herself as supported by the medical evidence of her non-virgin state is sufficient to sustain the accused's conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The case of <i>People vs. Erardo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> is another case in point. In that case, as with the one at bar, the physician who examined the victim three (3) days after the commission of rape, found old hymenal lacerations. Accused-appellant therein contended that since the medical examination was conducted only three (3) days after the alleged rape, this implies that the hymenal lacerations already existed prior to the date of the rape.<br><br>The Court found this contention unavailing. It ruled that the claim that another person is responsible for the old healed hymenal lacerations prior to the date of the examination does not negate the commission of rape by accused-appellant when this has been demonstrated in vivid detail by complainant herself.<br><br>Similarly, in the case at bar, the defense tried to impute the crime to another person, one Uncle "Totong,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> to whom Arlyn reported the alleged rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> This contention must fall flat in the face of Arlyn's positive assertion that it was her father, the accused-appellant Romeo Llamo who raped her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> A perusal of Arlyn’s testimony as borne by the transcripts will show that she unhesitatingly pointed to her father as the person who deflowered her. Her testimony was simple and straightforward, consistent and unwavering, much like that of an innocent child that Arlyn Llamo was and still is. The trial court's conclusions, therefore, finding that the victim was raped by the accused-appellant, based on the direct and positive assertions of the victim, corroborated by an impartial eyewitness and the physician who examined her, deserve respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant's claim that if he had libidinous designs on his daughter, he need not have brought her to the sugarcane plantation to perpetrate it because "he had every opportunity to do it at home" deserves scant consideration. Based on his own account, accused-appellant declared that when he and Arlyn went to Bismartz, Don Carlos, Bukidnon on October 7, 1996, they stayed at the house of the Estampador spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> As correctly observed by the Solicitor General, accused-appellant's reason for bringing Arlyn to the sugarcane field then becomes obvious--to be away from the prying eyes of Monding Estampador and his wife so that he can perpetrate his dastardly act with absolute ease and impunity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Finally, accused-appellant contends that the trial court failed to consider his candid and unrebutted testimony to the effect that prior to the alleged rape imputed to him, his daughter Arlyn was missing;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> and, that he allegedly spent several days searching for her. Accused-appellant further claims that there was a great possibility that the alleged rape was committed during the time that Arlyn was missing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant's lame denial and alibi cannot prevail over the positive testimony of complainant as well as eyewitness Dionesio Lora and the other prosecution witnesses. Notably, while appellant consistently declared that he searched for his daughter and even reported to the authorities that she was missing, he failed to present any witness to corroborate his claim. As it is, such claim is self-serving and deserves no evidentiary value.<br><br>Denials and alibis unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence are negative and self-serving which deserve no weight in law and cannot be given greater evidentiary weight over the testimonies of credible witnesses who testified on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the trial court observed that "despite her apparent low mental endowment, Arlene was able to give to the court a good account of the crime. In her simple but straightforward narration of the incident, the court cannot but be impressed that she bared painful truth." The trial court, likewise, found Dionesio Lora a credible witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Moreover, it is worthy to note that accused-appellant himself testified that he had no quarrel with any of the prosecution witnesses, two of whom are even his relatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Well-entrenched is the rule that the testimony of a rape victim is credible where she has no motive to testify against the accused;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> more so, when such testimony is simple and straightforward, unshaken by a rigid cross-examination and unflawed by any inconsistency or contradiction. The same must be given full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>This Court has consistently held that when the victim says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been committed, and if her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> This is all the more true where the complainant is the daughter of the accused because it is absurd that a daughter would accuse her own father of this heinous crime had she really not been aggrieved. Given the naivete, age, and low mentality of complainant, it is difficult to believe that she would fabricate a charge of rape against her own father whom she had depended on for all her material and emotional needs.<br><br>In this culture, the father is called "haligi ng tahanan," the pillar of strength upon whom his children look to for moral guidance and material as well as emotional support. The father is the "padre de familia," the head of the family who is morally and socially obligated to protect his family and to ensure their well-being.<br><br>That is why society recoils with disgust and repulsion when confronted with cases of incestuous rapes such as the one at bar. That is why we are outraged when the very person whom society in general and the family in particular, look up to is the one who betrays his family's trust and destroys the moral fibers of society. For, as stated at the outset, the man who violates the chastity of his own daughter, his own flesh and blood is reduced to a level lower than a beast. By inflicting the primitive, bestial act of incestuous lust on his own blood, such a man deserves to forfeit his place in human society.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Cour is morally convinced beyond an iota of doubt that herein accused-appellant committed the dastardly act of rape against his own daughter Arlyn.<br><br>Thus, we find that the trial court correctly imposed the penalty of death upon the accused-appellant considering the latter's relationship to the complainant who was only twelve (12) years old at the time the rape was committed. Four Justices of the Court continue to maintain the unconstitutionality of Republic Act 7659 insofar as it prescribes the death penalty; nevertheless, they submit to the ruling of the majority to the effect that this law is constitutional and that the death penalty can be lawfully imposed in the case at bar.<br><br>Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 11 of Republic Act No.7659 (An Act to Impose the Death Penalty on Certain Heinous Crimes Amending for that Purpose the Revised Penal Code, as Amended, other Special Penal Laws, and for other purposes) provides:<br><br><center>x x x.<br></center><blockquote>Art. 335. <i>When and how rape is committed</i>.--Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li>By using force or intimidation;<br><br></li><li>When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br><br></li><li>When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<br></li></ol></blockquote><blockquote>The crime of rape shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br>When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has become insane, the penalty shall be death.<br><br>When the rape is attempted or frustrated and a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br>When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, a homicide is committed, the penalty shall be death.<br><br><u>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:</u><br></blockquote><blockquote><ol><li><u>When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant. step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.</u><br><br></li><li>When the victim is under the custody of the police or military authorities.<br><br></li><li>When the rape is committed in full view of the husband, parent, any of the children or other relatives within the third degree of consanguinity.<br><br></li><li>When the victim is a religious or a child below seven (7) years old.<br><br></li><li>When the offender knows that he is afflicted with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) disease.<br><br></li><li>When committed by any member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines or the Philippine National Police or any law enforcement agency.<br><br></li><li>When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has suffered permanent physical mutilation.

Under item number one (1), the concurrence of minority of the victim and her relationship to the offender constitutes one special qualifying circumstance; both should be alleged and proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In the instant case, it was specifically alleged in the complaint and information; and, indubitably proved during trial that Arlyn was under eighteen years of age, in fact only twelve years old, when the rape was committed and that the offender, Romeo, was her father. The prosecution offered the Certificate of Live Birth of Arlyn Llamo; and, more significantly Romeo admitted his paternity and Arlyn's minority at the time of the commission of the rape, in open court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Thus, the Court is constrained to affirm the death penalty imposed by the trial court.
