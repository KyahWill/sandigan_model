In the said letter, petitioner was officially informed of his shortage in the amount of P222,327.24 which was stated in the original Report of Cash Examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> but which was adjusted in the amended Report of Cash Examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated June 11, 1986 by crediting him the amount of P2,395.69,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> thereby reducing his accountability to P218,349.99.<br><br>After establishing the amount of the shortage as reflected in Exhibit "D", the OIC Municipal Treasurer submitted his progress report demonstrating further restitution of petitioner's disallowed cash advances and vouchers in the amount of P14,406.00 and P12,303.00 or a total of P26,709.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> thereby further reducing his liability to P191,640.99. While petitioner admitted his accountability to be only P64,538.95, he doubted the accuracy of the said amount for the reason that in his perception, his liability was allegedly between P30,000.00 and P40,000.00 only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Resultantly, petitioner was charged with malversation of public funds in the Information filed with respondent Sandiganbayan, allegedly committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about March 18, 1986, or sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in the municipality of Isulan, Province of Sultan Kudarat, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, a public officer, being then the Municipal Cashier in the above-stated municipality, and as such is accountable and responsible for public funds entrusted to him by reason of his position, with grave abuse of confidence and taking advantage of his public position as such, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously misappropriate, embezzle and take away from said public funds the total amount of Two Hundred Eighteen Thousand Three Hundred Forty-nine Pesos and 99/100 (P218,349.99), Philippine Currency, which is misappropriated and converted to his own personal use, to the damage and prejudice of the government in the aforestated amount.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>Duly arraigned on January 13, 1989, petitioner Nicanor E. Estrella pleaded "Not Guilty" to the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> After the prosecution had rested its case, petitioner filed a "motion to be allowed to file a demurrer to evidence" which was opposed by the prosecution. Respondent court denied the said motion. On May 20, 1995, petitioner again filed a "motion and/or manifestation" for the dismissal of the case for lack of merit. When the incident was heard, petitioner's counsel admitted in open court that the motion and/or manifestation was "in the nature of a demurrer to evidence", hence, pursuant to Sec. 15, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court, petitioner effectively waived his right to present evidence and submitted the case for decision based on the evidence presented by the prosecution. The Sandiganbayan rendered its decision convicting petitioner, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds Nicanor E. Estrella guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of malversation penalized under Par. 4, Article 217, Revised Penal Code.<br><br>There being no modifying circumstances and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the Court imposes on the accused the indeterminate penalty from TWELVE (12) YEARS, FIVE (5) MONTHS and ELEVEN (11) DAYS of reclusion temporal as minimum to EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS, EIGHT (8) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of reclusion temporal as maximum, the fine equal to TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FORTY NINE PESOS AND NINETY-NINE CENTAVOS (P218,349.99), the amount malversed, and perpetual special disqualification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br>Petitioner states five (5) assigned errors, to wit:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">I.</td><td width="90%" align="justify">The Sandiganbayan gravely erred in not holding that the Cash Examination Report dated March 18, 1986 (Exhibit B for the prosecution) on the basis of which petitioner was said to have allegedly incurred shortage in the amount of P218,349.99 is palpably wrong therefore invoking reasonable doubt accused should be freed of criminal culpability.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">II.</td><td align="justify">The Sandiganbayan gravely erred in not clearly and unequivocably holding to prevent double billing or double payment that there are two (2) distinct kinds or classes of money accountability petitioner has to clear or liquidate, namely: 1) Cash collections, from market fees, stall rentals, real estate tax collections, etc. and, 2) Cash Advances, for salaries of municipal employees, gasoline, maintenance of the municipality, etc. in the amount of P247,753.28 and P249,829.25 respectively.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">III.</td><td align="justify">The Sandiganbayan erred in not holding that the collections in the total amount of P247,753.28 has been fully liquidated or turned over to the municipal coffers of Isulan as evidenced by the prosecution's own Exhibits D-6-B to D-6-S, Liquidation Receipts issued by the Municipal Treasurer of Isulan, in favor of the Municipal Cashier.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">IV.</td><td align="justify">The Sandiganbayan erred in not holding that in carrying over and reflecting the collections still as a liability in the Cash Examination Report (Exhibit B) and charging against it paid payrolls, vouchers is totally wrong since this would result in double billing or double entry.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">V.</td><td align="justify">The Sandiganbayan erred in not charging against Cash Advances all paid payrolls, vouchers, cash on hand and as a consequence clear petitioner of such advances.</td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote></blockquote>Otherwise stated, the basic issue is this: Whether or not the Sandiganbayan erred in finding petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of malversation.<br><br>Petitioner vigorously opposes the Report of Cash Examination disclosing that he is still liable for cash collections, averring it is intrinsically wrong. According to him, the audit team erred in crediting paid payrolls/vouchers, cash on hand or allowed cash item against his accountability for cash collections considering that his cash collections were already liquidated. His basis was the prosecution's own evidence, the 18 receipts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> amounting to P235,070.99 issued by the Municipal Treasurer for the liquidation of his daily collections.<br><br>As shown in the Report of Cash Examination, there are two kinds of money obligations that petitioner has with the Municipal Government of Isulan, Sultan Kudarat. They are cash collections and cash advances. A cardinal principle in accounting is that fully paid payrolls and vouchers should be credited to cash advances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the audit team admitted that they credited the fully paid vouchers/payrolls in the amount of P68,692.91 and voucher No. 61 in the amount of P3,977.28 or a total of P72,670.19 against petitioner's cash collections as evidenced by the Report of Cash Examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>, duly signed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> by petitioner. Likewise, the amount of P177,478.78 representing the cash on hand and allowed cash items, produced by petitioner during the audit examination were added to P72,670.19 by the audit team to fully liquidate petitioner's cash collections. It is apparent therefore that petitioner incurred no shortage in his cash collections.<br><br>However, from the testimony of the lone prosecution witness, State Auditor Binangon, it appeared that petitioner was able to liquidate his money obligation only during the time of the audit examination. To quote her testimony:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" align="justify">"PJ Garchitorena</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="10%"></td><td width="90%" align="justify">If Galvez received that amount from the accused why are we going to hold the accused responsible for that amount?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td align="justify">Your Honor these liquidations were only submitted at the time of the audit, so the issuance of the receipts were only made at the time of the audit but the dating correspond to the daily liquidation by Mr. Estrella.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td align="justify">Are you saying that Mr. Galvez did not receive the sum?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td align="justify">Only at the time of the audit.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td align="justify">Why?

Due to the trust he reposed on the Treasurer he did not ask receipt for every remittance that he made. Petitioner further contends that he opted to rest his case in a Demurrer to Evidence considering that during the Pre-trial of the said case, he adverted to the prosecution's evidence, particularly, Exhibits "D-6-B" to "D-6-S", as evidencing the liquidation of his cash collections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>After a careful scrutiny of Exhibits "D-6-B" to "D-6-S", it appeared that the testimony of the lone prosecution witness was more credible than that of petitioner's declaration. The receipts representing the liquidation for cash collections supported the testimony of the prosecution witness. Said receipts were not chronologically issued as demonstrated in the following:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;" valign="top" width="40">Receipt No.</td><td style="font-weight: bold;" width="30">Date Issued</td><td style="font-weight: bold;" width="30">Exhibit No.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5573641</td><td>February 8, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-B"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5976423</td><td>February 8, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-C"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5976424</td><td>February 8, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-D"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852401</td><td>February 12, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-E"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852411.</td><td>February 17, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-F"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852404</td><td>February 18, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-G"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852417</td><td>February 19, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-H"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852413</td><td>February 28, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-I"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852405</td><td>February 28, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-J"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852406</td><td>February 28, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-K"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852410</td><td>February 28, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-L"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852414</td><td>March 17, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-M"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852402</td><td>February 17, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-N"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852403</td><td>March 19, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-O"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852415</td><td>March 19, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-P"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852409</td><td>February 20, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-Q"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852412</td><td>February 28, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-R"</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">5852416</td><td>March 18, 1986</td><td>Exhibits "D-6-S"</td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote>As shown in the above mentioned list, Receipt No. 5852402 was issued on February 17, 1986 while Receipt No. 5852403 was issued on March 19, 1986. The irregularity in the issuance of the receipts evidencing remittances of cash collections arose when succeeding numbers of Receipt No. 5852403 were issued ahead of the same. If it is true that petitioner really made remittances of his cash collections at the end of the day, the irregularity would not have happened. It was for this reason that Municipal Treasurer Jose S. Galvez of Isulan, Sultan Kudarat was also prosecuted before the respondent court for violation of PD 1445, Section 89.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>As stated earlier and based on the Report of Cash Examination, the fully paid payrolls and vouchers were credited to petitioner's accountability for cash collection. The prosecution witness, as member of the audit team, explained their procedure or reason in this manner, thus:<blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" align="justify">PJ GARCHITORENA <br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"></td><td align="justify">Madam, I am not asking you what he did.

The petitioner included the fully paid payrolls and vouchers in liquidating his cash collections. In the same way, the Municipal Treasurer receipted the liquidation based on the sum total of cash and the paid payrolls and vouchers. If we are to conform with the opinion of the petitioner to the effect that the fully paid payrolls and vouchers totalling P72,670.19 should be credited to his cash advances, it would simply mean that the same amount should likewise be deducted from his cash collections. In the same way that if we are to credit the amount of P177,478.78<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> from his cash advances, the amount of P175,083.09 should be deducted from his collections, hence, petitioner's shortage would still be the same. As pointed out by the respondent court, and we quote:<br><blockquote>"If, as contended, the turn over or liquidation of the daily collections of P247,753.28 was applied to the accused's accountability for cash advances, then his accountability for daily collections would remain outstanding while his accountability for cash advances would be reduced <i>pro tanto</i> by the same amount of P247,753.28. Consequently, whether one or the other was done, the result would be the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code holds liable for malversation a public officer who shall appropriate public funds or property for which he is accountable, or shall take or misappropriate or shall consent, or through abandonment or negligence, shall permit any other person to take such public funds or property. Furthermore, the failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public funds or property with which he is chargeable, upon demand by any duly authorized officer, shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that he has put such missing funds or property to personal uses.<br><br>The elements of malversation of public funds are (a) the offender is a public officer, (b) he had custody or control of the funds or property by reason of the duties of his office, (c) these funds or property were public funds or property for which he was accountable, and (d) that he appropriated, took, misappropriated or consented, or through abandonment or negligence, permitted another person to take them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Anent the last element, we have held that to justify conviction for malversation of public funds, the prosecution has only to prove that the accused received public funds or property and that he could not account for them or did not have them in his possession and could not give a reasonable excuse for the disappearance of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> An accountable public officer may be convicted of malversation even if there is no direct evidence of misappropriation and the only evidence is that there is a shortage in his accounts which he has not been able to explain satisfactorily.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Petitioner was not able to produce the missing amount of P191,640.99; and neither was he able to explain his failure to produce that amount.
