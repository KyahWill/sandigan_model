  <p>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The facts, as found by the Court of Appeals, are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“The subject of the case at bench is a parcel of land known as Lot 
No. 1478-B of the Escalante Cadastre, located at Ugtongan, Escalante, 
Negros Occidental, containing an area of 11.1278 hectares. </p>
  <p>"Lot No. 1478-B was originally owned by the spouses Eusebio Mahilum
 and Dionisia Blase.  On February 13, 1912, Eusebio and Dionisia sold 
the land to their son Simeon Mahilum, who took possession thereof and 
enjoyed the fruits of the land in concept of owner, openly, publicly and
 uninterruptedly except in 1972.  He had the land declared in his name 
for taxation purposes. </p>
  <p>"On March 10, 1931, the Court of First Instance of Negros 
Occidental acting as a cadastral court rendered judgment adjudicating 
the land to the spouses Simeon Mahilum and Adriana Pabalate. </p>
  <p>"In 1932, Simeon Mahilum sold one-half (1/2) of the property to his brother Maximo. </p>
  <p>"Sometime thereafter, Simeon Mahilum sold 500 square meters of the 
property to Fausto Moncada and another 500 sq. m., more or less to 
Ugtongan Elementary School. </p>
  <p>"On July 2, 1969, at the instance of his sister Rosario Mahilum, 
Simeon, who is an illiterate, affixed his thumbmark on a document 
denominated as an Extra-Judicial Partition of Inherited Real Estates<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 on the misrepresentation of Rosario Faustina that Eusebio Mahilum's 
heirs would partition three other lots and did not include Simeon's Lot 
1478-B.
  </p>
  <p>"On July 11, 1970, an inexistent title to the land in the names of 
Sps. Eusebio Mahilum and Dionisia Blase was reconstituted on the 
strength of the technical description of the land and an affidavit 
executed by Rosario Mahilum, and OCT No. RO-1076 was issued. </p>
  <p>"The defendants-heirs of Eusebio Mahilum then partitioned the 
property among themselves to the exclusion of Simeon Mahilum and on 
October 26, 1970, the following titles<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> were issued:  </p>
  <p>“Lot 1478-B-1 TCT#60557 – Joaquin Mahilum <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B-3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60559 – Rosario Mahilum <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B-4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60560 – Rosario Mahilum having bought Quirino Mahilum’s share <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B-5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60561 – Fausto Moncada <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B-6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60562 – Eusebio Mahilum and Dionisia Blase <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B-7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60563 – Teresita Lumayno having bought Albina Mahilum’s share <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B-8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60564 – Felipe Mahilum <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B-9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60565 – Heirs of Juan Mahilum <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B-10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60566 – Santiago Mahilum ½ and Maximo Mahilum ½
  </p>
  <p>"Later, TCT NO. T-60564 was cancelled and TCT No. T-69709 was 
issued to defendant spouses Nena Arriola Adolfo and Francisco Adolfo who
 bought Felipe Mahilum's share; likewise TCT No. T-60561 in the name of 
Fausto Moncada was cancelled when he sold his lot to spouses Ricardo 
Mahilum and Elena Bacuado. </p>
  <p>"Generosa Cawit Lumayno and Braulio Lumayno later purchased Rosario Mahilum's share and were substituted as party defendants. </p>
  <p>"In 1972 Simeon Mahilum discovered that the inexistent title was reconstituted and the property partitioned. </p>
  <p>"On March 13, 1973, Simeon Mahilum and the heirs of Maximo Mahilum 
filed a complaint for annulment of title with the then Court of First 
Instance of Negros Occidental, alleging that the reconstituted OCT No. 
RO-1076 was null and void since there was no prior title to be 
reconsituted in the name of Eusebio Mahilum and Dionisia Blase;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 that Simeon Mahilum was the rightful owner of Lot 1478-B, the same 
having been adjudicated to him by the CFI at the cadastral proceedings 
in 1931; that Simeon's thumbmarks on the Extra-Judicial Partition were 
obtained thru fraudulent misrepresentations.  Consequently, all titles 
that flowed therefrom are null and void.
  </p>
  <p>"In their answer, defendants contend that the property in question 
which was owned by Eusebio Mahilum and Dionisia Blase never truly 
conveyed to Simeon Mahilum. When cadastral proceedings in Escalante, 
Negros Occidental, went underway, Eusebio Mahilum entrusted to his 
eldest son, Simeon the task of handling all matters pertaining to the 
titling of the land inasmuch as he was too old to withstand the rigors 
attendant to the case, traveling to Bacolod to find a lawyer and to 
attend the hearings and take care of the other pertinent aspects of the 
registration proceedings.  They assert their right of dominion over 
their respective portions of the property by reason of inheritance from 
their deceased parents/grandparents, Eusebio and Dionisia Mahilum. </p>
  <p>"For their part, the other defendants profess to be purchasers in 
good faith not aware of any flaw in their predecessors' titles. </p>
  <p>"A second amended complaint was filed by plaintiffs minus the heirs
 of Maximo Mahilum as "they are no longer interested because they have 
no more father and they have no money to spend for the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  </p>
  <p>"After trial, the lower court rendered the assailed decision, the dispositive portion of which reads: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Court hereby: </p>
    <p>"1. Orders the dismissal of this case; </p>
    <p>"2. Orders the plaintiffs to pay jointly and severally defendants the sum of P5,000.00 as attorney's fees; </p>
    <p>"3. Orders respondents Francisco Mahilum and Rosela Mahilum to 
forthwith surrender possession of the lands owned by defendants Generosa
 Lumayno and Teresita Lumayno; </p>
    <p>“4. Finds the respondent spouses Francisco Mahilum and Rosela 
Mahilum guilty of contempt of court and sentences them to an 
imprisonment of TEN (10) days; </p>
    <p>" 5. Orders the continued confinement of respondents beyond ten 
(10) days should they still fail or refuse to restore said 
defendants-petitioners to the possession of their lands. </p>
    <p>" SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
      </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>On May 17, 1991, respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
</p><p>After the parties had submitted their respective briefs, on 
September 14, 1995, the Court of Appeals promulgated its decision 
reversing the appealed decision, the decretal part of which is quoted in
 the opening paragraph of this decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
</p><p>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
</p><p>The issues raised are (1) whether Simeon Mahilum acquired the 
subject property by purchase from his parents, or by inheritance, and 
(2) whether the titles issued as a result of partition of subject lot 
were void.
</p><p>The issues raised are factual.  We may not review the appellate court's findings of fact in an appeal <em>via</em> certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 The findings of fact of the Court of Appeals supported by substantial 
evidence are conclusive and binding on the parties and are not 
reviewable by this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> unless the case falls under any of the exceptions to the rule,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> such as diverse factual findings of the lower courts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> or the findings are entirely grounded on speculations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Petitioner failed to prove that the case falls within the exceptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
</p><p>Thus, the question of whether the subject parcel of land, Lot 
1478-B was sold by the original owners, Eusebio Mahilum and Dionisia 
Blase to their son Simeon is a factual issue. Nonetheless, the cadastral
 court in its decision rendered in 1931 declared the land to be owned by
 Simeon.  The ruling was uncontested until 1973, when Simeon filed the 
complaint for annulment of reconstituted title in the name of Eusebio 
Mahilum and Dionisia Blase.
</p><p>We agree with the Court of Appeals that it was much too late for petitioners' claim.  Laches had set in.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
</p><p> In like manner, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the 
partition of the same lot was fraudulent.  Rosario knew there was no 
other way to obtain the partition of the subject property than having 
her brother Simeon sign a deed of partition, making the latter believe 
that the deed pertained to the three other lots.  The scheme was simple 
enough considering that Simeon was illiterate.  The law, however, 
requires that in case one of the parties to a contract is unable to read
 and fraud is alleged, the person enforcing the contract must show that 
the terms thereof have been fully explained to the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
</p><p> We are not persuaded that Rosario clearly and fully explained 
the contents of the deed of partition to her brother Simeon.  
Petitioners' allegations are negated by the fact that Simeon not only 
strongly opposed the survey of the land in 1970 but also filed a 
complaint for annulment of reconstituted title in 1973. Consent, having 
been obtained by fraud, the deed entered into could be annulled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Hence, if the deed was null, the reconsituted title and all transfer titles arising therefrom were also void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
</p><p><strong>IN VIEW WHEREOF</strong>, the Court DENIES the petition for review, hereby AFFIRMING the decision of the Court of Appeals.
</p><p>No costs.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.
