				<BR><STRONG>MENDOZA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case involves the appointment and transfer of career executive service officers (CESOs).&nbsp; More specifically, it concerns the "appointment" of respondent Josefina G. Bacal, who holds the rank of CESO III, to the position of Chief Public Attorney in the Public Attorney's Office, which has a CES Rank Level I, and her subsequent transfer, made without her consent, to the Office of the Regional Director of the PAO.<br><br>In its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> rendered on March 25, 1999, the Court of Appeals declared respondent Josefina G. Bacal entitled to the position of Chief Public Attorney in the Public Attorney's Office.&nbsp; Petitioners moved for a reconsideration, but their motion was denied by the appeals court in its resolution dated July 22, 1999.&nbsp; Hence this petition for review on certiorari.&nbsp; Petitioners contend that the transfer of respondent to the Office of the Regional Director of the PAO is appropriate considering her rank as CESO III.<br><br>The background of this case is as follows:<br><br>Respondent Josefina G. Bacal passed the Career Executive Service Examinations in 1989.&nbsp; On July 28, 1994, she was conferred CES eligibility and appointed Regional Director of the Public Attorney's Office.&nbsp; On January 5, 1995, she was appointed by then President Fidel V. Ramos to the rank of CESO III.&nbsp; On November 5, 1997, she was designated by the Secretary of Justice as Acting Chief Public Attorney.&nbsp; On February 5, 1998, her appointment was confirmed by President Ramos so that, on February 20, 1998, she took her oath and assumed office.<br><br>On July 1, 1998, petitioner Carina J. Demaisip was appointed "chief public defender" by President Joseph Estrada.&nbsp; Apparently because the position was held by respondent, another appointment paper was issued by the President on July 6, 1998 designating petitioner Demaisip as "chief public defender (formerly chief public attorney), PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE vice ATTY. JOSEFINA G. BACAL, effective July 1, 1998."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> On the other hand, respondent was appointed "Regional Director, Public Defender's Office" by the President.<br><br>On July 7, 1998, petitioner Demaisip took her oath of office. President Estrada then issued a memorandum, dated July 10, 1998, to the personnel of the "Public Defender's Office" announcing the appointment of petitioner Demaisip as "CHIEF PUBLIC DEFENDER." Petitioner Secretary of Justice was notified of the appointments of petitioner Demaisip and respondent Bacal on July 15, 1998.<br><br>On July 17, 1998, respondent filed a petition for quo warranto questioning her replacement as Chief Public Attorney.&nbsp; The petition, which was filed directly with this Court, was dismissed without prejudice to its refiling in the Court of Appeals. Accordingly, respondent brought her case in the Court of Appeals which, on March 25, 1999, ruled in her favor, finding her to be lawfully entitled to the Office of Chief Public Attorney.<br><br>Petitioners seek the reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals on the following grounds Â¾<br><br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT RESPONDENT JOSEFINA G.

This brings us to the main issue in this appeal.<br><br><center><br>II.&nbsp; Merits of the Case</center><br><br>In holding that respondent's transfer amounted to a removal without cause, the Court of Appeals said:<br><br><blockquote>. . .&nbsp; Her appointment as Regional Director was in effect a removal in the guise of transfer, to repeat, without her consent.&nbsp; Having been validly appointed Chief Public Defender by the President on February 8, 1998, would naturally entitle her to security of tenure since on the basis of the appointment, she was appointed, not merely assigned, to a particular station. Her involuntary transfer, through appointment, to that of a mere Regional Director, did not either conform to the rules on the constitutional protection of security of tenure.&nbsp; Above all, her supposed appointment as a Regional Director is not only temporary but is on the other hand permanent wherein she lost her position as Chief Public Attorney, or her connection with the previous position being severed.<br><br>. .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .<br><br>In the case of the petitioner, there is certainly a diminution in duties and responsibilities when she was downgraded through the July 6, 1998 appointment, involuntarily made, from that of Chief Public Attorney to a mere Regional Director.&nbsp; To repeat, the rank equivalent to a Bureau Director is Rank III while that of a mere Bureau Regional Director is Rank V.&nbsp; Diminution in duties and responsibilities, certainly becomes apparent and then in the matter of salary, the basic salary of a Chief Public Attorney together with all the perks, would amount to P575,199.00.&nbsp; In the case of a Regional Director, his basic salary together with all the perks, would only amount to P341,479.96.&nbsp; Admittedly, when a CESO is assigned or made to occupy a position with a lower salary grade, he shall supposedly continue to be paid his salary that attaches to his CES rank.&nbsp; It cannot, on the other hand, be denied that the moment a non-CESO is appointed to a CES position, he shall receive, at the same time, the salary of his CES position. There is merit in the petitioner's argument that allowing the Regional Director to receive continuously the salary rate of Chief Public Attorney in effect would amount to an illegal consequence since the disbursement of public funds, as budgeted, provides funding for only one Chief Public Attorney.&nbsp; The dilemma arises when both the petitioner and respondent Demaisip would be claiming the salary of a Chief Public Attorney.&nbsp; There is no pretension either in the Brief of the public respondents that there has been a supplemental budget for the petitioner, now downgraded to a mere Regional Director, to be receiving continuously the salary scale of a Chief Public Attorney.<br><br>. .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .<br><br>Changing a CESO, Rank III, with a non-CESO eligible nor a CESO defies the recruitment, selection and appointment process of the Career Executive Service. As a matter of fact, as a rule (<u>1997 Revised Edition</u>, <u>Handbook, Career Executive Service</u>), the appointment to most positions in the CES is supposed to be made by the President only from the list of CES eligibles, but recommended by the CES Board. Admittedly, an incumbent of a CES position may qualify for appointment to a CES rank, only upon the confirming of a CES Eligibility and compliance with the other requirements being prescribed by the Board (<u>Ibid. p. 5</u>).&nbsp; Precisely, the CES was created pursuant to PD No. 1 (adopting the Integrated Reorganizational Plan, dated September 24, 1972), if only to form a continuing pool of well-selected and development-oriented career administrators who shall provide competent and faithful service (<u>Ibid. p. 2</u>). We cannot see this from that of the petitioner then being replaced by a non-CESO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><br>The appealed decision will not bear analysis.<br><br><i>First</i>. What should be emphasized in this case is that respondent Josefina G. Bacal is a CESO III and that the position of Regional Director of the PAO, to which she was transferred, corresponds to her CES Rank Level III and Salary Grade 28.&nbsp; This was her position before her "appointment" on February 5, 1998 to the position of Chief Public Attorney of the PAO, which requires a CES Rank Level I for appointment thereto.&nbsp; Respondent Bacal therefore has no ground to complain.&nbsp; She may have been considered for promotion to Rank I to make her appointment as Chief Public Attorney permanent.&nbsp; The fact, however, is that this did not materialize as petitioner Carina J. Demaisip was appointed in her place.&nbsp; If respondent was paid a salary equivalent to Salary Grade 30 while she was holding that office, it was only because, under the law, if a CESO is assigned to a position with a higher salary grade than that corresponding to his/her rank, he/she will be allowed the salary of the CES position.<br><br>As respondent does not have the rank appropriate for the position of Chief Public Attorney, her appointment to that position cannot be considered permanent, and she can claim no security of tenure in respect of that position.&nbsp; As held in <i>Achacoso v. Macaraig</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It is settled that a permanent appointment can be issued only "to a person who meets all the requirements for the position to which he is being appointed, including the appropriate eligibility prescribed." Achacoso did not. At best, therefore, his appointment could be regarded only as temporary.&nbsp; And being so, it could be withdrawn at will by the appointing authority and "at a moment's notice," conformably to established jurisprudence. . . .<br><br>The mere fact that a position belongs to the Career Service does not automatically confer security of tenure on its occupant even if he does not possess the required qualifications.&nbsp; Such right will have to depend on the nature of his appointment, which in turn depends on his eligibility or lack of it.&nbsp; A person who does not have the requisite qualifications for the position cannot be appointed to it in the first place or, only as an exception to the rule, may be appointed to it merely in an acting capacity in the absence of appropriate eligibles.&nbsp; The appointment extended to him cannot be regarded as permanent even if it may be so designated. . . .</blockquote><br>It is contended, however, that respondent is qualified for the position of Chief Public Attorney because this position has a CES Rank Level III, while that of Regional Director, Public Attorney's Office, has a CES Rank Level V.&nbsp; This is not so.&nbsp; The position of Chief Public Attorney has a CES Rank Level I and a Salary Grade 30, while that of Regional Director of the PAO has a CES Rank Level III and a Salary Grade 28.&nbsp; This is shown by the following:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><ol><li>Certification, dated April 6, 1999, issued by the Secretary of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), which states that "the position of the head of Public Attorney's Office (PAO) is classified as Chief Public Attorney at Salary Grade 30"&nbsp; (Annex A of Annex M, Petition).<br><br></li><li>Certification, dated April 15, 1999, issued by Elmor D. Juridico, then Executive Director of the CES Board, which states that "the Rank equivalent to the position of Chief Public Attorney and Regional Public Attorney are CESO Rank I and CESO Rank III respectively" (Annex B of Annex M, Petition); and<br><br></li><li>Certification, dated July 8, 1998, previously issued to respondent Bacal by then Executive Director Juridico of the CES Board, stating that the position of Chief Public Attorney has a CES rank equivalent of Rank I. (vide Annex C of Annex M, Petition). The certification reads:<br><br>This is to certify that Atty. JOSEFINA G. BACAL, Chief Public Attorney, Public Attorney's Office was conferred CES Eligibility on July 28, 1994 per Board Resolution No. 94-4620 and was appointed Career Executive Service Officer (CESO) Rank III by then President Fidel V. Ramos on January 5, 1995.&nbsp; She is yet to fulfill the requirements for an adjustment of her CES rank (from CES Rank III to Rank I) to a level equivalent to her present position.<br><br>This certification is issued upon the request of Atty. Bacal for whatever purpose it may serve best.</li></ol><br><i>Second.&nbsp; </i>The Court of Appeals held that respondent Bacal had acquired security of tenure as Chief Public Attorney by the mere fact of her appointment to that position.&nbsp; This is likewise the point of the dissent of Justice Gonzaga-Reyes who contends that a CES eligibility is all that a person needs in order to acquire security of tenure in any position embraced in the Career Executive service; that a CESO rank is only necessary to differentiate a CESO's general managerial duties/responsibilities, personal qualifications, and demonstrated competence; and that no other CES examination is required for appointment to a higher rank.<br><br>Appointments, assignments, reassignments, and transfers in the Career Executive Service are based on rank.&nbsp; On this point, the Integrated Reorganization Plan cannot be any clearer.&nbsp; It provides:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">c.</div></td> <td width="95%"><p align="JUSTIFY"><i>Appointment</i>.

Conferment of CES eligibility is done by the Board through a formal Board Resolution after an evaluation of the examinee's performance in the four stages of the CES eligibility examinations.<br><br>. . . .<br><br><b>Appointment to CES Rank</b><br><br>Upon conferment of a CES eligibility and compliance with the other requirements prescribed by the Board, <u>an incumbent of a CES position may qualify for appointment to a CES rank.&nbsp; Appointment to a CES rank is made by the President upon the recommendation of the Board.&nbsp; This process completes the official's membership in the CES and most importantly, confers on him security of tenure in the CES</u>.<br><br>There are six (6) ranks in the CES ranking structure.&nbsp; The highest rank is that of a Career Executive Service Officer I (CESO I), while the lowest is that of CESO VI.<br><br>The appropriate CESO rank to which a CES eligible may be appointed depends on two major qualification criteria, namely:&nbsp; (1) level of managerial responsibility; and, (2) performance.<br><br>Performance is determined by the official's performance rating obtained in the annual CESPES.&nbsp; On the other hand, managerial responsibility is based on the level of the general duties and responsibilities which an eligible is performing, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><b><b>Levels of Duties and</b><br> <b>Responsibilities</b></b></div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="CENTER"><b>Rank Equivalent</b></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>if level of managerial responsibilities <br> are comparable to that of an Under- <br> secretary</td> <td><div align="CENTER">I</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><p>if comparable to that of an Assistant <br> Secretary</p> </td> <td><div align="CENTER">II</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><p>if comparable to that of a Bureau <br> Director or a Department Regional<br> Director</p> </td> <td><div align="CENTER">III</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><p>if comparable to that of an Assistant <br> Bureau Director, Department<br> Assistant Regional Director or<br> Department Service Chief</p> </td> <td><div align="CENTER">IV</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><p>if comparable to that of a Bureau <br> Regional Director</p> </td> <td><div align="CENTER">V</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><p>if comparable to that of a Bureau <br> Assistant Regional Director</p> </td> <td><div align="CENTER">VI</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>As a general rule, a CES eligible will be recommended for appointment to the rank equivalent of the level of his managerial responsibility if his performance rating is <i>Satisfactory</i> or higher.&nbsp; If the performance rating is <i>Outstanding</i>, he will be recommended one rank higher than his level of managerial responsibility.</blockquote><br>Security of tenure in the career executive service is thus acquired with respect to rank and not to position.&nbsp; The guarantee of security of tenure to members of the CES does not extend to the particular positions to which they may be appointed â a concept which is applicable only to first and second-level employees in the civil service â but to the rank to which they are appointed by the President. Accordingly, respondent did not acquire security of tenure by the mere fact that she was appointed to the higher position of Chief Public Attorney since she was not subsequently appointed to the rank of CESO I based on her performance in that position as required by the rules of the CES Board.<br><br>Indeed, to contend, as does the dissent of Justice Gonzaga-Reyes, that a CES eligibility was all that was required to make her appointment to the position of Chief Public Attorney permanent would give rise to an anomalous situation.&nbsp; Following such theory, even if respondent is not appointed CESO I because her performance as Chief Public Attorney does not warrant her appointment to such higher rank, she cannot be transferred to any other office to which her rank (CESO III) qualifies her.&nbsp; This theory of the dissent, <i>i.e.</i>, that a CES eligibility gives the appointee security of tenure â not the ruling in this case that it is appointment to the appropriate rank that confers security of tenure â is what will undermine the Career Executive Service.<br><br><i>Third</i>. Within the Career Executive Service, personnel can be shifted from one office or position to another without violation of their right to security of tenure because their status and salaries are based on their ranks and not on their jobs.&nbsp; To understand this, it is necessary to consider the reason for the creation of the Career Executive Service.<br><br>R.A. No. 5435,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> as amended by R.A. Nos. 6076, 6172, and 6175, created a commission charged with the specific function of reorganizing the government "to promote simplicity, economy, and efficiency" in its operations. The result was the preparation of the Integrated Reorganization Plan which was adopted and declared part of the law of the land by P.D. No. 1 on September 24, 1972.&nbsp; A major feature of the Integrated Reorganization Plan was the creation of the Career Executive Service whose justification was explained by the Commission on Reorganization, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The present Civil Service system is not geared to meet the executive manpower needs of the government.&nbsp; The filling of higher administrative positions is often based on considerations other than merit and demonstrated competence.&nbsp; The area of promotion is currently confined to the person or persons "next-in-rank" in the agency.&nbsp; <u>Moreover, personnel classification and compensation are uniformly based on concepts and procedures which are suited to positions in the lower levels but not to managerial posts in the higher levels</u>.&nbsp; To fill this crucial gap, it is recommended that a Career Executive Service be established.&nbsp; This group of senior administrators shall be carefully selected on the basis of high qualifications and competence.&nbsp; Skilled in both techniques and processes of management, these career executives will act as catalysts for administrative efficiency and as agents of administrative innovation.<br><br><u>The status and salary of the career executives will be based on their rank, and not on the job that they occupy at any given time . . . .&nbsp; In this sense, the rank status of the Career Executive Service is similar to that of the commissioned officers in the Armed Forces or members of the Foreign Service.&nbsp; Unlike these latter organizations, however, entrance to the Career Executive Service will not be generally at an early age in a relatively junior level but at a senior management level.</u><br><br>. .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .<br><br><u>The rank classification in the Service will allow for mobility or flexibility of assignments such that the government could utilize the services or special talents of these career executives wherever they are most needed or will likely create the greatest impact.&nbsp; This feature is especially relevant in a developing country which cannot afford to have its scarce executive manpower pegged to particular positions.</u></blockquote><br>Mobility and flexibility in the assignment of personnel, the better to cope with the exigencies of public service, is thus the distinguishing feature of the Career Executive Service.&nbsp; To attain this objective, the Integrated Reorganization Plan provides:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><blockquote>e.&nbsp; <i>Assignments, Reassignments and Transferees</i>. . . .<br><br>Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, members of the Career Executive Service may be reassigned or transferred from one position to another and from one department, bureau or office to another; <i>provided </i>that such reassignment or transfer is made in the interest of public service and involves no reduction in rank or salary; <i>provided</i>, further, that no member shall be reassigned or transferred oftener than every two years; and <i>provided</i>, <i>furthermore</i>, that if the officer concerned believes that his reassignment or transfer is not justified, he may appeal his case to the President.</blockquote><br>The implementing rules and regulations of the CES Board provide:<br><br><blockquote><i><u>Salary of Career Executive Service Officers</u></i>.&nbsp; A CESO is compensated according to his CES rank and not on the basis of the CES position he occupies.&nbsp; However, if a CESO is assigned to a CES position with a higher salary grade than that of his CES rank, he is allowed to receive the salary of the CES position.<br><br>Should he be assigned or made to occupy a CES position with a lower salary grade, he shall continue to be paid the salary attached to his CES rank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners are, therefore, right in arguing that respondent, "as a CESO, can be reassigned from one CES position to another and from one department, bureau or office to another.&nbsp; Further, respondent, as a CESO, can even be assigned or made to occupy a CES position with a lower salary grade.&nbsp; In the instant case, respondent, who holds a CES Rank III, was correctly and properly appointed by the appointing authority to the position of Regional Director, a position which has a corresponding CES Rank Level III."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Indeed, even in the other branches of the civil service, the rule is that, unless an employee is appointed to a particular office or station, he can claim no security of tenure in respect of any office.&nbsp; This rule has been applied to such appointments as Director III or Director IV or Attorney IV or V in the Civil Service Commission since the appointments are not to specified offices but to particular ranks;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Election Registrars;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Election Officers, also in the Commission on Elections;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and Revenue District Officers in the Bureau of Internal Revenue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Reiterating the principle in <i>Sta. Maria v. Lopez</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> this Court said:<br><br><blockquote>. . . [T]he rule that outlaws unconsented transfers as&nbsp; anathema to security of tenure applies only to an officer who is appointed â not merely assigned â to a particular station. Such a rule does not proscribe a transfer carried out under a specific statute that empowers the head of an agency to periodically reassign the employees and officers in order to improve the service of the agency.&nbsp; The use of approved techniques or methods in personnel management to harness the abilities of employees to promote optimum public service cannot be objected to. . . .</blockquote><br>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that respondent's appointment to the position of Chief Public Attorney was merely temporary and that, consequently, her subsequent transfer to the position of Regional Director of the same office, which corresponds to her CESO rank, cannot be considered a demotion, much less a violation of the security of tenure guarantee of the Constitution.<br><br><i>Fourth.&nbsp; </i>On the other hand, Justice Puno makes much of the fact that petitioner Carina J. Demaisip is not a CES eligible.&nbsp; Suffice it to say the law allows in exceptional cases the appointment of non-CES eligibles provided that the appointees subsequently pass the CES Examinations.&nbsp; Thus Part III, Chap. I, Art. IV, par. 5(c) of the Integrated Reorganization Plan provides that <br><br><blockquote>the President may, in exceptional cases, appoint any person who is not a Career Executive Service eligible; provided that such appointee shall subsequently take the required Career Executive Service examination and that he shall not be promoted to a higher class until he qualified in such examination.</blockquote><br>For the same reason that the temporary appointment of respondent Josefina G. Bacal as Chief Public Attorney is valid under this provision of the law despite the fact that she does not hold the rank of CESO I, so is the appointment to the same position of petitioner Carina J. Demaisip. The question in this case is not the validity of the appointment to such position but whether the appointee acquires security of tenure even if he does not possess the requisite rank.&nbsp; There is no claim that petitioner Demaisip has a right to remain in the position of Chief Public Attorney permanently.<br><br>On the other hand, as respondent herself does not have the requisite qualification for the position of Chief Public Attorney, she cannot raise the lack of qualification of petitioner.&nbsp; As held in <i>Carillo v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> "in a quo warranto proceeding the person suing must show that he has a clear right to the office allegedly held unlawfully by another.

I posit the thesis, however, that respondent Bacal has <b>at least a temporary right</b> to stay as PAO Chief <b>until</b> she is replaced by a qualified appointee properly appointed.&nbsp; It is granted that the Constitution vests in the President the power to appoint and that the exercise of the powers involves a wide swath of discretion.&nbsp; Be that as it may, <b>the Constitution eschews arbitrariness and it never intended that the power to appoint should be exercised with grave abuse of discretion.</b> The exercise of the power has a set limit, the limit that it should not be exercised to violate any of the various norms spelled out in the Constitution.&nbsp; In the case at bar, it should not infringe the merit and fitness principle which is the heart of the civil service system.&nbsp; The appointment of the petitioner clearly violates the ideal of meritocracy.&nbsp; We cannot turn a blind eye to the anomaly of this appointment on the technical ground that in a <b><i>quo warranto</i></b> proceeding, we should not focus on the lack of qualification or disqualification of the petitioner Demaisip.&nbsp; <b>It is time we tone this doctrine in appropriate cases where its strict application will perpetuate to a high office a patently unqualified appointee at the expense of many who are highly qualified for the position.</b><br><br>I further respectfully submit that the <b>bigger issue</b> in the case at bar concerns the <b>constitutional aspect</b> of a <b><i>quo warranto</i></b> proceeding --- the need to check the exercise of the power of appointments so that it will not wreak havoc to the Career Executive Service. The court should uphold the rule of law by striking down and all arbitrary exercise of power.&nbsp; It should promote the reign of meritocracy by <b>establishing the civil service as a politically neutral zone</b>.&nbsp; It should encourage careerism and discourage the political pole vaulting of patently unqualified appointees.&nbsp; Towards these ends, the Court should not allow petitioner's appointment to prevail on the thin and technical ground that in <b><i>quo</i> <i>warranto</i> </b>suit, her lack of qualification is irrelevant. Such ruling makes law a meaningless abstraction, technically neat but an intolerable anomaly on the effective workings of the civil service system.<br><br>Lest we forget, the office at the vortex of the controversy at bar is the Public Assistance Office.&nbsp; This is the lead office of the State in its effort to give effective legal assistance to the poor and powerless of our people.&nbsp; We can take judicial notice of the fact that it handles most of the death penalty cases involving the indigents in our society. Needless to state, the PAO is a vital cog in our system of equal justice and it cannot be allowed to fail in its noble mission.&nbsp; It can only succeed if its head office is the best of the available qualified eligibles.<br><br><b>Prescinding from these premises</b>, I respectfully submit that while petitioner Bacal has no <b>permanent</b> right as Chief Public Defender, she has, nevertheless, a <b>temporary</b> right to stay as Chief Public Defender, until a qualified appointee is named by the President to the position.&nbsp; The appointment of petitioner Demaisip has absolutely no color of validity and cannot be given any effect on technical grounds.<br><br>I so vote.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><sup> </sup>It was then known as citizens Legal Assistance Office (CLAO).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><sup> </sup>P. 22, Performance and Evaluation.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><sup> </sup>195 SCRA 235, 239.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><sup> </sup>EO 292, Revised Administrative Code of 1987 on the Civil Service Commission.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><sup> </sup>Republic Act 2260 (also known as the Civil Service Act of 1959), as amended by Republic Act 6040.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><sup> </sup>Bernas' The 1973 Philippine Constitution, 1974 ed., Article XII (B), section 1, p. 523, citing the February 18, 1972 Session of the Constitutional Convention.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Birmingham v.

Bacal passed the Career Executive Service Examination in 1989.&nbsp; On July 28, 1994, she was conferred CES eligibility, and was appointed Regional Director of the Public Attorney's Office on January 5, 1995. She was appointed by then President Fidel Ramos to the rank of CESO III.&nbsp; On November 5, 1997, she was designated by the Secretary of Justice as Acting Chief Public Attorney. On February 5, 1998, her appointment was confirmed by President Ramos, and on February 20, 1998, she took her oath and assumed office.&nbsp; On July 1, 1998, petitioner Carina J. Demaisip was appointed "Chief Public Defender" (formerly Chief Public Attorney) by President Joseph Estrada. On July 6, 1998, petitioner was designated "Chief Public Defender" vice Atty. Josefina C. Bacal effective July 1, 1998.&nbsp; On July 7, 1998 petitioner took her oath of office.&nbsp; On the other hand, respondent Bacal was appointed Regional Director, Public Defender's Office.<br><br>At the time of her appointment by then President Ramos to the position of Chief Public Attorney, respondent Atty. Josefina Bacal possessed the requisite CES eligibility for the position.&nbsp; She had passed the examinations for the Career Executive Service, and had the appropriate CES eligibility for the third level of the career civil service.&nbsp; She had been conferred CESO Rank III.&nbsp; Although the position of Chief Public Attorney carries CESO Rank I (Chief of Office), she was eligible for appointment thereto without the need of passing another CES examination, as indeed there is only one appropriate eligibility, i.e.&nbsp; CESO eligibility, for any of the six levels in the Career Executive Service.&nbsp; By law, no civil service examination is required for promotion to a higher position within the same level<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> as no other examination for promotion from one level to a higher level in the career executive service has been prescribed.&nbsp; Thus, the Executive Director of the Career Executive Service Board categorically stated in a certification dated April 15, 1999 as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"This is to certify that the Rank equivalent to the position of Chief Public Attorney and Regional Public Attorney are CESO Rank I and CESO Rank III respectively.&nbsp; However, a Career Executive Service Officer (CESO) or a CES eligible need not be a CESO I or a CESO III to qualify for appointment to the position of Chief Public Attorney and Regional Public Attorney respectively.<br><br>x x x.<br><br></blockquote><div style="margin-left: 360px;">ELMOR D. JURIDICO, CESO II<br>Executive Director "</div><br><br>Similarly in a letter-reply addressed to respondent Bacal dated August 4, 1998 regarding respondent's "predicament" relative to her appointment as Chief Public Attorney, the Chairman of the Career Executive Service Board, Chairman Corazon Alma G.

Bacal:<br><br>xxx<br><br>Please be informed that the CES Board's policy on the security of tenure of Career Executive Service Officers (CESOs) and CES eligibles remains the same. That is, CESOs and eligibles like you are entitled to security of tenure because you have met all the requirements for the position to which you were appointed, including the appropriate eligibility required.&nbsp; This policy of the Board is based on solid constitutional and statutory grounds. Consequently, you and the other CESOs and eligibles can only be removed except for a valid cause and after due notice and hearing.&nbsp; And the phrase `for a valid cause' in connection with removals of public officers has acquired a well-defined concept.&nbsp; `It means for reason which the law and sound public policy recognized as sufficient warrant for removal, that is, legal cause and not merely causes which the appointing power in the exercise of discretion may deem sufficient. (De los Santos vs. Mallare, 87 Phil. 280).<br><br>In the event, therefore, that you are removed or ousted without cause, due notice and hearing, the same shall constitute a violation of your constitutional and statutory rights to security of tenure which rightly calls for remedy or redress in the proper body or court of law.<br><br></blockquote><div style="margin-left: 360px;">Very truly yours,<br><br>CORAZON ALMA G. DE LEON<br>Chairman"</div><br><br>Again in a letter dated May 17, 1999 Atty. Bacal was assured by the CESB Executive Director that a CES eligible who is a Regional Director and who is subsequently promoted by the president, to a higher position (that of an Undersecretary) in the CES, becomes permanent in the latter position, viz:<br><br><blockquote>"Please be informed that under existing law and rules, a <u>Career Executive Service Eligibility is a requirement&nbsp; for a permanent appointment to any Career Executive Service position including those of Undersecretary, Assistant Secretary, Bureau Director, Assistant Bureau Director, Regional Director, Assistant Regional Director and Department Service Chief</u>.&nbsp; Please refer to the Supreme Court Decisions on Achacoso vs. Macaraig, et al G.&nbsp; R. No. 93023 and Pangilinan vs. Maglaya, et al G.R. No. 104216 for an elucidation on this issue.&nbsp; Thus, <u>a CES eligible&nbsp; appointed to the position of Regional Director becomes permanent to the position more so if he was subsequently appointed&nbsp; to a rank in the CES by the President</u>.&nbsp; The same eligible can also qualify for promotion to higher CES positions and if subsequently extended appointment to a higher CES position by the appointing authority, <u>the CES eligible becomes permanent in that position.&nbsp; It goes without saying therefore, that a CES eligible who is a Regional Director and who subsequently gets appointed Undersecretary by the President&nbsp; becomes permanent in the position of Undersecretary</u>."</blockquote><br>It is accordingly difficult to understand why, despite the absence of any change in the pertinent law, the Career Executive Service Board should renege on its previous official position that respondent has no legal claim to security of tenure as Chief Public Attorney.&nbsp; The position it now espouses is that security of tenure is conferred only if the appointee has been conferred the rank corresponding to the CES position he is holding; otherwise stated, respondent Bacal who holds a CESO Rank III does not enjoy security of tenure in the position of Chief Public Attorney as she does not possess CESO Rank I.<br><br>The position is not tenable and distorts the concept of professionalization and careerism that animated the creation of the career executive service by extending the scope of the career civil service system to the highest managerial levels in the government bureaucracy.&nbsp; The creation of the Career Executive Service was not meant to disturb or disrupt the well-established concept in the Philippine Civil Service that extends tenurial protection to any person holding a permanent appointment in the career civil service who meets all the requirements for the position to which he is appointed, including the appropriate eligibility required.<br><br>The Qualification Standards for the Career Executive Service prescribes the following requirements for the position of Chief Public Attorney.:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">Education&nbsp;&nbsp; -Bachelor of Laws<br>Experience- 3 years of supervisory experience<br>Training-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None required<br>Eligibility- Career Service Executive Eligibility (CSEE)/Career Executive Service (CES)<br></div><br>Notably CES Rank is not one of the prescribed requirements for the position.<br><br>CES eligibility, which is conferred by the CESO Board, is a requisite for appointment to CES positions.&nbsp; On the other hand, CESO Rank is granted by the President based on two criteria:&nbsp; (1) level of managerial responsibility, e.g. Rank I for Chief Public Attorney, Rank III for Regional Director; and (2) performance. Accordingly, a CESO promoted to a higher CES position may obtain the CESO Rank of the higher position only after an evaluation is made of his performance on the job by the CESB, which is the agency that recommends to the President the conferment of the higher CESO rank to the qualified incumbent thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The evaluation of the performance of a CES eligible in a given position is as a rule required to obtain an appointment to rank equivalent to the level of his managerial responsibility.&nbsp; Thus, respondent Bacal was conferred CESO Rank III after eleven years as PAO Regional Public Attorney (Regional Director).&nbsp; As above pointed out, being a CESO eligible, she possessed the necessary and appropriate eligibility for the position of Chief Public Attorney, a position to which she was regularly appointed by the President on February 5, 1998. Had she not been inordinately replaced, she would be eligible for appointment to CESO Rank I after evaluation of her performance in office.<br><br>The proposition that appointment to a position in the Career Executive Service requires that the appointee has the corresponding rank level of the position appears to be anchored on the following provision of the Integrated Reorganization Plan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%">"c.</td> <td width="95%"><p align="JUSTIFY"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Appointment.</span> Appointment to appropriate classes in the Career Executive Service shall be made by the President from a list of career executive eligibles recommended by the Board. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Such appointments shall be made on the basis of rank</span>; provided that appointments to the higher ranks which qualify the incumbents to assignments as undersecretary and heads of bureaus and offices and equivalent positions shall be with the confirmation of the Commission on Appointments.

No reference is made nor is it intended to equate security of tenure in the Career Executive Service to security of tenure in the position.<br><br>The following features of the Career Executive Service also illustrate the distinction between membership in the CES and appointment to a CES position:<br><br>1)&nbsp; Membership in the Career Executive Service is acquired upon appointment to an appropriate class in the Career Executive Service; the law does not require appointment&nbsp; to a CES position to acquire membership in the CES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> When the law states that appointments to the CES shall be made on the basis of rank, it refers to appointments to the CES rank not appointments to CES position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>2)&nbsp; The salary and&nbsp; status of membership of the CESO shall be based on rank "not on the position occupied at any given time."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>3)&nbsp; A CESO who obtains an Outstanding performance rating may qualify for promotion to the next higher rank but still remain in his position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>4)&nbsp; A CESO may be reassigned or transferred from one position to another, in the interest of the service; such an assignment shall not result in reduction in rank or compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>It is submitted that while appointment to rank confers security of tenure in the CES, it is a permanent appointment to a CES position for which one has the appropriate eligibility which confers on the appointee security of tenure in the said position.&nbsp; A contrary conclusion would disrupt the concept of careerism that is contemplated to pervade the career executive service when this was conceived and put into place in the Integrated Reorganization Plan.&nbsp; Respondent Bacal acquired security of tenure in the CES when she was appointed CESO Rank III.&nbsp; However, she acquired her security of tenure as Chief Public Attorney in 1998 when, possessing the requisite CESO eligibility, she was extended by the President a permanent appointment (not a temporary appointment or temporary designation) as Chief Public Attorney.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><sup> </sup>PD No. 807, as amended, otherwise known as the Civil Service Decree of the Philippines; E.O.
