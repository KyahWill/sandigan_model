Sedillo filed a motion for postponement as he [would be] appearing in a case in Manila. Atty. Ybanez manifested that on February 26, 1995 Atty. Sedillo was in Dumaguete and further that this case ha[d] been delayed by the failure of the [petitioners] to complete the presentation of their evidence. The Court then ordered the case submitted for decision for the THIRD TIME.<br></div><br>March 16, 1995<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">The Court issued an order reconsidering the February 27, 1995 order upon motion of Atty. Sedillo and set the case for the [petitioners] for June 16, 1995 with a STERN WARNING TO THE [PETITIONERS].<br></div><br>June 16, 1995<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">The hearing set for [this day] was cancelled as the Judge [was] on leave and reset to September 8, 1995.<br></div><br>September 8, 1995<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">The [petitioners'] counsel did not appear. Hearing [was] reset to November 16, 1995.<br></div><br>November 16, 1995<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">The [petitioners'] counsel did not appear. Neither did his client. The hearing [was] reset to February 13, 1996.<br></div><br>February 9, 1996<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">The [petitioners'] counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel.<br></div><br>February 12, 1996<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">The Court issued an order granting the withdrawal of the [petitioners'] counsel. The [petitioners were] directed to immediately engage the services of a new counsel. This notice was received personally by the wife of [Petitioner] Mauro Edrial, Jr.<br></div><br>February 13, 1996<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">The Court issued an order setting the case [for] April 26, 1996. This order was received by the wife of the [Petitioner] Mauro Edrial, Jr.<br></div><br>April 26, 1996<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">There was no appearance from the [petitioners]. Hence, the case was submitted for decision for the FOURTH TIME.<br></div><br>July 8, 1996<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">Atty. Sedillo filed a motion to reopen the case and in effect reentered his appearance.<br></div><br>August 20, 1996<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">Private respondents thru counsel filed opposition to the motion of the [petitioners].<br></div><br>September 6, 1996<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">The Hon. Judge issued an order denying the motion to reopen hereby affirming the April 26, 1996 order submitting the case for decision.<br></div><br>September 11, 1996<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">[Petitioners] filed a motion for reconsideration.<br></div><br>October 2, 1996<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">Court denied the motion for reconsideration.<br></div><br>October 23, 1996<br><br><div style="margin-left: 80px;">Private respondents received a copy of the Petition for Certiorari."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></div></div> </blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></u><br></div><br>The CA dismissed petitioners' appeal because, in issuing the questioned Orders, the trial judge committed no grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction. In giving petitioners more than ample time to complete their presentation of evidence and in granting their Motions for Postponement, the judge was accommodating them more than they actually deserved.<br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Issues</b></u><br></div><br>Petitioners submit that the CA erred in affirming the twin Orders of the Dumaguete City RTC, Branch 39. They contend that a reversal thereof would have allowed them to complete their presentation of evidence. Hence, by affirming those Orders, the CA allegedly violated their right to due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>This Court's Ruling</b></u><br></div><br>The Petition is without merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Main Issue</b></u><br><u><b><i>Due Process and Reopening of Trial</i></b></u><br></div><br>Counsel for petitioners alleges that the addresses of his clients on file in his law firm were incorrect; hence, the notices and other forms of communication he had sent to them were not received. He allegedly discovered this fact only after he had filed his withdrawal as their counsel. He also argues that the denial of the Motion to Reopen Trial was "plainly capricious and oppressive" because private respondents were equally guilty of delay and procrastination. Finally, he maintains that allowing petitioners to present their remaining evidence would be "in the interest of substantial due process and humane justice."<br><br>Respondents disagree, reasoning that the trial court thrice reconsidered its Order to submit the case for decision; that is, petitioners were given several opportunities to present their evidence, but they squandered them. Petitioners, they further point out, were intentionally seeking to delay the resolution of the case because they were in physical possession of the land in dispute.<br><br>Counsel's excuses are unsatisfactory and unacceptable. The CA ruled that petitioners were given "more than enough time" to complete their presentation of evidence. Respondents rested their case as early as September 1992. Petitioners' lawyer, at his own request, was allowed to start presenting evidence only on April 12, 1993. From that day until April 26, 1996 or for a period of three years, counsel presented only two witnesses. The trial judge was in fact liberal in granting petitioners' Motions for Postponement. But enough was enough; when they attempted to delay the trial some more, the trial judge finally and correctly refused to go along.<br><br>True, respondents also asked for continuances, but petitioners were ultimately to blame for the inexcusable delay. The case was submitted for decision three times -- on December 11, 1990, October 30, 1992, and February 27, 1995 - but petitioners and/or their counsel did not appear in court each time. After having failed to take advantage of opportunities to ventilate their claims below, parties may no longer be accorded the same chances, in the absence of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, as in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The Court frowns on lawyers' practice of repeatedly seeking extensions of time to file pleadings and thereafter simply letting the period lapse without submitting any pleading or even any explanation or manifestation of their failure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; The same principle applies more forcefully to motions for continuance. Postponement is not a matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion. Actions thereon will not be disturbed by appellate courts in the absence of a clear or manifest abuse of discretion, resulting in a denial of substantial justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; We concur with the CA that there is no such denial in this case.<br><br>It is highly suspicious how the counsel for petitioners continued to represent his clients effectively for several years despite allegedly having lost their correct addresses. It was definitely his duty to know the correct ones. Indeed, it was too late for him to do so after he had withdrawn as their counsel. According to him, after April 16, 1996, he sent an office employee to verify the whereabouts of Mauro Edrial Jr. The inquiry yielded the information that Mauro actually resided in San Jose, Negros Oriental, and that Susan Edrial Valenzuela resided in Gomez St., Dumaguete City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; He should have undertaken the search before withdrawing as counsel. Further, notice might not have been received by petitioners themselves, but that did not excuse counsel's failure to appear during trials.<br><br>Counsel for petitioners further avers that he had difficulty in presenting Atty. Roque Bonganciso because of the latter's prior commitments which conflicted with the scheduled trial dates. The last witness was Mauro Edrial Jr., but counsel had the wrong address on file. He should just have adjusted the order of presentation of witnesses and called Edrial Jr. later. Such move could have prevented the postponement. Besides, finding an available date in his calendar would not have taken Atty. Bonganciso three years.<br><br>The Code of Professional Responsibility requires that lawyers, after obtaining extensions of time to file pleadings, memoranda or briefs, shall not let the period lapse without submitting the same or offering an explanation for their failure to do so (Rule 12.03).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, they should avoid any action that would unduly delay a case, impede the execution of a judgment or misuse court processes (Rule 12.04).<br><br>For the benefit of the bench and bar, worth repeating is the CA's reminder to petitioners' counsel of his duty to his client and to the court:<br><blockquote>"Being an officer of the court a lawyer is part of the machinery in the administration of justice. Like the court itself, he is an instrument to advance its ends-the speedy, efficient, impartial, correct and inexpensive adjudication of cases and the prompt satisfaction of final judgments. A lawyer should not only help attain these objectives but should likewise avoid any unethical or improper practices that impede, obstruct or prevent their realization, charged as he is with the primary task of assisting in the speedy and efficient administration of justice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Petition is <b><i>DENIED</i></b> and the assailed Decision and Resolution <b><i>AFFIRMED</i></b>.
