				<BR><STRONG>PURISIMA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> assailing the Decision of the 
Commission on Audit (COA) of November 12, 1996, which affirmed the Special Audit 
Office (SAO) Report dated April 21, 1994 covering the Fishery Sector Program 
Fund of the Department of Agriculture (DAR) Regional Office No. V, Pili, 
Camarines Sur for the period 1991-1992.</p>
<p align="justify">Records show that on April 26, 1993, COA directed an audit of 
the Fishery Sector Program Fund of the DAR Regional Office No. V, in Pili, 
Camarines Sur, specifically transactions relating to: (a) the purchase of 
equipment; (b) training and catering services; and (c) accounts payable.</p>
<p align="justify">As a result of the audit, the special audit team submitted its 
report (SAO Report), replete with adverse findings and observations against the 
DAR Regional Office No. V, viz:</p>
<ol><ol><li>Transactions amounting to P3,247,494 relating to the purchase of equipment, 
training and catering services, construction of patrol boats, floating guard 
house and fish sanctuary markers were not subjected to bidding and were not 
covered with proper contracts and purchase orders, in violation of COA Circular 
No. 78-84, to the damage and prejudice of the government;<br>
</li><li>Charges to accounts payable were not founded on valid claims in violation of 
Section 46 of PD No. 1177;<br>
</li><li>Purchases of base and portable radio communications equipment were made 
without securing first the purchasers' and dealers' permits from the National 
Telecommunications Commission (NTC) in violation of Act No. 3846, otherwise 
known as the "Radio Control Law";<br>
</li><li>Honoraria for the first semester were paid without an appropriation for the 
purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </li></ol></ol>
<p align="justify">On the basis of the aforesaid special audit team's findings and 
observations, the SAO Report, among others, recommended the refund of the 
disallowed/excessive disbursements and the filing of administrative cases 
against the officers and/or employees involved in the said irregularities.</p>
<p align="justify">On August 4, 1993, the herein petitioner Fe D. Laysa, then 
Regional Director of the DAR Regional Field Unit No. V, submitted her Comment or 
"justification for the audit findings"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
as follows:</p>
<ol><ol><li>Their invitation to prospective bidders of motorcycles were disseminated not 
through publication in a newspaper of general publication but through postings 
in conspicuous places and thru personal delivery to known dealers in the 
locality;<br>
</li><li>Sealed canvass was the only means resorted to procure scuba diving 
equipments because according to Mr. Francisco Ombao, this type of equipment is 
not obtainable in the locality and no supplier in Manila is willing to 
participate in a formal bidding if it will be held in the Regional Office;<br>
</li><li>VHS Editing Recorder was procured thru direct purchase from a distributor in 
Manila but this was done after ensuring that no other outlet for said equipment 
was selling at a lower price;<br>
</li><li>Trainings for Scuba Diving, with package deals for instructions, board and 
lodging, transportation and other facilities were procured thru negotiated 
contracts with one Atty. Jose Yap because no other outfit in Bicol has the 
expertise and capability to undertake this specialized training. </li></ol><blockquote>
<p align="justify">DAR Regional Office No. V and Atty. Jose Yap agreed to a 25% 
increase in the training fee because there was a dramatic increase of prices 
from 1991 to 1992.</p>
<p align="justify">While there were no available funds from regular releases for 
these trainings, the above expenditures were charged against FSP funds because 
they support the FSP objectives;</p></blockquote><ol start="5"><li>Management, through oversight, failed to secure the required tax receipts 
and requests sufficient time for this;<br>
</li><li>Two cross visits (batch of scuba diving training) which were part of CY 1992 
Work and Financial Plan were carried out in February and May of 1993 due to 
volume of work and weather conditions;<br>
</li><li>Their failure to secure purchase permit from NTC for communications 
equipment as well as to check on the dealer's permit to purchase was admittedly 
an oversight, being their first time to procure this equipment;<br>
</li><li>Their payment of honoraria was made in the belief that the submitted Work 
and Financial Plan for 1991 which provided personal services (honoraria) of 
P636,000.00 would be approved like in the previous year, 1990;<br>
</li><li>Their awarding the purchase contract to Annabel General Merchandise, which 
quoted P18,000.00 and P9,000.00 for base and portable radios, respectively, 
instead of to AMU Import/Export which quoted P15,200.00 and P8,000.00, 
respectively, was most advantageous to the government because immediate 
available repair, warranty and registration of the units were also included in 
the offer. </li></ol></ol>
<p align="justify">On April 21, 1994, after the Review Panel found the SAO Report 
to be in order, COA Chairman Celso D. Gangan directed the Director of COA, 
Regional Office No. V, to bring the proper charges before the Office of the 
Ombudsman against the petitioner and other officials and employees involved in 
the irregularities.</p>
<p align="justify">The petitioner appealed the findings of the special audit team 
to the COA <i>en banc </i>but in its decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated November 12, 1996, COA denied the 
appeal.</p>
<p align="justify">Unable to accept the said decision, petitioner brought the 
present petition for <i>certiorari</i>, imputing grave abuse of discretion on 
the part of COA. Petitioner, in the main, asserts that the findings and 
recommendations of the SAO were made without fully appreciating the Fishery 
Sector Program which is a special program relating to research and development. 
Bureaucratic adherence to prescribed rules and procedures stifles research and 
development activities; petitioner pointed out. According to petitioner, since 
the Fishery Sector Program is funded, not by the regular or general 
appropriations but by the Asian Development Bank and the Overseas Economic 
Cooperative Fund of Japan, the generally stringent rules governing 
appropriations should not be strictly construed in the operation of subject 
program.</p>
<p align="justify">In its Comment, the Office of the Solicitor General agreed with 
COA that the petitioner and other officials and employees had violated COA rules 
and regulations.</p>
<p align="justify">The petition is without merit.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner is well aware of the agency's non-compliance with 
pertinent COA rules and regulations on the bidding process, submission of 
certain documents to support claims for disbursements, and charging of accounts 
on valid claims, reasoning out that after all, the government's best interest 
did not suffer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">The responsibility for state audit is vested by the 
Constitution in the COA.</p>
<p align="justify">Under the Constitution, the COA "xxx shall have the power, 
authority, and duty to examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to the 
revenue and receipts of, and expenditures or uses of funds and property, owned 
or held in trust by, or pertaining to, the Government, or any of its 
subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities xxx".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> In the exercise of its broad powers, 
particularly its auditing functions, the COA is guided by certain principles and 
state policies to assure that "government funds shall be managed, expended, 
utilized in accordance with law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or 
wastage xxx with a view to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the 
operations of government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">As can be gleaned from the foregoing provisions of the 
Constitution, verification of whether officials of the agency properly 
discharged their fiscal responsibilities and whether the agency complied with 
internal auditing controls in the collection and/or disbursement of government 
funds, are parts of the functions of the COA. Given the COA findings in this 
case which were substantiated by evidence, the COA correctly decided to file the 
charges against the petitioner and the other officers and employees involved, 
leaving the ultimate resolution of the question (whether or not their handling 
of government funds fell short of pertinent COA rules and regulations) to be 
made after trial.</p>
<p align="justify">Findings of quasi-judicial agencies, such as the COA, which 
have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is confined to specific 
matters are generally accorded not only respect but at times even finality if 
such findings are supported by substantial evidence, as in the case at bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In this era of clogged court dockets, the 
need for specialized administrative boards or commissions with special 
knowledge, experience and capability to hear and determine promptly disputes on 
technical questions or essentially factual matters, subject to judicial review 
in case of grave abuse of discretion, is imperative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the COA is 
<strong>AFFIRMED</strong> and the Petition <strong>DISMISSED</strong> for lack 
of merit. No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p>
