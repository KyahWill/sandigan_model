				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 262, Pasig City, finding 
accused-appellant Arnel C. Montano guilty of violation of Art. III, §15 
of Republic Act No. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act), as amended by Republic 
Act No. 7659, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and to pay a fine of P2 million and the costs of the suit.
<p>The information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> against accused-appellant alleged -
</p><blockquote>
  <p>That in the afternoon of (the) 22nd of January, 1996, in the  
municipality of Taguig, Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused did then 
and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and knowingly sell, 
distribute and/or deliver 229.7 grams of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride 
otherwise known as ‘shabu’ which is a regulated drug, without the 
corresponding license and/or legal authority to sell, distribute and/or 
deliver the same. </p>
  <p>CONTRARY TO LAW.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When arraigned, the accused-appellant pleaded not guilty, whereupon he was tried.
</p><p>The presentation of the testimony of the first witness for the 
prosecution, Forensic Chemist Demelen Dela Cruz of the National Bureau 
of Investigation (NBI), was dispensed with, as the defense entered into a
 stipulation with the prosecution concerning the following facts:  (1) 
that 229.7 grams of a white crystalline substance was submitted to the 
NBI Forensic Chemistry Division for laboratory examination to determine 
if it was methamphetamine hydrochloride or <em>shabu</em>; (2) that a 
forensic examination was performed by the witness on the substance 
submitted; (3) that the substance was found to be positive for <em>shabu</em>;
 and (4) that the substance was the same 229.7-gram substance submitted 
for forensic examination by NBI Agent Timoteo Rejano.  Accused-appellant
 denied, however, that the <em>shabu</em> had been seized from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
</p><p>The prosecution presented evidence showing that the shabu had been seized from accused-appellant, thus:
</p><p>Sometime in the second week of January 1996, NBI Agent Timoteo 
Rejano received a tip from a female confidential informant that the 
accused-appellant was engaged in the distribution of <em>shabu</em> in Taguig, Metro Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 Agent Rejano and the informant, therefore, conducted a “test-buy” 
operation on January 18, 1996 at accused-appellant’s residence at 104 N.
 P. Cruz St., Barangay Ususan, Taguig, Metro Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 When they arrived at the place, the female informant went inside the 
gate as Agent Rejano stayed behind.  After thirty minutes, the informant
 asked Agent Rejano to come in, and the two then proceeded along a 
roofed alley with concrete walls on both sides.  They entered a second 
gate where a store with a long bench was located. A woman, whom Agent 
Rejano came to know was accused-appellant’s mother, tended the store.
</p><p>At the gate, the informant introduced Agent Rejano to accused-appellant as a Chinese drug-user and a big-time buyer of <em>shabu</em>.
  While Agent Rejano waited at the store, the informant went with 
accused-appellant in front of the latter’s house about 15 meters away 
and transacted business with him on the porch.  Agent Rejano saw them 
sniffing something while seated on the metal chairs.  After thirty 
minutes, the informant returned to Agent Rejano and secretly told him 
that she already had the stuff from the accused-appellant.  Thereafter, 
they left and returned to the NBI office in Taft Avenue, Manila.
</p><p>The stuff was submitted for forensic examination and was found to be <em>shabu</em>.
  After Agent Rejano reported to his superiors what transpired during 
the operation, he was directed to conduct with the informant another 
“test-buy” operation on the accused-appellant in order to gain the 
latter’s trust and confidence.  The plan was eventually to make him sell
 a larger amount of <em>shabu</em> to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
</p><p>On January 19, 1996, Agent Rejano, together with the female 
informant and another intelligence agent, returned to 
accused-appellant’s house to purchase more <em>shabu</em>.  Again, it 
was the informant who transacted with accused-appellant while Agent 
Rejano and the intelligence agent stayed at the store.  After half an 
hour, the informant returned and discreetly told them that she had with 
her the stuff from accused-appellant and that the latter was willing to 
deliver 200 grams of <em>shabu</em> on January 22, 1996.  Then, they left.
</p><p>Upon arriving at the NBI, Agent Rejano made a request<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 for the forensic examination of the crystalline substance purchased 
from accused-appellant.  Forensic Chemist II Emilia Andeo-Rosaldes 
issued a certification,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated January 19, 1996, stating that the substance submitted was <em>shabu</em>. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
</p><p>On January 22, 1996, a team of NBI agents proceeded to Taguig, 
Metro Manila aboard three vehicles.  About 100 meters away from the 
target area, the buy-bust team, composed of Agent Reynaldo Esmeralda, 
Agent Regner Peneza, and the informant, took a tricycle to 
accused-appellant’s house, while the rest of the NBI operatives waited 
for a signal at a distance.  Accused-appellant and his mother met the 
buy-bust operatives.  The informant informed accused-appellant that they
 already had the money and were ready to buy 250 grams of <em>shabu</em>.
  Accused-appellant then led the group to an alley towards the kitchen 
outside his house.  The informant introduced Agent Peneza as her husband
 and Agent Esmeralda as the bodyguard of her employer, the Japanese 
financier.  Accused-appellant’s mother then served the group some 
snacks, consisting of leche flan and softdrinks.  Accused-appellant left
 them and, after a few minutes, returned with Hector Tinga.  
Accused-appellant told the group to follow him.  Accused-appellant’s 
mother was left behind.  They passed through a dark narrow alley leading
 to an enclosed space at the back of accused-appellant’s house.  Tinga 
brought out two plastic packets of a white crystalline substance and 
handed them to accused-appellant.  Accused-appellant gave the packets to
 the informant who tested the contents by burning a small amount using 
an improvised tooter.  When the informant confirmed that the substance 
was <em>shabu</em>, accused-appellant asked for the money. 
</p><p>Agent Esmeralda handed accused-appellant bundles of P100 bills.  
While the accused-appellant and Tinga were counting the money, Agents 
Esmeralda and Peneza announced the arrest and handcuffed the two.  
Esmeralda radioed the other members of the NBI team to proceed to the 
area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> After the team 
secured the house, Agent Auralyn Pascual served the search warrant to 
the mother of accused-appellant.  With two barangay officials as 
witnesses, the NBI agents recovered from the search, besides the two 
packets of white crystalline substance, a tooter, a burner, aluminum 
foil, a pair of scissors, and a match.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 The items were listed in the inventory  of  articles seized which was 
signed by Agent Pascual and attested to by the barangay officials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Agent Pascual gave the mother of the accused-appellant a copy of the inventory.
</p><p>The NBI team brought accused-appellant and Tinga to NBI Taft 
where they were booked and their photographs and fingerprints taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The two packets of white crystalline substance,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> marked as AM-1 and AM-2 respectively, and the improvised tooter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>seized during the search were forwarded to the forensic chemistry laboratory for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
 Accused-appellant and Tinga were brought to the Department of Justice 
for inquest and then detained at the NBI Taft.  The report on the 
forensic examination showed that the crystalline substance, weighing 
229.7 grams, was <em>shabu</em>.  The tooter, however, was negative for <em>shabu</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Later, the Department of Justice, through Prosecutor Ferdinand Abesamis, issued a Resolution, dated February 1, 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 recommending the filing of an information only against 
accused-appellant on account of the insufficiency of evidence against 
Tinga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
</p><p>Accused-appellant denied that there were “test-buy” operations 
conducted on him on January 18 and 19, 1996.  His version of the 
incident is as follows:
</p><p>In the afternoon of January 18, 1996, while he was cleaning the 
passenger jeepney he was driving, a woman arrived and introduced herself
 as “Solly.” As she was looking for the residence of Hector Tinga, 
accused-appellant pointed to her the direction to the said house.  After
 a few minutes, Solly returned and told him that the gate was closed.  
She requested him to fetch Tinga.  Accused-appellant said he acceded to 
the request and that, after a while, Tinga came to meet the stranger.  
According to accused-appellant, Solly told him that she and Tinga met in
  a nightclub in Ermita, and that she worked for a Japanese employer.  
Accused-appellant said that he got interested, because he wanted to work
 abroad, and the stranger might be able to help him get employment 
overseas.
</p><p>Accused-appellant testified that, on January 22, 1996 at around 2
 p.m., Solly returned to his house with her husband and the bodyguard of
 her Japanese employer.  They proceeded directly to the “dirty” kitchen 
of his house without knocking at the unlocked gate.  Accused-appellant 
said he did not inquire into the purpose of their visit because he 
assumed it was about his application for overseas employment.  They 
allegedly assured him that they would help him.  He introduced them to 
his mother, who served them leche flan and softdrinks.  Then, his mother
 left to fetch his children and his nephew from school.  After eating, 
Solly and her companions moved to the garden, also inside the compound. 
 Solly requested him to call Tinga.  He was about to go, but he saw 
Tinga coming.  Accused-appellant assumed that they agreed to meet at his
 house.  After greeting Tinga and telling him that Solly was waiting for
 him in the garden, he went inside the kitchen to wash the dishes used 
by his visitors.  Tinga and the visitors went inside his house and 
joined his children in watching television.  Accused-appellant asked 
Tinga if he could help him in securing an overseas job and Tinga told 
him he would.  He claims that he went out to get an electric fan for his
 visitors but, when he returned, he saw them already in the storage room
 at the back of his house.  He stated that he saw Tinga handing two bags
 of <em>shabu</em> to the “bodyguard,” who turned out to be NBI Agent 
Esmeralda.  According to accused-appellant, he told Tinga and the 
visitors that he might be implicated in the transaction, and that his 
mother would get angry because she did not know that they were 
transacting <em>shabu</em> in his house.  They assured him, however, 
that they would take care he did not get involved in the deal.  Then, he
 saw Solly’s “husband,” whom he later learned was Agent Peneza, handing 
over a bag of money to Tinga.  It was then that the NBI agents 
identified themselves and ordered him and Tinga, at gun point, to lie 
face down on the floor.  He and Tinga were handcuffed.  He allegedly 
said, “<em>Iyan na nga ba ang sinasabi ko tapos ito pa ang mapapala ko, kawawa naman ako</em>.”  Accused-appellant claimed he was kicked and was told that he would be “taken care of.”
</p><p>Aurora Montano, accused-appellant’s mother, arrived and found her
 grandchildren running around.  One of them told her that 
accused-appellant was handcuffed and lying face down on the floor.  When
 his mother saw him and the NBI agents, she exclaimed, “<em>Bakit ganito ang nangyari?  Akala ko ba tutulungan ninyo ang anak ko, ngayon ito pa ang mapapala namin</em>.”
 The NBI agents repeated to his mother that they would “take care of 
him.” Then, another group, presumably with the NBI team, arrived and 
took pictures of them.  Accused-appellant and Tinga were brought out of 
the storage room.  Still another group arrived with the barangay 
chairman, showed his mother a search warrant, and conducted a search on 
the house.  According to him, nothing was recovered from his house.  He 
and Tinga were taken to the NBI office for fingerprinting.  Again, he 
was told that he would be “taken care of.” He and Tinga were detained 
separately at the NBI Taft.  Later, he said he was surprised to learn 
that Tinga was released.  Subsequently, he was transferred for detention
 to MMRC, Camp Ricardo Papa, Bicutan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
</p><p>On cross-examination, accused-appellant testified that Solly 
approached him on January 18, 1996 because there was nobody else at that
 time she could ask for direction to Tinga’s house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He said he was not investigated at the NBI office but was only asked by Agent Esmeralda as to who was the owner of the <em>shabu</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
</p><p>Aurora Montano, accused-appellant’s mother, also testified for 
the defense.  She stated that, on January 18, 1996, she was at their 
house taking care of her grandchildren, but she denied that they had 
visitors that day.  Likewise, she denied having any visitor at their 
house on January 19, 1996.  According to her, on January 22, 1996 at 
around 2 p.m., she went out of the house and saw her son, two men, and a
 woman seated on the bench of their “dirty” kitchen along the 
passageway.  She described the passage as 140 meters long, 2 ½ meters 
wide, six feet in height, with concrete walls on both sides, a roof, and
 three gates.  According to her, the “dirty” kitchen was located 40 
meters from their house and 100 meters away from the first gate.  Her 
son introduced her to the visitors and requested her to prepare some 
snacks for them.  She overheard them talking about a recruitment agency 
in Japan.  She remembered one of them was named “Boyet.” After serving 
them leche flan and softdrinks, she said she went out to fetch her 
grandchildren from school.  When she arrived, her son and his companions
 were not in sight.  Then, a group of around twenty armed persons 
arrived and kicked their main and middle gates, shouting “<em>shabu</em>, <em>shabu</em>.” She told them there was no <em>shabu</em>
 in the house.  After driving these people away, she went inside to look
 for her grandchildren.  Some of them were at the back of their house 
where their storeroom was located.  She went to the storeroom through 
another passage and found her son and Tinga with their arms raised.  The
 visitors were also there and introduced themselves as NBI operatives.  
The other NBI agents arrived after a few minutes.  Her son and Tinga 
were brought to the porch and handcuffed.  Afterwards, another group 
arrived with the barangay chairman and showed her a search warrant.  
They conducted a search throughout the house but they allegedly did not 
find anything.  Then, the two were taken to the NBI office in Taft 
Avenue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
</p><p>On cross-examination, she testified that she did not know the 
reason why her son, Tinga, and their visitors went to their storage room
 on January 22, 1996.  She did not even notice them going there but only
 found out that they did when she went and saw her grandchildren in the 
storeroom.  She testified that nobody could enter the storeroom without 
her son’s permission.  Aurora Montano admitted that she knew Tinga was 
selling <em>shabu</em> but claimed that she could not forbid her son 
from associating with Tinga because they were neighbors.  She said she 
was surprised why Tinga was released while her son remained in detention
 and was the only one charged in court. She stated that Tinga is the 
cousin of Congressman Dante Tinga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
</p><p>On August 29, 1997, the trial court rendered a decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Arnel C. 
Montano GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 15, in 
relation to Section 20, of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, otherwise 
known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972.  Said accused is hereby 
sentenced to: (a) suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, (b) pay a fine in the amount of Two Million Pesos (P2,000,000.00), and (c) pay the costs.
  </p>
  <p>SO ORDERED.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accused-appellant contends that the trial court erred in convicting 
him: (1) “despite its findings that the prohibited drug subject matter 
of (the) case did not originate from appellant but from Hector  Tinga”; 
 (2)  “despite  the  fact  that  he  was  singled  out  for  prosecution
 in violation of his right to equal protection of laws”; and (3) “on the
 basis of an alleged buy-bust operation when it was shown to have been 
resorted to harass, extort and abuse.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
 In the alternative, he prays that this Court find him guilty as an 
accomplice only, because he merely handed to the poseur-buyers the drug 
which Tinga produced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
</p><p>We find these contentions without merit.
</p><p><em>First</em>.  This Court has held that the elements necessary 
for the prosecution of the illegal sale of drugs are: (1) the identity 
of the buyer and the seller, the object, and consideration; and (2) the 
delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
</p><p>Contrary to accused-appellant’s assertions, the evidence for the 
prosecution establishes these elements beyond reasonable doubt.  NBI 
Agents Esmeralda and Peneza positively identified accused-appellant as 
the person who, together with Tinga, sold to them two plastic packets of
 a white crystalline substance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Accused-appellant was thus caught <em>in flagrante delicto</em> in the buy-bust operation conducted by the NBI.  The <em>corpus delicti</em> of the crime charged, <em>i.e.</em>, the 229.7 grams of <em>shabu</em>, was duly established before the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In fact, accused-appellant, through his counsel, even admitted the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>
 He delivered the drug to the buy-bust team and payment for it was made.
  The fact that the drug originally came from Tinga is immaterial.  As 
held by this Court, proof of ownership of the drug is not necessary in 
the prosecution of illegal drug cases.  It is sufficient that it was 
found in accused-appellant’s possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
</p><p>Indeed, from the evidence adduced by the prosecution, it cannot 
be denied that accused-appellant had possession of the 229.7 grams of <em>shabu</em>.  It was he who delivered the same to the NBI operatives after it was handed to him by Tinga.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> After making the delivery, he and Tinga asked for the payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>
</p><p><em>Second</em>.  Accused-appellant invokes the defense of alibi.
  He claims that he went out of his house to get an electric fan and 
only witnessed the illegal transaction after his return and that he was 
merely implicated by the arresting officers.
</p><p>This defense is uncorroborated.  Accused-appellant’s mother 
testified that she too was out of the house at the time the buy-bust 
operation was being conducted and that, when she came back, she saw her 
son and Tinga already under arrest.  
</p><p>We have consistently held that the defense of alibi, if not 
substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, is weak, self-serving, 
and without weight in law, and thus undeserving of consideration by the 
courts.  It cannot prevail over the positive identification of the 
prosecution witnesses  who  have no reason or ill motive to testify 
falsely against the accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>
 In this case, the testimonies for the prosecution are consistent, 
unequivocal, and replete with details of the transaction with 
accused-appellant, and, therefore, merit our full faith and credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>
</p><p><em>Third</em>.  The presumption of regularity in the performance
 of their duties in favor of the arresting officers had not been 
sufficiently controverted by accused-appellant; hence, this Court is 
bound to uphold the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> 
Except for his self-serving statements, accused-appellant failed to 
present evidence to establish that the buy-bust operation was “resorted 
to harass, extort and abuse.”  In a vain attempt to establish his 
inculpability, he even questioned the validity of his arrest on account 
of the absence of a warrant.  The fact, however, is that 
accused-appellant was apprehended <em>in flagrante delicto</em> during a
 buy-bust operation against him and his arrest falls within the ambit of
 Rule 113, §5(a) of the Rules on Criminal Procedure on arrests without a
 warrant.  Indeed, this Court has already ruled that a buy-bust 
operation is “a form of entrapment which has repeatedly been accepted to
 be a valid means of arresting violators of the Dangerous Drugs Law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The validity of the arrest in this case must be sustained.
</p><p><em>Fourth</em>.  Nor is there merit in accused-appellant’s 
assertion that, because of the release of Hector Tinga, he is entitled 
to an acquittal.  No principle of equality justifies setting free a man 
who is otherwise guilty just because his co-conspirator escaped 
prosecution.  Accused-appellant’s guilt is not  dependent  on  whether  
or  not  Tinga was similarly charged with the same offense.  As 
discussed above, the evidence against accused-appellant sufficiently 
establishes his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
</p><p>However, it cannot be denied that Agents Peneza and Esmeralda 
testified that Tinga, who brought out the sachets from his pocket and 
counted the purchase money with accused-appellant, also directly 
participated in the sale.  What should be done, therefore, is to let a 
copy of the decision be given to the Department of Justice so that it 
may review its resolution in the case of Hector Tinga.
</p><p>Alternatively, accused-appellant prays that he be held guilty 
merely as an accomplice.  This cannot be done.  Art. 18 of the Revised 
Penal Code defines an accomplice as a person who, not being a principal 
in the commission of a felony, cooperates in the execution of the 
offense by previous or simultaneous acts. On the other hand, Art. 17 
thereof provides that principals are: (1) those who take a direct part 
in the execution of the act; (2) those who directly force or induce 
others to commit it; and (3) those who cooperate in the commission of 
the offense by another act without which it would not have been 
accomplished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>
</p><p>The evidence shows that accused-appellant was indeed a principal 
in the commission of the crime charged in this case.  Though it was 
Tinga who produced the two plastic packets of <em>shabu</em>, it was 
accused-appellant who delivered the same to the buy-bust team.  He was 
the one who asked for payment, who received the same, and who counted it
 in the presence of the buy-bust team.   It is undeniable that 
accused-appellant directly participated in the illegal sale of the <em>shabu</em>.  Consequently, his conviction must be upheld.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 262, Pasig City is AFFIRMED <em>in toto</em>.
</p><p>Let a copy of this decision be furnished the Honorable Secretary 
of Justice for whatever action he may deem necessary to take in the case
 of Hector Tinga.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.
