Court, Branch 17, Kidapawan City, Cotabato finding accused-appellant

guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder, sentencing him to <em>reclusion perpetua,</em>
 and ordering him to indemnify the heirs of the victim, Leolito Paquelet

  <strong>The Facts
  </strong>
</center>
<p>
On August 17, 1996, there was a benefit dance held at the barangay hall 
of Meohao, Kidapawan, Cotabato.  The dance ended at 12:30 a.m. the 
following day.
</p><p>
Leolito attended the dance.
</p><p>
On August 18, 1996, at around 1:00 a.m., Leolito who just came from the 
dance was seen by prosecution witness Remegia Obenza (hereinafter 
referred to as “Remegia”) with accused-appellant Arnold Gonzales, on a 
bench outside her store.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
Leolito was asleep on the bench.  Presumably, it was while he was sleeping that someone with a dagger snuffed out his life.
</p><p>
There were no eyewitnesses to the actual stabbing.  The prosecution thus
 had the task of knitting the pieces of evidence together into a 
thriving whole.  An accusing finger was pointed at Gonzales, as he was 
the last person seen with Leolito before he was stabbed dead.
</p><p>
On August 18, 1996, a post-mortem examination was conducted on Leolito’s body.  We quote the relevant parts of the report:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “PERTINENT FINDINGS: </p>
  <p> “CHEST AND BACK: Multiple stab wounds on the right anterior chest 
on the level of 2nd intercostal space midclavicular line measuring 4 
cms. in lenght (sic) and 4 ins, in depth; 3rd ICS MCL measuring 3 cms. 
in lenght (sic) and 4 ins, in depth; on the left anterior chest on the 
level of the 2nd and 3rd ICS parasternal area measuring 5 cms. in lenght

 2 cms. in lenght (sic) and 2 ins. in depth. </p>
  <p> “CAUSE OF DEATH: ACUTE BLOOD LOSS SECONDARY TO MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On August 21, 1996, 1st. Asst. Provincial Prosecutor Jose Agerico R. de 
Guzman of Cotabato filed an information for murder against Gonzales, to 
wit:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “That on August 18, 1996 at Barangay Meohao, Municipality of 
Kidapawan, Province of Cotabato, Philippines, the said accused, armed 
with a bladed weapon, with intent to kill, did then and there willfully,
 unlawfully, feloniously and with treachery, attack, assault and stab 
LEOLITO PAQUELET, thereby hitting and inflicting upon the latter 
multiple stab wounds on the different parts of his body, which is the 
cause of his death thereafter. </p>
  <p> “CONTRARY TO LAW.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On November 12, 1996, upon arraignment, accused pleaded “not guilty.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
On December 18, 1998, the trial court rendered a decision disposing of the case, thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “Prescinding from the foregoing facts and considerations, the

hereby ordered to indemnify the heirs of Leolito Paquelet the sum of 
P50,000.00. </p>
  <p> “With costs de oficio. </p>
  <p> “IT IS SO ORDERED.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On January 8, 1999, Gonzales filed a notice of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
On October 20, 1999, we resolved to accept the appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
In his appeal, Gonzales argued that his guilt was not proved beyond 
reasonable doubt, given the insufficiency of evidence against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
</p><center>
  <strong> Court’s Ruling </strong>
</center>
<p>
We do not agree.  Circumstantial evidence suffices to convict.  Resort 
to circumstantial evidence is essential when to insist on direct 
testimony would result in setting felons free.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </sup>  The following facts prove<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </sup>  the guilt of Gonzales:
</p><p><strong>
(1)      Shortly after the crime was committed, Gonzales admitted to a certain Juny Habla that he stabbed the victim.
</strong>
</p><p>
Prosecution witness Juny Habla testified that:
</p><p>
On August 18, 1996, at around 2:00 a.m., Gonzales came to his house at 
Palusok, Mua-an, Kidapawan City.  He was wearing a bloodied shirt.  In 
the presence of Juny’s brother and sister, Gonzales admitted that he 
stabbed Leolito.  Gonzales requested Juny to accompany him to the house 
of a certain Egoy Cornejo to surrender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
Juny’s testimony should not be disregarded.  True, the records do not 
show whether Juny was a confidant or close friend of Gonzales.  However,
 we note that admissions, as evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </sup>  need not be made only to close friends.
</p><p>
The utterance could have very well been a part of the res gestae.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </sup>
  It is not uncommon for one who is confronted with a startling 
occurrence to panic and seek the help of an acquaintance or even a 
stranger.
</p><p>
While it is a wonder why one would make such an incriminating confession
 to a stranger, it is more incredible for one with no motive or feelings
 of ill-will to testify falsely against another, incriminating him in a 
grievous crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
When there is no showing that the principal witness for the prosecution 
was actuated by an improper motive, the presumption is that he was not 
so actuated, and his testimony is thus entitled to full faith and 
credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
It is equally important to note that Juny’s testimony was unrebutted and that cross examination was waived by the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </sup>
  The defense could have questioned the veracity of the testimony.  
Having failed to do so, Juny’s testimony, which the trial court 
correctly considered as credible, stands unscathed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p><strong>
    (2)      Gonzales was the last person to be seen with the victim before he died.
</strong></p>
<p>
Remegia categorically stated that shortly before the victim was stabbed,
 she saw Gonzales with Leolito on a bench outside her store.
</p><p>
True, mere presence at the scene of the crime is not tantamount to guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </sup>  However, this is not the only circumstance availing here.
</p><p>
We recall the case of <em>People v. Santos.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </sup>
  There, we affirmed the conviction of the accused on the basis of 
circumstantial evidence.  There, two of the four compelling links<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </sup>
  were that: (1) the accused were the last persons seen with the victim,
 as it is so in the case at bar and (2) there were police officers who 
testified on the conditions of the accused at the time of arrest, 
conditions which indicated their guilt, again, a circumstance present in
 this case.
</p><p><strong>
(3)      Upon discovering that the victim had died (from the stab 
wounds), Gonzales uttered a statement, displaying apathy inconsistent 
with innocence.
</strong>
</p><p>
Remegia also testified that she heard Gonzales trying to wake the victim.  She heard Gonzales say to another, "<em>Patay na na, patay na na mo report lang ko ugma</em>.” (He is already dead, I will just report it tomorrow).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
The indifferent and unperturbed tenor of the statement is significant.  
It is not normal for one who innocently chances upon a dead man, lying 
in his own pool of blood to nonchalantly shrug it off and announce that 
he “will just report (it) tomorrow.” Such apathy is inconsistent with 
innocence.
</p><p>
Facts or circumstances that are consistent with guilt and are 
inconsistent with innocence, constitute evidence with weight and 
probative force.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
Remegia heard Gonzales speak.  She knew Gonzales since he was a boy.  
She was familiar with him and could identify him by the mere sound of 
his voice.  Expertise in voice identification is not necessary.  
Reliance on one’s sense of hearing and recollection suffices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
  <strong>(4)      Police officers SPO1 Espadera and SPO3 Salmorin 
testified that when they arrested Gonzales, he was wearing a 
blood-stained shirt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </sup></strong> 
</p><p>
Neither may the testimonies of SPO1 Espadera and SPO3 Salmorin be 
ignored.  No proof of bias or ill motive to falsely implicate Gonzales 
was shown.  Furthermore, credence should be accorded to the testimonies 
of prosecution witnesses who are law enforcers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
The well entrenched rule is that assessment of the credibility of 
witnesses is within the province of the trial court.  It is the trial 
court and not this Court that had the opportunity to observe the 
witnesses’ manner of testifying, their furtive glances, calmness, sighs 
or their scant or full realization of their oaths.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
SPO3 Salmorin was not cross-examined by the defense<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </sup>
  and the statements he thus uttered were not rebutted.  A person’s 
silence, particularly when it is persistent, may justify an inference 
that he is not innocent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
The trial court was more inclined to believe the prosecution.  Absent any arbitrariness or gross mistake, so should we.
</p><p>
The non-presentation of the blood-stained shirt in evidence, being 
merely corroborative of other evidence on record, is not fatal to the 
prosecution’s case.
</p><p>
Sec. 4, Rule 133 of the Revised Rules of Court provides:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “SEC. 4.  Circumstantial evidence, when sufficient. - Circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if: </p>
  <p> “(a)    There is more than one circumstance; </p>
  <p> “(b)    The facts from which the inferences are derived are proven, and </p>
  <p> “(c)    The combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce conviction beyond reasonable doubt.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In our mind, the four aforementioned circumstances form an unbroken chain of events leading to one fair conclusion:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </sup>  that Gonzales perpetrated the crime.
</p><p>
A degree of proof excluding all possibility of error is not required to 
prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  Absolute certainty is not 
required.  Only moral certainty is.  In this case, the evidence meets a 
degree of proof sufficient to produce conviction in an unprejudiced 
mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p align="center"><strong> Accused’s defense is Alibi and Denial </strong>
</p><p>
Gonzales’ defense is <em>alibi</em> and denial, the weakest of all defenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
Given the straightforward, candid and positive testimonies of the 
prosecution witnesses and the negative testimony of Gonzales, the 
positive testimonies must prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p align="center"><strong>
Penalty and Damages
</strong>
</p><p>
We agree with the Solicitor General that the qualifying circumstance of treachery was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </sup>
  While the victim was in all probability asleep and defenseless when he
 was stabbed, this is a mere hypothesis or conjuncture.  In the absence 
of proof as to how the killing was perpetrated, the crime committed is 
only homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
The penalty imposable is reclusion temporal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </sup>  In the absence of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the penalty is imposed in its medium period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </sup> 
</p><p>
The trial court awarded damages in the amount of fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </sup>  We modify the grant of damages, by granting moral damages and civil indemnity for wrongful death.
