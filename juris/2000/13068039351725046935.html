				<BR><BR><div align="justify">For the sale of methamphetamine hydrochloride, otherwise known as “<em>shabu</em>,”
 Zheng Bai Hui alias Carlos Tan Ty and Nelson Hong Ty alias Sao Yu were 
sentenced by the Caloocan City Regional Trial Court to suffer the death 
penalty.  Their case is now before this Court on automatic review. 
<p>
Appellants were charged in an information stating:
</p><p>
That on or about the 24th day of October 1994 at Kalookan City, 
Metro-Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused, without authority of law, conspiring 
together and mutually helping with one another, did then and there 
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell and deliver to SPOI GILBERT G.
 SANTOS who posed as buyer, One (1) blue plastic bag labelled “SM 
Shoemart” containing one (1) piece of newsprint with one (1) transparent
 plastic bag containing yellowish crystalline substance “METHAMPHETAMINE
 HYDROCLORIDE” (Shabu) and having a weight of 992.30 grams, a regulated 
drugs, knowing the same to be such.
</p><p>
CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
</p><p>
Arraigned on November 4, 1994, appellants pleaded not guilty to the above charges.  Trial ensued thereafter.   
</p><p>
The </p><p>prosecution’s version, as pieced together from the testimonies of witnesses SPO3 Gilbert Santos,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> SPO1 Gerico Bacani,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> PO2 Elleonito Apduhan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and PO3 Noel Castañeto,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> is as follows:
</p><p>
In the morning of October 24, 1994, a police informant code-named 
“Stardust” arrived at the Narcotics Command (NARCOM) in Camp Ricardo 
Papa, Bicutan, Taguig, and informed Police Sr. Insp. Franklin Moises 
Mabanag of two Chinese nationals who were supposedly “big time” drug 
pushers.  She claimed to have regular contact with one of the alleged 
drug pushers, a certain Carlos Tan Ty.  Stardust, the informant, was a 
woman who had previously provided the police with information that led 
to the confiscation of one (1) kilo of shabu.
</p><p>
Acting on the information furnished by Stardust, the NARCOM agents 
organized a buy-bust operation to apprehend the reputed drug pushers.  
Stardust called up Carlos Tan Ty that same morning and introduced SPO3 
Gilbert Santos over the cellular phone.  Pretending to be a 
“pusher-buyer” in Parañaque, SPO3 Santos told Carlos that he was willing
 to buy shabu if Carlos had any stock.  Carlos replied that they had 
stock that was yellow in color.  SPO3 Santos and Carlos subsequently 
reached an agreement for the former to buy from the latter one (1) kilo 
of shabu for P500,000 and to meet at the Mercury Drug Store in Monumento
 later that afternoon.  Carlos would bring the shabu and SPO3 Santos the
 money.  Carlos informed SPO3 Santos that he would be wearing a striped 
T-shirt and that he would be bringing with him a companion.  Per Carlos’
 instructions, SPO3 Santos would come alone. 
</p><p>
SPO3 Santos and Police Sr. Insp. Mabanag then prepared the “boodle money” consisting of seven (7) bundles of newspaper cuttings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> that was supposed to represent the P500,000 purchase money.  A genuine P500 bill<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> was placed on top of one of the bundles and another P500 bill<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> at the bottom of the same bundle.  SPO3 Santos initialed the red portion of the Philippine flag in each of the bills.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
 Between the bills were the newspaper cuttings.  The bundles, each about
 three (3) inches thick, were wrapped with straps from the United 
Coconut Planters Bank and tied with a rubber band.  The boodle money was
 then placed in plastic<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and sealed with scotch tape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> SPO3 Santos rehearsed how he would show the drug pushers the boodle money.
</p><p>
The police held a briefing and formed a team led by Inspector Rolando 
Ibañez.  The members of the team included SPO3 Santos, SPO1 Gerico 
Bacani, PO3 Elleonito Apduhan, PO1 Noel Castañeto, and a certain SPO1 
Juspid.  SPO3 Santos was designated poseur-buyer and SPO1 Apduhan, his 
backup.  The team then proceeded to the meeting area for reconnaissance.
</p><p>
SPO3 Santos and the rest of the buy-bust team, dressed in civilian 
attire, arrived at the Mercury Drug Store at the corner of Edsa, 
Monumento, Caloocan City later that afternoon.  SPO3 Santos and Stardust
 waited inside the Mercury Drug Store while the other agents 
strategically positioned themselves several meters from the store, where
 the suspects could not spot them.
</p><p>
The suspects arrived at around 6:00 in the evening.  Stardust pointed to
 SPO3 Santos two (2) Chinese nationals, later identified as the accused,
 alighting from a tax.   SPO3 Santos stepped out of the store and 
introduced himself to the two (2) Chinese nationals as the person whom 
they talked with over the phone that morning.  He told the suspects that
 he brought the money with him, and showed the accused the boodle money 
by opening the wrapper and showing half of the bundle with the P500 bill
 on top.  He then gave the money to one of the Chinese nationals, later 
identified as the accused Carlos Tan Ty.  The latter’s companion, later 
identified as accused Nelson Hong Ty, in turn handed SPO3 Santos a blue 
plastic bag<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> with the 
marking of “SM” or “Shoemart.”  The two looked at the money while SPO3 
Santos opened the bag handed to him by Nelson Hong Ty.  SPO3 Santos 
found a yellowish substance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 sealed in transparent plastic and wrapped in newspapers.  The accused 
identified the substance as shabu.   Thereupon, SPO3 Santos held Carlos 
by the hand as the other members of the team came to help him effect the
 arrest of the two suspects, who were later brought to Camp Crame, 
Quezon City.
</p><p>
After the buy-bust operation, SPO3 Santos, PO3 Bacani and PO3 Apduhan placed their respective signatures<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 on the SM plastic bag, the newspaper wrappings and the transparent 
plastic containing the substance.  The yellowish substance, together 
with its wrappings, was then delivered by SP01 Noel Castañeto to the 
Crime Laboratory of the Philippine National Police (PNP).  The boodle 
money was handed over to the property custodian.
</p><p>
Leslie Maala,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> a forensic chemist from the PNP, received a letter-request<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
 from Police Sr. Insp. Franklin Moises Mabanag to conduct a laboratory 
examination on the substance taken from the accused.  Ms. Maala took 
random samples of about one (1) gram from different parts of the 
substance and, per their standard operation procedure, performed 
physical, chemical and confirmatory examinations thereon.  The physical 
examination consisted of weighing the entire substance.  The chemical 
examination, in turn, consisted of the Simons test and the Marquis’ 
test.  Thence, a thin layer chromatography test was performed.  The 
examinations were supervised by the Chief of the Chemistry Division.
</p><p>
From the examinations thus conducted, Ms. Maala concluded that the 
sample was positive for methamphethamine hydrochloride.  The results of 
Ms. Maala’s examination were reflected in her initial (Chemistry Report 
No. 0-793-94 dated October 25, 1994),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> as well as in her final (Physical Sciences Report D-793-94 of even date)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> report.  The final report states that the entire substance weighed 992.3 grams. 
</p><p>
The accused, in their defense, countered that no buy-bust operation took
 place.  They denied selling any shabu and accused the police of 
extortion.
</p><p>
Accused Carlos Tan Ty,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> 38,
 described himself as married and engaged in the business of buying and 
selling lumber and furniture.  At the time of his testimony, he had been
 staying in the Philippines for more than ten years, although sometimes 
he would go home to Mainland China.  Previously, he owned a sawmill 
business in Malanday but shifted to the furniture business in 1987, with
 Peter Chua and Nestor Lim as his partners.  Their office is located in 
Karuhatan near a gasoline station along the MacArthur Highway. Their 
customers include Arenas Furniture and Unicorn Furniture.  The business 
is not registered in Carlos’ name, however, since he is a Chinese 
citizen.
</p><p>
Accused Nelson Hong Ty,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> 
24, and originally from Fuchu, China, had been residing in the 
Philippines for around seven (7) years before his arrest.  Though not 
licensed or authorized to work in the country, Nelson was employed as a 
factory worker and electrician in Everwood Furniture, a business owned 
by one Jessie Cua and located in Lincoln Street, Malinta, Valenzuela.
</p><p>
Testifying with the aid of an interpreter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> they narrated their account of the events that transpired on October 24, 1994.
</p><p>
That afternoon, Carlos was in Everwood Furniture in Lincoln Street, 
Malinta conducting some business with the shop owner when Nelson, an 
employee there, entered the office.   Nelson had just come from the 
factory and had gone to the Everwood office in Malinta to report to his 
boss.  Nelson asked how Carlos’ business was going.  Carlos replied that
 it was okay.  Seeing it was almost 5:00 p.m., Carlos asked Nelson if he
 was done working.  Nelson replied, “Yes, my work is finished,” and that
 he was in fact on his way home.  Carlos told him that he was supposed 
to meet a customer, a certain Chua Ping, in Monumento to take some 
orders.  Carlos offered to bring Nelson home to the latter’s house in 
Navotas if Nelson was willing to wait.
</p><p>
Earlier that afternoon, Chua Ping called up Carlos and said he needed 
lumber and plywood for his new house.  He wanted to meet with Carlos in 
Monumento so Chua Ping’s carpenter could give Carlos a list of the 
lumber he needed.  He told Carlos to meet him between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m.
 at a restaurant located at the ground floor of No. 316, Monumento, 
along Edsa.
</p><p>
Nelson took Carlos’ offer to take him home and rode with Carlos to 
Monumento in Carlos’ car, a red Toyota.  Upon arriving in Monumento at 
around 6:00 p.m., Carlos parked his car in front of the Prudential Bank.
  A boy even offered to clean the car. 
</p><p>
The two walked along EDSA to meet Chua Ping.  They were about 15 
arms-length from the car when they were suddenly accosted by eight men. 
 Carlos and Nelson asked what was happening.  The men, who were in 
civilian attire, shoved Carlos and Nelson into a red Nissan Sentra.  The
 two were not able to shout for help. 
</p><p>
Inside the car, Carlos was blindfolded. 
</p><p>
Carlos and Nelson were then taken to the Anito Hotel in Monumento and brought to separate rooms.
</p><p>
Once inside the hotel room, Carlos was ordered to face the wall.  His 
blindfold was removed but he was boxed every time he looked at the men. 
 The men frisked him, seized his wallet and took therefrom cash 
amounting to P78,000.  His license, cellular phone, pager and watch were
 also taken from him.
</p><p>
Carlos’ captors sat him on the bed and one of them (a policeman, 
according to Carlos) asked him questions like what business he was 
engaged in.  Carlos tried to answer the man’s questions but they could 
not understand him.  They got mad and boxed him. 
</p><p>
An hour later, a Chinese-speaking man armed with a gun entered the room.
  Carlos pleaded with the man to help him since he did not know why he 
was arrested.  The man asked him if he had any money.  He said Carlos 
must have money since he had a business.  The man offered to help him in
 exchange for P500,000.  If Carlos would not give the money, the man 
warned, he would not arrange with the police for a settlement; Carlos 
“might [even] be thrown in Marikina.” Carlos told the man that he did 
not have that kind of money.  He said that with the help of his friends 
he could raise only P50,000.  The interpreter told Carlos to wait for 
him and he will talk to the policemen.
</p><p>
Nelson was also brought to one of the hotel rooms and instructed to sit 
on the bed.   Two men were in the room with him.  After an hour, a 
person who knew how to speak Chinese entered the room.  The man, who did
 not identify himself, carried a firearm.  He demanded P50,000 from 
Nelson, otherwise, the man warned, something bad will happen to him.  
“Papatungan ako ng kaso,” Nelson said in court.   Nelson told the man, 
“I am just working.  Where can I get such a big amount?”
</p><p>
Carlos and Nelson were then brought to their captor’s vehicles.  Carlos 
was handed his cellular phone so he could call up friends or relatives 
who could help him produce the sum of P200,000.  Carlos attempted to 
call them up but there was no reply. 
</p><p>
Riding in separate vehicles, Carlos and Nelson were brought to the 
latter’s house in Navotas between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m.  Nelson and some of
 the policemen went inside the house while Carlos remained in the car.  
The men took Nelson’s clothes, an electric fan, a gas stove, and a round
 plastic table from the house, and loaded them into the car.
</p><p>
The Chinese-speaking man asked Carlos if he was married.  Carlos told 
him he was.  The man informed him that they would next go to Carlos’ 
house.  He instructed Carlos to tell his wife to borrow from her friends
 the money they demanded.
</p><p>
Carlos and his captors arrived at his house at around 11:00 p.m.  
Carlos’ wife answered the door.   Four (4) of the men accompanied Carlos
 into the house, one of them holding him by the shirt.  Carlos told his 
wife that his companions were policemen who arrested him “because of the
 lumber,” and were now demanding P200,000 from him.    Carlos added that
 he had left his car in Monumento.  Carlos’ captors then brought him 
back to their car.  From the car, Carlos saw his wife ride in one of the
 policemen’s vehicles.   Carlos was told that his wife was going to see 
her friends.
</p><p>
The vehicle Carlos was riding proceeded to Karuhatan when one of the 
policemen received a message from a pager, and the group transferred to 
the BB gasoline station.  They stayed there for 15 to 20 minutes until 
the policeman received another message from his pager.  They drove to 
Monumento when a hand from another vehicle signaled them to stop.   They
 proceeded to Camp Crame thereafter.
</p><p>
At Camp Crame, Carlos and Nelson were placed in handcuffs.  Later in the
 evening of October 25, 1994, they were provided with a piece of paper 
with some writings.  The two were made to sign the paper and place their
 thumb marks thereon.  They told Carlos that he would be released 
lunchtime the next day, October 26, when his wife brought the money they
 demanded.  Nelson was given the same assurance of release.
</p><p>
Carlos and Nelson were not released the following day, however.  At 
around 11:00 a.m., October 26, Carlos and Nelson were presented to the 
media.
</p><p>
Carlos’ common-law wife, May Ann Ty, testified to corroborate the 
accused’s testimony.  Mary Ann and Carlos have been living together 
since 1989, and have three children.  According to Mary Ann, appellant 
has been engaged in the furniture business since 1989.
</p><p>
Mary Ann testified that between 11 in the evening of October 24, 1994 
and 12 midnight the next day, Carlos, along with a group of about six 
(6) men in civilian attire arrived at the couple’s residence.  They 
asked her if she knew Carlos. “Yes,” Mary Ann replied, and inquired what
 they needed from him.  She also asked the men who they were but they 
did not say anything.  (In court, Mary Ann identified one of them as 
“Abduhan,” apparently referring to PO3 Elleonito Apduhan, one of the 
agents who testified against the accused.)  The group informed her that 
Carlos “was arrested in connection with the woods.”  It occurred to Mary
 Ann that appellant was arrested “perhaps [because] he was able to buy 
woods without receipts.” The men demanded that Mary Ann produce the sum 
of P200,000, or else “something bad will happen to [Carlos].” They told 
her that they would return at 2:30 in the morning.  Before they left, 
the men searched the house and took her baby’s thermos and the batteries
 of a cellular phone.
</p><p>
After the men left, Mary Ann changed her clothes and woke up her brother
 so that he could accompany her to borrow the money.  One of her 
friends, a certain John Ang, subsequently promised to lend her P130,000 
through his secretary who would bring the money to Karuhatan.  Mary Ann 
returned home at past one in the morning and waited.
</p><p>
Two of the men returned at about 5:00 that same morning.  Two minutes 
later, Carlos entered the room, pushed by one of the men.  “What will 
you do to me?”  Carlos asked in broken Tagalog.  The man replied by 
ordering him, “Bumalik ka na sa kotse.”
</p><p>
The men then told Mary Ann to go with them so they could get the money 
from John Ang’s secretary.  Mary Ann thus rode with the men in a white 
vehicle.  She decided to go with them alone since her relatives were 
busy.  The vehicle first proceeded to Maysilo, Bulacan and then to 
Karuhatan, Valenzuela where Mary Ann received $4,000 and P30,000 in cash
 from John Ang’s  secretary.  Back in the car with the money, Mary Ann 
asked the men where her husband was.  They told her she would see her 
husband when she went home before sunset.  
</p><p>
Mary Ann then asked to whom should she give the money.  They replied, 
“Of course for us,” and the man to her left immediately grabbed it from 
her.  They kept on uttering words to the effect that “something bad will
 happen to [her] husband.” They said they planned to bring her husband 
to the doctor for a check-up so in case the couple filed a complaint, 
there would be no proof that anything happened to him.  The men dropped 
Mary Ann off along Karuhatan in MacArthur Highway.  Mary Ann jotted down
 the plate number of the men’s white car then went home to Valenzuela.
</p><p>
The men did not return Carlos home despite their assurances.  Mary Ann’s
 father managed to trace the whereabouts of her husband through the 
vehicle’s plate number.  When Mary Ann went to Camp Crame in the 
afternoon of October 25, 1994 to inquire about her husband, she saw the 
same white car parked in front of one of the offices.  The vehicle bore 
the same plate number as the one the men brought with them.
</p><p>
The night the men came, Mary Ann learned from Carlos that he left his 
car in front of the Prudential Bank at the Monumento Circle.  Mary Ann 
was able to retrieve the car, a Toyota, two days after Carlos’ arrest, 
or on October 26, 1994, at past eight in the morning.    When she went 
to recover the car, a teenaged boy approached her and asked her if she 
owned the car.  “Yes,” she replied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
</p><p>
Norlito Dotimas, 18, and a resident of Bagong Barrio, Caloocan City was 
the teenaged boy from the parking lot.  Presented as a witness for the 
defense, Norlito testified that since April 1994 he had been earning a 
living guarding and washing cars parked in the Prudential Bank.  The 
bank is beside the Mercury Drug Store in front of the Monumento in 
Caloocan.  Norlito works in the parking lot from eight in the morning to
 seven in the evening.
</p><p>
Norlito narrated that at about 5:30 in the afternoon of October 24, 
1994, a red car arrived at the Prudential Bank parking lot.  Two men, 
who later turned out to be the accused, alighted from the car.  Norlito 
offered “the tall guy,” referring  to  accused Carlos Tan Ty, to watch 
and wash the latter’s car.  Carlos agreed and walked on.  Norlito stared
 at the two men as they left, wondering whether they were Chinese or 
Japanese.  Norlito said that the men were not carrying anything with 
them.
</p><p>
Norlito had just started washing the back of Carlos’ car when he saw 
that the two men, then about ten (10) meters away, were 
"pinagkakaguluhan.” The taller man (Carlos) was held by the collar and 
then pushed into the car.   The smaller one (Nelson) was poked with a 
gun on his right temple, handcuffed and also forced into the car.
</p><p>
At around 8:00 a.m. the next day, October 25, 1994, someone took Carlos’
 car from the Prudential Bank parking lot.  Norlito was not able to 
charge for watching and washing that car, however, since he was busy 
washing another.
</p><p>
Norlito admitted that he was requested by Maryann Ty, whom he first met 
on December 9, 1994 in the Prudential Bank parking lot, to testify 
regarding her husband’s disappearance.  Norlito agreed to testify, and 
Mary Ann promised to pay him P200, the equivalent of his daily earnings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
</p><p>
The defense also offered the testimony of Sr. Insp. Franklin Moises 
Mabanag, who was presented as a hostile witness.  Sr. Insp. Mabanag was 
the chief of the Second Operation Group-Special Operation Unit of the 
NARCOM when the accused were arrested.  He testified to certain aspects 
of the buy-bust operation that led to the arrest of the accused. 
</p><p>
(1)          At the time he testified, Sr. Insp. Mabanag had known 
Stardust for more than two (2) years, having first met her in the place 
where she worked nightly.  He eventually convinced her to work with 
them, and gave her the code-name “Stardust.”  Sr. Insp. Mabanag declined
 to divulge Stardust’s real name in court “for security reasons.”  He 
revealed, however, that Stardust was neither a drug pusher nor a drug 
user; she did not have any arrest record.  She was usually given cash as
 “incentive” for the information she provided; Sr. Insp. Mabanag, 
though, could not remember how much he gave her in this case.  He 
described Stardust’s participation in the operation as “indispensable.”
</p><p>
(2)          The first time Sr. Insp. Mabanag first heard about Carlos 
Tan Ty was when Stardust reported on October 24, 1994 that the accused 
was actively engaged in the business of selling shabu.  They conducted a
 backgrounder on the accused, and their investigation yielded several 
persons with the same name as Carlos Tan.  They could not verify, 
however, if any one of these persons was actually the accused Zheng Bai 
Hui. 
</p><p>
(3)          The accused were immediately brought to Camp Crame after 
their arrest.  Sr. Insp. Mabanag prepared a spot report, which he 
submitted to Supt. Charles Galinan, chief of the NARCOM Special 
Operation Unit.  The buy-bust operation was not only reflected in said 
spot report but also in a pre-operation report prepared by Sr. Insp. 
Mabanag before the operation, and in a logbook containing the details 
thereof.  Not all the entries in the pre-operation report, such as the 
denominations of the bills used as boodle money, were entered in the 
logbook, however.  Sr. Insp. Mabanag claimed they did not maintain a 
police blotter since they were a special operation unit.
</p><p>
(4)          Sr. Insp. Mabanag denied that his operatives demanded money from the accused in exchange for the latter’s release.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
</p><p>
The defense also presented, as hostile witnesses, SPO3 Gilbert Santos, 
PO3 Elleonito Apduhan and PNP forensic chemist Leslie Maala, all of whom
 previously testified for the prosecution.
</p><p>
The testimony of SPO3 Santos yielded the following additional information:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    (1) The serial numbers and the denominations of the genuine money 
used in the buy-bust operation were not recorded in their police 
logbook, since their Commanding Officer said it was no longer necessary.
  They did not place any fluorescent powder on the boodle money. 
  </p>
  <p> (2) He had never met either of the accused before their arrest nor
 did he have any record or any “A-1 information” regarding them. </p>
  <p> (3) They did not conduct a “test-buy” or a surveillance of the 
activities of the accused to determine the veracity of the information 
Stardust had provided. </p>
  <p>
    (4) They were not armed with a warrant when they effected the arrest of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>PO3 Elleonito Apduhan also testified that he did not know any of the 
accused before their arrest.  He confirmed that no test buy was 
conducted by their office.  He denied having gone to the house of 
accused Carlos Tan Ty and demanding money from the latter’s wife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
  </p>
<p>
Leslie Maala, for her part, expounded on the examinations she conducted 
on the subject substance.  Quite pertinently, she testified that the 
tests she performed, namely, the Simons test, the Marquis’ test and the 
thin layer chromatography, are qualitative, not quantitative tests.  
They are not designed to determine the purity of the specimen.  Ms. 
Maala admitted she never conducted any quantitative test on the 
substance since there was no request for such an examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
</p><p>
The trial concluded, Judge Adoracion Angeles of the Caloocan City 
Regional Trial Court, Branch 121, rendered a decision convicting both 
accused thus:
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, premises considered, the accused ZHENG BAI HUI a.k.a. CARLOS 
TAN TY and NELSON HONG TY a.k.a. SAO YU are hereby found GUILTY beyond 
reasonable doubt of the offense of Violation of Section 15, Article III,
 RA 6425 in relation to Section 21-B of the same Act and each is 
accordingly sentenced to suffer the penalty of DEATH and to pay a fine

</p><p>
The case is now before this Court for automatic review.
</p><p>
Appellants, in the brief filed by Atty. Nestor Ifurung, contends:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> I.   That the trial court erred in depriving the accused of the 
prized ideal of ‘the cold neutrality’ of an impartial judge as part of 
procedural process.  It assumed the role of the prosecutor and judge in 
the case, and further unduly and arbitrarily curtailed the right of the 
accused on the cross examination of the witnesses against them. </p>
  <p> II.  That the trial court erred in giving credence to the 
so-called “buy-bust” story of the prosecution despite the unmistakable 
hallmarks of fabrication thereof, and corollarily, in concluding that 
both accused were caught in flagrante delicto in the act of selling 
methamphetamine hydrochloride to a police poseur buyer. </p>
  <p>
    III. That the trial court erred in refusing disclosure of the 
identity of and putting on the witness stand the alleged confidential 
informant who supposedly arranged the buy-bust that led to the arrest of
 both accused, and thereby, infringed upon the fundamental right of the 
accused to confront and cross-examine a material witness against them.
  </p>
  <p>
    IV. That the trial court erred in convicting both accused on the 
basis of the evidence of the prosecution showing they were the victims 
of police instigation, which entitles them to acquittal.
  </p>
  <p>
    V.  That the trial court erred in imposing upon the accused the 
capital penalty of death despite the absence of expert evidence on the 
percentage of the pure quantity of the alleged shabu sued upon called 
for in Resolution No. 3, dated March 8, 1979 of the Dangerous Drugs 
Board, and of Sec. 16, Art. III, of RA 6425.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>

<p>
Appellant Nelson Hong Ty, in whose behalf Atty. Leven Puno filed another
 brief, assigns similar errors on the part of the trial court:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> I    THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED A GRAVE ERROR WHEN IT KNOWINGLY 
DEPRIVED THE ACCUSED OF THE “COLD NEUTRALITY” OF AN IMPARTIAL JUDGE AS A
 PART OF THEIR RIGHT TO PROCEDURAL PROCESS. </p>
  <p> II   THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED A GRAVE ERROR IN GIVING FULL FAITH AND CREDIT TO THE “BUY-BUST” STORY OF THE POLICE OFFICERS. </p>
  <p>
    III  THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED A GRAVE ERROR IN FINDING AND 
CONCLUDING THAT BOTH ACCUSED WERE CAUGHT IN FLAGRANTE DELICTO IN THE ACT
 OF SELLING METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE TO A POSEUR BUYER.

THE RIGHT OF THE ACCUSED TO CONFRONT AND CROSS-EXAMINE A WITNESS AGAINST

<p>
In his supplemental brief, appellant Nelson Hong Ty adds that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.  THE TRIAL COURT COMMITED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO 
LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN RENDERING THE ASSAILED DECISION BASED 
PARTLY ON THE TESTIMONY OF A WITNESS WHO THROUGH INADVERTENCE WAS NOT 
SWORN, BEFORE TESTIFYING FOR THE PROSECUTION.

  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
    The arguments raised by appellants may be reduced to the following issues:
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    (1)          Whether the failure of a prosecution witness to take 
his oath invalidates the proceedings before the trial court.
  </p>
  <p>
    (2)          Whether appellants were denied their right to an impartial and disinterested tribunal.
  </p>
  <p>
    (3)          Whether the refusal of the trial judge to allow 
disclosure of the identity of the informer deprived appellants of their 
right to confront and cross-examine said witness.
  </p>
  <p> (4)          Whether the prosecution proved appellants’ guilt beyond reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p>
    (5)          Whether the death penalty should be imposed upon appellants.

</p><p>
Appellant Nelson Hong Ty argues that the failure of SPO1 Jerico Bacani 
to take an oath before he testified deprived the accused of their right 
to due process.  It is contended that they are entitled to a new trial.
</p><p>
That SPO1 Bacani, a witness for the prosecution, did not take an oath 
before his testimony is undisputed.  The omission appears to have been 
brought about by circumstances starting from the hearing of November 14,
 1994.  SPO3 Gilbert Santos was testifying on cross-examination when 
Atty. Leven Puno, counsel for the defense, moved for a continuance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The trial court granted counsel’s motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> At the start of the next hearing, on November 17, 1994, the prosecutor called on SPO1 Jerico Bacani as a witness<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>notwithstanding
 SPO3 Santos’ unfinished testimony.  Atty. Puno objected and reminded 
the court that he was still cross-examining SPO3 Santos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> In response, the prosecutor informed the court that SPO3 Santos was not present in the courtroom<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>despite notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> After some discussion between the court and counsel for the respective parties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Atty. Puno acceded to continue the cross-examination of SPO3 Santos at a subsequent date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The court even dictated an order to that effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The prosecutor then offered the testimony of SPO1 Bacani,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>
 and conducted the direct examination, without the witness having first 
taken an oath.  Neither did SPO1 Bacani take an oath at the continuation
 of his testimony on November 23, 1994.
</p><p>
The failure of a witness to take an oath prior to his testimony is a defect that may be waived by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Appellant Nelson Hong Ty concedes to this rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>
 He asserts, however, that he did not waive his right to object to the 
lack of oath, since the inadvertence was discovered only after the 
judgment of conviction by the trial court when counsel was preparing the
 brief for automatic review by this Court.  As authority for this 
argument, appellant cites <em>Langford v. United States,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> where the Court of Appeals of the Indian Territory declared that:
</p><p>
x x x it would seem that knowledge or want of knowledge [of the lack of 
oath] is the true test in this class of cases.  In a note to section 
264b of Wigmore’s Edtion (16th) of Greenleaf on Evidence the following 
appears: “Whether he may [have a new trial] if a witness on the other 
side, testified without having been sworn at all quære? If the omission 
of the oath was known at the time, it seems he cannot; but, if it was 
not discovered until after trial, he may.”  Mr. Thompson, in his work on
 Trials (volume 1, § 365) says: “It is the duty of the party calling the
 witness to see that he is sworn, though, if the oath is inadvertently 
omitted, the objection will not be good after verdict;” but at once 
adds, “The objection must be made as soon as it is discovered, or it 
will be deemed waived.”  x x x.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>Langford</em> makes reference to the following excerpt in <em>Hawks v. Baker,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> also cited by appellant:
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is the duty of the counsel offering a witness to move that he may be 
sworn, and thus be qualified to testify.  * * * Thus far the counsel for
 the opposite party has no concern with the transaction.  He has a right
 to presume that the person taking the stand in the character of a 
witness has been duly sworn.  Of course, his omission to inquire and 
ascertain the fact cannot be considered as any waiver of his right to 
object to the incorrectness of the proceeding if the person supposed to 
be sworn was in fact never sworn.  No man can be considered waiving a 
right which he is unconscious of possessing.  * * * The defendant has 
not had a trial of his cause on legal evidence, but partly on that which
 is illegal.
</p><p>
<em>Langford</em> states that “knowledge or want of knowledge is the 
true test” in determining whether there was a waiver of the lack of 
oath.  We find, however, that this test would open the door to fraud 
since any party can claim want of knowledge of the defect before verdict
 is rendered.  Such a claim would be exceedingly difficult to verify.  
We believe that the better test would be not whether a party had 
knowledge of the lack of oath but whether he had the opportunity to know
 of the lack of oath.  If a party ought to have known of the lack of 
oath but did not object thereto, he cannot later be heard raising such 
an objection.  Thus, in State v. Embrey,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the Supreme Court of New Mexico held:
</p><p>
The testimony or declarations of any unsworn person, given or made in 
the presence of the trial judge and of the parties and their attorneys, 
under such circumstances that they knew or should have known what the 
unsworn individual was doing and saying, may be considered by the jury 
as that of any sworn witness.  Where no objection is promptly made to 
such a proceeding, it is too late to urge the objection on motion for 
new trial.  (Italics supplied.)
</p><p>
In the case at bar, defendant and his counsel were present at the 
hearing of November 17, 1994 when SPO1 Bacani was presented as a 
witness.  They did not, however, object to the lack of oath.  Nor did 
they pose any objection when SPO1 Bacani continued his testimony on 
November 23, 1994; Atty. Puno even cross-examined the witness.  In State
 v. Doud,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the Supreme Court of Oregon had occasion to rule that:
</p><p>
If the defendant had wished that the x x x witness should have been 
sworn, he should have been observant and should have mentioned the 
matter in the trial court.  We are certain that had the matter then been
 mentioned an appropriate oath would have been administered.  In all 
likelihood, it would have produced no different effect, for all thought 
that an oath had been administered.  It is now too late to present the 
objection. This assignment of error is dismissed as lacking in merit.
</p><p>
So we hold in this case.
</p><p>
In any event, the granting of a new trial because of said omission would
 be pointless because even if testimony of SPO1 Bacani were excluded, it
 would not materially affect the totality of the evidence for the 
prosecution.   His testimony is merely corroborative of those of SPO3 
Gilbert Santos, PO2 Elleonito Apduhan and PO3 Noel Castañeto and could 
therefore be dispensed with, without affecting the prosecution’s case or
 prejudicing that of the defense.
</p><p align="center">
II
</p><p>
Appellants also contend that they were deprived of their right to the 
cold neutrality of an impartial judge, and attempt to establish a 
pattern of partiality on the part of RTC Judge Adoracion Angeles.
</p><p>
First, they assert that the judge “actively assumed the role of the prosecutor”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>
 in the examination of Norlito Dotimas.  Norlito, the “watch-your-car 
boy,” testified that appellants did not arrive in a taxi but in a car 
driven by appellant Carlos Tan Ty.   In resolving this argument, it 
would be helpful to examine the entire transcript of Norlito’s 
cross-examination and the circumstances surrounding the questioning 
appellants find so objectionable.
</p><p>
The prosecutor began the cross-examination by asking the witness who 
requested him to testify.  Norlito answered that it was Mary Ann Ty, the
 wife of appellant Carlos Ty.  Asked when he was requested to testify, 
Norlito replied he could not remember.  The prosecutor continued:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    Q    But you are sure that when you came to this Court this morning, she accompanied you, is that correct?
      <br>
    A     Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    And you neither received a subpoena coming from the Court to testify today, is that correct?
      <br>
    A     None, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    And where did she pick you up before you came to this Court?
      <br>
    A     From Arte Subdivision, sir.
  </p>
  <p>

      <br>
    A     Yes, your Honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A couple more questions were asked by the prosecutor when the judge 
interrupted him.  Apparently, the judge wanted to clarify where Mary Ann
 picked up Norlito because when he recited his personal circumstances, 
he said that he resided in Bagong Barrio, Caloocan.  The clarification 
led to several more questions involving when and where Norlito and Mary 
Ann agreed to meet in Arte Subdivision.  Thereafter, she ordered the 
prosecutor to continue with the cross-examination.
</p><p>
Before the prosecutor could continue, however, the judge again asked a 
series of questions, all pertaining to when Norlito and Mary Ann first 
met.  These questions, the defense claims, were aimed “to discredit”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the witness:

    The cross-examination ended with a question from the prosecutor.  
The judge also propounded a few more questions again relating to the 
alleged meeting between Norlito and Maryann.
  </p>
<p> Thereafter, Atty. Puno proceeded with the witness’ re-direct 
examination.  After several questions by Atty. Puno pertaining to the 
conversation Norlito had with Mary Ann at the witness’ house, the judge 
interjected with her own questions on the subject.  At this point, Atty.
 Puno tried to protest since the witness was “getting confused.”  The 
judge, according to appellants, only “exhibited greater vehemence and 
further tried to push him to the wall,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> thus:

      Atty. Puno manifested that the judge herself was actually 
conducting the cross-examination, and a spirited discussion between 
counsel and the judge ensued:
    </p>
    <p>
      ATTY. PUNO:
    </p>
    <p> I do not know how to tell this to the Court, Your Honor, but I 
will not be true to my duty to my client if I will not express this to 
the Court—that the Presiding Judge actually was doing the 
cross-examination. </p>
    <p>
      COURT:
    </p>
    <p> No, counsel, that’s for clarification of the Court.  I would like to find out also some matters. </p>
    <p>
      ATTY. PUNO:
    </p>
    <p> This is very honest, that is no longer clarificatory questions, 
but that is actually cross-examination for the prosecution… I am very 
sorry to say this, Your Honor.   I am telling this with all honesty and I
 felt your Honor, I will not be true to my duty to my client if I will 
not express this.  And I want that to be placed/put on record …
            </p>
    <p>
      COURT:
    </p>
    <p> Those questions were asked by the Presiding Judge for 
clarification… for clarificatory questions, because there are matters 
which are very vague to the Court. </p>
    <p>
      ATTY. PUNO:
    </p>
    <p>
      That is my manifestation, your Honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      COURT:
    </p>
    <p>
      And that is also the observation of the Court on the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATTY. PUNO:
    </p>
    <p> Do not know if this will be all that … (interrupted). </p>
    <p>
      FISCAL MANANQUIL:
    </p>
    <p> Besides, it was the witness himself who testified that she was 
requested by Mary Ann Ty to testify, that’s precisely why we are going 
deeper … (interrupted) </p>
    <p>
      COURT:
    </p>
    <p> No.  The observation is not only in the particular point.   The 
prosecution and the defense is entitled to their own observation in the 
same way that the Court is entitled to its own observation.  Because, 
the trial court has to observe the demeanor of the witness while 
testifying.  As a matter of fact, even on appeal, the findings of the 
trial court with respect to findings of fact will be given much weight, 
because we, Judges in the trial court has the capacity to observe the 
demeanor of the parties to witnesses being presented in Court.   
Therefore, I have to make it on record the demeanor of the witness or 
the witnesses, so that, when I make the proper evaluation and assessment
 by the time a decision will be rendered in this case, everything will 
have to appear on record, for the guidance of the Court.  It is the 
prerogative of the Presiding Judge to ask clarificatory questions on 
matters which are still very vague to Him or to Her, in order that He or
 She will not be misguided in the proper evaluation and assessment of 
the facts of the case…..  That’s it…
            </p>
    <p>
      ATTY. PUNO:
    </p>
    <p>
      Your Honor, please, I agree that clarificatory questions were to 
be asked by the Presiding Judge, as the latter is entitled to it.  The 
only thing, if your Honor please, is that, this witness is not an 
intelligent witness and because of this cross-examination conducted by 
the Presiding Judge of this Court---and I am very sorry to say this---. 
 May I place it on record that this witness actually got confused
    </p>
    <p>
      COURT:
    </p>
    <p> That is your assessment, simply because the Court was able to 
find out, in the conduct of its clarificatory questions, some matters 
which were not taken up by the Prosecuting Fiscal, like for example, the
 testimony of the witness that she was paid by such Mary Ann Ty, and 
probably that’s the reason why you did not like the Court to ask that 
question.   That’s your observation and this is the observation of the 
Court. </p>
    <p>
      ATTY. PUNO:
    </p>
    <p> May I take exception to the observation of the Court with 
regards to payment ….. I believe your Honor, that he was paid for the 
amount of his “gana” ….. </p>
    <p>
      COURT:
    </p>
    <p> Everything were placed on records.    Never mind, you and I 
cannot change the testimony of the witness at this point in time.  So, 
let us not make any alteration in the testimony of this witness.  At 
this point in time, the Court is not yet in a position to evaluate the 
evidence, as the Court is still in the process of receiving the evidence
 for the defense.   But, the Court should not be divested of its 
prerogative to conduct clarificatory questions on the matter which are 
still very vague …. </p>
    <p>
      ATTY. PUNO:
    </p>
    <p>
      This is my manifestation, your Honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      COURT:
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything is on record.
    </p>
    <p>
      COURT:
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, it is the duty of the member of the Bench to always aid
 the Court in the proper administration of Justice, so that the Court 
should not be divested of its right to conduct clarificatory questions. 
 And, neither the lawyer should be a bar if the Court asks clarificatory
 questions on matters which are vague, so much so, that the Court is not
 interested in this case.  If at all, the Court asks clarificatory 
questions, it is for the purpose of finding out the truth and for the 
purpose of aiding the Court in the proper evaluation and assessment of 
facts and evidence on records, in order, further, that the law may be 
acquired properly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup>

<p>
On that note, the hearing of December 12, 1994 ended.
</p><p>
A week later, the accused filed a “Motion to Inhibit/Disqualify Presiding Judge,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> contending that the judge exhibited bias against the accused in her questioning.  The judge denied the motion in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> ated December 20, 1994, prompting the accused to file a petition for certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup>before
 the Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals initially issued a 
temporary restraining order enjoining Judge Angeles from hearing the 
case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The appellate court, however, eventually dismissed the petition for lack of merit and lifted the restraining order,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> thereby allowing trial to continue.
</p><p>
Like the Court of Appeals, we find no prejudice in the judge’s questioning.
</p><p>
From the outset, Her Honor had observed that the witness Norlito Dotimas
 never looked at any of the persons propounding the questions—that is, 
until the judge made her observations of record.  Understandably, 
appellants did not care to mention this fact in their pleadings.  It is 
in the context of the judge’s observations, however, that her 
questioning must be construed.
</p><p>
The averted gaze, in our culture, is a telltale sign of prevarication, 
and Norlito’s reticent demeanor no doubt raised suspicions in the 
judge’s mind that his testimony may be a fabrication.  The judge also 
noted in her Order denying the motion to disqualify her that the witness
 was evasive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Of course, 
the witness’ behavior could be attributed to shyness, or even 
nervousness, since the witness was testifying in court for the first 
time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> In any case, it was 
incumbent upon the trial judge to confirm or dispel her suspicions.  It 
was, after all, her duty to ascertain the credibility of the witness to 
enable her to arrive at a just verdict.  In the fulfillment of this 
duty, the judge dwelt at length on how Norlito and Mary Ann first met 
and whether Norlito was paid in exchange for his testimony.  It would be
 to curtail or limit unduly the discretion of a trial judge to impute 
with a sinister significance such minute and searching queries from the 
bench,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> especially in light of the witness’ suspicious behavior.
</p><p>
In any case, a severe examination by a trial judge of some of the 
witness for the defense in an effort to develop the truth and to get at 
the real facts affords no justification for a charge that he has 
assisted the prosecution with an evident desire to secure a conviction, 
or that he had intimidated the witnesses for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>
 The trial judge must be accorded a reasonable leeway in putting such 
questions to witnesses as may be essential to elicit relevant facts to 
make the record speak the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup>
 Trial judges in this jurisdiction are judges of both the law and the 
facts, and they would be negligent in the performance of their duties if
 they permitted a miscarriage of justice as a result of a failure to 
propound a proper question to a witness which might develop some 
material bearing upon the outcome.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup>
 In the exercise of sound discretion, he may put such question to the 
witness as will enable him to formulate a sound opinion as to the 
ability or the willingness of the witness to tell the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> A judge may examine or cross-examine a witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> He may propound clarificatory questions to test the credibility of the witness and to extract the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup>
 He may seek to draw out relevant and material testimony though that 
testimony may tend to support or rebut the position taken by one or the 
other party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> It cannot be 
taken against him if the clarificatory questions he propounds happen to 
reveal certain truths which tend to destroy the theory of one party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup>
</p><p>
To prop up their theory of bias, the defense claims that the judge in 
asking questions to prosecution witnesses SPO3 Gilbert Santos,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> SPO1 Gerico Bacani,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> SPO3 Noel Castañeto,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> and Leslie Maala<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Actually “helped” the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> We do not agree.  As we held in People vs. Angcap:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup>
</p><p>
x x x.  At the most, there was the effort of the trial judge to arrive 
at the truth and do justice to the parties.  It would be a distorted 
concept of due process if in pursuance of such a valid objective the 
trial judge is to be stigmatized as being guilty of an act of 
unfairness.  x x x.  “There is nothing on record to show that anyone of 
the judges of the trial court attempted to help the prosecution.  The 
questions propounded by the judge, subject of appellant’s complaint, 
appeared to have been intended to elicit the truth from the witnesses.  
The inquisitiveness complained of by appellant’s counsel did not have 
the purpose of unduly harming the substantial rights of the accused.  It
 was only to be expected from the judges who, with full consciousness of
 their responsibilities, could not easily be satisfied with 
incompleteness and obscurities in the testimonies.”  This assignment of 
error is therefore unfounded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup>
</p><p>
Next, it is claimed that the judge “prevented the defense from pursuing intensive inquiries of witnesses.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Instances are cited where the judge allegedly “blocked off”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup>
 questions by defense counsel even when the prosecutor failed to object.
  Thus, when SPO3 Santos was testifying for the defense as a hostile 
witness, Atty. Ifurung, the counsel for the defense, asked him:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    Q    I ask you Mr. Santos, are you a forensic chemist?<br>

    While it may be true that this witness testified that he bought 
shabu, he is not testifying here as forensic chemist with expertise on 
chemical analysis.  He is testifying as a poseur buyer and therefore, 
further questions on the witness would be out of order.  Hence, the

<p>
The questions by counsel in court regarding the ability of the arresting
 officer to distinguish between shabu and tawas without a laboratory 
examination, the academic degree of his training instructor, and the 
officer’s authorship of books on drug identity and analysis are 
irrelevant, improper and impertinent.  In drug cases, an arrest made in 
flagrante delicto does not require that the arresting officer possess 
expert knowledge of the substance seized, or that he perform precise 
scientific tests to determine its exact nature.  That would be 
impractical, and obstructive to effective law enforcement.  The judge 
was therefore correct in disallowing these questions.
</p><p>
The judge need not have waited for an objection from opposing counsel to
 bar immaterial questions.  A judge has the duty to see to the 
expeditious administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup>
 If the opposing counsel does not object to such questions, the judge 
cannot stand idly by and allow the examining counsel to propound 
endlessly questions that are clearly irrelevant, immaterial, improper or
 tend to be repetitious.  The action by the judge in this case, 
therefore, cannot be deemed prejudicial; indeed, it is entirely proper. 
 In Ventura et al. vs. Judge Yatco,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> we said:
</p><p>
About the active part that the judge took in the trial, the court finds 
that said active part was for the purpose of expediting the trial and 
directing the course thereof in accordance with the issues.  While 
judges should as much as possibly refrain from showing partiality to one
 party, it does not mean that a trial judge should keep mum throughout 
the trial and allow parties that they desire, on issues which they think
 are the important issues, when the former are improper and the latter, 
immaterial.  If trials are to be expedited, judges must take a leading 
part therein, by directing counsel to submit the evidence on the facts 
in dispute, by asking clarifying questions and by showing an interest in
 a fast and fair trial.  Judges are not mere referees like those of a 
boxing bout, only to watch and decide the results of the game; they have
 as much interest as counsel in the orderly and expeditious presentation
 of evidence, calling attention of counsel to points at issues that are 
overlooked, directing them to ask questions that would elicit the facts 
on the issues involved, clarifying ambiguous remarks by witnesses, etc. 
 Unless they take an active part in trials in the above form and manner,
 and allow counsel to ask questions, whether pertinent or impertinent, 
material or immaterial, the speedy administration of justice which is 
the aim of the Government and of the people cannot be attained.  Counsel
 should, therefore, not resent any interest that the judge takes in the 
conduct of the trial, they should be glad that a trial judge takes such 
interest and help in the determination of the truth.
</p><p>
It is also argued that the judge showed her “uneven hand”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup>
 when she overruled objections interposed by the defense when it was the
 prosecution’s turn to examine SPO3 Santos.  This was supposedly in 
contrast to the above actuation exhibited by the judge when the defense 
was examining the same witness.

    FISCAL CAJIGAL:

    Q    Please tell to the Court what were the specific instructions 
given by your Commanding Officer before you effected the buy-bust

  <p>
    ATTY. IFURUNG:
  </p>
  <p>
    We object in the first place, there was no statement by the eye

respect to that buy-bust operation.

  </p>
  <p>
    Overruled, witness may answer.

</blockquote>
<p>
A     We conducted surveillance on the area where we are going to.  And 
if we were already there, I will approach him and I will pose as a 
buyer.  And if I can see that there is shabu, then I will arrest him, 
sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup>
</p><p>
We discern no bias in the foregoing proceedings.  The questions of the 
prosecutor were proper, and the objections of defense counsel were 
correctly overruled.
</p><p>
The prosecutor’s question as to whether the Commanding Officer 
determines if the operation should be a buy-bust or a raid was objected 
to for not having been taken up on direct examination.  The question, 
however, was merely preliminary and was posed to lay the foundation for 
the next question, that is, whether it was the Commanding Officer who 
determined if fluorescent powder should be placed on the boodle money or
 not.  The latter question, too, was within the bounds of the rules of 
evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> for defense counsel had previously asked questions whether fluorescent powder was used in the operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup>
 The question was intended to blunt any implication from defense 
counsel’s questions that  SPO3 Santos was somehow responsible for the 
non-use of fluorescent powder in the buy-bust operation.  In response, 
SPO3 Santos said that the decision to use fluorescent powder rested in 
the Commanding Officer.  Contrary to defense counsel’s objection, SPO3 
Santos was equally competent to answer this question.  He was a 
subordinate of the Commanding Officer and a member of that particular 
command, and therefore knowledgeable of the decision-making policies 
therein.
</p><p>
The judge’s query as to why SPO3 Santos pretended to be a drug pusher 
was completely relevant in determining the legality of the entrapment.  
Moreover, the defense counsel had asked during the direct examination if
 SPO3 Santos lied when he allegedly told the accused that he was a drug 
pusher.  The judge merely asked why he lied.  The question was clearly 
clarificatory.
</p><p>
Neither do we find anything objectionable to the prosecutor’s question 
on whether the accused were arrested after SPO3 Santos handed over the 
money to them.  It is not clear from the transcript what exactly was the
 ground for counsel’s objection.
</p><p>
Lastly, the judge did not err in overruling counsel’s objection to the 
questions pertaining to the Commanding Officer’s specific instructions 
to SPO3 Santos for, on re-direct examination, Atty. Ifurung, counsel for
 the defense, asked:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    Q    What is the name of your Commanding Officer?
      <br>
      A     Sr. Ins. Franklin Mabanag, sir.

  <p>
    ATTY. IFURUNG:
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    So, you just follow instructions from your Commanding Officer?
      <br>
      A     Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    And you were instructed by your Commanding Officer to effect the arrest of Carlos Tan Ty?
      <br>
      A     Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    And you were instructed to effect his arrest under any circumstances?
      <br>
      A     Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    FISCAL CAJIGAL:
  </p>
  <p>
    Misleading, your Honor.
  </p>
  <p>
    ATTY. IFURUNG:

  <p>
    That will be all, your Honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup>

</blockquote>
<p>
Upon the conclusion of the re-direct examination, the adverse party may 
re-cross-examine the witness on matters stated in his re-direct 
examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup>
</p><p>
In sum, we find that the judge, in propounding questions to the 
witnesses, in overruling ungrounded objections and disallowing improper 
questions by the defense, did not exhibit any bias against the accused. 
 On the contrary, the judge demonstrated nothing more than an unwavering
 quest for the truth and a rightful intolerance for impertinence, fully 
cognizant of her duties and of the scope of her discretion.
</p><p align="center">
III
</p><p>
Appellants contend that the trial court erred in sustaining the refusal 
by Sr. Insp. Mabanag to divulge the identity of Stardust, the woman who 
informed the police about the two accused.  It is claimed that such 
refusal violated the right of the accused to confront and cross-examine 
said witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup>
</p><p>
As a rule, informers are not presented in court because of the need to 
preserve their cover so they can continue their invaluable service to 
the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Equally strong
 reasons include the maintenance of the informant’s health and safety 
and the encouragement of others to report wrongdoing to police 
authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> The rule against disclosure is not absolute, however.  In Roviaro v. United States,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> the United States Supreme Court declared:
</p><p>
What is usually referred to as the informer’s privilege is in reality 
the Government’s privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of 
persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged
 with enforcement of that law. [Citations omitted.]  The purpose of the 
privilege is the furtherance and protection of the public interest in 
effective law enforcement.  The privilege recognizes the obligation of 
citizens to communicate their knowledge of the commission of crimes to 
law-enforcement officials and, by preserving their anonymity, encourages
 them to perform that obligation.
</p><p>
The scope of the privilege is limited by its underlying purpose.   Thus,
 where the disclosure of the contents of a communication will not tend 
to reveal the identity of an informer, the contents are not privileged. 
 Likewise, once the identity of the informer has been disclosed to those
 who would have cause to resent the communication, the privilege is no 
longer applicable.
</p><p>
A further limitation on the applicability of the privilege arises from 
the fundamental requirements of fairness.  Where the disclosure of an 
informer’s identity, or of the contents of his communication, is 
relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a 
fair determination of a cause, the privilege must give way.  In these 
situations the trial court may require disclosure and, if the Government
 withholds the information, dismiss the action. 
</p><p align="center">
x x x
</p><p>
We believe that no fixed rule with respect to disclosure is justifiable.
  The problem is one that calls for balancing the public interest in 
protecting the flow of information against the individual’s right to 
prepare his defense.  Whether a proper balance renders nondisclosure 
erroneous must depend on the particular circumstances of each case, 
taking into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the 
possible significance of the informer’s testimony, and other relevant 
factors.
</p><p>
Before disclosure of the informer’s identity may be allowed, however, 
the defense must, before or during the trial, request the production of 
the confidential informant or his identification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup>
 (Thus, in Roviaro the accused repeatedly demanded disclosure.)  In 
addition, the defendants must show how the identity of the informer is 
essential to their defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup>
</p><p>
In this case, counsel for appellant Carlos Tan Ty indeed requested the 
trial court to compel Sr. Insp. Mabanag, who was then testifying on 
direct examination, to reveal the identity of Stardust:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    Q:   What is the real name of Stardust?
      <br>
      A:    For security reason, we cannot give her name, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q:   Is it not a fact Mr. Mabanag, that this informant was the one who arrange for the selling of shabu?
      <br>
      A:    Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q:   In other words this Stardust is known to the accused?
      <br>
      A:    Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q:   So there is no reason for you to hide the identity of the 
informant considering that according to you she is known to the accused?
      <br>
      A:    Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q:   In fact she was the one who allegedly arrange for the buying of the alleged shabu?
      <br>
      A:    Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
  Q:   Will you please give her name?
    <br>
    A:    For security reason I cannot give her name, because we are putting the very life of the informant to danger, sir
  </p>
  <p>
  Atty. Ifurung:
  </p>
  <p>
  Your Honor please may we request the witness to give the name of the 
alleged informant since according to him she is known to the accused, so
 there is no reason for the witness to keep the identity of the 
informant, so may we request that the Court directs the witness to 
divulge the identity of the informant
  </p>
  <p>
  Court:
  </p>
  <p>
  She might be known but the court will not compel the witness to 
divulge the identity of the informant for security reason as alleged by 
the witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Appellants nevertheless failed to show at the time of their request how 
the identity of the informer or her production was essential to their 
defense.  In <em>State v. Driscoll,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup>
 the defense, during the cross-examination of the State’s final witness,
 asked the witness the name of the informant.  The prosecution objected 
to the question for being outside the scope of the direct examination.  
The court sustained the objection, stating “I will not compel him to 
answer that question if he desires not to at this time.” The state 
rested and the defendant presented his evidence without renewing his 
request for the disclosure of the identity of the informer.  The 
defendant was subsequently convicted for burglary.  On appeal, the 
defendant assigned as error the trial court’s refusal to require 
disclosure of the identity of the informer.  The Supreme Court of 
Washington held that the trial court did not commit error in ruling 
thus.  It held:
</p><p>
In the instant case, the request came from the defendant at the time and
 in the manner hereinabove set out, and was not in any fashion 
thereafter renewed.  The defendant, at the time of the request, did not 
advise the trial court of his proposed defense of entrapment nor 
undertake, in any way, to enlighten the trial court as to the 
materiality of relevancy of the requested disclosure.   The ruling at 
that particular stage of the proceedings was to the effect that 
disclosure would not be required at that time.  The door was thus open 
to subsequent showing and request.
</p><p>
The Supreme Court of North Carolina in State v. Boles, 246 N.C. 83, 85, 
97 S.E. 2nd 476, 477, in considering a like claim of error under 
analogous circumstances, stated
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “In passing on defendant’s assignments based on exceptions Nos. 4 
and 5, we must do so in the light of the facts before Judge Johnston at 
the time he made the ruling complained of.   At that time there was no 
conflict in the testimony.    Nothing appeared in the evidence 
concerning the informer except the fact that he was present when the 
witness made the purchase.  We hold that the defendant did not make a 
sufficient showing to require the disclosure.  The court’s refusal to 
order it under the circumstances was not error. </p>
  <p align="center">
    *     *                                 *                                 *     *         *
  </p>
  <p> “Had the defendant, in the light of this conflict [a conflict in 
the evidence developed by defendant’s testimony], requested the name of 
the confidential informer as a possible defense witness, a more serious 
question would have been presented.   That question, however, was not 
before Judge Johnston and consequently is not before us.  The propriety 
of disclosing the identity of an informer must depend on the 
circumstances of the case and at what stage of the proceedings the 
request is made.  Roviaro v. United States, [decided 25 March, 1957, 353
 U.S. 53, 1 L.Ed.2d 639] 77 S.Ct. 623.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Under the circumstances of the instant case, we hold the trial court did not commit error in the ruling complained of.
</p><p>
Like in Driscoll, the defense in this case did not renew their request 
for the production of the informer’s identity.  Nor did they advise the 
trial court of their defense or the relevancy of such disclosure when 
they demanded the production of Stardust’s identity.  When Sr. Insp. 
Mabanag was put on the stand, there was no hint that the accused was 
going to raise frame-up, extortion, and instigation as defenses.  The 
accused had not yet testified; neither had appellant Carlos Tan Ty’s 
wife, Mary Ann.  The defense did not raise the question of the 
informer’s identity again after these witnesses testified.
</p><p>
The burden of showing need for disclosure is upon defendants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup>
 The necessity for disclosure depends upon “the particular circumstances
 of each case, taking into consideration the crime charged, the possible
 defenses, the possible significance of the informer’s testimony, and 
other relevant factors.” Appellants did not develop any such criteria 
with reference to the merits of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup>
 A mere request during a witness’ examination indicates speculation on 
the relevancy of his testimony; and mere speculation an informer may be 
helpful is not enough to carry the burden and overcome the public 
interest in the protection of the informer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Hence, the trial court did not err in sustaining the refusal of the witness to reveal the identity of Stardust.
</p><p align="center">
IV
</p><p>
We come now to the sufficiency of the prosecution evidence.
</p><p>
The elements necessary in every prosecution for the illegal sale of 
shabu are: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and
 the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the 
payment therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> The 
Court finds that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses adequately
 establish these elements.  The Court has no reason to doubt the 
following assessment of the trial court regarding the credibility of 
these witnesses:
</p><p>
An exhaustive scrutiny of the prosecution’s evidence shows that the 
accused were caught in flagrante delicto through a buy-bust operation 
staged b police operatives.  Both accused were positively identified by 
the poseur-buyer himself and by three (3) other members of the buy-bust 
team.  These eye witnesses for the prosecution were also consistent in 
their testimonies concerning the important details of the sale, to wit: 
 (1) that the informant was at the scene and it was she who identified 
the two accused, (2) that Gilbert Santos acted as poseur-buyer, (3) that
 the said poseur-buyer handed the boodle money to accused Carlos Tan Ty 
and the latter called his co-accused Nelson Hong Ty who handed to the 
poseur-buyer a blue plastic bag containing the regulated drug, 
Methamphetamine Hydrochloride or shabu.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup>
</p><p>
Appellate courts accord the highest respect to the assessment of 
witnesses’ credibility by the trial court, because the latter was in a 
position to observe their demeanor and deportment on the witness stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup>
</p><p>
Appellants however attempt to poke holes in the prosecution’s case.  
They theorize that the buy-bust operation was merely a contrivance as 
indicated by the following so-called “unmistakable hallmarks”:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    (a) a fictitious informant,
  </p>
  <p>
    (b) no pre-arrest test-buy,
  </p>
  <p>
    (c ) absence of pre-arrest surveillance,
  </p>
  <p>
    (d) use of bogus/boodle money,
  </p>
  <p>
    (e) drug sale in public,
  </p>
  <p>
    (f) no record of operation in the police blotter,
  </p>
  <p>
    (g) money not dusted with fluorescent powder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We are not swayed by this argument.
</p><p>
Appellants claim that the failure of the prosecution to present the 
informer in court demonstrates that the informer is fictitious and gives
 rise to the presumption that her testimony would be adverse if 
produced.
</p><p>
The rule in determining whether the informer should be presented for a 
successful prosecution in cases involving buy-bust operations is best 
stated in <em>People vs. Doria</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup>
</p><p>
Except when the appellant vehemently denies selling prohibited drugs and
 there are material consistencies in the testimonies of the arresting 
officers, or there are reasons to believe that the arresting officers 
had motives to testify falsely against the appellant, or that only the 
informant as the poseur-buyer who actually witnessed the entire 
transaction, the testimony of the informant may be dispensed with as it 
will be merely corroborative of the apprehending officers’ eyewitness 
testimonies.  There is no need to present the informant in court where 
the sale was actually witnessed and adequately proved by prosecution 
witnesses.
</p><p>
None of the above circumstances obtains in this case.  While appellants 
do deny selling shabu, there are no material inconsistencies in the 
testimonies of the arresting officers.  The arresting officers had no 
motive to testify against appellants; the claims of extortion against 
the arresting officers, as will be shown later, were not firmly 
established.  Finally, the informer was not even the poseur-buyer in the
 operation.  The sale was actually witnessed and adequately proved by 
the prosecution witnesses.  The presumption laid down in Section 3(e), 
Rule 131 of the Rules of Court, to wit: “(e) [t]hat evidence willfully 
suppressed would be adverse if produced,” therefore, does not apply 
since the testimony of the informer would be merely corroborative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup>
</p><p>
That no test buy was conducted before the arrest is of no moment for 
there is no rigid or textbook method of conducting buy-bust operations. 
 For the same reason, the absence of evidence of a prior surveillance 
does not affect the regularity of a buy-bust operation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> especially when, like in this case, the buy-bust team members were accompanied to the scene by their informant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup>
 The Court will not pretend to establish on a priori basis what detailed
 acts police authorities might credibly undertake and carry out in their
 entrapment operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> 
The selection of appropriate and effective means of entrapping drug 
traffickers is best left to the discretion of police authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup>
</p><p>
Appellants describe as implausible the testimony that they supposedly 
merely “looked” at the boodle money without counting it.  We find 
nothing dubious in appellants’ behavior.  Indeed, it is totally 
consistent with human nature.  Appellants were engaged in an illegal 
activity and it was necessary that they act inconspicuously.  The sale 
was consummated in public and appellants would invite unwanted attention
 if they counted the money right in busy Monumento.
</p><p>
Appellants also fault the police officers for not observing the 
purported “proper procedure” in the marking and the blotter of the P500 
bills used as part of the boodle money. They failed to establish, 
however, that such a procedure existed.  Sr. Insp. Mabanag, on the other
 hand, testified that they do not even maintain a police blotter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup>since they were a special operation unit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup>
</p><p>
That the sale was in public does not diminish the prosecution witnesses’
 credibility or the trustworthiness of their testimony.  In <em>People vs. Zervoulakos</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup>
 we observed that “the sale of prohibited drugs to complete strangers, 
openly and in public places, has become a common occurrence.  Indeed, it
 is sad to note the effrontery and growing casualness of drug pushers in
 the pursuit of their illicit trade, as if it were a perfectly 
legitimate operation.”
</p><p>
Appellants submit, however, that this ruling applies only to “small 
level drug trafficking,” and not to cases involving a substantial amount
 of drugs, such as the one at bar.  The distinction is illusory for it 
is not improbable for large transactions involving drugs to take place 
under the cover of commonplaceness.  A kilo of shabu can be transported 
and delivered with facility in public and it does not tax credulity that
 such transactions indeed occur.   While the sale may have been made to a
 stranger, the lure for easy profits can easily outweigh the risk of 
arrest and prosecution.  Moreover, the risk was reduced by the 
introduction by the informant, who had regular contact with appellant <em>Carlos Tan Ty</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> of the poseur-buyer to the latter.
</p><p>
Equally without merit is the argument that the buy-bust was not recorded
 in the police blotter is proof of a sham buy-bust.  A prior blotter 
report is neither indispensable nor required in buy-bust operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup>
</p><p>
Lastly, the failure of the NARCOM agents to use fluorescent powder on 
the boodle money is no indication that the buy-bust operation did not 
take place.  Like a prior blotter report, the use of fluorescent powder 
is not indispensable in such operations.  The use of initials to mark 
the money used in the buy-bust operation has been accepted by this 
Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> The prosecution has the prerogative to choose the manner of marking the money to be used in the buy-bust operation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup>
</p><p>
Appellants raise the defense of frame-up.  Frame-up is the usual defense of those accused in drug related cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> and it is viewed by the Court with disfavor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> since it is an allegation that can be made with ease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup>
 For this claim to prosper, the defense must adduce clear and convincing
 evidence to overcome the presumption that government officials have 
performed their duties in a regular and proper manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup>
 Appellants have failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that 
they were framed by the NARCOM agents.  Appellants’ testimonies were 
corroborated merely by Norlito Dotimas and Mary Ann Ty.  Norlito 
Dotimas’ credibility, however, remains doubtful because of his 
suspicious behavior and evasive answers while on the witness stand.  
Mary Ann Ty, on the other hand, is the common-law wife of appellant 
Carlos Tan Ty and the mother of his three children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup>
 She has a natural interest in favoring appellants.  Pitted against the 
presumption that government officials have performed their duties in a 
regular and proper manner, the evidence for the defense simply cannot 
prevail.
</p><p>
The claim of extortion is similarly untenable.  Like an alleged 
frame-up, a supposed extortion by police officers is a standard defense 
in drug cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup>and must also be proven by clear and convincing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup>
 Again, appellants have failed to discharge this burden.  Such a claim 
is supported only by the same unreliable evidence to support the claim 
of frame-up.
</p><p>
Appellants submit in the alternative that the facts as presented by the 
prosecution reveal that the law enforcers instigated appellants to sell 
shabu to them.  We find no instigation in this case.
</p><p>
x x x the general rule is that it is no defense to the perpetrator of a 
crime that facilities for its commission were purposely placed in his 
way, or that the criminal act was done at the ‘decoy solicitation’ of 
persons seeking to expose the criminal, or that detectives feigning 
complicity in the act were present and apparently assisting in its 
commission.  Especially is this true in that class of cases where the 
offense is one of a kind habitually committed, and the solicitation 
merely furnishes evidence of a course of conduct.  Mere deception by the
 detective will not shield defendant, if the offense was committed by 
him free from the influence or the instigation of the detective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup>
</p><p>
Here, the law enforcers received a report from their informant that 
appellants were “big time” drug pushers.  Poseur-buyer SPO3 Santos then 
pretended to be engaged in the drug trade himself and, with the help of 
his fellow NARCOM agents, arrested appellants in the act of delivering 
the shabu.  Hence, appellants were merely caught in the act of plying 
their illegal trade.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup>
</p><p>
Contrary to appellants’ contentions, no tinge of unconstitutionality attended the arrest of appellants. What we said in <em>People vs. Liquen</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup>is sufficient to dispose of this argument:
</p><p>
In the case at bar, the buy-bust operation was formed by the police 
officers precisely to test the veracity of the tip and in order to 
apprehend the perpetrator.  Having caught the culprit red-handed as a 
result of the buy-bust operation, Garcia and his team-mates were not 
only authorized but were also under obligation to apprehend the drug 
pusher even without a warrant of arrest.  Section 5 (a) of Rule 113 of 
the Revised Rule on Criminal Procedure, reads in part as follows: 
“Sec.5. <em>Arrest without warrant; when lawful</em>—A peace officer or a
 private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person: (a) When, in 
his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually 
committing, or is attempting to commit an offense; x x x.”
</p><p>
Clearly, the situation in the case at bar is one where a person commits a
 crime in the presence of a police officer; hence, the latter may 
validly arrest the offender even without first obtaining a warrant of 
arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup>
</p><p>
There can be no doubt, therefore, that appellants are guilty of the sale of methamphetamine hydrochloride, a regulated drug,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> in violation of Section 15 of the Dangerous Drugs Act,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> as amended.
</p><p>
Conspiracy between the appellants was evident. The transaction was 
successfully consummated between the poseur-buyer and appellant Carlos 
Tan Ty, together with his companion, appellant Nelson Hong Ty, with one 
receiving the marked money and the other delivering the contraband to 
the poseur buyer.  No other logical conclusion would follow from the 
duo’s concerted action except that they had a common purpose and 
community of interest, the accepted <em>indicia</em> that could establish the existence of conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup>
 Conspiracy having been established, the accused are answerable as 
co-principals regardless of the degree of their participation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup>
</p><p>
“Conspiracy,”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> as used 
herein, refers to the manner of incurring criminal liability, and not a 
crime in itself.  Conspiracy is not punishable except when the law 
specifically provides a penalty therefor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> such as in conspiracies to commit treason,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> coup d’etat,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> rebellion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> sedition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> and the sale of dangerous drugs.  The last is punishable under Section 21(b) of the Dangerous Drugs Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup>
</p><p>
When the conspiracy relates to a crime actually committed, the 
conspiracy is absorbed; it does not constitute a separate crime, but is 
only a manner of incurring criminal liability.  The participants to the 
crime are merely held equally liable since the act of one is the act of 
all.  It was thus error for the trial court to convict appellants for 
“Section 15, Article III, RA 6425 [punishing the sale of regulated 
drugs] in relation to Section 21-B [penalizing the conspiracy to sell 
regulated drugs] of the same Act.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup>
 In this case, the crime (the sale of regulated drugs), and not only the
 conspiracy (to sell the same) was actually committed.  To hold 
appellants liable for violation of Section 15 alone, therefore, would be
 more precise and more in accord with the principles of criminal law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup>

V
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    We arrive at the imposition of the proper penalty.
  </p>
  <p>
    Section 15 of the Dangerous Drugs Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659 states:
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
SEC. 15.  <em>Sale, Administration, Dispensation, Delivery, Transportation and Distribution of Regulated Drugs</em>.-  The penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>
 to death and a fine ranging from five hundred thousand persos to ten 
million pesos shall be imposed upon any person who, unless authorized by
 law, shall sell, dispense, deliver, transport or distribute any 
regulated drug.
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 20 of this Act to the 
contrary, if the victim of the offense is a minor, or should a regulated
 drug involved in any offense under this Section be the proximate cause 
of the death of a victim thereof, the maximum penalty herein provided 
shall be imposed.
</p><p>
In relation thereto, Section 20 of the same law, as amended, provides:
</p><p>
SEC. 20.  <em>Application of Penalties, Confiscation and Forfeiture of the Proceeds or instruments of the Crime</em>.-
  The penalties for offenses under Sections 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 of Article 
II and Sections 14, 14-A, 15 and 16 of Article III of this Act shall be 
applied if the dangerous drugs involved is in any of the following 
quantities:
</p><ol><li>40 grams or more of opium;
</li><li>40 grams or more of morphine;
</li><li>200 grams or more of shabu or methylamphetamine hydrochloride;
</li><li>40 grams of more of heroin;
</li><li>750 grams or more of indian hemp or marijuana;
</li><li>50 grams or more of marijuana resin or marijuana resin oil;
</li><li>
40 grams of more of cocaine or cocaine hydrochloride; or
</li><li>
In the case of other dangerous drugs, the quantity of which is far 
beyond therapeutic requirements, as determined and promulgated by the 
Dangerous Drugs Board, after public consultations/hearings conducted for
 the purpose.
</li></ol>
Otherwise, if the quantity involved is less than the foregoing quantities, the penalty shall range from prision correccional to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> depending upon the quantity.
<p>
From the foregoing provisions, the penalty for the sale of regulated 
drugs is based, as a rule, on the quantity thereof.  The exception is 
where the victim is a minor or where the regulated drug involved is the 
proximate cause of the death of the victim.  In such cases, the maximum 
penalty prescribed in Section 15, i.e., death, shall be imposed, 
regardless of the quantity of the prohibited drugs involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup>
 Appellants, therefore, cannot be sentenced to suffer the death penalty 
under this exception, the conditions for its imposition not being 
present.  Their penalty ought to be determined by the quantity of 
methamphetamine hydrochloride involved in the sale.
</p><p>
To recall, appellants sold the NARCOM operatives a substance weighing 
992.3 grams.  This amount is more than the minimum of 200 grams required
 by the law to warrant the imposition of either <em>reclusion perpetua</em> or, if there be aggravating circumstances, the death penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup>
 Appellants however foist the probability that the substance sold could 
contain additives or adulterants, and not just methamphetamine 
hydrochloride.  Thus, the actual weight of pure shabu could be less than
 992.3 grams, thereby possibly reducing the imposable penalty.
</p><p>
The contention has no merit.  We rejected a similar argument in People vs. Tang Wai Lan:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup>
</p><p>
Accused-appellant then argues that the tests were not done for the 
entire amount of drugs allegedly found inside the bags.  It is suggested
 that since the law, Republic Act No. 7659, imposes a penalty dependent 
on the amount or quantity of drugs seized or take, then laboratory tests
 should be undertaken for the entire amount or quantity of drugs seized 
in order to determine the proper penalty to be imposed.
</p><p>
The argument is quaint and even borders on being ridiculous.  In the 
present case, even assuming that the confirmatory tests were conducted 
on samples taken from only one (1) of the plastic packages, 
accused-appellant’s arguments must still fail.
</p><p>
It will be recalled that each of the plastic packages weighed 1.1 
kilograms, an amount more than sufficient to justify imposing the 
penalty under Sec. 14 of Rep. Act. No. 6425 as amended by Rep. Act No. 
7659.  A sample taken from one (1) of the packages is logically presumed
 to be representative of the entire contents of the package unless 
proven otherwise by accused-appellant.  Therefore, a positive result for
 the presence of drugs is indicative that there is 1.1 kilogram of drugs
 in the plastic package from which the sample was taken.  If it is then 
proved, beyond reasonable doubt, x x x that accused appellant 
transported into the Philippines the plastic packages from which samples
 were taken for tests, and found positive as prohibited drugs, then 
conviction for importing “shabu” is definitely in order.  (Italics in 
the original.  Underscoring supplied.)
</p><p>
Thus, if the prosecution proves that the sample is positive for 
methamphetamine hydrochloride, it can be presumed that the entire 
substance seized is shabu.  The burden of evidence shifts to the accused
 who must prove otherwise.  Appellants in this case have not presented 
any evidence to overcome the presumption.
</p><p>
The sale of 200 or more grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride, a regulated drug,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> is punishable by <em>reclusion perpetua</em> to death, and a fine ranging from P500,000 to P10,000,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> No aggravating circumstances attended the commission of the crime.  Hence, appellants can only be sentenced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. 
</p><p>
The personal corporal punishment must be complemented by the pecuniary 
penalty provided therein.  With respect to the latter, the courts may 
determine the amount of the fine within the range provided by law, 
subject to the rule on increasing or reducing the same by degrees as 
provided by the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup>
