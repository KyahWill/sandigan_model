Aside from prosecution witness Lincoln Leyretana, there were thirteen other passengers on board the passenger jeepney (Ibid).<br><br>"Suddenly, Luisito Angeles, a passenger of the Jeepney, was shot twice at close range by the person seat[ed] next to the prosecution witness Lincoln Leyretana (ibid).&nbsp; Thereafter, the assailant alighted from the passenger jeepney and shot again the victim twice (p. 7, ibid).&nbsp; Prosecution witness Lincoln Leyretana saw the assailant board another passenger jeepney [in front] of the Aurora Market, Quezon City (p. 8, ibid).&nbsp; Meanwhile, prosecution witness Lincoln Leyretana, together with several other male passengers and the driver, brought Luisito Angeles to the nearest hospital where Luisito Angeles was pronounced dead on arrival (ibid).<br><br>"From the hospital, prosecution witness Lincoln Leyretana and several other passengers of the jeepney proceeded to the police station where they gave their sworn statements to the police (ibid).&nbsp; The investigation of the shooting incident was handled by SPO3 Juan Dacillo.&nbsp; On February 6, 1988, prosecution witness Lincoln Leyretana accompanied the group of SPO3 Juan Dacillo to Marikina City where appellant was allegedly seen by another prosecution witness, Carmelita Mendoza (ibid).&nbsp; He saw appellant riding a passenger bus and pinpointed him to the police authorities (ibid).&nbsp; The police officers followed the passenger bus and boarded the same.&nbsp; They apprehended appellant who introduced himself as a police officer.<br><br>"[O]n the afternoon of February 8, 19<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>8, appellant escaped.<br><br>"On January 5, 1989, an Information charging appellant [with] murder was filed.<br><br>"On December 13, 1995, appellant was arrested in Nueva Ecija."</blockquote><br><br><center><b><u><i>Version of the Defense</i></u></b></center><br><br>In his Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> appellant interposes denial and alibi and relates his version of the facts in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>"Appellant categorically and emphatically denied the charge and invoked the defense of alibi, claiming that he was at his place of work in Pasig on the date and time of the incident complained of, x x x work attendance [on which] was confirmed by the defense witness, SPO1 Arsenio Eugenio, and that he [did] not know the person of Luisito Angeles.&nbsp; Appellant likewise proved that Luis Angeles (father of the deceased) and Carmelita Angeles Mendoza (aunt of the deceased) were once in the place of appellant's friend, Priscilla De Guzman; that when appellant pacified them while they were arguing about their business, Luis Angeles got mad at him, telling him not to intervene; that at the police station on 6 February 1998, appellant heard Mr. Leyretana saying to SPO3 Dacillo `malayo naman sa hitsura doon sa sketch' but the latter replied, `ituro mo na lang;' that appellant left the police station after being pinpointed by Mr. Leyretana because nobody minded him; that appellant was arrested on his birthday, 13 December 1995, at Nueva Ecija; and that when the appellant was in jail, a man took pictures of him many times while Mr. Leyretana and Carmelita Mendoza visited him."</blockquote><br><br><center><b><u>Trial Court's Ruling</u></b></center><br><br>Rejecting appellant's defense, the trial court gave full faith and credence to the testimony of the lone eyewitness.&nbsp; It ruled thus:<br><br><blockquote>"This Court finds no substantial imperfection in the testimony of Mr. Leyretana who saw the accused and observed the manner in which he killed the victim who was in a defenseless state on board a passenger jeepney, as well as in the testimony of Carmelita Mendoza whose account of the earlier circumstances involving the accused from 4:00 a.m. of December 16, 1987 until the victim went out of their house proves the act manifestly indicating the determination to make possible the succeeding incident witnessed by Mr. Leyretana.<br><br>"Accused interposes alibi as a defense which cannot prevail over his positive identification by an eyewitness, Lincoln Leyretana, who has no motive to falsely testify.&nbsp; Moreover, it was not sufficiently established that it was physically impossible for accused to be in the scene of the crime at Aurora Boulevard, Quezon City, at 5:30 a.m., the time complained of.&nbsp; Then, too, it bears noting that while it was the direct testimony of the accused that he was at his place of work in Pasig on December 16, 1987, he also testified on cross examination that he reported for work on December 16, 1987 at 7:00 a.m.<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Outside said office, one of the police officers `threatened' Natividad, for he desisted from joining them while Primavera, et al. watched from inside the jeep.&nbsp; Thereafter, they all proceeded `together' to the MMP Headquarters where the police officers directed Natividad to join a line-up of ten (10) men. Then, the police officers called the two women (Primavera and Galvadores) and the man (Soliman) and asked them to make the identification<i>.&nbsp; It can thus be readily seen that at the premises of the Allied Brokerage Corporation office, the police officers literally paraded Natividad before Primavera et al. whom they purposely `fetched' from the Manila Christian Guesthome `to see' Natividad."&nbsp; </i>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In <i>Natividad</i>, there was impermissible suggestion because the policemen let the witness know from the start who their suspect was. In the present case, while the police already had a suspect, they did not reveal his identity to Leyretana. In fact, it was the witness himself who pointed out the culprit to them.<br><br><b><u><i>Right to Counsel During<br>Police Lineup</i></u></b><br><br>Appellant also argues that the identification made by Leyretana during the police lineup was inadmissible, because the former was not assisted by counsel at the time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The argument contradicts settled jurisprudence.&nbsp; The Court has held that the assistance of counsel is not essential during a police lineup.&nbsp; Thus, the Court ruled in People v.

It has also been held that an uncounseled identification at the police line-up does not preclude the admissibility of an in-court identification."</blockquote><br><b><u><i>Appellant's Flight</i></u></b><br><br>Further militating against the cause of appellant was his flight.&nbsp; The records show that he escaped from the police station after his arrest.&nbsp; He explained that "[w]hen nobody minded me, I already left the place."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> At the time, he already knew that he would be charged.&nbsp; Instead of defending his innocence, he escaped from the law, even if it meant being AWOL from his post as a policeman.&nbsp; Clearly, his flight evinced his guilt.<br><br><center><b><u><br>Collateral Issues</u></b></center><br><br><b><u><i>Appellant's Alibi</i></u></b><br><br>Appellant insists that he was in his office in Pasig City when the crime was committed.&nbsp; This argument scarcely deserves consideration.&nbsp; The well-settled rule is that alibi is a weak defense, which cannot prevail over the positive identification of the accused by a credible witness,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> as in this case.<br><br><b><u><i>Treachery and Evident<br>Premeditation</i></u></b><br><br>We agree with the trial court that the killing was qualified by treachery.&nbsp; This qualifying circumstance is appreciated when the attack was executed in such a manner as to ensure the offender's safety from any defense or retaliatory act of the offended party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In the present case, appellant shot the unsuspecting victim point-blank inside the jeepney.&nbsp; Not content, once outside, the former shot the latter two more times.<br><br>We disagree with the ruling, however, that evident premeditation was present.&nbsp; The prosecution failed to establish the following elements of this aggravating circumstance:&nbsp; (a) the time when the accused determined to commit the crime, (b) an act manifestly indicating that the accused clung to that determination, and (c) a lapse of time between the determination and the execution sufficient to allow the accused to reflect upon the consequences of the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> That appellant had been seen near the victim's house a few minutes before the shooting did not by itself establish evident premeditation.<br><br><b><u><i>Proper Penalty<br>And Civil Liabilities</i></u></b><br><br>Be that as it may, the trial court correctly sentenced appellant to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.&nbsp; When the crime was committed in 1987, the penalty for murder was <i>reclusion temporal, </i>in its maximum term, to death.&nbsp; There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstance, the penalty should be imposed in its medium term, which is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The trial court correctly awarded the amount of P50,000 as indemnity ex delicto.&nbsp; Pursuant to current jurisprudence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> this is awarded without need of proof other than the commission of the crime. We also sustain the awards of P95,500 as actual damages and P20,000 as moral damages, for these were supported by evidence.<br><br>We disagree, however, with the award of P150,000 for loss&nbsp; of earning capacity. The amount of indemnity for such loss is based on the income at the time of death and the probable life expectancy of the victim.&nbsp; It should also be stressed that this indemnity refers to the victim's total earnings minus the necessary living expenses.&nbsp; In computing this award, the Court has used the following formula:<br><br><blockquote>"2/3&nbsp; x&nbsp; (80 -&nbsp; age of the victim at the time of death)&nbsp; x&nbsp; (reasonable portion of the annual net income which would have been received as support by the heirs)"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br>In the present case, it was shown that the victim, a mechanical engineer, was 35 years old and earning P20,000 a month (or an annual income of P240,000) when he was killed.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, we believe that the amount of necessary living expenses should be fixed at P10,000 a month.&nbsp; Applying the above formula, the indemnity in the present case should be computed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>= 2/3&nbsp; x (80 - 35) x (P240,000 - P120,000)<br><br>= 2/3&nbsp; x&nbsp; 45&nbsp; x&nbsp; P120,000<br><br>= P3,600,000.</blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is hereby <i><b>DENIED</b> </i>and the assailed Decision <i><b>AFFIRMED</b>, </i>with the sole modification that the heirs of the victim are awarded P3,600,000 as indemnity for the lost earnings of the deceased, in addition to the other amounts awarded by the trial court.&nbsp; Costs against appellant.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br>Melo, (Chairman), Vitug, and Gonzaga-Reyes, JJ., concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" width="60%" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><sup> </sup>Rollo, pp. 21-40; records, pp. 216-235.&nbsp; This was written by Judge Thelma A.
