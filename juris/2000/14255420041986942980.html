				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Execrable as it so is, the crime of rape becomes even most odious when committed against a child of tender years by a man old enough to be her grandfather.<br><br>Accused-appellant, Zosimo Barredo, was charged with the crime of Rape in a criminal complaint, dated 13 May 1997, filed before Branch IV of the Regional Trial Court of Batangas City. Docketed Criminal Case No. 9003, the complaint, in its accusatory portion, read:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 19th day of March, 1997, at about 6:30 o’clock in the morning, at Barangay Talahib, Municipality of Tingloy, Province of Batangas, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie with and have carnal knowledge of one Riolyn Panganiban, eight (8) years and nine (9) months old, against her will and consent."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></blockquote>Arraigned on 15 October 1997, accused-appellant Barredo, assisted by counsel, entered a plea of not guilty to the offense charged.<br><br><i>The case for the prosecution</i>. –<br><br>On 19 March 1997, at about 6:30 in the morning, eight-year old Riolyn Panganiban, together with accused-appellant Zosimo Barredo, whom Riolyn would fondly address "<i>Tio Simo</i>," were walking downhill along the Barangay road in Talahib, Tingloy, Batangas. Barredo requested Riolyn to accompany him to the retail store of one <i>Tiya Deling</i> on the pretext of buying some sugar which she could then bring back to his wife since he was going elsewhere to attend a wake (<i>dasalan</i>). Along the way, accused-appellant propositioned Riolyn, i.e., "<i>Tayo maghindutan</i>," to which the complainant replied "<i>Ayaw ko po</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Accused-appellant persisted, carried Riolyn off the road, and then stopped at a nearby mango tree. He laid her on the ground, pulled down her underwear and covered her eyes with his hat and hands. She could feel that appellant was trying to insert his penis into her vagina. Riolyn felt pain but all she could do was to cry because appellant had threatened to kill her. His lust satisfied, he dressed up and told Riolyn to put back her underwear. From there, the two proceeded to <i>Tiya Deling’s</i> store. Accused-appellant gave Riolyn P2.00 to get some candies for the children at home.<br><br>Arriving home, Riolyn started to cry and told her mother what the accused had done to her. Her mother reported the incident to their Barangay Captain who took no time in inviting accused-appellant to the Tingloy Police Station. Riolyn, assisted by her mother, executed a "<i>sinumpaang salaysay</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> narrating the incident before the police authorities.<br><br>Riolyn was brought for medical examination to the Rural Health Physician, Dr. Maria Lourdes Gajitos, of Tingloy, Batangas. Her medical examination disclosed that the right hand of the victim was swollen and while her hymen was still intact, there was, however, erythema or redness near the vaginal opening.<br><br><i>The version of the defense</i>. -<br><br>Accused-appellant denied having raped Riolyn. In the morning of 19 March 1997, he said Riolyn went to his house, merely ten meters away where she and her family resided, asking for coffee and sugar but since he had none at the time, he asked Riolyn to instead come with him to buy some at the store of <i>Tiya Deling</i> about half a kilometer away. The two went. After buying coffee and sugar, Riolyn went back home alone since he had to assist a certain <i>Tiya Mensyang</i> in the observance of the 9th day of death of the latter’s son. He denied having raped Riolyn. The accusation, he asserted, had been filed only to get back at him because his wife was "mad" at Riolyn’s mother for failing to pay back the cash and goods she had borrowed from his wife.<br><br><i>Decision of the trial court</i>. -<br><br>On 04 May 1998, the trial court found accused-appellant guilty of the crime charged; it adjudged:<br><blockquote>"In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the Court is morally convinced that accused Zosimo Barredo, from the evidence adduced in this proceedings, did in fact and in truth had carnal knowledge, sexually abused-complainant Riolyn Panganiban, a nine year old child on March 19, 1997 at about 7:00 o’clock in the morning at Barangay Talahib, Tingloy Batangas. Wherefore, accused Zosimo Barredo is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Statutory Rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659. He is therefore sentenced to death by lethal injection pursuant to existing laws. He is further directed to pay complainant Riolyn Panganiban with the sum of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00) as compensatory and moral damages. With costs.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote>The death sentence having been meted by the trial court, the case has been elevated to this Court for automatic review.<br><br>Accused-appellant assigns the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:<br><blockquote><center>"I<br></center><br>"THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE, AND IN IMPOSING THE DEATH PENALTY.<br><br><center>"II<br></center><br>"THE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN ORDERING ACCUSED-APPELLANT TO PAY COMPLAINANT THE AMOUNT OF P100,000.00 AS COMPENSATORY AND MORAL DAMAGES."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>In essence, appellant assails the credibility of the victim pointing out supposed improbabilities in her testimony, focusing particularly on the following testimony of the victim, to wit:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">"Q.</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> When Zosimo Barredo inserted his penis to your organ, was your face still covered by the hat?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">"A.</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Yes, sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">"Q. </div></td><td><div align="justify">Why were you able to say that it was his organ being inserted to your organ because according to you, your face was covered?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">"A. </div></td><td><div align="justify"><i>Pakiramdam ko po’y parang iyon</i>.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">"COURT:</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">"Q.</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Did you actually see his penis?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">"A.</div></td><td><div align="justify"> No, sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">"Pros.

An entry into the vaginal orifice, however slight, consummates the offense.<br><br>Once again, the Court finds occasion to stress that the issue of credibility, the principal thrust of the defense in assailing the judgment of conviction, is a matter best addressed by the trial court who has the chance, much better than that of an appellate court, to observe the demeanor of the witness while testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> So, also, there has almost invariably been a marked receptivity by the courts in lending credence to the testimony<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of young victims of rape particularly when the sexual assault is committed while they are still in their tender years. If found to be credible, a lone testimony by the victim is considered enough to sustain a conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <br><br>In the absence of corroborative evidence, the court would not be prepared to accept the usual lame defense of denial over the straightforward and positive declaration of a victim.

When the woman is under twelve years of age or is demented.<br><br>"<i>The crime of rape shall be punished by reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>"Whenever the crime of rape is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br>"When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has become insane, the penalty shall be death.<br><br>"When the rape is attempted or frustrated and a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof, the penalty shall be <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<br><br>"When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, a homicide is committed, the penalty shall be death.<br><br>"The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><br>"1. When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.<br><br>"2. When the victim is under the custody of the police or military authorities;<br><br>"3. When the rape is committed in full view of the husband, parent, any of the children of other relatives within the third degree of consanguinity.<br><br>"4. When the victim is a religious or a child below seven (7) years old.<br><br>"5. When the offender knows that he is afflicted with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) disease.<br><br>"6. When committed by any member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines or the Philippine National Police or any law enforcement agency.<br><br>"7. When by reason or on the occasion of the rape, the victim has suffered permanent physical mutilation."<br></blockquote>The penalty for the crime of rape is generally one of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. Rape becomes punishable by death only if a qualifying circumstance is present, and none appears to be extant in the instant case. While the victim, Riolyn, is admittedly eight years and nine months old at the time of the commission of the offense, the offender, however, is not her parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim to warrant the imposition of the extreme penalty.<br><br>In its decision, the trial court awarded the sum of P100,000.00 by way of compensatory and moral damages without specifying the portion of the award that should respond to the particular kind of damages. In line with prevailing jurisprudence, the Court holds that the appellant should be ordered to pay the sum of P50,000.00 as civil liability <i>ex-delicto</i> and another P50,000.00 as moral damages.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the judgment of the Regional Trial Court, branch IV, of Batangas City convicting accused-appellant Zosimo Barredo of the crime of rape in Criminal Case No. 9003 is <i>AFFIRMED</i>, with the <i>MODIFICATION</i> that the penalty of death imposed by the trial court should be reduced, as it is hereby so reduced, to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. Accused-appellant is ordered to pay the complainant, Riolyn Panganiban the sum of P50,000.00 as civil liability <i>ex-delicto</i> and an additional amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages or a total amount of P100,000.00.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Purisima, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, Ynares-Santiago</i>, and <i>De Leon, Jr., JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> TSN, January 5, 1998, p. 13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Records, p. 5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 31.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> TSN, 19 November 1997, p. 5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> TSN, 05 January 1998, pp. 11-14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>People vs. Faigano</i>, 254 SCRA 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <i>People vs. Echegaray</i>, 257 SCRA 561.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>People vs. Palicte</i>, 229 SCRA 543; <i>People vs. Abella</i>, 228 SCRA 662; <i>People vs. Ligotan</i>, 262 SCRA 602.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> <i>People vs. Conde</i>, 252 SCRA 681.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>People vs. Casipit</i>, 232 SCRA 638; <i>People vs. Junio</i>, 237 SCRA 826.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> <i>People vs. Bulaybulay</i>, 248 SCRA 601.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> <i>People vs. Carizo</i>, 233 SCRA 687.</div>
