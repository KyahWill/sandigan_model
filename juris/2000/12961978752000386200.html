				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a decision <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 23, Iloilo City, finding accused-appellants Eddy Paneza and Oscar Servando, together with accused Ronnie Agomo-o, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> guilty of highway robbery under P.D.

Some of them went to Barangay Mapili to respond to the report of the incident.&nbsp; At around four o'clock in the morning of the following day, SPO1 Lasap and his companions found three empty shells of a 12-gauge shotgun.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> SPO1 Lasap is a first cousin of the victim Rodito Lasap.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Dr. Jason Palomado of the Passi District Hospital treated Freddie Agrabio for a wound on his left elbow.&nbsp; The wound was two centimeters in length and two centimeters in depth. Agrabio was discharged from the hospital the following morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Dr. Palomado issued a medical certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> stating that Agrabio needed treatment for a period of 9 to 30 days.<br><br>On September 28, 1993, Jocelyn Agomo-o went to the San Enrique Police Station and turned over a wrist watch allegedly taken during the hold-up. The watch was eventually returned to its owner, Jose Amador.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The defense of the accused was alibi.&nbsp; Ronnie Agomo-o claimed that he was at the Provincial Hospital with his mother from September 21 to September 23, 1993 to watch over his sick brother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Accused-appellant Eddy Paneza said he was in his aunt's house in Rizal, Palapala, Iloilo in the morning of September 22, 1993 and that, at around 10 o'clock, he accompanied his aunt, Teresa Escultero, to Brgy. Madarag, San Enrique, arriving there at three o'clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; They went there to talk with the family of the prospective husband of his aunt's daughter.&nbsp; Eddy Paneza slept in the groom's house and proceeded to Barangay Bawatan the following morning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Teresa Escultero corroborated Eddy Paneza's testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Lastly, Ma. Elena Servando, sister-in-law of Oscar Servando, testified that on September 22, 1993, accused-appellant Oscar Servando accompanied her to Sitio Baclayan, San Enrique to gather corn.&nbsp; They went back home at around six o'clock in the evening.&nbsp; They removed the corn ears from the cob and finished doing so at 11 o'clock that evening.&nbsp; The following morning, they dried the corn until the afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The lower court then rendered a decision on February 5, 1997 finding the accused guilty.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of its decision states:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Ronnie Agomo-o, Eddy Paneza and Oscar Servando GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violating the provisions of Section 3, Paragraph (b) of Presidential Decree No. 532, otherwise known as the Anti-Piracy and Anti-Highway Robbery Law of 1974, particularly the last portion thereof, and sentences them to suffer a penalty of imprisonment of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i>, and to pay the heirs of Rodito Lasap civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00.<br><br>The accused Ronnie Agomo-o, Eddy Paneza and Oscar Servando who are presently detained are entitled to be credited in full with the entire period of their preventive detention.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>It is from this judgment that Paneza and Servando appealed. Ronnie Agomo-o did not appeal.

Accused-appellants claim that the testimony of Freddie Agrabio was incredible and highly improbable.&nbsp; They contend that Agrabio could not have been beside the driver when the latter was shot; otherwise, he, too, would&nbsp; have been injured considering his proximity to the driver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> That Freddie Agrabio could also have been hit is sheer speculation and conjecture and, therefore, not a valid argument against the veracity of his testimony.&nbsp; Freddie Agrabio could not have been hit because Rodito Lasap was shot at close range.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The latter was shot on the chest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> hence, the scattered pellets only hit that area.&nbsp; Moreover, Freddie Agrabio was the only one seated in front of the jeepney beside the driver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Under such circumstances, the passenger could have moved away from the driver.&nbsp; He may have been seated next to the driver but not close enough to be within the range of the shotgun.<br><br>The trial court correctly relied on the positive identification of the accused made by Freddie Agrabio and Jose Amador.&nbsp; No reason has been advanced why the testimonies of these witnesses should not be believed.&nbsp; Hence, the trial court's evaluation of the witnesses' testimonies must be accorded great respect since it had the opportunity to observe and examine the witnesses' conduct and demeanor on the witness stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On direct examination, Freddie Agrabio testified as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">Q.</td><td width="90%" align="justify">Mr. Freddie Agrabio, on September 22, 1993, around 7:30 in the evening, more or less, could you remember where were you?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A.</td><td align="justify">Yes, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q.</td><td align="justify">Where were you?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A.</td><td align="justify">I was sitting in the front seat of the jeepney.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q.</td><td align="justify">Why were you there?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A.</td><td align="justify">I was going to town.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q.</td><td align="justify">Of what town?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A.</td><td align="justify">Passi.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q.</td><td align="justify">Where did you come from?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A.</td><td align="justify">From Sitio Gomez.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q.</td><td align="justify">What municipality?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A.</td><td align="justify">Sitio Gomez, Brgy.

For example, while Agrabio identified Eddy Paneza as the person who stabbed him,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Jose Amador said it was Oscar Servando.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Freddie Agrabio was also confused about the type of firearm Ronnie Agomo-o used, whether it was a pistolized homemade shotgun or something else.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Such discrepancies, however, in the testimonies of the witnesses do not detract from their truthfulness.&nbsp; These apparent inconsistencies may be attributed more from an honest mistake due to fleeting memory than from a deliberate intent to prevaricate.&nbsp; Instead of detracting from the truthfulness of the testimonies, the inconsistencies reinforce the witnesses' credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> What is important is that the testimonies of these witnesses corroborated each other in material points, to wit:&nbsp; (a) that the passenger jeepney they were riding on was stopped on the crossing to Barangay Mapili, San Enrique by an armed man in the person of Ronnie Agomo-o, accompanied by accused-appellants Eddy Paneza and Oscar Servando; (b) that after announcing a hold-up, Ronnie Agomo-o shot Rodito Lasap, the driver of the passenger jeepney; and, (c) that the accused then divested the passengers of their money and other valuables.<br><br>It is settled that so long as the witnesses' testimonies agree on substantial matters, the inconsequential inconsistencies and contradictions dilute neither the witnesses' credibility nor the verity of their testimonies.&nbsp; As this Court has held:<br><blockquote>In sum, the inconsistencies referred to by the defense are inconsequential.&nbsp; The points that mattered most in the eyewitnesses' testimonies were their presence at the <i>locus criminis,</i> their identification of the accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crime and their credible and corroborated narration of accused-appellant's manner of shooting Crisanto Suarez.&nbsp; To reiterate, inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses that refer to insignificant details do not destroy their credibility.&nbsp; Such minor inconsistencies even manifest truthfulness and candor erasing any suspicion of a rehearsed testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>In contrast to the clear and positive identification of Freddie Agrabio and Jose Amador, accused-appellants gave nothing but alibi and denial.&nbsp; They gave only self-serving testimonies, corroborated only by the testimonies of their relatives.&nbsp; As we have held, "[a]libi becomes less plausible when it is corroborated by relatives and friends who may then not be impartial witnesses."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Alibi is an inherently weak defense and must be rejected when the accused's identity is satisfactorily and categorically established by the eyewitnesses to the offense,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> especially when such eyewitnesses have no ill motive to testify falsely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In the case at bar, the defense failed to show that Freddie Agrabio and Jose Amador were motivated by ill will.<br><br>Furthermore, accused-appellants' defense of alibi and denial cannot be believed as they themselves admitted their proximity to the scene of the crime when the offense occurred.&nbsp; Eddy Paneza testified that, at the time of the incident, he was in Barangay Madarag, a town within the municipality of San Enrique<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> where the robbery took place.&nbsp; On the other hand, Ma. Elena Servando testified that Oscar Servando went with her to gather corn in Sitio Baclayan which is also in the municipality of San Enrique.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>For the defense of alibi to prosper, the following must be established: (a) the presence of the accused-appellant in another place at the time of the commission of the offense; and, (b) physical impossibility for him to be at the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> These requisites were not fulfilled in this case.&nbsp; Considering that accused-appellants themselves admitted that they were in the same municipality as the place where the offense occurred, it cannot be said that it was physically impossible for them to have committed the crime.&nbsp; On the contrary, they were in the immediate vicinity of the area where the robbery took place.&nbsp; Thus, their defense of alibi cannot prosper.<br><br><b>Second</b>. Accused-appellants contend that there can be no finding of conspiracy against them because the prosecution failed to establish their participation in the killing of Rodito Lasap.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>This argument is without merit.&nbsp; Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.&nbsp; It may be inferred from the acts of the accused indicating a common purpose, a concert of action, or community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> That there was conspiracy in the case at bar is supported by the evidence on record. Freddie Agrabio testified that after shooting the driver, the accused ordered the passengers to give their money and valuables.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Although Freddie Agrabio could not specify who among the three divested him of his wallet because he was lying face down on the floor of the jeepney,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> it is clear that accused-appellants took part in the robbery.&nbsp; Accused-appellant Paneza did not only take valuables from the passengers but also stabbed Freddie Agrabio, hitting the latter on the left elbow.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Jose Amador identified both accused-appellants Eddy Paneza as the one who took his wrist watch and wallet while simultaneously pointing a "pinote" at him,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and Servando as the one who frisked his waist as he was alighting from the jeepney.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Clearly, therefore, accused-appellants cooperated with one another in order to achieve their purpose of robbing the driver and his passengers. "[F]or collective responsibility to be established, it is not necessary that conspiracy be proved by direct evidence of a prior agreement to commit a crime.&nbsp; It is sufficient that at the time of the commission of the offense, all the accused acted in concert showing that they had the same purpose or common design or that they were united in its execution."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>While only Ronnie Agomo-o shot and killed Rodito Lasap, accused-appellants cannot be exonerated.&nbsp; When conspiracy is established, all who carried out the plan and who personally took part in its execution are equally liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Accused-appellants must both also be held responsible for the death of Rodito Lasap.<br><br><b>Third</b>. Accused-appellants further assert that they cannot be convicted of highway robbery as the crime was not committed by at least four persons, as required in Article 306 of the Revised Penal Code. However, highway robbery is now governed by P.D. No. 532, otherwise known as the Anti-Piracy and Anti-Highway Robbery Law of 1974.&nbsp; This law provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 2. (e).&nbsp; <i>Highway Robbery/Brigandage</i>.¾ The seizure of any person for ransom, extortion or other unlawful purposes, or the taking away of the property of another by means of violence against or intimidation of person or force upon things or other unlawful means, committed by any person on any Philippine Highway.<br></blockquote>In the case of <i>People v. Puno</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> it was held that P.D. No. 532 amended Art. 306 of the Revised Penal Code and that it is no longer required that there be at least four armed persons forming a band of robbers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The number of offenders is no longer an essential element of the crime of highway robbery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Hence, the fact that there were only three identified perpetrators is of no moment. P.D. No. 532 only requires proof that persons were organized for the purpose of committing highway robbery indiscriminately.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> "The robbery must be directed not only against specific, intended or preconceived victims, but against any and all prospective victims."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In this case, the accused, intending to commit robbery, waited at the Barangay Mapili crossing for any vehicle that would happen to travel along that road.&nbsp; The driver Rodito Lasap and his passengers were not predetermined targets.&nbsp; Rather, they became the accused's victims because they happened to be traveling at the time when the accused were there.&nbsp; There was, thus, randomness in the selection of the victims, or the act of committing robbery indiscriminately, which differentiates this case from that of a simple robbery with homicide.<br><br>Sec. 3(b) of the law provides:<br><blockquote>The penalty of <i>reclusión temporal </i>in its minimum period shall be imposed.&nbsp; If physical injuries or other crimes are committed during or on the occasion of the commission of robbery or brigandage, the penalty of <i>reclusión temporal </i>in its medium and maximum periods shall be imposed.&nbsp; <ins>If kidnapping for ransom or extortion or murder or homicide, or rape is committed as a result or on the occasion thereof, the penalty of death shall be imposed.</ins><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br></blockquote>Since a homicide occurred during the commission of the highway robbery, the appropriate penalty to be imposed on accused-appellants would have been death.&nbsp; However, the crime was committed on September 22, 1993 when the imposition of the death penalty was suspended by the 1987 Constitution.&nbsp; Hence, the penalty next lower in degree, or <i>reclusion perpetua</i>,<i> </i>was correctly imposed by the trial court on accused-appellants Paneza and Servando.<br><br>In accordance with our recent rulings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the trial court correctly awarded P50,000.00 as civil indemnity in favor of the heirs of Rodito Lasap.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 23, Iloilo City is AFFIRMED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bellosillo, (Chairman), Quisumbing, Buena, and</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">De Leon, Jr., JJ.,</span> concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Per Judge Tito G.
