Thereupon Accused SARAGINA armed with knives in both hands rushed to the direction of victim and at this precise moment MERCEDITA MARTIN who was then nearby watching basketball game was able to see the event and sensing what was forthcoming warned the Victim by shouting "Tiyong takbo" prompting the latter to run but was overtaken after a brief chase by Accused SARAGINA who forthwith stabbed Victim at right side of his back below the armpit . Despite his injuries, Victim was able to run a short distance to the nearby alley where he fell down fact up to the ground. Accused pursued Victim and was about to enter the door of a certain house on the mistaken belief that Victim took refuge thereat if not for the warning shout of his co-Accused WILLIAM LANGCUYAN "hindi diyan Tiyong" prompting Accused to proceed to the alley which was the direction pointed to by his cohort and finding victim thereat lying prostrate on the ground hacked the latter on the face causing his instantaneous death. Forthwith both Accused SARAGINA and LANGCUYAN fled from the crime scene right after the latter had uttered "Tiyong takbo na".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></div><div></div><div>On January 17, 1997, the RTC found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder the dispositive portion of the decision reads:</div><div><blockquote></blockquote></div><div>"WHEREFORE premises considered and the prosecution having established beyond an iota of a doubt the guilt of the accused CARLITO SARAGINA of the crime of Murder, this Court hereby sentences said Accused to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua; to indemnify the heirs of the late ANTONIO VULPANGCO the amount of P50,000.00 without any subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs.</div><div><br></div><div>The period of Accused’s preventive imprisonment shall be credited in full in the service of his sentence pursuant to Art. 29 of the Revised Penal Code.</div><div><br></div><div>Let the case against Accused WILLIAM LANGCUYAN be archived without prejudice to its revival if he would be arrested later on.</div><div><br></div><div>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></div><div></div><div>Hence the present appeal where the accused-appellant assigns the following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:</div><div><br></div><div><div></div><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">I.</td><td width="90%" align="justify">THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT GIVING EXCULPATORY WEIGHT TO THE DEFENSE INTERPOSED BY THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">II.</td><td align="justify">THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN APPRECIATING THE QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE OF TREACHERY DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE ITS ATTENDANCE IN THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME CHARGED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]<br><br></sup></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div></div><div>The accused-appellant contends that the RTC erred in not giving weight to his claim that he acted in self-defense when he stabbed Antonio Vulpangco (VULPANGCO). He maintains that when he confronted VULPANGCO regarding the complaint of his sister, VULPANGCO got angry and picked up a knife to stab him. He was able to grab VULPANGCO’s hand and they grappled for possession of the same. After he was able to successfully wrest the knife away from VULPANGCO, he stabbed the latter in defense. The accused-appellant maintains that it was necessary for him to stab VULPANGCO in order to repel the aggression against him.</div><div><br></div><div>It is further contended by the accused-appellant that the witnesses of the prosecution namely, Pelagio Trigo Vda. De Vulpangco and Editha Trigo were biased and not credible witnesses. The RTC should not therefore have given full weight and credence to their testimonies.</div><div><br></div><div>The accused-appellant claims that, assuming for the sake of argument that he stabbed the victim not in the act of legitimate self-defense, the RTC erred in convicting him of the crime of murder in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that treachery attended the commission of the crime. In finding the presence of treachery, the RTC merely inferred the attendance thereof since the attack on the victim was sudden and unexpected. The accused-appellant prays that the decision of the RTC be reversed and that he be acquitted of the crime charged.</div><div><br></div><div>The appellee, on the other hand, posits that the guilt of the accused-appellant was proved beyond reasonable doubt and that he is guilty of the crime of murder.</div><div><br></div><div>The Solicitor General argues that the claim of the accused-appellant that he acted in self-defense is untenable considering that it was incumbent on the accused-appellant to prove clearly and convincingly that the killing of VULPANGCO was justified and that he incurred no liability therefor. This he failed to do. Moreover, self-defense is an affirmative allegation all the elements of which must be established with certainty. The accused-appellant’s reliance on his sister’s testimony which aside from being self-serving, only proves provocation on the part of VULPANGCO and does not prove self-defense. Besides, the fact that the accused fled the scene of the crime negates the justifying circumstance of self-defense. Further, evidence reveals that when the accused-appellant stabbed VULPANGCO the first time, VULPANGCO managed to run away but the accused-appellant, resolute in his purpose to kill him, chased and stabbed him again. Clearly, this negates self-defense.</div><div><br></div><div>The appellee however agrees with the accused-appellant that treachery was not proved and that the RTC based its finding on inferences and not on conclusive proof. Moreover, the assault on VULPANGCO cannot be characterized as sudden and unexpected inasmuch as he was forewarned of the impending danger against him and that he was able to run from the accused-appellant. The appellee submits however that the crime committed by the accused-appellant is still murder since evident premeditation, which was alleged in the information, was sufficiently proved. It was established that the accused-appellant learned that VULPANGCO was harassing his sister, Ester Langcuyan (ESTER), by uttering malicious remarks against her and showing his private part to her when he was drunk a week before he assaulted VULPANGCO. One week was more than sufficient time for him to think and reflect upon his determination to carry out his criminal intent. The appellee therefore recommends that the decision of the RTC be affirmed.</div><div><br></div><div>After a careful and meticulous review of the evidence on record, we resolve to affirm the RTC’s judgment of conviction.</div><div><br></div><div>The accused-appellant admits that he stabbed and killed VULPANGCO but claims that he acted in self-defense. Because of this claim, the burden of proof was shifted to the accused-appellant to establish by clear and convincing evidence the elements thereof, namely: (a) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (b) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent and repel it; and, (c) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></div><div><br></div><div>Foremost of the above requisites is that the victim was guilty of unlawful aggression; the absence of this requisite negates the existence of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Evidence must positively show that there was a previous unlawful and unprovoked attack on the person of the accused which placed him in danger and justified him in inflicting harm upon his assailant through the employment of reasonable means to repel the aggression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></div><div><br></div><div>In the present case, the evidence clearly establishes that VULPANGCO was not guilty of unlawful aggression. On the contrary, it was the accused-appellant who was guilty of the sudden and unprovoked attack. Principal prosecution witness, Mercedita Martin (MARTIN), a Barangay Kagawad, narrated the events leading to the killing Of VULPANGCO and positively identified the accused-appellant as the assailant in her testimony the pertinent portions of which are quoted as follows:</div><div><div><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span></div><div></div><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valalign="top">"PROSECUTOR UBALDO:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="10%"></td><td width="90%" align="justify">Do you recall where were you on April 1, 1996 at about 5:45 p.m.?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valalign="top">WITNESS:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"></td><td align="justify">In the Plaza of Purok 4.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valalign="top">PROSECUTOR UBALDO:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"></td><td align="justify">Do you recall if there was untoward incident that happened on that date?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valalign="top">WITNESS:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"></td><td align="justify">Yes, sir.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valalign="top">PROSECUTOR UBALDO:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"></td><td align="justify">What was that?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valalign="top">WITNESS:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"></td><td align="justify">Carlito Saragina stabbed Antonio Volfangco.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valalign="top">PROSECUTOR UBALDO:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"></td><td align="justify">You said that the accused Carlito Saragina stabbed Antonio Volfangco, is that correct?</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valalign="top">ATTY.

The nature, location and number of wounds inflicted on the victim belie and negate the accused-appellant's claim of self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The autopsy report shows that the victim sustained two wounds. The postmortem findings of the autopsy report read:</div><div><blockquote></blockquote></div><div>"Pallor, generalized.</div><div><br></div><div>Hack wound, Elliptical, in shape, edges clean cut, 11.0 cms. both extremities sharp, oriented vertically at the face extending from the right alas of the notes to the circumoral area, right side, directed backward, involving the skin and soft tissues, axillary bone and mandible, approximate dept 5.0 cms.</div><div><br></div><div>Stab wound, Elliptical edges clean cut, 6.0 cms., oriented almost horizontally, medial extremity sharp, lateral extremity blunt, at the chest, left side, along the anterior axillary line, 21.0 cms., from the anterior median line, directed backward, upward and medially, thru the 5th intercostal space, into the thoracic cavity, perforating the lung left, upper lobe, approximate depth of 8.0 cms.</div><div><br></div><div>Hemotherax, left 600 c.c.</div><div><br></div><div>Brain and other visceral organs, pale.</div><div><br></div><div>Stomach, empty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></div><div></div><div>If there was any truth to the accused-appellant’s claim of self-defense, he would not have run after VULPANGCO and stabbed him again in the face after VULPANGCO ran away considering that he was already able to wrest the knife away from VULPANGCO and stab him on the chest. At that point, there was no longer any need for him to continue to defend himself inasmuch as his alleged assailant already ran away from him.</div><div><br></div><div>Another factor that negates accused-appellant’s claim of self-defense is the fact that the accused-appellant eluded arrest from the time of the issuance of the RTC’s Order of Arrest on September 25, 1992 up to the time when he was finally arrested on January 12, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Flight is a strong indication of guilt when it is done to escape from the authorities or to escape prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></div><div><br></div><div>It is our conclusion that the claim of self-defense is not tenable for it is clear from the established facts, the physical evidence and his conduct that the accused-appellant was determined to kill VULPANGCO and did not just act to defend himself. In view of the foregoing discussion, it is no longer necessary to discuss the third element, i.e. lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.</div><div><br></div><div>In finding the accused-appellant guilty of murder, the RTC appreciated the qualifying circumstance of treachery considering that the attack on VULPANGCO was sudden and unexpected. Both the accused-appellant and the appellee agree that treachery cannot be appreciated when the victim was forewarned of the impending danger against him.</div><div><br></div><div>After a careful scrutiny of the evidence, we agree with the accused-appellant and the appellee. MARTIN testified that prior to the stabbing of VULPANGCO, the accused-appellant confronted VULPANGCO and addressed him saying "Ano pare, umpisahan na natin?" Moreover, MARTIN was also able to forewarn VULPANGCO regarding the impending assault of the accused-appellant when she shouted "Tiyong Takbo". He was thereafter able to run away from the accused-appellant who unfortunately was able to catch up with him and stab him. Treachery cannot be appreciated when the victim was aware of the attack against him and was even able to flee even though briefly from his attacker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></div><div><br></div><div>We disagree with the ratiocination of the appellee that despite the absence of treachery, the accused-appellant is still guilty of murder due to the existence of evident premeditation. For evident premeditation to be properly appreciated, the prosecution must prove the following requisites: (a) the time when the accused determined to commit the crime; (b) an act manifestly indicating that the accused has clung to his determination; and (c) a lapse of time between the determination to commit the crime and the execution thereof sufficient to allow him to reflect upon the consequences of his act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></div><div><br></div><div>In the case at bar, the prosecution failed to adduce evidence showing when and how the accused-appellant planned and prepared to kill VULPANGCO. The mere fact that the accused-appellant learned that VULPANGCO was pestering his sister a week before the killing is insufficient to prove evident premeditation beyond reasonable doubt. It would be stretching one’s imagination to conclude that during said period, the accused-appellant planned to kill VUPANGCO; the conclusion would be highly speculative. The mere knowledge that VULPANGCO had a misunderstanding with the accused-appellant’s sister does not suffice to prove that the accused-appellant planned to kill him.</div><div><br></div><div>Since both treachery and evident premeditation cannot be appreciated to qualify the crime into murder, the accused-appellant can only be convicted of the crime of homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Article 249 of the Revised Penal Code provides that the penalty for homicide is <em>reclusion temporal</em>.
