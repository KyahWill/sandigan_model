				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In accusations involving incestuous rape, the relationship of the accused with the offended party as well as the latter's age must be alleged in the information and proven by the prosecution with competent evidence during the trial. A bare photocopy of the victim's Birth Certificate which is neither certified nor offered formally in evidence is not sufficient proof of her age.<br><br><center><ins><b>Statement of the Case</b></ins></center><br>For automatic review is a Joint Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated May 16, 1997 issued by the Regional Trial Court (Branch 39)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of Calapan, Oriental Mindoro, in Criminal Case Nos. C-4775, C-4776 and C-4777, convicting Rolando Tabanggay on three counts of qualified rape and sentencing him to suffer the supreme penalty of death for each count.<br><br>In three separate Informations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> all dated July 18, 1995, appellant was charged with the crime of rape allegedly committed once against his daughter Rynalyn Tabanggay, then 14 years old; and twice against his other daughter, Genalyn Tabanggay, then 13 years old. Except as to the time, the date and the name of the victim, the Informations similarly read as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 14th day of May, 1994, at around 2:00 o'clock in the morning, in Barangay Sta. Mesa, Municipality of Victoria, Province of Oriental Mindoro, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, motivated by lust and lewd design, and by means of force and intimidation, using a deadly weapon, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously did lie and succeeded in having carnal knowledge with his daughter, RYNALYN TABANGGAY y RAMIREZ, 14 years old, against the latter's will and consent.<br><br>Contrary to law."<br></blockquote>The other two Informations state that the accused likewise raped his other daughter, Genalyn, on two different occasions when she was only 13 years old.<br><br>On September 7, 1995, the accused-appellant, with the assistance of his counsel <i>de oficio</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> pleaded not guilty to the charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The prosecution and the defense thereafter agreed on a joint trial of the three cases, since common witnesses were to be presented.<br><br><center><ins><b>The Facts</b><br><br><b><i>Version of the Prosecution</i></b></ins></center><br>The evidence for the prosecution are summed up by the Office of the Solicitor General, as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><blockquote><br>"On May 14, 1994, at around 2:00 in the morning, private complainant Rynalyn Tabanggay, then turning 14 years old, was sleeping inside a nipa hut in Sta. Mesa, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro together with her sister Everlyn Tabanggay. Rynalyn was awakened when she felt that she was being kissed and hugged by appellant, her father, who told her to keep still. Appellant went on touching Rynalyn's breasts and vagina. Frightened, Rynalyn pleaded appellant to have mercy on her. However, appellant ignored Rynalyn's plea and instead told her "(a)nak, mahal na mahal kita(,) bago ang iba makinabang ako muna." Rynalyn tried to wake up her sister but failed to do so because appellant boxed her, thereby rendering her unconscious. Later, when Rynalyn regained consciousness, she felt pain all over her body and her knees were trembling. She also saw her vagina bleeding. When she tried to get out of the hut, appellant followed Rynalyn and, while holding on to her clothes, appellant threatened her not to tell the incident to anybody, otherwise he would kill her. Thereafter, appellant left the hut and went to the house of a neighbor.<br><br>"Meanwhile, Rynalyn and several others harvested palay. In the afternoon of the same date, she went home [to] San Antonio, also in Victoria, Oriental Mindoro, but she did not tell anybody about the sexual assault upon her.<br><br>"On May 17, 1994, Rynalyn left their house and went to Manila and applied for a job as a housemaid. She wanted to be far from home so that she could forget what appellant had done to her.<br><br>"While working as a housemaid in Manila, Rynalyn wrote her mother Gundina Tabanggay a letter, informing the latter that appellant raped her. After receiving the said letter sometime in August 1994, Gundina got angry and confronted appellant about the same. When informed that the contents of Rynalyn's letter were not good, appellant bowed his head and could not look straight in Gundina's eyes. And when Gundina asked appellant if, by bowing his head, appellant was admitting the truth, appellant replied that he committed something wrong to her and his daughter.<br><br>"Later, on June 8, 1995, Gundina looked for Rynalyn who had gone to Guinangan, Quezon. After finding Rynalyn in the said place, Gundina brought her home [to] Oriental Mindoro on June 12, 1995. The following day, Dr. Ma. Cristina A. Gonzales of the Oriental Mindoro Provincial Hospital examined Rynalyn. According to the Medical Certificate dated June 14, 1995 issued by Dr. Gonzales, Rynalyn suffered hymenal laceration at two, three, five, seven and eight o'clock positions. Appellant, through counsel, admitted that Dr. Gonzales [was] a medico-legal expert and that, in connection with her examination of Rynalyn, Dr. Gonzales issued the aforesaid medical certificate.<br><br>"Sometime in February 1995, private complainant Genalyn Tabanggay, Rynalyn's sister who was then turning 13 years old, was with her six other siblings inside a room in their house. Appellant approached Genalyn and told her to keep quiet. Thereupon, appellant touched Genalyn's private parts and kissed her on the left cheek. Appellant also inserted his penis into Genalyn's vagina. As a result of the rape, Genalyn's vagina and thighs became painful. She also cried. Thereafter, appellant left and went to his bed outside the room.<br><br>"The sexual assault upon Genalyn was repeated on March 19, 1995 at around 1:00 o'clock in the morning. On the said date and time, appellant went to the room where Genalyn was sleeping. Appellant placed himself on top of Genalyn and tried to insert his penis into her vagina, as a result of which Genalyn felt pain in her vagina. Appellant threatened to kill Genalyn if she would not keep quiet. This notwithstanding, Genalyn cried and cried until her sister Rosalyn, who was then 10 years old, was awakened. Later in the morning, after appellant had left the house and [gone] to the ricefield, Genalyn told her sister Rosalyn about the second rape incident. Rosalyn in turn told Gundina, upon the latter's arrival from Manila, that appellant raped Genalyn. Gundina then asked Genalyn if what Rosalyn had told her was the truth. Genalyn replied in the affirmative.<br><br>"On June 15, 1995, Dr. Romeo G. Andal of the Oriental Mindoro Provincial Hospital examined Genalyn. According to the Medical Certificate of even date, which was issued by Dr. Andal, Genalyn suffered hymenal laceration at three, six, nine, and eleven o'clock positions. Appellant, through counsel, also admitted that Dr. Andal [was] a medico-legal expert and that, in connection with his examination of Genalyn, Dr. Andal issued the aforesaid medical certificate."<br></blockquote><center><ins><b><i>Version of the Defense</i></b></ins></center><br>Appellant's defenses, on the other hand, consist of alibi and denial. His counter-statement of the facts is as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><blockquote>"As regards Criminal Case No. 4775, said accused testified that while it is true that on May 14, 1994 he was in Sta. Mesa, Victoria, he was, however, with several male companions and they were then sleeping in a patio outside the nipa hut.<br><br>"That he could not possibly commit the crime of rape on Rynalyn Tabanggay because there were many persons in said place, especially when Rynalyn Tabanggay was in a nipa hut with several companions sleeping side by side. In fact, the accused testified that in the morning of said date they started threshing palay at the early dawn together with several companions and when they returned to the hut to take their breakfast, Rynalyn Tabanggay was there together with several male and female companions and everything was casual and normal.<br><br>"To corroborate the testimonies of the accused with respect to Criminal Case No. 4775, Rolly Rivas took the witness stand and testified that the accused was with him at the patio in Sta. Mesa, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro from the evening of May 13, 1994 up to morning of May 14, 1994. That it was even at the early dawn of May 14, 1994 when they started threshing palay until they went back to the nipa hut and took their breakfast and Rynalyn Tabanngay was there. That when they were taking their breakfast, everything was normal and casual.<br><br>"With regard to Criminal Case Nos. 4776 &amp; 4777, the accused testified that [i]n the month of February 1995 he was in Sta. Mesa, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro working in a ricefield. That Barangay Antonio of Victoria, Oriental Mindoro [was] five (5) kilometers away from Sta. Mesa.<br><br>"That on March 19, 1995, said accused was in Barangay Alcate and was not in Barangay Antonio. Accused testified that he did not rape G[e]nalyn Tabanggay.<br><br>"Said accused likewise testified that these cases of rape were filed against him in order to put on said accused the blame on what the [T]iyo Untog of the offended parties did to them in Bongabon, Oriental Mindoro. That when the accused came to know that his wife was receiving money from this [T]iyo Untog and the offended parties were likewise receiving monies from this [T]iyo Untog, he felt suspicious that something bad was going on between his wife, the offended parties and this [T]iyo Untog, who [was] a relative of the accused. The accused then transferred their residence from one place to another against the will of his wife inasmuch as the accused was not a good provider. Domestic quarrels ensued between the accused, his wife and the offended parties until these cases of rape were filed against him because of bad blood."<br></blockquote><center><ins><b>Ruling of the Trial Court</b></ins></center><br>After considering the evidence proffered by both parties and citing jurisprudence on rape cases, the trial court concluded as follows:<br><blockquote>"All considered, the Court finds accused liable, as principal, for Rape (3 counts) defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 11 of Republic Act 7659, for having sexual intercourse by means of force and intimidation once with his daughter Rynalyn Tabanggay, then 14 years of age, and twice with his other daughter Genalyn Tabanggay, then 13 years of age, with the qualifying circumstance that the victim[s are] under eighteen year[s] of [age] and the offender is a parent in all these cases.<br><br>"A child especially that of [the] fair sex, looks up to [her] father with high regard and as protector and guardian against all evils and aggressions. If a father deflowers his daughter under eighteen years of age, he is a beast[;] he does not only deserve to be deprived of his parental authority over her but has no place in society. The crimes committed by herein accused, [those] of having sexual intercourse with his daughters under eighteen years of age by means of force and intimidation cry to the high heavens for the imposition of the most severe punishment, i.e., death."<br></blockquote>The court thus disposed of the cases in the following manner:<br><blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds accused Rolando Tabanggay guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as principal, of the crime of Rape (3 counts) with the qualifying circumstance in all these cases that the victim is under eighteen years of age and the offender is a parent and hereby sentences him to suffer THREE DEATH PENALTIES, together with the accessory penalties provided by law, and to indemnify the victim Rynalyn Tabanggay [in] the amount of P50,000.00 in Criminal Case No. C-4775 and Genalyn Tabanggay the total amount of P100,000.00 in Criminal Cases Nos. C-4776 and C-4777, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.<br><br>"For services rendered as counsel <i><ins>de oficio</ins></i>, Atty. Rodrigo C. Dimayacyac is awarded attorney's fees in the amount of P1,500.00, subject to availability of funds."<br></blockquote><center><ins><b>Issue</b></ins></center><br>In his appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> before us, accused-appellant assigns this single error:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><blockquote>"The trial court erred in finding the accused guilty of the crime of rape on three (3) counts."<br></blockquote><center><ins><b>The Court's Ruling</b></ins></center><br>We affirm the trial court's finding that the appellant is guilty of rape on three counts. However, we reduce the penalty to <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> because of the failure to prove sufficiently the minority of the private complainants.<br><br><center><ins><b>Main Issue:<br><em>Sufficiency of Prosecution Evidence</em></b></ins></center><br>Appellant first argues that the testimony of Rynalyn did not establish with moral certainty that he had indeed raped her. She did not present any corroborating testimony despite her allegation that she was lying side by side with her companions when the incident took place. Besides, it remains unrebutted that Rynalyn had previously been sexually molested by her uncle for a monetary consideration. Furthermore, her examining physician was not presented to give an expert opinion on whether she had been truly raped on the date and at the time in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>With respect to Genalyn's testimony, appellant contends that the same was impressed with uncertainties. It was supposedly inconceivable that she was raped while lying side by side with several companions. Moreover, she was silent when her mother confronted her as to the truth of the rape incidents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Appellant further insists that private complainants and their mother were ill-motivated in filing the rape cases against him. There was allegedly bad blood between them because of his failure to give sufficient provision to his family.<br><br>The averments of appellant really boil down to the sufficiency of the evidence for the prosecution and the credibility of its witnesses to support his conviction on three counts of rape.<br><br>The settled guiding principles in prosecutions for rape are: (1) to accuse a man of rape is easy, but to disprove it is difficult though the accused may be innocent; (2) considering that in the nature of things, only two persons are usually involved in the crime of rape, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merit and not be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On the other hand, there is also the principle that as long as the complainant's testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Guided by these judicial doctrines, the Court scrutinized all the pieces of evidence on record, especially the testimonies of the complaining victims. We find no good reason to deviate from the findings of the trial court that appellant indeed raped Rynalyn and Genalyn. Their testimonies were straightforward, candid and spontaneous. If their tales were mere contrivances, the girls would not have remained composed and consistent throughout the grueling and lengthy interrogations by the prosecution and the defense attorneys.<br><br>The following is the candid testimony of Rynalyn as to the lustful acts inflicted upon her by appellant when she was only 13 years old:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" align="justify">PROS.

Normally, no woman would be willing to undergo the arduous stages and the embarrassing consequences of a rape trial, if not to condemn an injustice and obtain retribution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Appellant's contention that Genalyn's testimony was impressed with uncertainties is totally unfounded. On the contrary, we find it candid, consistent and natural. Her inability to immediately give direct answers to some questions may be attributed to her innocence and naivete. In any case, the Court has ruled in the past that minor lapses in a testimony should be expected when the one testifying is recounting a debasing and humiliating experience such as rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The victim may not be able to remember and describe every detail of her repulsive experience, precisely because she might in fact be trying to expunge it from her memory, as it is too painful to remember.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>As regards appellant's argument that it was improbable for him to have raped his daughters in the same room where their other siblings were asleep, suffice it to say that this Court has held time and again that rape can be committed even in places where people congregate -- in parks, within school premises, inside a house where there are other occupants, and even in the same room where other family members are sleeping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Lust is no respecter of time, place or kinship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In contrast, there is no rule that rape can be committed only in seclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Hence, in rape cases, corroborative testimony is not absolutely necessary. The prosecution is not bound to present witnesses other than the victims themselves, for their testimonies alone, if credible and free from material inconsistencies, as in these cases, may be the sole basis of appellant's conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Appellant's further allegation that it was a certain Untog who sexually molested private complainants does not affect his culpability. Prior sexual intercourse with a different person is irrelevant in a rape case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Likewise unmeritorious is the argument of appellant that the nonpresentation of an expert medical witness is fatal to the rape charges against him. We have consistently held that a medical examination is not indispensable to a prosecution for rape, as long as the evidence on record convinces the court beyond doubt that conviction is proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Nevertheless, both offended parties underwent physical examination and offered in court their Medical Certificates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Appellant's counsel manifested their admission of the genuineness of their Medical Certificates and the expertise of the examining physicians, as well as the willingness of the defense to dispense with their testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> With these express declarations and waiver, appellant cannot now assail the absence of an expert opinion on the medical conditions of private complainants.<br><br>We also find unsubstantiated appellant's imputation of ill motive to private complainants and their mother, an imputation he makes simply on the basis of his failure to provide sufficiently for his family's needs. Such flimsy argument deserves no consideration. It is very unlikely that a mother would expose her own minor daughters to the ignominy of a rape trial merely to retaliate against her husband's shortcomings as a family man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It would have to be shown that private complainants were so morally depraved that, simply for this reason, they would concoct a story that would put appellant to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>As said earlier, no mother in her right mind would sacrifice her own daughters, young as they are, to the indignities of a rape trial, unless her sole motive is an honest desire to have the transgressor punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> And ordinarily, no young innocent girls would admit having been raped, submit themselves to gynecological examinations, and participate in a public trial where they are made to narrate in detail their debasing experience; that is, unless the reason is to avenge their honor, even if such action would mean capital punishment for the man who gave them life. An imputation that they were merely motivated by ill will must be fully supported by convincing evidence, an evidence which appellant herein utterly failed to present.<br><br>All in all, the prosecution has certainly established beyond doubt that appellant is guilty of rape on three counts: one against Rynalyn and two against Genalyn. We now go to the proper imposable penalty.<br><br><center><ins><b><i>Proper Penalty</i></b></ins></center><br>Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, prescribes the supreme penalty of death "[w]hen the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim." Based on this provision, the trial court thus imposed the death penalty upon accused-appellant.<br><br>However, jurisprudence dictates that when the law specifies certain circumstances that will qualify an offense and thus attach to it a greater degree of penalty, such circumstances must be both alleged and proven in order to justify the imposition of the graver penalty. Recent rulings of the Court relative to the rape of minors invariably state that in order to justify the imposition of death, there must be independent evidence proving the age of the victim, other than the testimonies of prosecution witnesses and the absence of denial by the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> A duly certified certificate of live birth accurately showing the complainant's age, or some other official document or record such as a school record, has been recognized as competent evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, we find insufficient the bare testimony of private complainants and their mother as to their ages as well as their kinship to the appellant. We note that a photocopy of Genalyn's Birth Certificate is included in the records of the case. But it was neither duly certified nor formally offered in evidence. Therefore, no probative value can be given to it. Furthermore, we cannot agree with the solicitor general that appellant's admission of his relationship with his victims would suffice. Elementary is the doctrine that the prosecution bears the burden of proving all the elements of a crime, including the qualifying circumstances. In sum, the death penalty cannot be imposed upon appellant.<br><br>In addition to indemnity, moral damages in an amount the Court deems just should be awarded to private complainants, without necessity for pleading or proof of the basis thereof. It is recognized that the victim's injury is inherently concomitant to and necessarily results from the odiousness of the crime, thus warranting the award of moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> We find just and proper the amount of P50,000 as moral damages to each of private complainants.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <i>AFFIRM </i>the Joint Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Oriental Mindoro, Branch 39, in Criminal Case Nos.
