He attributes the falsity of the charges against him on the victim's mother who warned him that she would do everything to put him to jail after the accused-appellant threw them out of the house. However, imputations such as this is indeed hard to believe because no mother would be so callous to sacrifice her own daughter, concoct a story of the latter's defloration, allow an examination of her daughter's private parts and present her to be the subject of a public trial just to retaliate against him for his transgressions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup>&nbsp; Nor is it probable that a child of tender years like Jeypen, not exposed to the ways of the world, would impute a crime so serious as rape to any man if it were not true and if she is not motivated solely by the desire to have the culprit apprehended and punished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Thus, the trial court did not err in giving credence to Jeypen's testimony over the hollow submissions of the accused-appellant. The testimony of Jeypen herself which is supported by the medical evidence of her non-virgin state is sufficient to clearly establish the guilt of the accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>&nbsp; Nonetheless, the trial court erred in imposing the capital punishment on accused-appellant.<br><br>Republic Act No. 7659 has introduced seven other special qualifying circumstances, including the minority of the victim and the relationship between her and the offender, the attendance of which in the commission of the crime of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, would warrant the imposition of the mandatory penalty of death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Except as to the dates of the commission of the crimes charged, that is, March 5, 1997 in Criminal Case No. 97-9989<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup>&nbsp; and April 7, 1997 in Criminal Case No. 97-9991,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup>&nbsp; the identical informations, under which accused-appellant was eventually convicted, read as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 5<sup>th</sup> day of March, 1997, in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, Arturo Garcia y Canda, stepfather of complainant Jeypen Inilog, stepdaughter, a minor (10 years old) by means of force and intimidation did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of complainant against her will and consent.<br><br>Contrary to Law.</blockquote>While the informations in Criminal Cases Nos. 97-9989 and 97-9991 properly alleged the minority of the victim, Jeypen Enilog, the alleged relationship of the said victim, as alleged stepdaughter of the accused-appellant, was not duly proved. Evidence presented at the trial only showed that Jeypen's mother, Josefina, and accused-appellant have been cohabiting only as common-law spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup>&nbsp; No proof was presented by the prosecution that Josefina and accused-appellant were married as to qualify the latter as Jeypen's stepfather.<br><br>This failure of the prosecution to prove the qualifying circumstance of step-parent relationship between accused-appellant and the victim, Jeypen, as alleged in the information, precludes a finding of qualified rape and the automatic imposition of the death penalty. To rule otherwise would be tantamount to a deprivation of the constitutional right of the accused to be correctly informed of the nature and the cause of accusation against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, accused-appellant should only be held liable for simple statutory rape, which is punishable by reclusion perpetua.<br><br>Finally, this Court noted that while the accused-appellant was found guilty, the trial court failed to award to the rape victim, Jeypen, the amount of P50,000.00, as civil indemnity, and an additional amount of P50,000.00, as moral damages, for each count of rape committed by the accused-appellant, contrary to prevailing jurisprudence.
