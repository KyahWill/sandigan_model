				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case is here on appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 147, Makati, finding accused-appellant Francisco L. Doinog and his co-accused Samuel L. Cortez guilty of violation of P.D. No. 532 (Anti-Piracy and Anti-Highway Robbery Law of 1974) and sentencing them to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and ordering them to pay the heirs of the victim, SPO2 Ricardo Bautista, the amount of P50,000.00, plus costs.<br><br>The information for Highway Robbery, filed on October 4, 1993 against both accused, reads:<br><blockquote>The undersigned 4th Assistant Prosecutor accuses FRANCISCO DOINOG y LADRERO and SAMUEL CORTEZ y LOPEZ of the crime of Violation of P.D. 532 (Highway Robbery), committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about the 19th day of September, 1993, in the Municipality of Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together with Nene Lavadia, alias Dodo, alias Randy and John Doe whose true identities and present whereabouts are still unknown and mutually helping and aiding one another, with intent to gain and by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, divest and carry away cash money amounting to P1,000.00 more or less from Leonora S. Bañaga a bus conductress and cash money and valuables from passengers namely, Ismael Pontillas y Ladrero, Susan Pineda y Bautista and Jaime Doria y Molina in an undetermined amount, while aboard a passenger bus which was travelling along Magallanes, Bgy. Bangkal, Makati, Metro Manila, which is a Philippine Highway as defined by P.D. 532, to the damage and prejudice of said Leonora S. Bañaga and the aforementioned passengers in an undetermined amount; that on the occasion of the said robbery and in order to insure the commission of the said offense, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together and all of them mutually helping and aiding one another, with deliberate intent to kill and without justifiable cause, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously shoot and stab one SPO2 Ricardo Bautista, thereby inflicting upon him gunshot and stab wounds on the vital parts of his body which caused his death; and that as a further consequence thereof, physical injuries were inflicted upon the passengers namely Ismael Pontillas y Ladrero, Susan Pineda y Bautista and Jaime Doria y Molina.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br></blockquote>Another information for illegal possession of firearms in violation of P.D. No. 1866 was filed on the same day against accused-appellant, Francisco L. Doinog, alleging --<br><blockquote>The undersigned 4th Assistant Prosecutor accuses FRANCISCO DOINOG y LADRERO of the crime of Illegal Possession of Firearm and Ammunitions (P.D. No. 1866) committed as follows:<br><br>That on or about the 19th day of September, 1993, in the Municipality of Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines, a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without being authorized by law, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, direct custody and control and carry outside of his residence a cal. 38 paltik with Serial No. 282550 with four (4) live bullets, which is in violation of the above-cited law.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>Upon arraignment, both accused pleaded "not guilty" to the charges against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> After arraignment, accused Samuel Cortez escaped from the Makati municipal jail and, to this date, has remained at large. The trial proceeded as to accused-appellant alone.<br><br>The facts are as follows:<br><br>At around 1:30 in the afternoon of September 19, 1993, an air-conditioned bus of the Prince Transport was held-up as it reached the Magallanes fly-over in Bangkal, Makati, along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue. Five (5) armed men stood up from their seats in different parts of the bus and announced the hold-up. One of the men seated beside the driver pulled out a fan knife and poked it at the latter. Another robber took about P1,000.00 from the bus conductor while the others divested the passengers of their cash and valuables. A commotion ensued when one of the robbers fired a gun. When the driver stopped the bus, the robbers and passengers alighted, leaving only the bus driver, the bus conductor and an injured passenger, SPO2 Ricardo Bautista. SPO2 Bautista was later taken to the Villamor Air Base Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. The autopsy report (Exh. E)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> showed that he suffered gunshot and stab wounds which led to his death.<br><br>Accused-appellant apparently was also aboard the bus and was hit during the gun fire. He was taken to the Villamor Air Base Hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound on the left thigh. While he was being given first aid treatment at hospital, Sgt. Rogelio Bibat confiscated a .38 caliber firearm allegedly lying on a bed beside accused-appellant’s. Accused-appellant was transferred first to the Philippine General Hospital and then to the Ospital ng Makati and, afterward, placed under arrest and detained in the Makati Municipal Jail.<br><br>On May 31, 1995, the trial court rendered its decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote><br>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court, finding accused Francisco Doinog and Samuel Cortez guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged in the "Information" in Criminal Case No. 93-8496, hereby sentences them to suffer reclusion perpetua, and to indemnify the heirs of SPO2 Ricardo Bautista of the sum of P50,000.00. With costs.<br><br>In Criminal Case No. 93-8497, the Court hereby acquits accused Francisco Doinog for insufficiency of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, this appeal. Accused-appellant assigns the following errors:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">I.</td><td width="90%" align="justify">THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. 93-8496 FOR INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE ON THE PART OF THE PROSECUTION.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">II.</td><td align="justify">THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT GIVING CREDENCE TO THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY THE DEFENSE WHICH INCLUDES THE NEGATIVE FINDINGS OF NBI FORENSIC CHEMIST MARY ANN ARANAS ON THE PARAFFIN TEST CONDUCTED ON BOTH HANDS OF THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">III.</td><td align="justify">THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. 93-8496 DUE TO REASONABLE DOUBT.</td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant contends that the prosecution evidence consists mainly of testimonies of unreliable witnesses; that the evidence in fact shows that he was the a victim of trumped-up charges; and that the trial court failed to give due consideration to the report of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) that when he was tested for powder (nitrate) burns he was found negative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), on the other hand, relies on the rule that the trial court’s determination of the credibility of witnesses could no longer be disturbed on appeal. The OSG claims that the inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution’s witnesses are on minor details and do not affect their reliability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>This Court generally accords respect to the factual findings of the trial court judge, considering that the latter has the opportunity to directly observe the witnesses and determine by their demeanor on the stand the probative value of their testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> There are exceptions to this rule, however, such as, where the record shows that facts and circumstances of weight and influence have been overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied by the trial court which, if considered, would have affected the result of the case, or when such findings are arbitrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>This is such a case. Here, the trial court based its finding of guilt primarily on the testimony of the supposed eyewitness, Jaime Doria, who testified thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">Q</td><td width="90%" align="justify">On September 19, 1993, at about 1:00 o’clock in the afternoon, do you recall where were you?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td align="justify">Yes, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td align="justify">Where were you at that time?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td align="justify">I was aboard a bus.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td align="justify">Can you still recall what bus you were riding in at that time?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td align="justify">Prince Transport.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td align="justify">And you were then board for what direction?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td align="justify">I am proceeding to Bicutan.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td align="justify">While as you said you were then on board the said bus, do you recall of any unusual incident that took place?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td align="justify">Yes, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td align="justify">What was that incident?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td align="justify">There was a hold-up that took place.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td align="justify">You said there was a hold-up that took place do you know who that hold-upper was at that time?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td align="justify">I could not recognize if he is present in Court.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q</td><td align="justify">Will you please look around inside the courtroom and pinpoint to the hold-upper as you said you saw on that date September 19, 1993?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td align="justify">Yes, sir.

While it may be true that, as the trial court noted, Jaime Doria was not shown to have ill-motive or bias in testifying against accused-appellant, the inconsistencies in his testimony are so glaring and material that they cast doubt on his credibility.<br><br>Thus, on direct examination, Jaime Doria claimed that he was seated in the "middle of the bus" while accused-appellant was seated near the driver. However, on cross-examination, he testified that what he said in his affidavit (Exh. F)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> executed before the police, i.e., that he was seated in front, behind the driver, was the accurate statement. He tried to explain that he kept moving from seat to seat during the ride because he was "uncomfortable." But why he thus felt he did not say. Nor did he explain why he was looking around at the other passengers inside the bus, as did the five robbers. If this were true, then his actions were unnatural, if not altogether suspicious.<br><br>Likewise, during direct examination, the witness stated that it was one of accused-appellant’s companions who poked a knife at the bus driver, while accused-appellant stood "near the door" of the bus. Upon examination by the defense counsel, however, he said that initially it was accused-appellant who poked a knife at the driver. When his inconsistency was pointed out to him, Jaime Doria changed his answer and claimed that there were two men who held a knife against the driver.<br><br>It also appears that the witness cannot clearly recall whether gun shots were fired by robbers seated at the left and right sides, or at the front and back portions of the bus. Initially, he stated that the man seated to his right pulled a gun when the hold-up was announced. Upon questioning by the Court, however, he testified that he heard gun shots coming from the "front and at the back" of the bus. It is noteworthy that nowhere in his testimony did this witness claim he saw any of the robbers in front carrying a gun. Even from his confusing statements, it appears that the two robbers in front, who were within his vantage point, were carrying bladed weapons, not guns.<br><br>But the most serious discrepancy in Jaime Doria’s testimony relates to his supposed positive identification of accused-appellant as one of the robbers. In his affidavit (Exh. F), there was no mention of accused-appellant’s name, much less his identification as one of the assailants. It was accused Samuel Cortez whom he identified thus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">T</td><td width="90%" align="justify">Sa loob ng opisinang ito maari bang igala mo ang iyong paningin, at pagkatapos ay sabihin mo sa akin kung mayroon kang nakikilala?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">S</td><td align="justify">Mayroon po, yon po, yan po yong isa sa homoldap sa amin sa Bus na sinasakyan ko, yan po yong tumutok ng Balisong sa driver ng Bus (Affiant pointing to One Samuel Cortez y Lopez) inside the intelligence division Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote>On direct examination, Doria claimed that accused-appellant was one of robbers he saw and identified at the Taguig police station. When cross-examined by defense counsel, however, Doria admitted that he "did not recognize [accused-appellant] at the police station" and knew him/his face only from the newspapers.
