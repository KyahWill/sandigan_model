				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>On 21 April 1997 the Regional Trial Court of Manila found the accused 
ELEUTERIO DIMAPILIS guilty of rape and imposed upon him the supreme penalty of 
death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><sup> </sup>The case is now 
before us on automatic review.</p>
<p>In an Information filed by State Prosecutor Lilian Doris S. Alejo, ten 
(10)-year old Sharon Degala Salas, assisted by her maternal grandaunt Violeta 
Benjamin, charged Eleuterio Dimapilis, common-law husband of Sharon's mother, 
with having raped her sometime in June 1993. Being the common-law husband of her 
mother, Sharon referred to Eleuterio as her stepfather.</p>
<p>The records show that aside from the Information in the instant case, three 
(3) other Informations were filed by the same complaining witness against 
Eleuterio Dimapilis all charging him with rape committed in Makati and now 
pending before this Court in G.R. Nos. 128619, 128620 and 128621. Still another 
Information was filed by Sharon against the same accused for rape allegedly 
committed at FTI, Bicutan, Taguig, although the records are bereft of any 
information on the developments of that case.</p>
<p>Sharon's calvary began sometime in June 1993 when her mother Linda Degala 
commenced a common-law relationship with Eleuterio Dimapilis, also known as 
<i>Jun, Dakila </i>or<i> Daky</i>. Linda lived with Eleuterio in a cramped one 
(1)-room structure located in a thickly populated area in Sta. Ana, Manila, 
together with her four (4) children by a previous marriage one of whom was 
Sharon.</p>
<p>Eleuterio was a jeepney driver plying the PRC - LRT route. He would leave the 
house at around four o'clock in the morning and return home at seven o'clock in 
the evening. Linda was unemployed. At times she would joy-ride with Eleuterio; 
at other times, she would gamble in Batute, Makati. Her children stayed home as 
they were still very young, except for nine (9)-year old Sharon<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> who was in grade three (3) in school.</p>
<p>One afternoon, at around two o'clock, Linda told Sharon not to go to school 
but to stay home and attend to her three (3) siblings as she was going to gamble 
in Batute, Makati. On that occasion Eleuterio also stayed home with Linda's 
children because the jeepney he was driving had to be repaired. According to 
Sharon, while she was sound asleep that afternoon Eleuterio suddenly woke her 
up. Her siblings at that time were outside the house playing while she and 
Eleuterio were alone in the house. Sharon claimed that on such occasion 
Eleuterio sexually abused her - <i>ginalaw/hinalay</i>, in her own words. When 
asked to explain how she was <i>ginalaw/hinalay</i>, she said that Eleuterio 
"fingered" her private organ, touched her breasts and kissed her body while 
rubbing his penis presumably to attain an erection. She later felt his penis 
pressed against her vagina and he was trying to insert it into hers. However, he 
did not succeed in penetrating her as she cried out in pain.</p>
<p>This incident was repeated three (3) times in three (3) different venues. 
From Sta. Ana, Manila, where her first sexual abuse took place, her family moved 
to FTI, Bicutan, Taguig. There, Eleuterio "fingered" her again while poking a 
kitchen knife at her.</p>
<p>Sometime in 1994 her family transferred to Batute, Makati where Eleuterio 
again poked a kitchen knife at Sharon and tried to force his penis once more 
into her organ. Her ordeal culminated in February 1996 when her family moved to 
PNR, San Antonio Village, Makati, where Eleuterio again forced his organ into 
hers.</p>
<p>All the while Sharon kept mum about her sexual encounters with Eleuterio. But 
she could not keep it for long. In May 1996 she broke her silence. She finally 
told Violeta Benjamin, a maternal grandaunt whom she called <i>Lola Violy</i>, 
about the sexual assaults of Eleuterio. Immediately, her <i>Lola Violy</i> 
brought her to the National Bureau of Investigation where she was investigated, 
her statement taken,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and medico-legal 
examination conducted.</p>
<p>In the medical report of Dr. Aurea P. Villena, her examining physician, 
Sharon's hymen was "moderately tall, moderately thick with superficial old 
healed laceration at three (3) o'clock position corresponding to the face of a 
watch, edges rounded, non-coaptable." Dr. Villena clarified that the term 
"superficial old healed laceration" meant that the laceration did not extend up 
to the entire width of the hymen and could have been sustained not more than 
three (3) months before her examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Upon inquiry, she opined that a laceration 
of this kind was possible even if the penis only had slight contact 
("<i>dinikit</i>") with the vagina and that the accused might have tried to get 
it in but had to remain out as the vaginal opening was small.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> There was no full penetration but the 
intent to enter the vagina was evident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p>Accused Eleuterio Dimapilis denied the charge and surmised that Sharon was 
merely brainwashed by her grandaunt Violeta Benjamin who was against his 
maintaining a relationship with her niece, Sharon's mother. According to him, 
Violeta's anger towards him worsened when he destroyed the windows and gate of 
her house. He narrated that when he arrived home at about two o'clock early 
morning, he found his common-law wife Linda crying. When he asked her, Linda 
told him that she was shoved and mauled by her <i>Auntie Violy</i>, referring to 
Violeta Benjamin, when she went to the latter's house to fetch Sharon. According 
to Eleuterio, he got mad because at that time Linda was already pregnant with 
his child. He went to her <i>Auntie Violy</i>'s house in Sorsuage, Makati, to 
demand an explanation why she maltreated his wife but nobody answered him at the 
door although he saw people inside peeping through the window jalousies. Irked, 
he hurled stones at the house, breaking in the process a few jalousies and a 
portion of the gate. Three (3) days later, a co-worker of Eleuterio informed him 
that someone was looking for him. He turned out to be an NBI agent who was there 
to pick him up for questioning in connection with a complaint filed against him. 
At the NBI headquarters he learned, to his surprise, that a complaint for rape 
was filed by Sharon with the assistance of Violeta Benjamin.</p>
<p>The accused argued that the rape charge supposedly committed in Sta. Ana in 
June 1993 was easily belied by the fact that at that time they were no longer 
residing in Sta. Ana, but in Batute, Makati, in a small rented room where they 
stayed up to 1994. He explained that they only resided in Sta. Ana, prior to 
1993.</p>
<p>As if affirming her faithfulness and loyalty to her common-law husband, Linda 
did not believe her own daughter's account; instead, she testified in favor of 
Eleuterio. She narrated that she and Eleuterio had been living together as 
husband and wife since 1992, renting a small room at the squatter's area 
together with her four (4) children, including Sharon, and that he worked as a 
jeepney driver. She recounted that Sharon often went to Lapaz, Makati, to work 
as a manicurist at her Aunt Alma's place. One time she fetched Sharon from there 
but Alma and her <i>Auntie Violy</i> refused to let Sharon go. According further 
to Linda, despite her pregnancy her <i>Auntie Violy</i> mauled her and whisked 
Sharon away in a taxicab to avoid her. She reported the incident to Eleuterio 
who upon hearing her rushed to their <i>Auntie Violy</i>'s house to confront her 
but failed to talk to her. Three (3) days later, an NBI agent went to their 
house looking for Eleuterio. She directed the agent to the office where 
Eleuterio was working as an stuntman. She found out later that Eleuterio was 
apprehended and was being detained at the NBI headquarters. There, she was 
surprised to see her <i>Auntie Violy</i> and that Sharon had filed a complaint 
against Eleuterio for rape. It dawned on her then that that might be what her 
<i>Auntie Violy</i> meant when she overheard her say that she would not stop 
until Eleuterio was incarcerated.</p>
<p>On 21 April 1997 the trial court rejected the theory of the defense and 
declared the accused Eleuterio Dimapilis guilty of rape. The court <i>a quo</i> 
declared that the accused's defense was a mere blanket denial which could not 
stand against the clear narration of Sharon that Eleuterio pressed his organ 
against hers after he woke her up, "fingered" her private organ, touched her 
breasts and kissed her body while rubbing his penis obviously to excite 
himself.</p>
<p>As regards the issue of residence raised by the defense, the trial court 
observed that the accused failed to specifically state the month in 1993 when 
they moved out of Sta. Ana, so that it could only be presumed that they were 
still residing in Sta. Ana when the rape was committed. Consequently, the trial 
court convicted the accused Eleuterio of rape and sentenced him to death. The 
trial court explained that under Art. 335 of <i>The Revised Penal Code</i>, as 
amended by RA 7659, the imposition of the penalty of death was justified as the 
qualifying circumstances of minority and relationship were established, Sharon 
being below twelve (12) years old at the time of the rape and the accused 
Eleuterio was the common-law husband of Sharon's mother.</p>
<p>The defense now asserts that the prosecution failed to prove the guilt of the 
accused beyond reasonable doubt. Accused Eleuterio argues that an examination of 
the testimony of Sharon would reveal that she failed to sufficiently outline the 
circumstances behind the perpetration of the offense, having utilized ambiguous 
terms or sweeping generalizations, describing the acts he allegedly performed on 
her, e.g., <i>ginalaw</i> or <i>hinalay</i>. He contends that the absence of a 
specific date as to when the rape was committed, the events leading to the 
commission of the crime, as well as the manner by which the abuse was committed, 
cast doubt on the veracity of Sharon's imputations and militates against her 
credibility. Thus, he concludes, for failure of the prosecution to draw details 
of the rape from Sharon he should be acquitted.</p>
<p>The evaluation of the testimonies of witnesses by the trial court is binding 
upon the appellate court in the absence of a clear showing that it was reached 
arbitrarily or that the trial court had plainly overlooked certain circumstances 
of substance or value which, if considered, might affect the result of the case. 
In prosecutions for rape, this Court has generally been guided by the following 
considerations in the evaluation of evidence: (a) an accusation for rape can be 
made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person 
accused, though innocent, to disprove it; (b) in view of the nature of the crime 
in which only two (2) persons usually are involved, the testimony of the 
complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and, (c) the evidence for 
the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to 
draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense. Consequently, 
conviction must rest on nothing less than proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>A scrutiny of the records reveals that Sharon gave a seemingly confusing 
testimony although, quite apparently, the slip errors could be traced to the 
bungling presentation of the prosecution's evidence. Nonetheless, this Court is 
convinced that Sharon was able to narrate in plain language the manner she was 
sexually abused by the accused. In her direct examination Sharon said that she 
had to leave their place in Sta. Ana because she was <i>ginagalaw</i> or 
<i>hinahalay</i> by Eleuterio. She recounted, in clarification, that in June 
1993 in Sta. Ana, Eleuterio "fingered" her, kissed her body, and forced his 
organ against hers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> When she was 
cross-examined she clarified that the incident happened at two o'clock in the 
afternoon and that the accused "fingered" her while rubbing his penis to attain 
an erection.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> She was sleeping at the 
time and there were no other persons inside the room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> She did not go to school so that she could 
watch over her siblings because her mother was going to gamble in Batute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On redirect examination she stuck to her 
theory that the incident happened in June 1993 when the accused did not report 
for work because his jeepney had to be repaired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It was on the same occasion that 
Eleuterio tried to insert his organ into hers and she felt it when he pressed it 
against her private part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> At that 
time, her mother was not around as she was in Batute while her brothers and 
sisters were playing outside the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thus, contrary to the contention of the 
accused, Sharon made a consistent and detailed account of how he sexually abused 
her in June 1993 inside their residence in Sta. Ana when nobody was around.</p>
<p>The exact date in June 1993 need not be specified, especially when Sharon 
could no longer remember it. She nevertheless particularly recalled that it was 
the day she did not go to school upon instruction of her mother and Eleuterio 
remained at home because his jeepney had to be fixed. Witnesses are not always 
expected to have a precise memory of the time and date when an event transpired. 
It is sufficient that it can be determined with particularity as opposed to 
other occasions unless time is considered an element of the crime. A perfect 
recollection of the time when a particular event occurred may even be viewed 
with suspicion and considered an indicium of the falsity or fabrication of a 
witness' account.</p>
<p>The terms <i>ginalaw</i> and <i>hinalay</i> are admittedly cryptic. Although 
they were sufficiently clarified by Sharon to mean that the accused "fingered" 
her private organ, kissed her body while stimulating his penis into an erection 
and tried to penetrate her, albeit unsuccessfully in view of the natural 
resistance at her opening and her propitious cry of pain, all prelude to 
copulation, the fact of penetration, however slight, which is necessary for a 
conviction for consummated rape, remained nebulous and unclear.</p>
<p>Notably, Sharon made conflicting assertions regarding the entry of the penis 
into her vagina. On direct examination, Sharon confirmed that Eleuterio inserted 
his organ into hers, which pained her and for which she cried.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On cross-examination, however, twice she 
denied that penetration occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> On 
re-direct examination she reiterated that he was not able to insert his private 
part into hers because she felt pain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> 
In fact, subsequently, she reiterated that the organ of the accused did not 
penetrate hers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Thus, although in her 
direct examination she asserted that his penis penetrated her vagina, she 
repeatedly and steadfastly denied any penetration of her organ in subsequent 
proceedings.</p>
<p>Thus, in <i>People v. Campuhan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> this Court clarified that the touching of 
the female organ to constitute consummated rape should be construed in relation 
to the entry by the penis into the <i>labia majora</i>. It is not mere touching 
in the ordinary sense, nor a grazing or clashing alone of the organs, but there 
must be entry of the vagina of the victim <u>even in the slightest degree</u>. 
In that case, the judgment of the court <i>a quo</i> holding the accused guilty 
of consummated rape was modified to attempted rape for failure of the 
prosecution to prove the slightest intrusion into the <i>labia majora</i> of the 
victim.</p>
<p>The testimony of the medico-legal officer is definitive proof that 
penetration did not occur. Dr. Aurea P. Villena testified that she found 
superficial old healed lacerations in the vagina of Sharon that showed that she 
had indeed been abused, and that the lacerations could only have been sustained 
not more than three (3) months before the examination was conducted,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which was in 1996 or three (3) years 
after the June 1993 incident. As such, it could not be held as conclusive 
evidence thereof. At any rate, it may be recalled that three (3) other 
Informations for rape were filed by Sharon against the same accused for sexual 
abuses committed in Makati the last of which occurred in February 1996, or three 
(3) months before the medico-legal examination in May 1996. Thus it stands to 
reason that by proximity alone the medico-legal report would be more reflective 
of that occasion rather than the event subject matter of this review. Be that as 
it may, it is clear that the accused sexually abused Sharon in June 1993. From 
all manifestations, Eleuterio attempted to rape Sharon. By his overt acts, he 
had commenced the commission of rape but was not able to consummate the act 
because of Sharon's outcry, which was not clearly shown to have emanated from 
any penetration but merely from an attempt to do so.</p>
<p>Parenthetically, the trial court erroneously relying on Art. 335 of <i>The 
Revised Penal Code</i> as amended by RA 7659 imposed the penalty of death on the 
accused on account of the minority of the victim and her relationship to the 
accused. However, it should be noted that the crime was committed in June 1993 
at a time when RA 7659 imposing the death penalty was not yet in effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Consequently, the accused should be 
penalized in accordance with the old law, Art. 355 before its amendment, under 
which an accused who had sexual congress with a child below twelve (12) years 
old was held guilty of statutory rape and sentenced to the penalty of 
<i>reclusion perpetua</i>. The circumstance of minority was taken merely as an 
element of the crime of statutory rape, and relationship was treated as an 
aggravating circumstance which could not increase the indivisible penalty of 
<i>reclusion perpetua</i> as imposed by law.</p>
<p>The penalty for attempted rape is two (2) degrees lower than the imposable 
penalty for consummated rape which is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>. Two (2) degrees 
lower would be <i>prision mayor </i>the range of which is six (6) years one (1) 
day to twelve (12) years. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and taking 
into account the presence of relationship as aggravating circumstance, the 
maximum of the penalty to be imposed upon the accused shall be taken from the 
maximum period of <i>prision mayor</i>, the range of which is ten (10) years and 
one (1) day to twelve (12) years. The minimum shall be taken from the penalty 
next lower in degree which is <i>prision correccional</i> the range of which is 
six (6) months and one (1) day to six (6) years, in any of its periods.</p>
<p>As regards moral damages, they are awarded in such amount as the court deems 
just without necessity for pleading or proof thereof. Recent jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> has pegged the amount to P50,000.00 for 
victims of consummated rape. The award by the court <i>a quo</i> of P500,000.00 
as moral damages in favor of the victim is thus too excessive. For attempted 
rape P25,000.00 may be considered reasonable.</p>
<p>Exemplary damages may likewise be awarded to the victim in the amount of 
P10,000.00, considering the existence of the aggravating circumstance of 
relationship, as a deterrent against those who may be similarly situated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the court <i>a quo</i> declaring ELEUTERIO 
DIMAPILIS (also known as <i>Jun, Dakila </i>or <i>Daky</i>) guilty of rape and 
sentencing him to death and to pay his victim P500,000.00 in moral damages is 
<strong>MODIFIED</strong>; instead, the accused is held guilty of ATTEMPTED RAPE 
and is sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of four (4) years and two (2) 
months of <i>prision correccional</i> medium, as minimum, to ten (10) years four 
(4) months and ten (10) days of <i>prision mayor</i> maximum, as maximum, and to 
pay his victim Sharon Degala Salas the sum of P25,000.00 for moral damages and 
P10,000.00 for exemplary damages. Costs <i>de oficio.</i> </p>
