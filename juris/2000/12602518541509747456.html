				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before the Court for automatic review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Masbate, Branch 46, in Criminal Case No. 7978, convicting the accused-appellant, Rudy Cortes y Caballero, of the crime of rape committed against Analiza Germina y Banculo, sentencing him to suffer the supreme penalty of death, and disposing thus:<br><blockquote><i>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Rudy Cortes y Caballero guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape defined under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code with three (3) attendant aggravating circumstances a crime penalized under R.A. No. 2632 and R.A. No. 411, and hereby imposes to the accused the supreme penalty of DEATH and to indemnify the victim, Analiza Germina, the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages, and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></i><br></blockquote>Filed on January 16, 1996, the Information charging the accused-appellant with the crime of rape, alleges:<br><blockquote><i>"That on or about September 29, 1995, at about 12:00 o’clock midnight, at Sitio Balik-Balik [sic], Barangay Poblacion, Municipality of Baleno, Province of Masbate, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused armed with a knife, by means of violence and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously have carnal knowledge with Analiza Germina y Banculo against her will and consent.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></i><br></blockquote>The inculpatory facts and circumstances complained of can be culled as follows:<br><br>The private Complainant, Analiza Germina y Banculo, seventeen years old (17), was the lone occupant of her parents’ house at Sitio Balik-Balik [sic], Poblacion, Baleno, Masbate, as she was studying in the nearby Baleno High School. Her parents were then staying in another house at Barangay Batuila, Baleno, Masbate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>At around midnight of September 22, 1995, Analiza was suddenly awakened by a heavy weight pressing down upon her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Since the house was lighted, she recognized her attacker, Rudy Cortes y Caballero, who is her brother-in-law. Accused-appellant pointed a knife at her throat and covered her mouth with a handkerchief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Despite Analiza’s struggle to free herself, the accused-appellant succeeded in removing her underpants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> With his one hand poking a knife near her throat, and the other holding her hand, he positioned his legs on top of the legs of Analiza and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina even as the latter felt a strange onslaught of pain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> After consummating his crime, accused-appellant warned Analiza to keep the incident to herself or he would kill her; wielding his knife to signify the threat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On November 12, 1995, Analiza had gathered enough courage to report the incident to her mother such that on November 17, 1995, she was brought to Dra. Marilou A. Hernandez for medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The pertinent portion of the medical report dated November 11, 1995, stated:<br><blockquote><i>"hymenal healed laceration at 6:00 o’clock position Vaginal os admits two fingers with ease."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></i><br></blockquote>Accused-appellant interposed alibi as a defense. He declared that in the night of September 29, 1995, he was inside his house in Sog-ong, Baleno, Masbate. According to him, the victim had a misunderstanding with her older sister, Elsa Cortes, (his wife) because they advised the victim not to allow her boyfriend to sleep in their parents' house in Balic-Balic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> This version of accused-appellant was corroborated by his wife Elsa Cortes, who testified that from 6:00 o'clock in the evening of September 29, 1995 until the following morning, accused-appellant was in their house. Elsa likewise confirmed the alleged misunderstanding between her and Analiza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On April 28, 1997, the trial court came out with the judgment of conviction under automatic review. The defense contends that:<br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE COURT <span style="font-style: italic;">A QUO</span> ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN ORDERING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT TO INDEMNIFY THE VICTIM IN THE AMOUNT OF P50,000.00 AS MORAL DAMAGES AND TO PAY THE COSTS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>It is doctrinal that the evaluation by the trial court of the testimony of a witness is accorded with highest respect because the trial court had the direct and singular opportunity to observe the facial expression, gesture, and tone of voice of a witness while testifying and therefore, competent to determine whether or not the witness is telling the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In the case under scrutiny, the trial court gave credence to the testimony of the rape victim, ratiocinating thus:<br><blockquote><i>"The victim in testifying how the crime of rape was committed against her was straightforward and direct on the material facts which has all the earmarks of truthfulness"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></i><br></blockquote>Indeed, the victim’s truthfulness can be gleaned unerringly from her testimony, to wit:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr style="font-style: italic;"><td colspan="2" valign="top">"xxx <br><br> </td></tr><tr><td style="font-style: italic;" valign="top" width="10%"> Q </td><td style="font-style: italic;" valign="top" width="90%"> While you were sleeping on that date September 29, 1995 at about 12 midnight inside your house, will you tell us if something unusual happened?

Marilou A. Hernandez, who opined that the healed laceration at 6:00 o’clock position on the victim’s hymen could have been caused by sexual intercourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Against the tale of Analiza, accused-appellant put up alibi as a defense. Time-honored is the rule that alibi is inherently weak and easily contrived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Accused-appellant must therefore prove with clear and convincing evidence that it was physically impossible for him to be at the place and approximate time of commission of the felony,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> which quantum of proof he failed to come forward with.<br><br>The house of accused-appellant is approximately three kilometers from the <i>locus criminis</i>, a distance which could be negotiated in less than an hour hike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> It was not then physically impossible for accused-appellant to leave and after raping Analiza, to return to his house without his wife noticing his brief absence.<br><br>What is more, the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive testimony of the prosecution witness and her clear identification of accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In the case under scrutiny, since accused-appellant was positively identified by the rape victim, his defense of alibi cannot prevail.<br><br>Accused-appellant theorized that the lower court did not consider infirmities in the testimony of Analiza which should have warranted his acquittal. He argued<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> that it was highly improbable for him (accused-appellant) to have been on top of the victim for one long hour before he was able to consummate the rape.<br><br>The Court discerns no basis for deviating from the settled rule that testimonies of rape victims who are young and immature are credible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Inconsistencies in their testimonies on minor details do not affect the substance of their declaration, veracity and weight of their testimony. As aptly held by the trial court, "Although the length of time might be too long, the precise length of time would be of no moment since it could have been only be an error in her approximation of the length of time."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Verily, the length of time during which accused-appellant was on top of the victim is only a minor detail which cannot detract from the fact of rape. It could simply mean that due to the resistance of the victim, it took a long time before accused-appellant succeeded in consummating his crime. So also, the mistake in the calculation of time could have been engendered by the natural fickleness of memory which tends to strengthen rather than weaken credibility as it erases any suspicion of rehearsed testimony and does not destroy the substance of her testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Besides, it is not unlikely that accused-appellant stayed that long on top of the victim considering the apparent impunity which the surrounding circumstances afforded him. It bears stressing that the victim was all alone in her house, not to mention the fact that her mouth was covered by a handkerchief, and her cries could not have possibly caught the attention of the neighbors who, at twelve midnight, were presumably in deep slumber.<br><br>Accused-appellant argued further that if the rape was consummated only after an hour, "then he runs the risk of being seen in the house in a very compromising situation considering that it was night time and the victim was alone in the house."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> In a long line of rape cases, the Court has consistently held that lust is no respecter of time and place, and rape can be and has been committed in even the unlikeliest of places. Venues of rape have been inside a house where there were other occupants, in a room adjacent to where the victim’s family members were sleeping or even in a room which the victim shares with the sister of the offender. There is no rule that rape can be committed only in seclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> With more reason therefore that the aforecited ruling should be applied in this case. As stressed upon by the Solicitor General, the situation of the victim is practically an open invitation to the criminally deviant, like the accused-appellant who, being the brother-in-law of the victim, knew her isolation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Contrary to the claim of accused-appellant, the time and place of commission of the crime sued upon actually created a very nil chance for him to be caught because the victim was alone in the house and the people in the neighborhood could not be expected to be all awake and roaming around the streets at midnight.<br><br>Neither does the Court find convincing the claim of delay on the part of the victim in reporting the sexual assault against her. This Court has consistently held that delay in reporting rape incidents in the face of threats of physical violence, cannot be taken against the victim. A rape victim’s action is oftentimes overwhelmed by fear rather than by reason. It is this fear, springing from the initial rape, that the perpetrator hopes to build up a climate of extreme psychological terror, which would, he hopes, numb his victim into silence and submissiveness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The case of Analiza appears to be no exception. The threat of accused-appellant on her life generated fear in her mind which for a period of more than a month cowed her into silence.<br><br>No tenability can be fathomed in the supposed ill-motive imputed on the victim by accused-appellant and his wife. It would take more than an advice which allegedly angered the victim for the latter to subject her family to humiliation, and herself to embarrassment and life-long stigma. No woman, especially of tender age, would concoct a story of defloration, allow the examination of her private parts, and thereafter, pervert herself by being subjected to a public trial if she was not motivated solely by the desire to vindicate her honor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The trial court correctly found that the rape was committed with the use of a deadly weapon and consequently, the imposable penalty therefor is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Reclusion perpetua and death are indivisible penalties. Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code provides the rules for their application, one of which, pertinent to the case under consideration, is that when in the commission of the crime only one aggravating circumstance was present, the graver penalty is to be imposed.<br><br>In the present case, the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity, dwelling and relationship were considered by the lower court. But the aggravating circumstance of nocturnity cannot be appreciated since the evidence does not convincingly show that nighttime was purposely sought by the accused-appellant to ensure its execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>So also, the aggravating circumstance of relationship cannot be appreciated in this case because relationship,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> which is a special aggravating circumstance, must be specifically alleged in the Information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Since the prosecution failed to state in the Information that the accused-appellant is the victim's brother-in-law (a relative by affinity within the second civil degree), being the husband of the victim's eldest sister, Elsa Germina, the aggravating circumstance of relationship cannot be considered to aggravate the penalty of accused -appellant.<br><br>On the question of whether or not the aggravating circumstance of dwelling attended the commission of the crime, a ruling in the affirmative has not been reached. Consequently, absent any modifying circumstance, the lesser penalty provided by law should be imposed.<br><br>Under prevailing jurisprudence, the victim is entitled to an indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> in the amount of Fifty Thousand (<strike>P</strike>50,000.00) Pesos, in addition to the <strike>P</strike>50,000.00 moral damages awarded by the trial court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of Branch 46 of the Regional Trial Court of Masbate in Criminal Case No. 7987, finding accused-appellant Rudy Cortes y Caballero guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with the modification that the penalty of reclusion perpetua is imposed.<br><br>Accused-appellant is further sentenced to pay the victim, Analiza Germina y Banculo, the amount of Fifty Thousand (<strike>P</strike>50,000.00) Pesos, as indemnity <i>ex delicto</i>, apart from moral damages of Fifty Thousand (<strike>P</strike>50,000.00) Pesos.
