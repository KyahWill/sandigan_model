				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The central issue posed before this Court in the present case is the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 8551 (RA 8551), otherwise known as the "Philippine National Police Reform and Reorganization Act of 1998,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> by virtue of which petitioners herein, who were all members of the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM), were separated from office. Petitioners claim that such law violates their constitutionally guaranteed right to security of tenure.<br><br>The NAPOLCOM was originally created under Republic Act No. 6975 (RA 6975), entitled "An Act Establishing The Philippine National Police Under A Reorganized Department Of The Interior And Local Government, And For Other Purposes." Under RA 6975, the members of the NAPOLCOM were petitioners Edgar Dula Torres, Alexis C. Canonizado, Rogelio A. Pureza and respondent Jose Percival L. Adiong. Dula Torres was first appointed to the NAPOLCOM on January 8, 1991 for a six year term. He was re-appointed on January 23, 1997 for another six years. Canonizado was appointed on January 25, 1993 to serve the unexpired term of another Commissioner which ended on December 31, 1995. On August 23, 1995, Canonizado was re-appointed for another six years. Pureza was appointed on January 2, 1997 for a similar term of six years. Respondent Adiong’s appointment to the NAPOLCOM was issued on July 23, 1996. None of their terms had expired at the time the amendatory law was passed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On March 6, 1998, RA 8551 took effect; it declared that the terms of the current Commissioners were deemed as expired upon its effectivity. Pursuant thereto, President Ramos appointed Romeo L. Cairme on March 11, 1998 as a member of the NAPOLCOM for a full six year term. On the same date, Adiong, was given a term extension of two years since he had served less than two years of his previous term. Cairme and Adiong both took their oaths of office on April 6, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Completing the membership of the NAPOLCOM are Leo S. Magahum and Cleofe M. Factoran, who were appointed by President Estrada on June 30, 1998 and who took their oaths of office on July 2, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>According to petitioners, sections 4 and 8 of RA 8551 are unconstitutional. Section 4, amending section 13 of Republic Act No. 6975, provides -<br><blockquote>SEC. 13. Creation and Composition. – A National Police Commission, hereinafter referred to as the Commission, is hereby created for the purpose of effectively discharging the functions prescribed in the Constitution and provided in this Act. The Commission shall be an agency attached to the Department for policy and program coordination. It shall be composed of a Chairperson, four (4) regular Commissioners, and the Chief of the PNP as <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-officio</span> member. Three (3) of the regular Commissioners shall come from the civilian sector who are neither active nor former members of the police or military, one (1) of whom shall be designated as vice chairperson by the President. The fourth regular Commissioner shall come from the law enforcement sector either active or retired: Provided, That an active member of a law enforcement agency shall be considered resigned from said agency once appointed to the Commission: Provided further, That at least one (1) of the Commissioners shall be a woman. The Secretary of the Department shall be the <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-officio</span> Chairperson of the Commission, while the Vice Chairperson shall act as the executive officer of the Commission.<br></blockquote>Meanwhile, section 8 states that -<br><blockquote>Upon the effectivity of this Act, the terms of office of the current Commissioners are deemed expired which shall constitute a bar to their reappointment or an extension of their terms in the Commission except for current Commissioners who have served less than two (2) years of their terms of office who may be appointed by the President for a maximum term of two (2) years.<br></blockquote>Petitioners argue that their removal from office by virtue of section 8 of RA 8551 violates their security of tenure.<br><br>It is beyond dispute that petitioners herein are members of the civil service, which embraces all branches, subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies of the Government, including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> As such, they cannot be removed or suspended from office, except for cause provided by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The phrase "except for cause provided by law" refers to "… reasons which the law and sound public policy recognize as sufficient warrant for removal, that is, legal cause, and not merely causes which the appointing power in the exercise of discretion may deem sufficient."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Public respondents insist that the express declaration in section 8 of RA 8551 that the terms of petitioners’ offices are deemed expired discloses the legislative intent to impliedly abolish the NAPOLCOM created under RA 6975 pursuant to a <i>bona fide</i> reorganization. In support of their theory, public respondents cite the various changes introduced by RA 8551 in the functions, composition and character of the NAPOLCOM as proof of Congress’ intention to abolish the body created under RA 6975 in order to replace it with a new NAPOLCOM which is more civilian in nature, in compliance with the constitutional mandate. Petitioners’ posit the theory that the abolition of petitioners’ offices was a result of a reorganization of the NAPOLCOM allegedly effected by RA 8551.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The creation and abolition of public offices is primarily a legislative function.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> It is acknowledged that Congress may abolish any office it creates without impairing the officer’s right to continue in the position held<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and that such power may be exercised for various reasons, such as the lack of funds<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> or in the interest of economy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> However, in order for the abolition to be valid, it must be made in good faith, not for political or personal reasons, or in order to circumvent the constitutional security of tenure of civil service employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>An abolition of office connotes an intention to do away with such office wholly and permanently, as the word "abolished" denotes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Where one office is abolished and replaced with another office vested with similar functions, the abolition is a legal nullity. Thus, in <i>U.P. Board of Regents v. Rasul</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> we said:<br><blockquote>It is true that a valid and <i>bona fide</i> abolition of an office denies to the incumbent the right to security of tenure. [De la Lanna v. Alba, 112 SCRA 294 (1982)] However, in this case, the renaming and restructuring of the PGH and its component units cannot give rise to a valid and <i>bona fide</i> abolition of the position of PGH Director. <u>This is because where the abolished office and the offices created in its place have similar functions, the abolition lacks good faith.</u> [Jose L. Guerrero v. Hon. Antonio V. Arizabal, G.R. No. 81928, June 4, 1990, 186 SCRA 108 (1990)] We hereby apply the principle enunciated in <i>Cesar Z. Dario vs. Hon. Salvador M. Mison</i> [176 SCRA 84 (1989)] that abolition which merely changes the nomenclature of positions is invalid and does not result in the removal of the incumbent.<br><br>The above notwithstanding, and assuming that the abolition of the position of the PGH Director and the creation of a UP-PGH Medical Center Director are valid, <u>the removal of the incumbent is still not justified for the reason that the duties and functions of the two positions are basically the same</u>…. (underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>This was also our ruling in <i>Guerrero v. Arizabal</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> wherein we declared that the substantial identity in the functions between the two offices was <i>indicia</i> of bad faith in the removal of petitioner pursuant to a reorganization.<br><br>We come now to the case at bench. The question that must first be resolved is whether or not petitioners were removed by virtue of a valid abolition of their office by Congress. More specifically, whether the changes effected by RA 8551 in reference to the NAPOLCOM were so substantial as to effectively create a completely new office in contemplation of the law. In answer to this query, the case of <i>Mayor v. Macaraig</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> is squarely in point.<br><br>In that case, the petitioners assailed the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 6715<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> insofar as it declared vacant the positions of the Commissioners, Executive Labor Arbiters and Labor Arbiters of the National Labor Relations Commission and provided for the removal of the incumbents upon the appointment and qualification of their successors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The Court held that the removal of petitioners was unconstitutional since Republic Act No. 6715 did not expressly or impliedly abolish the offices of petitioners, there being no irreconcilable inconsistency in the nature, duties and functions of the petitioners’ offices under the old law and the new law. Thus:<br><blockquote>Abolition of an office is obviously not the same as the declaration that that office is vacant. While it is undoubtedly a prerogative of the legislature to abolish certain offices, it can not be conceded the power to simply pronounce those offices vacant and thereby effectively remove the occupants or holders thereof from the civil service. Such an act would constitute, on its face, an infringement of the constitutional guarantee of security of tenure, and will have to be struck down on that account. It can not be justified by the professed "need to professionalize the higher levels of officialdom invested with adjudicatory powers and functions, and to upgrade their qualifications, ranks, and salaries or emoluments.<br></blockquote>This is precisely what RA 8851 seeks to do - declare the offices of petitioners vacant, by declaring that "the terms of office of the current Commissioners are deemed expired," thereby removing petitioners herein from the civil service. Congress may only be conceded this power if it is done pursuant to a <i>bona fide</i> abolition of the NAPOLCOM.<br><br>RA 8551 did not expressly abolish petitioners’ positions. In order to determine whether there has been an implied abolition, it becomes necessary to examine the changes introduced by the new law in the nature, composition and functions of the NAPOLCOM.<br><br>Under RA 6975, the NAPOLCOM was described as a collegial body within the Department of the Interior and Local Government,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Department) whereas under RA 8551 it is made "an agency attached to the Department for policy and program coordination."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Contrary to what public respondents would have us believe, this does not result in the creation of an entirely new office. In <i>Mayor</i>, the NLRC, prior to the passage of the amendatory law, was also considered an integral part of the Department of Labor and Employment. RA 6715, however, changed that by declaring that it shall instead "..be attached to the Department of Labor and Employment for program coordination only…." making it a more autonomous body. The Court held that this change in the NLRC’s nature was not sufficient to justify a conclusion that the new law abolished the offices of the labor commissioners.<br><br>Another amendment pointed out by public respondents is the revision of the NAPOLCOM’s composition. RA 8551 expanded the membership of the NAPOLCOM from four to five Commissioners by adding the Chief of the PNP as an <i>ex-officio</i> member. In addition, the new law provided that three of the regular Commissioners shall come from the civilian sector who are neither active nor former members of the police or military, and that the fourth regular Commissioner shall come from the law enforcement sector either active or retired. Furthermore, it is required that at least one of the Commissioners shall be a woman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Again, as we held in <i>Mayor</i>, such revisions do not constitute such essential changes in the nature of the NAPOLCOM as to result in an implied abolition of such office. It will be noted that the organizational structure of the NAPOLCOM, as provided in section 20 of RA 6975 as amended by section 10 of RA 8551,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> remains essentially the same and that, except for the addition of the PNP Chief as <i>ex-officio</i> member, the composition of the NAPOLCOM is also substantially identical under the two laws. Also, under both laws, the Secretary of the Department shall act as the <i>ex-officio</i> Chairman of the Commission and the Vice-Chairman shall be one of the Commissioners designated by the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Finally, the powers and duties of the NAPOLCOM remain basically unchanged by the amendments. Under RA 6975, the Commission has the following powers and functions:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" align="center" bgcolor="#ffffff" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td style="font-weight: bold;" valign="top" width="5%"> (a) </td><td valign="top" width="95%"> <div align="justify">Exercise administrative control over the Philippine National Police;

Control means "the power of an officer to alter or modify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for the that of the latter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> On the other hand, to supervise is to oversee, to have oversight of, to superintend the execution of or the performance of a thing, or the movements or work of a person, to inspect with authority; it is the power or authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Thus, the power of control necessarily encompasses the power of supervision and adding the phrase "operational supervision" under the powers of the NAPOLCOM would not bring about a substantial change in its functions so as to arrive at the conclusion that a completely new office has been created.<br><br>Public respondents would have this Court believe that RA 8551 reorganized the NAPOLCOM resulting in the abolition of petitioners’ offices. We hold that there has been absolutely no attempt by Congress to effect such a reorganization.<br><br>Reorganization takes place when there is an alteration of the existing structure of government offices or units therein, including the lines of control, authority and responsibility between them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> It involves a reduction of personnel, consolidation of offices, or abolition thereof by reason of economy or redundancy of functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Naturally, it may result in the loss of one’s position through removal or abolition of an office. However, for a reorganization to be valid, it must also pass the test of good faith, laid down in Dario v. Mison:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><blockquote>...As a general rule, a reorganization is carried out in "good faith" if it is for the purpose of economy or to make bureaucracy more efficient. In that event, no dismissal (in case of a dismissal) or separation actually occurs because the position itself ceases to exist. And in that case, security of tenure would not be a Chinese wall. Be that as it may, if the "abolition," which is nothing else but a separation or removal, is done for political reasons or purposely to defeat security of tenure, or otherwise not in good faith, no valid "abolition" takes place and whatever "abolition" is done, is void <i>ab initio.</i> There is an invalid "abolition" as where there is merely a change of nomenclature of positions, or where claims of economy are belied by the existence of ample funds.<br></blockquote>It is exceedingly apparent to this Court that RA 8551 effected a reorganization of the PNP, not of the NAPOLCOM. They are two separate and distinct bodies, with one having supervision and control over the other. In fact, it is the NAPOLCOM that is given the duty of submitting a proposed reorganization plan of the PNP to Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> As mentioned earlier, the basic structure of the NAPOLCOM has been preserved by the amendatory law. There has been no revision in its lines of control, authority and responsibility, neither has there been a reduction in its membership, nor a consolidation or abolition of the offices constituting the same. Adding the Chief of the PNP as an <i>ex-officio</i> member of the Commission does not result in a reorganization.<br><br>No <i>bona fide</i> reorganization of the NAPOLCOM having been mandated by Congress, RA 8551, insofar as it declares the terms of office of the incumbent Commissioners, petitioners herein, as expired and resulting in their removal from office, removes civil service employees from office without legal cause and must therefore be struck down for being constitutionally infirm.<br><br>Petitioners are thus entitled to be reinstated to office. It is of no moment that there are now new appointees to the NAPOLCOM. It is a well-entrenched principle that when a regular government employee is illegally dismissed, his position never became vacant under the law and he is considered as not having left his office. The new appointments made in order to replace petitioners are not valid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>At this juncture, we note that it is alleged by public respondents that on June 30, 1998, Canonizado accepted an appointment by President Estrada as the Inspector General of Internal Affairs Services (IAS) of the PNP, pursuant to sections 40 and 41 of RA 8551 and that he took his oath of office before the President on July 7, 1998. However, this is a mere allegation on the part of public respondents of which this Court cannot take judicial notice. Furthermore, this issue has not been fully ventilated in the pleadings of the parties. Therefore, such allegation cannot be taken into consideration by this Court in passing upon the issues in the present case.<br><br>Petitioners also assail the constitutionality of section 4 of RA 8551 insofar as it limits the law enforcement sector to only one position on the Commission and categorizes the police as being part of the law enforcement sector despite section 6 of Article XVI of the Constitution which provides that the police force shall be civilian in character. Moreover, it is asserted by petitioners that the requirement in section 4 that one of the Commissioners shall be a woman has no rational basis and is therefore discriminatory. They claim that it amounts to class legislation and amounts to an undue restriction upon the appointing power of the President as provided under section 16 of Article VII of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In view of our ruling upon the unconstitutionality of petitioners’ removal from office by virtue of section 8 of RA 8551, we find that there is no longer any need to pass upon these remaining constitutional questions. It is beyond doubt that the legislature has the power to provide for the composition of the NAPOLCOM since it created such body.
