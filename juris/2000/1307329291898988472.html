</p>The case is an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, Bacoor, Cavite,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 finding accused-appellant, Jocelyn Daria Radam Acbangin (hereinafter 
referred to as "Jocelyn") guilty beyond reasonable doubt of kidnapping 
and serious illegal detention, and sentencing her to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.  In the same decision, the court acquitted accused Juanita Niu (hereinafter referred to as "Niu").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><p>We state the facts.
</p><p>On April 23, 1991, at around seven o'clock in the evening, Danilo
 Acbangin was worried when his daughter, four-year old Sweet Grace 
Acbangin (hereinafter referred to as "Sweet") did not come home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
</p><p>Sweet's father, Danilo, testified that he last saw Sweet on the 
same day, at six o'clock in the evening, playing in Jocelyn's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Jocelyn was the common law wife of his second cousin, Remy Acbangin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
</p><p>Danilo went to Jocelyn's house and looked for Sweet.  There was no one there. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
</p><p>At around seven fifteen in the evening, Danilo reported to the Barangay and the Bacoor Police Station that Sweet was missing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
</p><p>On the same day at eleven o'clock in the evening, Jocelyn arrived
 at Danilo's house without Sweet.  When asked where the child was, 
Jocelyn denied knowing of the child's whereabouts.
</p><p>On April 24, 1991, Danilo made a second report to the Bacoor Police Station, stating that Jocelyn returned without the child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
</p><p>On April 24, 1991, Jocelyn informed Danilo's mother-in-law that Sweet was in Niu's house in Tondo, Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>9
</p><p>On April 25, 1991, the case was reported to the Manila police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
</p><p>Jocelyn accompanied Danilo, Sweet's grandfather and police officers to Niu's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Jocelyn personally knew Niu and was first to enter the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Jocelyn went up to the second floor of the house.  She went down with Niu and Sweet.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Sweet was well-dressed and smiling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> She ran to her father and embraced him.  Niu then voluntarily turned Sweet over to her father and the policemen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
</p><p>Pat. Manuel Lao testified that when he asked Niu how she came to 
have possession of the child, she answered that a certain "Helen" 
brought the child to her.  This "Helen" could not be found.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
</p><p>However, on the witness stand, Niu told a different story. Niu 
narrated that it was Jocelyn who brought Sweet to her house on April 23,
 1991.  Jocelyn told Niu that she was going to leave the child and was 
going to return to get her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
</p><p>On April 26, 1991, a complaint for kidnapping a minor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 was filed against accused appellant Jocelyn Acbangin, accused Niu, 
Helen Doe and Juana Doe with the Municipal Trial Court, Bacoor, Cavite, 
to wit:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>â€œThat on the 23rd day of April 1991 (Tuesday) at about 7:00 P. M. 
at Brgy. San Nicolas, in the municipality of Bacoor, the above-named 
accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping each other, 
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx being a private person (sic), kidnapped and deprived 
one SWEET JOCELYN ACBANGIN, a xxxx four years old child (sic) without 
any justifiable cause which is prohibited by law to the damages (sic) 
and prejudice of said SWEET JOCELYN ACBANGIN and her relatives. </p>
  <p>"CONTRARY TO LAW."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On September 2, 1991, an information for kidnapping a minor was filed with the Regional Trial Court, Bacoor, Cavite<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> against Niu, Jocelyn and two Mary Does, to wit:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"That on or about the 23rd day of April 1991 at around 7:00 o'clock
 in the evening, at Barangay San Nicolas, Municipality of Bacoor, 
Province of Cavite, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and 
mutually helping and aiding one another, the above-named accused Jocelyn
 Acbangin, being then the auntie of Sweet Grace Acbangin, and being then
 private individuals, did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously, take, kidnap and deprive said Sweet Grace Acbangin of her 
liberty and failed to return her to the custody of her parents, thereby 
causing her damage and prejudice. </p>
  <p>"CONTRARY TO LAW."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On May 26, 1992, accused Niu and accused-appellant Jocelyn were arraigned.  Both pleaded "not guilty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
</p><p>At the trial, Jocelyn testified that: For six years, she was 
employed as Niu's housemaid.  While working for Niu, she took care of 
several children of different ages.  The number of children in Niu's 
household would vary from seven to fourteen.  According to Jocelyn, Niu 
was in the business of selling children.  On April 23, 1993, Sweet was 
brought to Niu's house by a certain Celia and Helen.  Jocelyn recognized
 Sweet as her niece.  Upon seeing Sweet, she decided to go to Sweet's 
parents in Bacoor, Cavite.  She then accompanied Sweet's father, along 
with some policemen to Niu's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
</p><p>On June 22, 1994, the trial court rendered the appealed decision.  We quote its <em>fallo</em>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, only accused Jocelyn Acbangin is 
hereby found Guilty Beyond Reasonable Doubt of the crime of Kidnapping 
and Serious Illegal Detention punishable under Article 267 of the 
Revised Penal Code with the imposable penalty of Reclusion Perpetua to 
Death.  Thus, she should suffer the prison term of Reclusion Perpetua. </p>
  <p>"This Court finds the above penalty to be too harsh to be imposed 
against 23-year old and third year high school student-accused Jocelyn 
Acbangin.  The evidence on record had not clearly indicated that Danilo 
Acbangin and minor-victim Sweet Grace Acbangin during the latter's two 
day stay in the house of Juanita Niu has been emotionally or physically 
injured.  The degree of malicious intent of accused Jocelyn does not 
warrant the excessive penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. </p>
  <p>"In connection with Article 5 of the Revised Penal Code, this Court
 recommends to His Excellency, the President of the Philippines, thru 
the Secretary of Justice, that executive clemency be extended to accused
 Jocelyn Acbangin as a means of mitigating the undue harshness of the 
penalty herein imposed. </p>
  <p>"Also send a copy of this Decision to the Provincial Warden of Trece Martires City for his information and guidance. </p>
  <p>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On August 8, 1994, accused-appellant filed a notice of appeal with the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
</p><p>Accused-appellant contends that her guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
</p><p>We deny the appeal.
</p><p>Jocelyn knew for two days where Sweet was.  In fact, it was she 
who brought Sweet to Niu's house.  The fact that she later on felt 
remorse for taking Sweet to Tondo, Manila and showed Sweet's father 
where the child was, cannot absolve her.  At that point, the crime was 
consummated.  Jocelyn's repentance and desistance came too late.
</p><p>The elements of serious illegal detention are: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"(1)      that the offender is a <em>private individual</em>; </p>
  <p>"(2)      that he kidnaps or detains another, or in any manner <em>deprives the latter of his liberty</em>; </p>
  <p>"(3)      that the act of detention or kidnapping must be illegal; </p>
  <p>"(4)      in the commission of the offense any of the following circumstances are present: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"(a)      that the kidnapping or detention lasts for more than 5 days; </p>
    <p>"(b)      that it is committed simulating public authority; </p>
    <p>"(c)       that any serious physical injuries are inflicted upon 
the person kidnapped or detained or threats to kill him are made; or </p>
    <p>"(d)      that the person kidnapped is <u>a minor</u>, female or public officer.  (<em>underscoring ours</em>)"
      </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case at bar, all the aforementioned requisites were present and were proven beyond reasonable doubt.
</p><p>In cases of kidnapping, if the person detained is a child, the 
question is whether there was actual deprivation of the child's liberty,
 and whether it was the intention of the accused to deprive the parents 
of the custody of the child.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
</p><p>Sweet was deprived of her liberty.  True, she was treated well.  
However, there is still kidnapping.  For there to be kidnapping, it is 
not necessary that the victim be placed in an enclosure.  It is enough 
that the victim is restrained from going home.  Given Sweet's tender 
age, when Jocelyn left her in Niu's house, at a distant place in Tondo, 
Manila, unknown to her, she deprived Sweet of the freedom to leave the 
house at will.  It is not necessary that the detention be prolonged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
</p><p>The intention to deprive Sweet's parents of her custody is 
indicated by Jocelyn's hesitation for two days to disclose Sweet's 
whereabouts and more so by her actual taking of the child.  Jocelyn's 
motive at this point is not relevant.  It is not an element of the 
crime.
</p><p>Sweet's testimony, stating that it was Jocelyn who brought her to
 Niu's house, should not be disregarded.  Section 20, Rule 134 of the 
Revised Rules of Court provides that, "All persons who can perceive, and
 perceiving, can make known their perception to others may be 
witnesses." A witness' young age will not deter him or her from being a 
competent and credible witness.  To be a competent child witness, the 
following criteria must be met:  (a) capacity of observation; (b) 
capacity of recollection and (c) capacity of communication.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>
 All these were met by Sweet.  Besides, the trial court's assessment of 
Sweet's credibility should be upheld and respected since its assessment 
was not tainted with arbitrariness or oversight of any material fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>
</p><p>Burdensome and harsh as it may be, the trial court correctly imposed the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.
  True, Sweet was not maltreated.  True also, that at the time of the 
crime, Jocelyn was only 21 years old.  However, the crime as defined by 
law was committed.  <em>Dura lex sed lex</em>.  The law may be harsh, but it is the law.
</p><p>We agree with the trial court that a strict application of Art. 
267 of the Revised Penal Code would be too harsh, taking into 
consideration the minimal injury caused by the offense.  We agree that 
the accused be recommended to the Chief Executive for the possible 
exercise of his pardoning power.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, we AFFIRM <em>in toto</em> the 
decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, Bacoor, Cavite, dated 
June 22, 1994, finding accused appellant JOCELYN RADAM ACBANGIN guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt of kidnapping and serious illegal detention 
defined and penalized under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, and 
sentencing her to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, with all the accessory penalties of the law and to pay the costs.
</p><p>Pursuant to Article 5 of the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
 we recommend to His Excellency, the President of the Philippines, 
through the Secretary of Justice, the grant to accused-appellant JOCELYN
 RADAM ACBANGIN of either a commutation of sentence to an indeterminate 
penalty of <em>prision correccional</em> to <em>prision mayor</em> or executive clemency, considering that she has been in preventive detention since April 29, 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Let a copy of this decision be forwarded to His Excellency, the President of the Philippines, through the Secretary of Justice.
</p><p>No costs.
