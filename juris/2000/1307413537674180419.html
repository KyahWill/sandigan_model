				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 10, Dipolog City, convicting accused-appellants of estafa under Article 315(2)(d) of the Revised Penal Code and sentencing them to suffer 24 years of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay P100,000.00 as actual damages.<br><br>The information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> against accused-appellants reads:<br><blockquote>That on June 1, 1995 in the City of Dipolog, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the above-named accused conspiring, confederating with and mutually helping one another, defraud one BERNHARD FORSTER by means of deceit, false pretenses and fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud, in the following manner: that accused made the private-complainant Ramos [should be Forster] to believe that their FEB&amp;T check No. C054220 dated August 1, 1995 in the amount of P100,000.00 was duly covered by corresponding funds in the drawee bank, Far East Bank &amp; Trust Company, Dipolog Branch; that they assured the private-complainant that the said check would not bounce; that the latter should accept it as payment of their obligation because the check has corresponding deposits; which deceit and pretenses, the accused did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously able to obtain and receive from him the sum of P100,000.00; however, when the said check was presented for payment with the said drawee bank, the same was dishonored and refused payment by the said bank for the reason that it was drawn against accuseds' insufficient funds thereat, and despite repeated demands made upon them to make good or pay their obligation, the accused failed and/or refused to do so, to the damage and prejudice of herein private-complainant in the aforestated amount.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.</blockquote>The prosecution presented two witnesses, Bernhard Forster, the complainant, and Jay Adraincem, general bookkeeper of the Far East Bank and Trust Company Branch in Dipolog City.&nbsp; The facts, as established by their testimonies, are as follows: <br><br>Accused-appellants are the owners of MGF ELECTRONICS SATELLITE SUPPLY, a business engaged in selling and installing satellite antenna system, with principal office at General Luna Street, Dipolog City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> In May 1995, accused-appellants installed in the house of complainant Bernhard Forster, in Maria Uray, Dapitan City, a single satellite antenna, for which complainant paid the total amount of P82,200.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Complainant was not, however, satisfied with the satellite antenna installed and the equipment which came with it, <i>i.e.</i>, television, remote control receiver, and manual receiver, which he thought were second-hand. Moreover, he wanted a bigger antenna. He was assured by accused-appellant Holzer that should new equipment arrive from abroad, the used equipment would be replaced&nbsp; and another antenna would be given.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On June 1, 1995, accused-appellant Holzer informed complainant that new equipment had arrived in Manila. His money, however, was not enough to secure the release of the equipment from the Bureau of Customs. For this reason, he asked complainant to lend him P100,000.00.<br><br>Complainant agreed and issued a check for P100,000.00 to accused-appellant Holzer.&nbsp; In exchange, the latter issued Check No. C054220 worth P100,000.00 and postdated August 1, 1995, which he and the accused-appellant Mercidita D. Albiso signed.<br><br>Before the due date, accused-appellant Holzer asked the complainant not to deposit the check on August 1, 1995. Four days later, accused-appellant again asked the latter not to deposit the check because the money from Switzerland to cover the check had not yet arrived. &nbsp;<br><br>Despite the request, however, complainant deposited the check on August 9, 1995.&nbsp; As to be expected, the check was dishonored for having been drawn against insufficient funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On the same day, complainant filed a complaint for estafa against accused-appellants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> On September 20, 1995, accused-appellants were ordered arrested by Judge Wilfredo C. Martinez. Bail was fixed at P30,000.00 for each of the accused-appellants.&nbsp; Accused-appellant Holzer was committed to the City Jail of Dicayas, Dipolog City; accused-appellant Albiso, who had gone to Manila, was arrested subsequently.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>During the trial, bank records were presented showing that accused-appellants opened their Savings Account with Far East Bank and Trust Company in Dipolog City on March 10, 1995 (Account No. 0196-024-10-2) while their Current Account was opened on April 11, 1995 (Account No. 0096-00348-0). The current account of accused-appellants contained the words ATSA, for Automatic Transfer from Savings Account, which meant that should the current account be insufficient to cover a check issued by the drawers, and there are enough funds available in the savings account, there would be an automatic transfer from the savings account to the current account.<br><br>FEBT Co.'s Jay Adraincem testified that, as early as April 1995, some checks issued by accused-appellants were already covered by the money transferred from the savings account by virtue of ATSA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> He further testified that based on the records, four checks issued by accused-appellants were dishonored by the bank on August 1, 1995 due to insufficient funds.&nbsp; On August 9, 1995, two checks, one of which was Check No. C054220, were also dishonored due to insufficient funds.&nbsp; Per bank policy, the current and savings account of accused-appellants were closed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The defense presented as its lone witness accused-appellant Ernst Georg Holzer, a Swiss national.<br><br>Accused-appellant Holzer testified that in May 1995, he installed a single satellite antenna in the house of complainant.&nbsp; After this transaction was completed, complainant came to him and asked if it was possible to watch German stations on his TV set. Accused-appellant, after consulting his foreign suppliers, answered in the affirmative and promised another antenna for the complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On June 1, 1995, he told complainant that the new equipment had arrived.&nbsp; However, he told complainant that he did not have enough money to secure the release of the equipment from the Bureau of Customs. He, therefore, asked for an advance payment of P100,000.00 for the antenna.&nbsp; According to accused-appellant, he issued Check No. C054220, postdated August 1, 1995, in the amount of P100,000.00 as security for his obligation of installing the second antenna in complainant's house. If he failed to install the antenna, he bound himself to return the amount advanced to him by means of the check in question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant Holzer claimed that he was able to install the antenna in complainant's house.&nbsp; However, since he did not know yet how much the antenna cost, he did not demand immediate payment from complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In November 1995,&nbsp; accused-appellant Holzer sent a letter&nbsp; from jail demanding from complainant payment of P102,345.75 for the antenna.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Complainant answered the letter stating that the prices quoted by accused-appellant were excessive and that he was willing to pay only P20,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>After trial, the lower court rendered judgment as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing and finding the accused guilty of estafa as defined and penalized under Par. 2(d) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, and considering the amount of the fraud, accused are hereby sentenced to suffer 24 years of reclusion perpetua together with the accessory penalties and to indemnify the complaining witness by way of actual damages in the sum of P100,000.00 and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote>Hence this appeal.&nbsp; Accused-appellants contend that their liability is only civil, not criminal. They argue (1) that Check No. C054220 was issued to secure the loan they obtained from complainant; (2) that there was no deceit on their part because they duly informed the complainant that the check was not yet funded; and (3) that complainant parted with his P100,000.00 not because of the check issued by them but because of the interest they agreed upon.<br><br>Art. 315(2)(d), as amended by R.A. No. 4885, states:<br><blockquote>Art. 315. <i>Swindling (estafa).</i>- Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned hereinbelow... :<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br></div><br>2. By means of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx<br></div><blockquote>d. By postdating a check, or issuing a check in payment of an obligation when the offender had no funds in the bank, or his funds deposited therein were not sufficient to cover the amount of the check.&nbsp; The failure of the drawer of the check to deposit the amount necessary to cover his check within three (3) days from receipt of notice from the bank and/or the payee or holder that said check has been dishonored for lack or insufficiency of funds shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of deceit constituting false pretense or fraudulent act. </blockquote></blockquote>The elements of estafa, as defined, are as follows:<br><blockquote>(1) The offender has postdated or issued a check in payment of an obligation contracted at the time of the postdating or issuance. <br><br>(2) At the time of postdating or issuance of said check, the offender has no funds in the bank or the funds deposited were not sufficient to cover the amount of the check.<br><br>(3) The payee has been defrauded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>In view of the amendment of Art. 315(2)(d) by R.A. No. 4885, the following are no longer elements of estafa:<br><blockquote>1. knowledge of the drawer that he has no funds in the bank or that the funds deposited by him are not sufficient<br><br>2. failure to inform the payee of such circumstance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>The drawer of the dishonored check is given three days from receipt of the notice of dishonor to deposit the amount necessary to cover the check. Otherwise, a prima facie presumption of deceit will arise which must then be overcome by the accused.<br><br><b>First. </b>Accused-appellant issued a postdated check in payment of an obligation.&nbsp; The first element was thus duly proven.&nbsp; It is admitted that accused-appellants issued Check No. C054220 on June 1, 1995, postdated August 1, 1995, to complainant Forster.&nbsp; The check was issued in exchange for the P100,000.00 loan received by accused-appellant Holzer on that day. <br><br>There is no merit in accused-appellants' contention that the check was given by them merely as a security for the faithful performance of their obligation to install a satellite antenna in complainant's house or even, as contended by them in their brief, as security for the payment of the loan of P100,000.00 contracted by them.<br><br>The check could not have been issued to secure the faithful performance by accused-appellants of their obligation to install an antenna in complainant's house for if it was, the delivery of the antenna would have rendered the check without effect.&nbsp; The fact is that even after they had delivered the antenna to complainant, accused-appellant Holzer still had to pay the P100,000.00.<br><br>Nor could the check have been intended as security for the loan of P100,000.00 from the complainant. Accused-appellant contracted the loan and, therefore, his obligation was to pay it.&nbsp; In this case, Holzer promised to pay on August 1, 1995 when the subject check matured.&nbsp; There was no other means agreed upon to pay the debt.&nbsp; If the check was issued to secure the loan, then complainant and accused-appellant could have agreed on a method of payment, upon the failure of accused-appellants to comply with which, complainant would have recourse to Check No. C054220. &nbsp;<br><br>The check was thus not issued as an evidence of the accused-appellant's debt to the complainant but rather, as payment of the former to the latter.<br><br><b>Second.&nbsp; </b>Accused-appellants had no sufficient funds in the bank to cover the check at the time of its issuance. This is the second element of the crime, which we also find to have been duly proven.&nbsp; On June 1, 1995, when they issued the checks, accused-appellants had insufficient funds in the bank.&nbsp; This fact was admitted by accused-appellant Holzer himself:<br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">When did you issue this check to Mr. Forster?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">1st week of June as I have testified here.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">So 1st day of June, 1995, you have money in the bank?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">May I see the record?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">(The Prosecution examining the record.)</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">First week of June the record says between May 31 and June 5 only P30,000.00?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">It is P60,000.00.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">The post dated check August 1, 1995, at that time, you have no sufficient funds in your drawee Bank?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">No.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>On the other hand, as early as April 1995,&nbsp; the current account of accused-appellants no longer had sufficient funds.&nbsp; When asked about a particular check issued to one Anabelle Ramos which was honored in April 1995, Jay Adraincem, of the Far East Bank and Trust Company Branch in Dipolog City, answered:<br><ol type="A"><li>Actually, these checks were issued by them [accused-appellants].&nbsp; We can see the validation of the bank.&nbsp; Check No. 054207 was encashed to us on April 17, 1995.&nbsp; We can also see this transaction in their statement.&nbsp; This P4,800.00 was encashed April 17, when this check No. 054207 was honored.&nbsp; <u>We can see the ATSA.&nbsp; Meaning, this P4,800.00 comes from the Savings Account.&nbsp; This P9,000.00 and P15,000.00 can also be seen in this statement, meaning for encashment.</u><sup> </sup><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></li></ol>Thus, it appears that accused-appellants were running out of funds as early as April 1995, shortly after they opened their savings and current account with Far East Bank and Trust Company in Dipolog City.<br><br><b>Third.&nbsp; </b>There is, however, no evidence that deceit accompanied the issuance of the check.&nbsp; This is the third element, which we find was not proven. The prosecution presented no evidence to show that a notice of dishonor had been to sent accused-appellants. Though complainant testified that he demanded payment from accused-appellant Holzer and waited for several days after the check had been dishonored, his affidavit, dated August 9, 1995, showed that he filed his complaint on the same day the check was dishonored.&nbsp; Complainant failed to explain the discrepancy when confronted about this:<br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">PROS.

It appears that after delivering the antenna, accused-appellant Holzer looked to complainant for payment, something he would not do had the amount of P100,000.00 he had received been given to him as payment for the antenna.<br><br>On the other hand, the check which he issued was intended as payment for the loan of P100,000.00.&nbsp; It could not have been given as a security or as a mere evidence of the debt because accused-appellant himself intended to encash it on its due date. That is why accused-appellant asked complainant not to deposit the check until his money from Switzerland arrived.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Had the check been given as security for the faithful performance of accused-appellant's obligation to install the antenna, there would have been no need for complainant to encash the check.<br><br>It appears that complainant instituted this case through the prodding of one Anabelle Ramos, a complainant in five other estafa cases against accused-appellants. The trial of the six cases against accused-appellants ¾ one of which is this criminal case ¾ was conducted jointly.&nbsp; We cannot, however, base accused-appellants' conviction on the number of estafa cases filed against them and the evidence presented in the other cases.&nbsp; Each case must be proven independently of each other.&nbsp; In this case, we find the evidence to be wanting.<br><br>There is no doubt that complainant suffered damage as a result of the dishonored check.&nbsp; However, where deceit is not proven, the accused cannot be convicted of estafa under Art. 315 (2)(d) of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; At most, he can only be held civilly liable.<br><br>This is such a case.
