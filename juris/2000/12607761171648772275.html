Lot No. 755 has an area of 3.691 hectares, Lot No. 777 has 25.0155 hectares, Lot No. 778 has 24.5091 hectares, and Lot No. 783 has 25.0363 hectares.

Riosa, Ernie M. Palmos, Palmera Agricultural Realty Corporation and Maristel Y. Angeles, involving lots titled in the names of the complainants but also covered by TCT No. 348292 (Lot No. 777).<br><br>Respondents alleged that Lot 777 ceased to be part of Friar Land as early as May 1922 when the Director of Lands executed Deed of Sale No. 10570 conveying ownership of Lot 777 to one Carlos Sarmiento, not to Vicente Salgado. The lot could not have been validly assigned to defendant Estrella Mapa on April 12, 1930 by Vicente Salgado, who was not the rightful owner of the property. TCT 348292 was procured only in 1986 while the titles of plaintiffs were issued in 1967 and one was issued in 1958.<br><br>Sometime in October 1986, respondents went to the Office of the City Assessor of Quezon City in response to a letter of the City Assessor informing them that Estrella Mapa was applying for the issuance of tax clearance for Lot 777 covering respondents’ property. The basis of the application was TCT No. 348292 of the Registry of Deeds for Quezon City dated August 12, 1986. The title contained an encumbrance, which stated that the title was under investigation by the Verification Committee of the Land Registration Commission (LRC), later known as National Land Titles and Deeds Registration Administration (NALTDRA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On November 4, 1987, the Verification Committee submitted a report stating that TCT No. 348292 was fraudulently and irregularly issued, being a duplication of previously issued titles and recommending the filing of an action for the annulment of TCT Nos. 348156, 348291 and 348292 all in the name of Estrella Mapa.<br><br>The committee recommended that:<br><blockquote>"1.

Likewise, it is within the judicial discretion of respondent court to base its decision on the report and recommendation of the Verification Committee. The fact that defendants were not able to cross-examine the members of the committee is a natural and legal consequence of defendants having been declared as in default.<br><br>"WHEREFORE, finding herein petition for annulment of judgment not to be sufficient in substance, We hereby DENY DUE COURSE to said petition which is accordingly dismissed pursuant to section 1(c), Rule 6 of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue</b><br></center><br>The basic issue in these consolidated cases is whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the annulment of the order of the trial court in LRC Case No. 3369 (86) authorizing issuance of titles on the basis of sales certificates and technical descriptions as reconstituted by the Land Registration Commission.<br><br>We deny the petitions.<br><br>The subject lots are part of the Piedad Estate, Quezon City, a Friar Land acquired by the Philippine Government from the Philippine Sugar Estates Development Company, Ltd., La Sociedad Agricola de Ultramar, the British-Manila Estate Company, Ltd., and the Recoleto Order of the Philippine Islands on December 23, 1903, as indicated in Public Act No. 1120 (Friar Lands Act) enacted on April 26, 1904.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The Piedad Estate has been titled in the name of the Government under Original Certificate of Title No. 614.<br><br>By virtue of Act No. 1120, the Piedad Estate was placed under the administration of the Director of Lands.<br><br><center><b>a. Petitioner not owner of land</b><br></center><br>Petitioner Liao claims that his predecessor in interest acquired the property through sale certificates Nos. 780, 781, 783, issued by the Director of Lands in 1913. It is shown, however, that the sale certificates were signed by the Director of Lands and approved by the Secretary of the Interior. These sales were void. This is because the sales were not approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources. In Solid State Multi-Products Corp. vs. Court of Appeals,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> we said that approval by the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce is indispensable for the validity of the sale of friar lands. In the absence of such approval, the sales were void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> In view of the invalidity of the sales, there can be no valid titles issued on the basis of such sales.<br><br>In any event, the certificates of sale,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> assuming their validity, became stale after ten (10) years from its issuance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> They can not be the source documents for issuance of title more than seventy (70) years later.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The rule entrenched on public policy denies relief to a claimant whose right has become "stale" by reason of negligence or inattention for a long period of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In these cases, Estrella Mapa’s inaction for a period of about fifty-six (56) years, counted from the time of the sale to her in 1930 up to the filing of the petition for the issuance of title in 1986, bars petitioner from whatever rights he could have acquired thereunder. If petitioner’s predecessor was indeed the owner, she should have taken steps to have the land properly titled long ago.<br><br><center><b>b. Double Sale</b><br></center><br>These cases involve a classic issue of double sale.<br><br>Faced with a situation where both parties claim to have acquired the subject property, the law provides that as between two purchasers, the one who registered the sale in his favor has a preferred right over the other who has not registered his title, even if the latter is in actual possession of the immovable property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>We have consistently ruled that "when two certificates of title are issued to different persons covering the same land in whole or in part, the earlier in date must prevail, and, in case of successive registrations where more than one certificate is issued over the same land, the person holding a prior certificate is entitled to the land as against a person who relies on a subsequent certificate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> A certificate is not conclusive evidence of title if the same land had been registered and an earlier certificate for the same is in existence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><center><b>c.
