The parcels of land are indisputably owned by Isabel Candelaria.<br><br>On October 20, 1974, Candelaria entered into a three-year lease agreement over the land with Pio Malabanan (hereinafter referred to as "Malabanan"). In the contract, Malabanan agreed among other things: "to clear, clean and cultivate the land, to purchase or procure calamansi, citrus and rambutan seeds or seedlings, to attend and care for whatever plants are thereon existing, to make the necessary harvest of fruits, etc."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Sometime in 1973, Malabanan hired the Bejasas to plant on the land and to clear it. The Bejasas claim that they planted citrus, <i>calamansi</i>, <i>rambutan</i> and banana trees on the land and shouldered all expenses of production.<br><br>On May 3, 1977, Candelaria gave Malabanan a six-year usufruct over the land, modifying their first agreement. As per the agreement, Malabanan was under no obligation to share the harvests with Candelaria.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Sometime in 1983, Malabanan died.<br><br>On September 21, 1984, Candelaria constituted respondent Jaime Dinglasan (hereinafter referred to as "Jaime) as her attorney-in-fact, having powers of administration over the disputed land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On October 26, 1984, Candelaria entered into a new lease contract over the land with Victoria Dinglasan, Jaime's wife (hereinafter referred to as "Victoria"). The contract had a term of one year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On December 30, 1984, the Bejasas agreed to pay Victoria rent of P15,000.00 in consideration of an "<i>aryenduhan</i>" or "<i>pakyaw na bunga</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> agreement, with a term of one year. The agreement is below quoted:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><blockquote><i>"Ako si Victoria Dinglasan bilang tagapamahala ni Isabel Candelaria ay ipinaaryendo kay Reynaldo Bejasa ang lupang dating aryendo ni Pio Malabanan sa nasabing Ginang Buhat sa ika-30 ng Disyembre 1984 hanggang Ika-30 ng Disyembre 1985. Ako ay tumanggap sa kanya ng pitong libong piso at ito ay daragdagan pa niya ng walong libong piso (P8,000) dito sa katapusan ng buwan ng Disyembre 1984.</i><br><table style="text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><br><i>(signed)<br><br>Reynaldo Bejasa</i><br></td><td style="text-align: center;"><br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (signed)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Victoria Dinglasan</i><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><i>"Witness</i><br><i>"(unintelligible)</i><br><i>"(unintelligible)"</i><br></blockquote>&nbsp;During the first week of December 1984, the Bejasas paid Victoria P7,000.00 as agreed. The balance of P8,000.00 was not fully paid. Only the amount of P4,000.00 was paid on January 11, 1985.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>After the <i>aryenduhan</i> expired, despite Victoria's demand to vacate the land, the Bejasas continued to stay on the land and did not give any consideration for its use, be it in the form of rent or a shared harvest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On April 7, 1987, Candelaria and the Dinglasans again entered into a three-year lease agreement over the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The special power of attorney in favor of Jaime was also renewed by Candelaria on the same date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On April 30, 1987, Jaime filed a complaint before the Commission on the Settlement of Land Problems ("COSLAP"), Calapan, Oriental Mindoro seeking ejectment of the Bejasas.<br><br>On May 26, 1987, COSLAP dismissed the complaint.<br><br>Sometime in June 1987, Jaime filed a complaint with the Regional Trial Court, Calapan Oriental, Mindoro<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> against the Bejasas for "Recovery of possession with preliminary mandatory injunction and damages." The case was referred to the Department of Agrarian Reform ("DAR").<br><br>On December 28, 1987, the DAR certified that the case was not proper for trial before the civil courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The trial court dismissed Jaime's complaint, including the Bejasas' counterclaim for leasehold, home lot and damages.<br><br>On February 15, 1988, the Bejasas filed with the Regional Trial Court of Calapan, Oriental Mindoro a complaint for "confirmation of leasehold and home lot with recovery of damages."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> against Isabel Candelaria and Jaime Dinglasan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On February 20, 1991, after trial, the trial court ruled in favor of the Bejasas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> First, they reasoned that a tenancy relationship was established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> This relationship can be created by and between a "person who furnishes the landholding as owner, civil law lessee, usufructuary, or legal possessor and the person who personally cultivates the same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Second, as <i>bona-fide</i> tenant-tillers, the Bejasas have security of tenure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The lower court ruled:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants, as follows:<br><br>"(1) Ordering the defendants to maintain plaintiffs in the peaceful possession and cultivation of the lands in question and to respect plaintiff's security of tenure on the landholdings of Isabel Candelaria and the home lot presently occupied by them;<br><br>"(2) Confirming the leasehold tenancy system between the plaintiffs as the lawful tenant-tillers and the landholder, Isabel Candelaria, with the same lease rental of P20,000.00 per calendar year for the use of the lands in question and thereafter, same landholdings be placed under the operation land transfer pursuant to Republic Act No. 6657;<br><br>"(3) Ordering the defendants to pay jointly and severally the plaintiffs the amount of P115,500.00 representing the sale of calamansi which were unlawfully gathered by Jaime Dinglasan and his men for the period July to December, 1987 and which were supported by receipts and duly proven, with formal written accounting, plus the sum of P346,500.00 representing the would-be harvests on citrus, calamansi, rambutan and bananas for the years 1988, 1989 and 1990, with legal rate of interest thereon from the date of the filing of the instant complaint until fully paid;<br><br>"(4) Ordering the defendants to pay plaintiffs jointly and severally the amount of P30,000.00 as attorney's fee and expenses of litigation; and<br><br>"(5) Authorizing the plaintiffs as tenant-farmers to litigate as pauper not only in this Court but up to the appellate courts in accordance with Section 16 of P. D. No. 946.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>On February 20, 1991, respondents filed their notice of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On February 9, 1993, the Court of Appeals promulgated a decision reversing the trial court's ruling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Reasoning: First, not all requisites necessary for a leasehold tenancy relationship were met.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> There was no consent given by the landowner. The consent of former civil law lessee, Malabanan, was not enough to create a tenancy relationship.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Second, when Malabanan engaged the services of the Bejasas, he only constituted them as mere overseers and did not make them "permanent tenants". Verily, even Malabanan knew that his contract with Candelaria prohibited sublease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Third, the contract ("<i>aryenduhan</i>") between the Bejasas and Victoria, by its very terms, expired after one year. The contract did not provide for sharing of harvests, means of production, personal cultivation and the like.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Fourth, sharing of harvest was not proven. The testimony of Reynaldo Bejasa on this point is self-serving. Fifth, the element of personal cultivation was not proven. Reynaldo Bejasa himself admitted that he hired laborers to clear and cultivate the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The Court of Appeals disposed of the case, thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the judgment appealed from is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The interlocutory order issued on September 5, 1988 is DISSOLVED and the appellees are hereby ordered to surrender possession of the disputed landholdings to appellant Isabel Candelaria and pay her the amount of P15,000.00 in annual rents commencing from 1986 plus attorney's fees and litigation expenses of P35,000.00 and costs.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>Hence, this appeal filed on March 3, 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The issue raised is whether there is a tenancy relationship in favor of the Bejasas.<br><blockquote>The elements of a tenancy relationship are:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br>&nbsp;(1) the parties are the landowner and the tenant;<br><br>(2) the subject is agricultural land;<br><br>(3) there is consent;<br><br>(4) the purpose is agricultural production;<br><br>(5) there is personal cultivation; and<br><br>(6) there is sharing of harvests.<br></blockquote>After examining the three relevant relationships in this case, we find that there is no tenancy relationship between the parties.<br><br><u>Malabanan and the Bejasas.</u> True, Malabanan (as Candelaria's usufructuary) allowed the Bejasas to stay on and cultivate the land.<br><br>However, even if we assume that he had the authority to give consent to the creation of a tenancy relation, still, no such relation existed<i>.</i><br><br>There was no proof that they shared the harvests.<br><br><u>Reynaldo Bejasa</u> testified that as consideration for the possession of the land, he agreed to deliver the landowner's share (1/5 of the harvest) to Malabanan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Only Reynaldo Bejasa's word was presented to prove this. Even this is cast into suspicion. At one time Reynaldo categorically stated that 25% of the harvest went to him, that 25% was for Malabanan and 50% went to the landowner, Candelaria.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Later on he stated that the landowner's share was merely one fifth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In <i>Chico v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> we faulted private respondents for failing to prove sharing of harvests since "no receipt, or any other evidence was presented."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> We added that "Self serving statements ... are inadequate; proof must be adduced."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><u>Candelaria and the Bejasas.</u> Between them, there is no tenancy relationship. Candelaria as landowner never gave her consent.<br><br>The Bejasas admit that prior to 1984, they had no contact with Candelaria.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> They acknowledge that Candelaria could argue that she did not know of Malabanan's arrangement with them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> True enough Candelaria disavowed any knowledge that the Bejasas during Malabanan's lease possessed the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> However, the Bejasas claim that this defect was cured when Candelaria agreed to lease the land to the Bejasas for P20,000.00 per annum, when Malabanan died in 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> We do not agree. In a tenancy agreement, consideration should be in the form of harvest sharing. <i>Even assuming</i> that Candelaria agreed to lease it out to the Bejasas for P20,000 per year,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> such agreement did not create a tenancy relationship, but a mere civil law lease.<br><br>Dinglasan and the Bejasas. <i>Even assuming</i> that the Dinglasans had the authority as civil law lessees of the land to bind it in a tenancy agreement, there is no proof that they did.<br><br>Again, there was no agreement as to harvest sharing. The only agreement between them is the "<i>aryenduhan</i>",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> which states in no uncertain terms the monetary consideration to be paid, and the term of the contract.<br><br>Not all the elements of tenancy being met, we deny the petition.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we AFFIRM the decision of the Court of Appeals of February 9, 1993, <i>in toto</i>.<br><br>No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., (Chairman), Puno, Kapunan, </i>and <i>Ynares-Santiago, JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Under Rule 45 of the 1964 Re<i>v</i>ised Rules of Court.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In CA-G.
