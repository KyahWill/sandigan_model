Diokno ordered the consolidation of Criminal Cases Nos. 97-664, 97-665, 97-666, 97-667 with Criminal Case No. 97-233.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The trial court stated the facts of the case <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>"Accused JOSE is an ex-convict. He served a prison term for the crime of theft. Accused IMELDA is his live-in partner.<br><br>Complainants AAA and BBB are the minor children of JOSE with EEE. AAA is now 14 years old while BBB is 12. (Exhibits "I" and "J"). their natural mother left them when they were still very young.<br><br>Upon being released from prison, JOSE moved in with IMELDA at their present residence at xxx.<br><br>Subsequently, JOSE took back AAA and BBB from his brother who took care of them while he was in prison.<br><br>The family occupied the room at the 2nd floor of their house. The ground floor is rented out to some boarders. At night, JOSE and IMELDA, together with their two-year old baby would sleep together in bed while AAA and BBB would sleep on the floor. At times, only a curtain would separate the bed from the floor where the sisters would be sleeping.<br><br>JOSE drinks a lot and is frequently drunk. He would usually drink two bottles of beer before going to bed.<br><br>On February 18, 1997, CCC had a chance to talk to BBB, her niece. BBB then confided to CCC how their father had been molesting her and her sister (AAA).<br><br>The following day, CCC and FFF, their youngest brother brought BBB and AAA to the barangay center. There, they related the ordeal of the two sisters. The Complaint Center, in turn, notified the Office of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).<br><br>With DSWD Social Workers, the group of CCC proceeded to Police Precinct No.7 at xxx city and sought police assistance for the arrest of JOSE and IMELDA. The two suspects were arrested and their case referred to the Station Investigation Division of the xxx Police.<br><br>SPO1 Lilia Hogar and Police Inspector Angelita Alvarico of the Women's Desk Section, investigated the complaint. The written statements of AAA and BBB were taken (Exhibits "A" and "B"). thereafter, AAA was referred to the National Bureau of Investigation and PNP Crime Laboratory for examination (TSN, March 17, 1997).<br><br>On February 20, 1997, the Final Investigation Report was issued by SPOI Lilia Hogar with the recommendation that the complaint of AAA and BBB be referred to the City Prosecutor for proper disposition (Exhibit "C").<br><br>After inquest, the preliminary investigation, the xxx Prosecution Office filed with the Court three informations for Rape against JOSE (Criminal Case Nos. 97-233, 97-664 and 97-665) and 2 counts of Acts of Lasciviousness (Criminal Case Nos. 97-666 and 97-667). IMELDA was indicted as an accomplice in the charge for rape in Criminal Case No.97-664.<br><br>AAA narrated in court how she and her younger sister BBB have been molested by their father on different occasions between August 1996 to January 1997. She testified that the first incident occurred in the night of August 18, 1996. They were all inside their common sleeping area. She was already fearful as her father was them again drunk.<br><br>JOSE and IMELDA were already without clothes and in bed when her father called her. She was ordered to undress and to climb in bed.<br><br>BBB has been ordered by JOSE to stand guard at their door.<br><br>Once in bed, JOSE told IMELDA to spread open AAA's legs. JOSE then called BBB to come near and to suck his penis so he could have an erection.<br><br>BBB obeyed her father's command. Thereupon, JOSE laid on top of AAA while IMELDA was holding her legs apart. AAA felt her lower abdomen moving up and down. She told her father that she was hurting already. But still, he did not withdraw his penis.<br><br>After a while, JOSE told IMELDA to lie down. JOSE then withdrew from AAA and went on top of IMELDA.<br><br>While JOSE and IMELDA were copulating, JOSE told AAA to suck IMELDA's breast.<br><br>The abominable scene finally stopped when they heard some noises outside.<br><br>AAA further testified that this incident was repeated on September 18, 1996. She was then watching a VHS tape at their uncle's place when her father told her to go upstairs to their room.<br><br>Inside their room, JOSE and IMELDA started to take off their clothes. JOSE ordered AAA to take off hers too. Her father was again drunk. He laid on top of her while IMELDA held her legs apart.<br><br>JOSE would even slap IMELDA whenever she fails to hold AAA's legs apart.<br><br>Again, the detestable incident ended with JOSE and IMELDA having sexual intercourse.<br><br>The father again molested AAA in November 1996. AAA though could not remember the exact date.<br><br>She testified that she woke up one night when she felt someone touching her most private part. She discovered her father beside her on the floor . She became upset. Her father withdrew her hand. Fortunately for AAA, her father desisted from pursuing his woeful intentions. JOSE climbed back to his bed and slept beside IMELDA.<br><br>According to AAA, the last incident happened on January 31, 1997 at about 12:00 o'clock in the evening. She was awaken (sic) by someone tapping her feet.<br><br>It was her father again. She was told to go the bathroom downstairs. She thought she would just be asked to fetch water. When she entered the bathroom, her father was already there and naked. She was told to remove her shorts and underwear. Her father was drunk again.<br><br>AAA was told to lean back on the wall and open her legs. Thereupon, JOSE proceeded to penetrate AAA. Then she felt pain, and deep inside her she wished her father would die so that her ordeal would stop.<br><br>Her father stopped when he heard their dog barking. He then instructed her daughter to bring a pail of water upstairs.<br><br>JOSE then woke up IMELDA and told her to prepare coffee. Thereafter, IMELDA told AAA to go back to sleep. AAA went to sleep with IMELDA massaging JOSE. (TSN, April 28, 1997, pp. 18-39; April 30, 1997, pp. 2-22; August 11, 1997, pp. 11-34; August 15, 1997, pp. 3- 15).<br><br>BBB, the other victim, narrated too in Court how she and her sister were molested by her father and his live-in partner in August 1996. She was only 12 years old then.<br><br>They were all inside their one-room quarters. Her father was drunk. She was told to stand guard at their door by her father. later, she was called by her father to the bed and ordered to suck his penis so he could have an erection. AAA was already in bed and without clothes, and so was her father.<br><br>JOSE then laid on top of AAA while IMELDA was holding AAA's legs apart.<br><br>In the meantime, BBB was again told to stand guard at the door (TSN, August 18, 1997, pp. 2-33).<br><br>AAA and BBB are one in telling the Court that they are fearful of their father, especially when he is drunk. They were often beaten up by their father should they refuse or fail to obey his command or wishes. They strongly believe too that their father is on drugs.<br><br>Dr. Tomas Suguitan, the Medico-legal Officer from the PNP Crime laboratory, identified his report on the examination conducted on BBB (Exhibit "C"). He confirmed that the "subject is in non-virgin state physically" with "deep healed laceration at 6 o'clock and shallow healed lacerations at 3, 7 and 10 o'clock" in her fleshy-type hymen.<br><br>However, the prosecution failed to clarify what appears to be a contradictory report rendered by the NBI Medico-legal Division (Exh. "D") showing that subject's hymen is "intact and its orifice small (2.0 cm. in diameter) as to preclude complete penetration by an average sized adult male organ in full erection without producing genital injury". Further, in Exhibit "C", witness Suguitan found no external signs of application of any form of violence". While in Exhibit "D", "physical injuries were noted on the body of the subject at the time of examination", consisting of, - scar, brownish 0.8 x 0.3 cm., left temple area; scars brownish, two (2) in number, one is 1.0 x 0.3 cm., the other 1.0 x 0.4 cm. left leg, upper 3rd, anterior aspect, and scar, reddish, 4.0 x 6.0 cms. right gluteal area.<br><br>Prosecution witnesses CCC and SPO1 lilia Hogar testified too in court. CCC narrated how she discovered the sexual abuse committed by her brother JOSE and IMELDA on her nieces (TSN, March 17, 1997, pp. 2-17).<br><br>SPO1 Hogar testified on the investigation conducted by the Criminal Investigation Division of the XXX Police Station on the complaint lodged by the victims (TSN, April 23, 1997, pp. 2-19).<br><br>Accused JOSE AND IMELDA denied the imputations against them. They advanced the following reasons as possible motive for the false accusations, to wit -<br><blockquote>a) He (JOSE) chastised AAA and BBB for "stealing" P2,000.00 in school;<br><br>b) His brother and sister are interested in having possession of their house; and<br><br>c) His brother and sister are envious of his work entitled "Destiny Philippines 2000" which he allegedly tried to have then President Fidel Ramos and Vice President Joseph Estrada be interested in."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>On July 6, 1998 the RTC rendered a decision finding both accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes charged. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>"<b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court finds Jose Pajo y Bagtong and Imelda Liquigan y Kasibayan GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the offenses charged.<br><br>Accordingly, accused Jose Pajo y Bagtong is hereby sentenced to suffer the following penalties,<br><ol type="1"><li> DEATH for consummated rape as charged in Criminal Case No. 97-97-233;<br><br></li><li> DEATH for consummated rape as charged in Criminal Case No. 97-664;<br><br></li><li> DEATH for consummated rape as charged in Criminal Case No. 97-665;<br><br></li><li> TEN (10) YEARS &amp; ONE (1) DAY of prision mayor as minimum to SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS &amp; FOUR (4) MONTHS of reclusion temporal as maximum for acts of lasciviousness as charged in Criminal Case No. 97-666; and<br><br></li><li> TEN (10) YEARS &amp; ONE (1) DAY of prision mayor as minimum to SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS &amp; FOUR (4) MONTHS of reclusion temporal as maximum for acts lasciviousness as charged in Criminal Case No.97-667.</li></ol>Accused Imelda Liquigan y Kasibayan is hereby sentenced to a prison term of TWELVE (12) YEARS &amp; ONE (1) DAY to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS &amp; EIGHT (8) MONTHS of reclusion temporal as an accomplice in the crime of rape as charged in Criminal Case No. 97-664.<br><br>Jose Pajo y Bagtong is ORDERED to INDEMNIFY complainants AAA Joy Pajo and BBB Joy Pajo in the amount of P50,000.00 each for each count of rape and acts of lasciviousness committed, and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>At the outset, we resolve to dismiss the appeals in Criminal Cases Nos. 97-666 and 97-667, wherein the RTC convicted PAJO of two counts of acts of lasciviousness and sentenced him to ten (10) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i> as minimum to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of <i>reclusion</i> <i>temporal</i> as maximum for each count, considering that PAJO failed to file notices of appeal for said cases. Under Section 1 (b), Rule 122 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, the appeal of a judgment rendered by the regional trial court in its original jurisdiction sentencing the accused to other than life imprisonment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> or death must be taken to the Court of Appeals by the filing of a notice of appeal with the court which rendered the judgment or order appealed from, and by serving a copy thereof on the adverse party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>We likewise dismiss the appeal of PAJO's co-accused, LIQUIGAN, for the reason that she similarly failed to file a notice of appeal of the judgment convicting her as an accomplice to the crime of rape in Criminal case No. 97-664. The appeal to the Supreme Court in cases where the penalty imposed is life imprisonment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> or where a lesser penalty is imposed but involving offenses committed on the same occasion or arising out of the same occurrence that gave rise to the more serious offense for which the penalty of death or life imprisonment is imposed shall be by filing a notice of appeal with the court which rendered the judgment or order appealed from, and by serving a copy thereof upon the adverse party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Inasmuch as both PAJO and LIQUIGAN have taken no appeal with respect to these cases, they became final and executory after the lapse of fifteen (15) days, the period for perfecting an appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> On the other hand, Criminal Cases Nos. 97-233, 97-664 and 97-665 are now before this Court on automatic review in view of the imposition of the death penalty. It is only in cases where the accused is sentenced to death when the appeal of the decision to the Supreme Court is automatic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> We thus limit our discussion to Criminal Cases Nos. 97-233, 97-664 and 97- 665 where the death penalty was imposed on PAJO.<br><br>In his brief, PAJO assigns the following error allegedly committed by the RTC:<br><blockquote><b>"THE</b> <b>LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS GUILTY OF THE CRIMES CHARGED, WITHOUT THEIR GUILT</b> <b>HAVING BEEN PROVED BEYOND A</b> <b>SHADOW OF A</b> <b>DOUBT</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote>PAJO maintains that the prosecution failed to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In support of this claim, PAJO asserts that:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> In her testimony, AAA was uncertain as to whether or not her father penetrated her on August 18, 1996.<br><br></li><li> He merely used his two daughters to arouse him in order for him to "trigger" his libido and "to put in action and activate his admitted onset of impotency" caused by his state of alcoholism in order to satisfy the passion of his live-in partner.<br><br></li><li> It is unlikely that he committed the alleged rapes and acts of lasciviousness because they admittedly transpired inside their house and in the presence of all the other members of the family. There was no evidence on record to prove that PAJO was sick of some form of medical perversion or that showed him to be of such a detestable human nature.<br><br></li><li> It is unbelievable that it took AAA exactly six (6) months and one (1) day or after being assaulted three times and only after her younger sister, BBB revealed the commission of the crime against her that she revealed the assaults committed against her by her father.<br><br></li><li> AAA and BBB filed the cases against their own father due to the improper suggestions and desire for revenge of their aunt and uncle (the brother and sister of PAJO) who reared and took care of AAA and BBB.<br><br></li><li> Had the cases been filed with the noblest intention of seeking justice, then it would have been for the best interest of the two children to include LIQUIGAN as co-principal in the alleged crimes of rape and not merely as an accomplice to the rape allegedly committed on August 18, 1996.<br><br></li><li> There is an irreconcilable conflict between the findings of the physical examination conducted on AAA by the National Police Commission - Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory Group (PNP) and that conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) contained in the two medical reports<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> submitted to the RTC. The report of the PNP showed that there was no external signs of application of any form of violence while in the NBI report, physical injuries were noted on the body of AAA at the time of her examination. Further, the NBI report showed that the hymen of AAA was intact and its orifice small as to preclude complete penetration by an averaged sized adult male organ in full erection without producing genital injury.</li></ol></blockquote>Based on the foregoing arguments, PAJO prays for his acquittal for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>After a meticulous review of the case, we resolve to affirm the judgment of the RTC.<br><br>The prosecution convincingly established the commission of the three rapes by PAJO against AAA through her testimony wherein she identified the accused-appellant PAJO as her father and narrated the manner by which he thrice raped her sometime in August 1996, September 18, 1996 and January 31, 1997. AAA first testified in Criminal Case No. 97-233 to prove the rape committed on January 31, 1997 as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0"

There was no showing that they were motivated to falsely implicate him in the commission of such a heinous crime and the absence of convincing evidence showing any improper motive on the part of the principal witnesses for the prosecution strongly tends to sustain the conclusion that no such improper motive exists, and that their testimonies are worthy of full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Moreover, it is long settled by jurisprudence that the determination of the competence and credibility of a child to testify rests primarily with the trial judge who sees the witness, notices her manner, her apparent possession or lack of intelligence, as well as her understanding of the obligation of an oath.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are accorded great respect unless the court <i>a quo </i>overlooked substantial facts and circumstances, which if considered, would materially affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The evaluation or assessment made by the trial court acquires greater significance in rape cases because from the nature of the offense, the only evidence that can oftentimes be offered to establish the guilt of the accused is the complainant's testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In the present case, we find no cogent basis to disturb the trial court's finding disregarding the testimonies of the defense witnesses and upholding the credibility of the complainants AAA and BBB who stood firm on their assertions and remained unfaltering in their testimony on the unfortunate incidents.<br><br>PAJO's claim that there was no evidence to show that he was sick of some form of medical perversion or that showed him to be of such detestable human nature to enable him to rape AAA in the presence of other persons deserves no sympathy. It has been repeatedly held that lust is no respecter of time or place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Besides, the mere act of a father of raping his daughter is abhorrent and this Court strongly condemns the perverse acts committed by PAJO against his daughters and is appalled by his defense that he merely used them to arouse him in order for him to "trigger" his libido and "to put in action and activate his admitted onset of impotency" caused by his state of alcoholism to enable him to satisfy the passion of his live-in partner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The bestiality in man whose conscience has been seared by his insatiable greed for lust shows no respect for blood or close kinship with his victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>PAJO's claim that AAA and BBB filed the cases against their own father due to the improper suggestions and desire for revenge of their aunt and uncle is not believable. PAJO's and LIQUIGAN's bare assertion that the cases were filed against him to allegedly get back at him for scolding AAA and BBB for stealing two thousand (P2,000.00) from their teacher and that his brother and sister were allegedly envious of him because they wanted his house and because he was being commissioned by the then President Fidel V. Ramos to write a book entitled Destiny 2000 is uncorroborated and is highly unbelievable. It has been consistently held that no member of a rape victim's family would dare encourage the victim to publicly expose the dishonor to the family unless the crime was in fact committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Given the circumstances of the resent case, it is most unlikely that AAA nor her aunt, CCC who happens to be the sister of PAJO, would subject AAA to the embarrassment and stigma incident to a rape trial if the charges were not true.<br><br>Pajo's inistence that LIQUIGAN should have been charged as a co-principal in all three rapes and not merely an accomplice to one rape, does not affect the culpability of PAJO for the crimes charged and is not enough reason to acquit him. In criminal prosecutions, it is the prosecution that determines the charges to be filed and how the legal and factual elements in the case shall be utilized as components of the information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It is basically the fiscal's function to the fiscal to determine what degree of complicity to the commission of a crime a person should be charged with, whether as principal, accomplice or accessory.<br><br>PAJO makes much of the fact that it took AAA exactly six (6) months and one (1) day or after being assaulted three times and only after her younger sister, BBB revealed the commission of the crime against her that she revealed the assaults committed against her by her father. However, this Court has time and again ruled that the fact that the failure of the complainant to report the rape to the immediate members of her family or to the police does not detract from her credibility for her hesitation can be attributed to her age and the moral ascendancy of the accused and his threats against the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> We find this to be true in the present case.<br><br>Finally, the alleged inconsistency between the findings of the medical examinations conducted on AAA contained in the medical reports prepared by the PNP<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and the NBI<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> is not sufficient to warrant the reversal of the judgment of conviction. The overwhelming evidence consisting of the testimonies of both AAA and BBB, which were thoroughly consistent with each other, is sufficient to establish PAJO's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Moreover, the inconsistency between the two medical reports only gives rise to the question of whether AAA was subjected to force and violence as shown by the presence of external signs of physical injuries. Even assuming that no physical injuries were found on AAA's body, such does not negate that PAJO raped her nor does it render the evidence submitted by the prosecution insufficient to establish the element of force or violence. When a father commits rape against his own daughter, the former's moral ascendancy and influence over the latter substitutes for violence or intimidation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In sum, AAA's clear and straightforward testimony, as corroborated by that of BBB, leads to the inescapable conclusion that the crimes of rape have been committed and PAJO is guilty of these crimes.<br><br>Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No.7659, provides:<br><blockquote>"The death penalty shall be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><ol type="1"><li> when the victim is <b><i>under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent</i></b>, ascendant, stepparent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim."</li></ol></blockquote>The three informations charging, PAJO with three counts of rape clearly alleged that he had carnal knowledge with his daughter, AAA, who was 13 years old at the time of the rapes as shown by her certificate of live birth<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> having been born on April 13, 1983. Her birth certificate likewise shows that PAJO is her father. Moreover, the prosecution presented AAA's aunt, CCC, who testified that AAA was her niece and that she was the daughter of PAJO who is her brother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Moreover, PAJO in his testimony admitted that AAA was his daughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The concurrence of minority of the AAA and her relationship to PAJO, having been alleged in the information and duly proved with certainty and clearness as the crime itself during trial, constrains the Court to affirm the conviction of PAJO of three counts of qualified rape, justifying the imposition of the death penalty for each count on him. As to PAJO's civil liability, we award AAA the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages for each count of rape considering that the crime was committed under circumstances which justify the imposition of the death penalty in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Four justices of the Court maintain that R.A. 7659 is unconstitutional insofar as it prescribes the death penalty; nevertheless they submit to the ruling of the majority to the effect that the law is constitutional and that the death penalty can be lawfully imposed in the case at bar.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the appealed decision of the Regional Trial Court finding the accused JOSE PAJO y BAGTONG guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three counts of qualified rape in Criminal Cases Nos. 97-233, 97-664 and 97-665 is <b>AFFIRMED.</b> The accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to <b>DEATH</b> and he is further ordered to pay the victim, AAA, the amounts of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages for each count of rape.<br><br>The appeals of JOSE PAJO y BAGTONG in Criminal Cases Nos. 97-666 and 97-667 and the appeal of IMELDA LIQUIGAN y KASIBAYAN in Criminal Case No. 97-664 are hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> and the decisions therein are final and executory.<br><br>Upon finality of this decision, let certified true copies thereof as well as the records of this case be forthwith forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise of his pardoning power.<br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, Ynares-Santiago,</i> and <i>De Leon, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Judge Dennis M.
