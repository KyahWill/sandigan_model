				<H3>ROSA YAP PARAS, COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. JUSTO DE JESUS PARAS, RESPONDENT<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This has reference to a case for disbarment initiated by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; complainant Rosa Yap Paras against her husband, Atty. Justo de Jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paras. The parties exchanged tirades&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and barbs in their copious pleadings, hurling invectives, cutting remarks and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; insults at each other. Reduced to its&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; essentials, Rosa Paras charged her husband with dishonesty and falsification of public documents, harassment and intimidation, and immorality for siring a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; child with another woman. Respondent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; denied the allegations, contending that his wife, in cahoots with her family,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is out to destroy and strip him of his share in their multi-million conjugal assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <p>The parties come from wealthy families in Negros Oriental. They were married on May 21, 1964 and have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two grown-up children. They have vast&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sugarlands and other businesses.&nbsp; Respondent was a Municipal Judge for 14 years and served as Mayor in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their town for 2 terms during the administration of President Aquino. Complainant is a businesswoman. Sometime in 1988, their marriage fell apart&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when due to "marital strain that has developed through the years," respondent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left his wife and children to live with his mother and sister in Dumaguete City&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and thence started his law practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complainant, in the meantime, filed a case for the dissolution of their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; marriage, which case is still pending in court.</p><p>The complaint charged:</p><blockquote><p align="center">DISHONESTY, FALSIFICATION and FRAUD</p><p> ... respondent obtained loans from certain banks in the name of complainant by counterfeiting complainant's signature, falsely making it appear that complainant was the applicant for said loans. Thereafter,&nbsp; he carted away and misappropriated the proceeds of the loans.&nbsp; . . . to guarantee the above loans, respondent mortgaged some personal properties belonging to the&nbsp; conjugal partnership without the consent of complainant.</p><blockquote></blockquote><p align="center">GROSSLY IMMORAL CONDUCT AND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;CONCUBINAGE</p>Respondent is . . . engaged in the immoral and criminal act of concubinage as he maintained an illicit relationship with one Ms. Jocelyn A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ching, siring an illegitimate child with her while married to complainant.<p align="center">UNETHICAL AND UNPROFESSIONAL<br>CONDUCT</p><p> Respondent abused courts of justice and misused his legal skills to frighten, harass and intimidate all those who take a position diametrically adverse to his sinister plans by unethically filing complaints and other&nbsp; pleadings against them. He utilized strategies to obstruct justice.</p><p align="center">OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE</p><blockquote><p> (Respondent) utilized strategies to obstruct justice. In the criminal actions initiated against him, respondent used his legal skills not to prove his innocence but to derail all&nbsp; the proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></blockquote></blockquote><table  ="" width="60%" align="center" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%">&nbsp;</td><td width="50%">(Complaint, Rollo, p. 2)<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table>In his Answer, respondent interposed the following defenses<p> (1) On the Charge of Falsification of Public Documents:</p>&nbsp;That during the sugarboom in the 1970's, his wife executed in his favor a Special Power of Attorney to negotiate for an agricultural or crop loan authorizing him "to borrow money and apply for and secure any agricultural or crop loan for sugar cane from the Bais Rural Bank, Bais City . . ." (Rollo,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annex "3", p. 262)&nbsp; <p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;&nbsp; the Charge of Forgery:</p><p>That the Report of the National Bureau of Investigation which&nbsp; found that "the questioned signatures (referring to the alleged forged&nbsp; signatures of complainant) and the standard sample signatures JUSTO J. PARAS&nbsp; were written <b>by one and the same person</b>..."(Annex"B" of the Complaint, Rollo, p. 26) was&nbsp; doctored, and that his wife filed against him a string of cases for&nbsp; falsification of public documents because he intends to disinherit his children&nbsp; and bequeath his inchoate share in the conjugal properties to his own mother.</p><p>(3) On the Charge of Grossly Immoral Conduct and Concubinage:</p><p>That this is a malicious accusation fabricated by his brother-in-law, Atty. Francisco D. Yap to disqualify him from getting any share in the conjugal assets. He cites the dismissal of the complaint for concubinage filed against him by his wife before the City Prosecutor of Negros Oriental as proof of his innocence.</p><p>Respondent, however, admits that he, his mother and sister, are solicitous and hospitable to his alleged concubine, Ms. Jocelyn Ching and her daughter, Cyndee Rose (named after his own deceased daughter), by allowing them to stay in their house and giving them some financial assistance, because they pity Ms. Ching, a secretary in his law office, who was deserted by her&nbsp; boyfriend after getting her pregnant.</p><p> (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Charge of Obstruction of Justice:</p><p>That "the legal remedies pursued by (him) in defense and offense&nbsp; are legitimate courses of action done by an embattled lawyer." </p><p>The Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD) of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines investigated the complaint against respondent summarizing the causes of action as follows:</p><blockquote><p>(1)Falsification of complainant's signature and misuse of conjugal assets; and</p> </blockquote><p> (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immorality and criminal acts of concubinage with one Ms. Ma. Jocelyn A. Ching (for) siring an&nbsp; illegitimate child with her while married to complainant, and, abandonment of&nbsp; his own family.</p><table  ="" width="60%" align="center" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%">&nbsp;</td><td width="50%">(Rollo, Report of the IBP, p. 34)</td></tr></tbody></table>No actual hearing was conducted as the parties agreed to merely submit their respective memoranda, depositions, and other pieces of evidence attached to their pleadings.&nbsp; <p>Thereafter, the CBD found respondent guilty as charged and recommended:</p><blockquote><p>(1) Respondent's suspension from the practice of law for three (3) months on the first charge; and</p><p>(2) Respondent's&nbsp; indefinite suspension from the practice of law on the second charge.</p><table  ="" width="60%" align="center" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%">&nbsp;</td><td width="50%">(<i>ibid.</i>, p. 57)<br></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The CBD held that the dismissal of the criminal cases against respondent for falsification and use of falsified documents (Criminal Case No. 11768) and for concubinage (I.S. No. 93-578) will not bar the filing of an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; administrative case for disbarment against him. In a criminal case, proof beyond reasonable doubt is required for conviction, while in an administrative complaint, only a preponderance of&nbsp; evidence is necessary.<br><p>The CBD gave credence to the NBI Report that "the questioned signatures (referring to the signatures appearing in the loan agreements,&nbsp; contracts of mortgage, etc.) and the standard sample signatures of respondent were <b>written by one and the same person</b>." This affirms the allegation of complainant&nbsp; Rosa Yap Paras that her husband forged her signatures in those instruments. Respondent denies this but&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his denial was unsubstantiated and is, therefore, self-serving.</p><p>In finding respondent liable for Immorality, the CBD relied heavily on the uncontroverted sworn affidavit-statements of respondent's children and three other eyewitnesses to respondent's illicit affair with Ms. Jocelyn Ching. For a better appreciation of their statements, their affidavits are hereby reproduced in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; full. Thusly,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p><table  ="" width="60%" align="center" border="0"><tbody><tr><td><div align="justify">"I, DAHLIA Y.

Vailoces was also asked by respondent to procure Cyndee Rose Paras' baptismal certificate after the latter was baptized in the house of respondent; she further testified that in said baptismal certificate, respondent appears as the father of Cyndee Rose which explains why the latter is using the surname "Paras." (p. 87, Annex "I", Rollo)</p><p align="justify">The findings and the recommendations of the CBD are substantiated&nbsp; by the evidentiary record. </p>ON THE CHARGE OF FALSIFICATION <br>OF COMPLAINANT'S&nbsp; SIGNATURE &nbsp; <p align="justify">The handwriting examination conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation on the signatures of complainant Rosa Yap Paras and respondent Justo de Jesus Paras vis-à-vis the questioned signature "Rosa Y. Paras" appearing in the questioned bank loan documents, contracts of mortgage and other related instrument, yielded the following results:</p><blockquote><p align="justify">CONCLUSION</p></blockquote><ol><li> The questioned and the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; standard sample signatures JUSTO J. PARAS <b><i>were written by one and the same person</i>.<br></b></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <li> The questioned and the standard sample signatures ROSA YAP PARAS <strong><i>were not written by one and the same person.</i></strong></li></ol><table  ="" width="60%" align="center" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%">&nbsp;</td><td width="50%">(Annex "B", Rollo, p. 26, emphasis ours;)<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table>The NBI did not make a categorical statement that respondent forged the signatures of complainant. However, an analysis of the above findings lead to no other conclusion than that the questioned or falsified signatures of complainant Rosa Y. Paraswere authored by respondent as said falsified signatures were the same as the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sample signatures of respondent.&nbsp; <p align="justify">To explain this anomaly, respondent presented a Special Power of Attorney (SPA) executed in his favor by complainant to negotiate for an agricultural or crop loan from the Bais Rural Bank of Bais City. Instead of exculpating respondent, the&nbsp; presence of the SPA places him in hot water.For if he was so authorized to obtain loans from the banks, then why did he have to falsify his wife's signatures in the bank loan documents? The purpose of an SPA is to especially authorize the attorney-in-fact to sign for and on behalf of the principal <strong>using&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his own name</strong>. </p><p align="justify">ON THE CHARGE OF IMMORALITY <br>AND CONCUBINAGE </p><p align="justify">The evidence against respondent is overwhelming. The affidavit-statements of his children and three other persons who used to work with him and have witnessed the acts indicative of his infidelity more than satisfy this Court that respondent has strayed from the marital path. The baptismal certificate of Cyndee Rose Paras where respondent was named as the&nbsp; father of the child (Annex "J", Rollo, p. 108); his naming the child after his deceased first-born daughter Cyndee Rose; and his allowing Jocelyn Ching and the child to live in their house in Dumaguete City bolster the allegation that respondent is carrying on an illicit affair with Ms. Ching, the mother of his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; illegitimate child.</p><p align="justify"> It is a time-honored rule that good moral character is not only a&nbsp; condition precedent to admission to the practice of law. Its continued possession is also essential for remaining in the practice of law (<i>People vs. Tunda</i>, 181 SCRA 692 [1990]; <i>Leda vs. Tabang</i>, 206 SCRA 395 [1992]).&nbsp; In the case at hand, respondent has fallen below the moral bar when he&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forged his wife's signature in the bank loan documents, and, sired a daughter with a woman other than his wife. However, the power to disbar must be exercised with great caution, and only in a clear case of misconduct that seriously affects the standing and&nbsp; character of the lawyer as an officer of the Court and as a member of the bar&nbsp; (Tapucar vs. Tapucar, Adm. Case No. 4148, July 30, 1998). Disbarment should never be decreed where any lesser penalty, such as temporary suspension, could accomplish the end desired (Resurrecion vs. Sayson, 300 SCRA 129 [1998]). In the light of the foregoing, respondent is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for SIX (6) MONTHS on the charge of falsifying his wife's signature in bank documents and other related loan instruments; and for ONE (1) YEAR from the practice of law on the charges of immorality and abandonment of his own family, the penalties to be served simultaneously. Let notice of this decision be spread in respondent's record as an attorney, and notice of the same served on the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and on the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all the courts concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p><p align="justify">SO ORDERED.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p><p align="justify"> <span style="font-style: italic;">Vitug, Panganiban, Purisima,</span> and<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; Gonzaga-Reyes, JJ.,</span> concur.</p></div>
