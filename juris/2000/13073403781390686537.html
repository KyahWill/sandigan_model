				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On appeal is the decision dated November 8, 1993 of
 the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City, Branch 117, in Criminal Case 
No. 92-1382 finding appellant guilty of the crime of illegal possession 
of firearm and sentencing him to ten (10) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i> as minimum to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>
 as maximum, and in Criminal Case No. 92-1384, finding appellant and 
accused guilty of the crime of homicide with the use of an unlicensed 
firearm, sentencing them to the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, and ordering them to indemnify the heirs of the victim the amount of P50,000.00, and to pay the costs.<br><br>Appellant
 Taguba is a 30 year-old security guard, residing in Dagat-Dagatan, 
Caloocan City, while accused Tolibas is a 33 year-old basin vendor 
residing in the same place. The victim, Amador Guina, was a 24 year-old 
marble mason.<br><br>For the State, the Office of the Solicitor General presented the following summary of the facts:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><blockquote>"On September 1, 1992, at around 11:30 in the evening Amado Guina,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 Joe Mari Tamargo and Peter Castro were on board a public utility 
jeepney along Taft Avenue (pp. 19-20, TSN, January 12, 1993) coming from
 Buendia bound for Manila. They had just come from their work in a 
marble works company at Megamall in EDSA (pp. 3-5, TSN, January 12, 
1993). The jeepney was fully loaded with passengers (p. 8, ibid). Amado 
was seated on one side at the rear portion of the jeepney directly 
facing Joe Mari and Peter who were seated at the other side of the 
jeepney (p. 8, ibid). When the jeep was cruising near the San Isidro 
Church in Pasay City (p. 6, TSN, January 12, 1993), appellant, who was 
seated immediately next to the right of Amado, suddenly, announced a 
hold-up (p. 8, TSN, January 12, 1993) whispering `do not move, this is a
 hold up' (p. 15, ibid). Appellant was holding a gun (p. 15, ibid) a 
caliber .38 revolver p. 13, ibid). Amado moved both of his hands as he 
wanted to resist (p. 15, ibid) and appellant, upon seeing this, 
immediately fired the gun at Amado (p. 10, ibid). A commotion ensued 
inside the jeepney during which time appellant and his companion, Jaime 
Tolibas, fled from the scene (p. 10, ibid).<br><br>Joe Mari and Peter 
brought the wounded Amado to the Philippine General Hospital using the 
same public utility jeepney they were riding on (p. 11, ibid). Amado, 
however, died along the way (p. 11, ibid); and was declared dead on 
arrival (DOA) at the said hospital (p. 10, TSN, February 17, 1993).<br><br>Meanwhile,
 Police Officer 1 Fernando Dominguez, a member of the Philippine 
National Police Special Action Force assigned at Fort Bonifacio, was on 
his way to his house on Villaroel St. in Pasay City after coming from 
the said camp (pp. 5-6, TSN, February 10, 1993). When he reached 
Sandejas St. corner Taft Avenue, he heard three consecutive gun shots 
(p. 6, ibid). Shortly thereafter he saw two men running towards him (pp.
 6-7, ibid). He stopped the two, introduced himself as a police officer,
 ordered them to lie down and frisked both of them while in that prone 
position (p. 7, ibid). He was able to confiscate a gun from appellant 
which he found tucked at the back of appellant's pants (p. 7, ibid). He 
was also able to confiscate from appellant and Tolibas several 
identification cards (Exhibits `I', `I-1', `I-2') some of which were 
fake (pp. 7-8, ibid).<br><br>While he was deciding on whether to bring 
the appellant and Tolibas to Fort Bonifacio or Pasay City Police 
Station, he was told by some bystanders that there were police officers 
nearby so he decided to turn over appellant and Tolibas to the police 
officers (p. 9, ibid). He asked appellant and Tolibas to walk toward the
 direction of the police officers, taking the precaution to walk behind 
the two for he might not be recognized as a police officer, 
unnecessarily placing himself at risk (pp. 9-10, ibid).<br><br>Police 
Officer 3 Edgardo Cordova and Police Officer 3 Ernie Cabrega were along 
Lakas ng Bayan St. near the corner of Sandejas St. and Taft Avenue in 
Pasay City patrolling the area (p. 3, TSN, April 13, 1993). They saw 
Police Officer 1 Dominguez walking toward them pointing a gun at 
appellant and Tolibas in front of him. Aside from the gun pointed at 
appellant and Tolibas, Police Officer 1 Dominguez was also holding 
another gun in his left hand, its muzzle pointed downward (pp. 3-4, 
ibid). Upon reaching hearing distance, they were informed by Police 
Officer 1 Dominguez that he had arrested the two, the gun in his left 
hand being the gun he had confiscated and that the gun in his right hand
 was his own (p. 4, ibid). Police Officer 3 Cordova and Cabrega took the
 guns from Police Officer 1 Dominguez and asked the three to come with 
them to their headquarters (p. 4, ibid). At the headquarters, Police 
Officer Dominguez was able to produce documents supporting the legality 
of his possession of the gun while appellant and Tolibas were not, and 
on the basis of this fact, the two were turned over to the Investigation
 Division for the filing of the necessary charges (p. 5, ibid). The gun 
was turned over to the Investigating Officer, Senior Police Officer 
Elmer Pueda (p. 5, ibid). With the confirmation of the arrest, Police 
Officer 1 Dominguez was requested to execute an affidavit of arrest 
(Exhibit `J') in connection with the incident (p. 11, TSN, February 10, 
1993).<br><br>On September 2, 1992, the body of Amado was autopsied by 
the Medico-Legal Officer of the Western Police District, Dr. Manuel A. 
Lagonera. In his Post Mortem Findings (Exhibit `L') he identified the 
cause of death as the gunshot wound at the right upper chest 
anterolateral, to wit:<br><blockquote><center>`<u>POST MORTEM FINDINGS</u><br></center><br><u>EXTERNAL FINDING:</u><br><ol><li>Gunshot
 wound, with the point of entry at the right upper anterolateral thorax,
 49 inches from heel, 13.5 cms. from anterior midline, measuring 0.5x0.4
 cms. and contusion collar measures 1x0.7 cms.<br><br>Trajectory-obliquely
 upwards, backwards crossing midline lacerating the upper lobe of the 
right lung (thru and thru), right sub-clavian artery, trachea and 
grazing the anterior portion of the body of 5th cervical vertebra. A 
copper coated slug was extracted at the basal portion in the left 
lateral side of the neck.<br></li></ol><u>INTERNAL FINDINGS:</u><br><ol><li>Lacerations
 of organs and tissues as mentioned in the trajectory of the bullet with
 massive hemorrhage in the right thoracic cavity.<br><br></li><li>The rest of the internal organs were markedly pale.<br><br></li><li>Recovered from the stomach about 1/2 glassful of partially digested rice meal with meaty materials and without alcoholic odor.<br></li></ol><u>CAUSE OF DEATH:</u><br><br>Shock sec. to a Gunshot Wound, Right Antero-Lateral Thorax.'<br></blockquote>On
 September 3, 1992, Joe Mari learned from a newspaper that appellant and
 Tolibas were arrested near the scene of the shooting of his friend on 
the very same night the shooting happened (p. 12, TSN, January 12, 
1993). Together with Peter, he went to the Pasay City Jail to see 
appellant and Tolibas, and there he was able to confirm that the persons
 arrested by Police Officer Dominguez were the ones who shot Amado (p. 
12., TSN, January 12, 1993). He then executed a sworn statement (Exhibit
 `H') on September 5, 1992 with SPO1 Pineda identifying appellant as the
 person who shot Amado, and Tolibas as appellant's companion during the 
attempted holdup (pp. 12-13, ibid)."<br></blockquote>For the defense, appellant and accused presented the following version of the story:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><blockquote>"On
 September 1, 1992, on or about 11:30 o'clock in the evening, herein 
accused-appellant, together with his co-accused, Jaime Tolibas, boarded a
 Monumento bound jeepney along Libertad Street, Pasay City, Metro 
Manila. The two (2) accused just came from accused Jaime Toliba's (sic) 
cousin, who was then residing somewhere in that vicinity. The passenger 
jeepney they were riding at the time, upon reaching the vicinity of Vito
 Cruz and Taft Avenue, Streets, a commotion broke out and the passengers
 riding the same all ran away from the jeep. The commotion was the 
result of a gun shot that was fired inside the passenger jeepney. A male
 person who is claimed to be a hold-upper fired at one of the passengers
 and the fatality was one Amador Guina. Both accused were among the 
passengers who ran away from the passenger jeepney upon hearing the gun 
shots. Running through an alley in the vicinity of Vito Cruz Street, 
both accused were stopped by a passing police officer, PNP Special 
Action Force, PO1 Fernando Dominguez detailed at Fort Bonifacio. A gun 
was alleged to have been confiscated from accused-appellant Raul Taguba.
 The two (2) accused including the gun alleged to have been confiscated 
were turned over by police officer Dominguez to a patrolling team of 
Pasay policemen named PO3's Cordora and Cabrega. Both accused were 
brought to the Pasay Police Station for investigation and SPO1 Elmer 
Pueda of the said police station conducted the investigation including 
the alleged gun confiscated. Preliminarily, both accused are being 
charged only of usurpation of authority by police investigation (sic) 
SPO1 Elmer Pueda because of the false ID's confiscated from them. They 
were then detained at the Pasay Police Station for two (2) days and no 
complainant appeared for that period of time. Accused Jaime Tolibas was 
inquested and charged with usurpation of authority while 
accused-appellant Raul Taguba and Jaime Tolibas were charged with 
illegal possession of firearm.<br><br>On September 5, 1992, an alleged 
eye witness, Joe Mari Tamargo Y Jumuad appeared before the office of 
investigator SPO1 Elmer Pueda of the Criminal Investigation Branch, 
Pasay Police Station, to give his statement of a hold-up incident which 
happened on September 1, 1992. Based on his statement, which is 
prosecution exhibit `H' and `H-1', he chanced upon and was able to read a
 news item in the Sept. 3, 1992 issue of People's Tonight. On page 5 to 8
 thereof, he allegedly recognized a male person on a news caption 
`Policemen Arrest Policemen' and pointed to a male suspect then seated 
in front of him and the investigator, as the alleged gunman who killed 
his friend, Amador Guina, in a hold-up incident which happened on 
September 1, 1992.<br><br>Based on the late testimony of Joe Mari 
Tamargo, another case and information for `Homicide With The Use of An 
Unlicensed Firearm' was filed against the two (2) accused."<br></blockquote>On
 September 4, 1992, appellant was charged with the crime of Illegal 
Possession of Firearms in Criminal Case No. 93-1382, which was raffled 
to the RTC-Pasay City, Branch 117. Said Information reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><blockquote>"The
 undersigned Assistant City Prosecutor accuses RAUL TAGUBA Y REYNOSO of 
VIOLATION OF PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NO. 1866, committed as follows:<br><br>That

 September 7, 1992, after prosecution witness Tamargo surfaced, 
appellant and accused were additionally charged in Criminal Case No. 
92-1384 with violation of Section 1, Paragraph 2 of Presidential Decree 
No. 1866 (Homicide with the Use of an Unlicensed Firearm), which was 
raffled to the RTC-Pasay, Branch 110. The Information states:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><blockquote>"The

 Appellant and accused likewise entered their respective pleas of not 
guilty to the charge of Homicide with the Use of an Unlicensed Firearm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 Upon discovery of the two pending cases in the different branches of 
the trial court, the defense moved for the consolidation of the two 
cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>During joint 
trial, the prosecution presented the following witnesses: (1) Joe Mari 
Tamargo, eyewitness to the incident, (2) PO1 Fernando Dominguez, who 
initially arrested both appellant and accused, (3) Dr. Manuel Lagonera, 
Medico-Legal officer of the Western Police District, who conducted the 
autopsy on the body of the victim, (4) PO3 Edgardo Cordova, (5) SPO2 
Jose Villa Garcia, the policemen to whom PO1 Dominguez turned over 
appellant and accused, and (6) Marilou Guina, widow of the victim, who 
testified as to the damages sustained as a result of the death of her 
husband.<br><br>For the defense, appellant and accused both testified 
and interposed the defense of denial. Both protested that they were mere
 innocent passengers of the jeepney. Appellant testified that he jumped 
out of the jeepney when an unidentified man suddenly shot his seatmate. 
When accused saw appellant running away, he followed suit. The two were 
still running when they were accosted by four policemen, who frisked 
them and confiscated their identification cards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On November 8, 1993, the trial court rendered a consolidated decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> disposing thus:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE,
 in view of the foregoing, the Court finds the accused Raul Taguba y 
Reynoso GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal case no. 92-1382, for
 violation of R.A. 1866, and sentences him to an indeterminate penalty 
of TEN (10) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of prision mayor as minimum to 
FOURTEEN (14) YEARS, EIGHT (8) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of reclusion 
temporal as maximum, and to pay the costs. It is also ordered that the 
firearm, subject matter of the offense, be turned over to the Firearms 
and Explosives Unit of the Philippine National Police for proper 
disposition.<br><br>Likewise, the Court in Criminal case no. 92-1384, 
the Court (sic) finds the accused Raul Taguba y Reynoso and Jaime 
Tolibas y Camposano GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of homicide with the 
use of an unlicensed firearm defined and penalized under Section 1, 
paragraph 2, of P.D. 1866, and sentences them to reclusion perpetua; to 
indemnify the heirs of the deceased Amado Guina, jointly and severally 
the amount of P50,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, and to pay the costs. Both accused shall be credited in the 
service of their sentence with the full time during which they have 
undergone preventive imprisonment in accordance with Article 29 of the 
Revised Penal Code.<br><br>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>Only appellant interposed an appeal. He contends that the trial court erred in:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>...
 NOT FINDING THAT THE PROSECUTION FAILED TO PROVE THE GUILT OF THE 
ACCUSED-APPELLANT RAUL TAGUBA BEYOND REASONABLE IN THE TWO CASES.<br><br></li><li>...

 DECREE NO. 1866 AND SENTENCING HIM THE PENALTY OF RECLUSION PERPETUA 
AND AN INDETERMINATE PENALTY OF TEN YEARS AND ONE DAY OF PRISION MAYOR 
AS MINIMUM TO FOURTEEN YEARS, EIGHT MONTHS AND ONE DAY OF RECLUSION 
TEMPORAL AS MAXIMUM.<br></li></ol></blockquote>In his brief, appellant 
assails the credibility of eyewitness Joe Mari Tamargo considering that 
it took him four (4) days after the incident to surface. Further, 
appellant bewails the fact that they were not in a police lineup when 
Tamargo identified them as the assailants. Appellant further assails the
 testimony of PO1 Dominguez considering that he executed his statement 
on September 1, 1992, but only signed it on September 3, 1992. Lastly, 
appellant claims that his conviction cannot stand since the firearm 
allegedly confiscated from him was never presented during trial.<br><br>In
 the appellee's brief, the Office of the Solicitor-General contends that
 the trial court did not err in its assessment of credibility of the 
witnesses, not having overlooked facts of substance or circumstances of 
significance which, if considered, would alter the result of the case. 
Further, the delay of a mere four days in the execution of Joe Mari's 
sworn statement has no bearing on his credibility. As to the delay in 
PO1 Dominguez' signing of his statement, he already explained that he 
made a temporary statement only because he was then about to go home. 
Further, there is no requirement that the firearm confiscated from 
appellant should in all instances be presented during trial. As 
explained by PO3 Cordora, the person who had custody of the firearm died
 after the incident, and the police officers could no longer locate the 
subject firearm.<br><br>An appeal in a criminal case throws the whole 
case wide open for review, and issues whether raised or not by the 
parties may be resolved by the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 Thus, we find that the issues in this case pertain to (1) the 
assessment of credibility of witnesses, (2) the correct characterization
 of the crime or crimes committed by appellant and accused, and (3) the 
propriety of their conviction for illegal possession of firearm in view 
of the non-presentation of the subject firearm in court.<br><br>As we 
have repeatedly held, the assessment of credibility of witnesses and 
their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by the trial court because
 of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and to 
note their demeanor, conduct and attitude. Findings of the trial court 
on such matters are binding and conclusive on the appellate court, 
unless some facts or circumstances of weight and substance have been 
overlooked, misapprehended or misinterpreted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 We generally uphold and respect the trial court's appraisal since, as 
an appellate court, we do not deal with live witnesses but only the cold
 pages of a written record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 In this case, the identification of appellant and accused by PO1 
Dominguez and eyewitness Tamargo was positive and categorical. Appellant
 and accused literally ran into PO1 Dominguez in their bid to escape the
 failed hold-up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Tamargo who was seated in front of the victim actually saw appellant shoot at the victim with a .38 cal. firearm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 Further, Tamargo promptly surfaced after reading the news of the arrest
 in a local newspaper which showed the pictures of appellant and 
accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Hence, he could 
not even be faulted for the slightest delay in coming out as an 
eyewitness to the killing. Likewise, PO1 Domiguez satisfactorily 
explained the delay of three days in signing the affidavit of arrest. 
The foregoing considered, we find no cogent reason to depart from the 
factual findings of the trial court.<br><br>As to the crime or crimes 
committed by appellant, the peculiar circumstances of the case led to 
the filing of two cases, both involving illegal possession of firearms. 
The trial court convicted appellant of illegal possession in Criminal 
Case No. 92-1382 and both appellant and accused of the crime of illegal 
possession in its aggravated form under Criminal Case No. 92-1384. 
However, the passage of Republic Act No. 8294,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 which lowered the penalties for illegal possession, has changed the 
legal scenario for appellant. Being beneficial to appellant who is not a
 habitual criminal, R.A. No. 8294 should be considered in his favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Under Section 1, third paragraph of R.A. No. 8294, and as interpreted by the Court in <i>People v. Molina</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and subsequent cases,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 if homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed 
firearm, only the offense of homicide or murder is committed, and the 
use of the unlicensed firearm should be considered as an aggravating 
circumstance. An examination of the allegations in the Information 
reveals that all the elements of homicide were sufficiently alleged and 
proven during trial. However, the Information did not allege any of the 
circumstances which would qualify the crime to murder. Hence, appellant 
can only be convicted of the crime of <i>homicide</i>.<br><br>On the 
last issue, can the crime of illegal possession be proven even in case 
of non-presentation of the subject firearm? In cases involving illegal 
possession of firearms, the prosecution has the burden of proving the 
elements thereof, <i>viz</i>.: (a) the existence of the subject firearm;
 and (b) the fact that the accused who owned or possessed it does not 
have the corresponding license or permit to possess the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 As to the first requisite, the existence of the subject firearm can be 
best established by the presentation of the firearm owned or possessed 
by the accused. However, there is no requirement that the actual firearm
 itself must be presented in court. In <i>People v. Orehuela</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
 the Court held that the existence of the firearm can be established by 
testimony, even without the presentation of the said firearm. Thus, the 
non-presentation of the subject firearm is not fatal to the prosecution 
of an illegal possession case. In this case, two credible witnesses 
testified that they saw appellant in possession of the subject firearm. 
PO1 Dominguez testified that he recovered a .38 cal. firearm with no 
serial number from appellant. Prosecution witness Tamargo saw appellant 
shoot at the victim. These witnesses who are total strangers to 
appellant and accused had no false motive to testify against them. The 
positive testimonies, therefore, prevail over the bare denials of 
appellant and accused. Worth noting, both were seen right in the midst 
of the <i>locus criminis</i>. As to the second requisite, the 
non-existence of the license or permit was sufficiently proven by the 
Certification (Exh. "A") of Sr. Inspector Mario M. Espino of the 
Philippine National Police, Firearms and Explosives Office that 
appellant is not a licensed/ registered firearms holder of any kind and 
caliber.<br><br>The foregoing considered, the crime committed by 
appellant was homicide, with the use of the unlicensed firearm as an 
aggravating circumstance. Under Art. 249 of the Revised Penal Code, the 
penalty for homicide is <i>reclusion temporal</i>, which in view of the 
presence of one aggravating circumstance, should be imposed in its 
maximum period. Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the minimum of 
the penalty should be taken from <i>prision mayor</i>. The lowering of 
the penalty, being favorable to the accused who did not interpose an 
appeal, should likewise be applied as to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>As
 to damages, the trial court correctly ordered appellant and accused 
solidarily to pay the heirs of the victim the amount of P50,000.00 as 
indemnity, pursuant to current jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>As
 to appellant, we find on review that he is liable for actual damages in
 the amount of P37,500.00, it being duly supported by receipts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
 Likewise, based on the evidence, he is also liable in the amount of 
P850,440.00, for the loss of earning capacity of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Furthermore, considering that the widow testified as to the mental anguish she suffered on account of the death of her husband,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>
 he is likewise ordered to pay the amount of P50,000.00 as moral 
damages. Finally, one aggravating circumstance having been proved, the 
award of exemplary damages against appellant in the amount of P20,000.00
 is also in order.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the consolidated decision of
 the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City, Branch 117, in Criminal Case 
Nos. 92-1382 and 92-1384, is hereby <b>MODIFIED</b>. Pursuant to existing laws, the Information in Criminal Case No. 92-1382 is quashed and the judgment therein <b>VACATED and SET ASIDE</b>. Appellant <b>RAUL TAGUBA y REYNOSO</b> and accused <b>JAIME TOLIBAS y CAMPOSANO</b>, are found <b>GUILTY</b> only of the crime of <b>HOMICIDE</b>
 aggravated by the use of an unlicensed firearm in Criminal Case no. 
92-1384. Appellant is hereby sentenced to the penalty of eleven (11) 
years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor </i>maximum as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months, and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>
 maximum as maximum, and ordered solidarily to pay the heirs of the 
victim the amount of P50,000.00 as indemnity. Although accused <b>JAIME TOLIBAS y CAMPOSANO</b>
 did not appeal his sentence, said penalty in this case being lower than

 The victim was 24 years old (Exhibit "E") at the time of his death. His
 wife testified that he was earning P190.00 a day as a marble mason, 
(TSN, January 4, 1993, p. 10), which amount we find to be reasonable. 
The formula for loss of earning capacity is life expectancy x (gross 
annual income - living expenses), with life expectancy = 2/3 (80 - age 
at time of death), and living expenses = 50% of gross income. Applying 
said formula, we have 2/3 (80 - 24) x (P45,600 - P22,800) = P850,440.00.
