Hence, this case proceeded only against appellant Elmer Manalili who was arrested on January 21, 1993 in Cebu City.<br><br>When arraigned on August 23, 1993, appellant Manalili pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> He also waived his right to pre-trial.&nbsp; Thereafter, trial ensued.<br><br>The prosecution presented the following testimonial evidence:<br><br>Prosecution witness Gervacio Ong Uy, 62, operations manager of the cargo-passenger vessel M/V J &amp; N Princess, testified that at 9:40 in the evening of December 15, 1992, Tuesday, he boarded said vessel.&nbsp; The vessel plies the route between Ubay, Bohol and Cebu (and vice-versa) every other day or every Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday.&nbsp; It leaves the port of Ubay, Bohol at 10:00 o' clock in the evening. About twenty minutes after departure on said date, he went down to urinate at the lower deck.&nbsp; After urinating, two persons were standing behind him; one was pointing a gun at his back and the other was holding his collar. They ordered him to go upstairs to the third or upper deck.&nbsp; Arriving there, they told him to open the radio room, and they destroyed the radio. They also ordered that all lockers of the room be opened.&nbsp; They told him that they were military men looking for firearms and shabu.&nbsp; He opened all lockers except&nbsp; that of quartermaster Ernesto Magalona, who was not around as he was hiding.&nbsp; The crew members looked for him, and when he appeared, the pirates scolded and hit him with an armalite.&nbsp; He was about 3 meters away from Magalona.&nbsp; Magalona opened his locker but the pirates were not able to find anything inside.&nbsp; When the locker was opened, he saw that the left hand of one pirate had a tattoo with the initials "G.V."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The pirates took from Gervacio Uy P30,500.00 in cash and his wristwatch worth P1,500.00.&nbsp; From an inventory made by the purser, the pirates divested from the passengers P200,000.00 in cash, and P300,000.00 worth of personal belongings including radio and jewelry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>After the robbery, the leader of the pirates told the quartermaster to stop the engine of the vessel, then there was a gunshot, which was apparently a signal for the get-away pumpboat.&nbsp; Before the pirates left, they told Uy's group not to go back to Ubay, but to proceed to Cebu, otherwise the boat would be strafed. Nevertheless, they proceeded to Talibon, Bohol in order to report the incident to the police.&nbsp; They arrived in Cebu at 5:00 o' clock in the morning of December 16, 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Gervacio Uy declared that he identified the two persons who initially pointed a gun at him through pictures.&nbsp; The one who pointed an armalite at him was about 5'6" in height, regular in built, brown complexion, with straight hair and between 25 to 28 years old.&nbsp; The second man was older, about 42 years old, 5'3" or 5'4" in height, medium built with brown complexion and black hair; he was carrying what looked like an uzi gun. From pictures presented by the Central Intelligence Service (CIS) when he was investigated, he identified the two as Titing Aranas and Paracueles, all at large.&nbsp; When appellant Elmer Manalili was presented during the preliminary investigation before the municipal judge of Ubay, he told Municipal Judge Napuli that his face was familiar among the eight pirates.&nbsp; However, quartermaster Magalona and Boiser, a passenger, identified him as one of the pirates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, Gervacio Uy said that out of the 20 pictures presented to him for identification by the CIS, he only positively identified Titing Aranas and Angelo Paracueles.&nbsp; He saw Elmer Manalili for the first time when he was presented before Judge Napuli for investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Prosecution witness Ernesto Magalona, 39, quartermaster of M/V J &amp; N&nbsp; Princess since 1991 to the present, testified that on December 15, 1992, he was on board the said vessel which left the port of Ubay, Bohol bound for Cebu at 10:00 o' clock in the evening.&nbsp; He was off-duty then.&nbsp; At the time of the robbery, he was on the second deck of the boat.&nbsp; He was lying on his cot near the passage way leading to the upper deck when someone shouted, "<i>Ayaw paglihok kay duna miy pangitaon nga shabu ug armas nga uzi</i>," meaning, "Do not move, we are searching for shabu and uzi gun." Then he saw their manager Gervacio Uy being escorted by two armed men.&nbsp; One was armed with an armalite pointed at Uy.&nbsp; The other man was also armed&nbsp; because something was bulging at his waist, but he did not see the kind of firearm he was carrying.&nbsp; He could identify the two armed men who escorted Uy, because he was about three to four meters away from them and the place was well illuminated with fluorescent lights.&nbsp; He identified one of the said armed men by pointing to a person inside the court room who, when asked his name, answered that he was Elmer Manalili.&nbsp; He declared that the other man carried a long firearm. Describing the manner Uy was escorted, he said that the man holding the armalite was also holding the collar of Uy and pushing him while appellant followed.&nbsp; Uy and the two armed men eventually reached the third deck where the armed men destroyed the radio.&nbsp; He came to know that the radio was destroyed because the purser who came from the third deck looking for him told him so.&nbsp; He tried to cover his face with his <i>malong</i>, but ultimately a pirate saw him and struck him with his gun hitting his right ear so he was forced to stand up and go with them to the third deck.&nbsp; When he was at the third or upper deck, Uy was on his way down to the second deck escorted by appellant.&nbsp; Immediately after his locker was opened, he was instructed to return to his cot and ordered to lie down.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Magalona said that there were about eight (8) pirates. He could only remember and identify the two armed men who escorted Gervacio Uy because the movements of the pirates were so fast and coordinated.&nbsp; He could remember Elmer Manalili because he was facing him and he saw him frontally. The pirates divested the passengers of their belongings.&nbsp; His wallet containing P1,000.00 was taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, Magalona stated that when the robbers announced a hold-up, he was lying down.&nbsp; They were ordered to remain lying down, face down for less than an hour.&nbsp; The robbers were in pairs stationed at the lower deck, second deck and third deck while the other two made rounds of&nbsp; these decks.&nbsp; When the passengers were divested of their belongings, operations manager Uy was at the third or upper deck escorted by the two armed men, one of whom was the appellant.&nbsp; He was positive that from the start, the two armed men escorted Uy from the comfort room at the lower deck to the second deck and then the third or upper deck where the radio room was located.&nbsp; They did not separate from Uy but always followed him, and he had a good look at them when they passed by the second deck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>After the incident, Magalona saw the appellant at the office of the chief of police in Ubay, Bohol and then during the investigation at the office of the municipal judge.&nbsp; He also saw the appellant from pictures of suspects shown to him at the office of the chief of police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Prosecution witness SPO2 Alex Henson Reyes, a member of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Ubay, Bohol,&nbsp; testified that on December 15, 1992 he was a passenger of M/V J &amp; N Princess bound for Cebu.&nbsp; He was asleep when the boat left the port of Ubay, but was awakened by a gunfire. Then he saw a pirate aiming an armalite rifle, and another one, about 16 years old, aiming his carbine rifle, at him. Another pirate got his bag, and taken therefrom was his service revolver, a caliber .38 Smith and Wesson, issued by the Chief of Police.&nbsp; The gun had twelve (12) rounds of ammunition.&nbsp; After the incident, he went to the PNP in Bohol, and from pictures that were shown to him, he identified the pirate who got his bag as Angelo Paracueles.&nbsp; He did not see the appellant during the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Due to fright suffered at the time of the incident, SPO2 Reyes asked for moral damages of P50,000.00, and actual damages of P50,000.00 for the loss of the gun, and P288.00 for the 12 rounds of ammunition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Prosecution witness PO3 Saul Pino Cuyno,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> a member of the PNP, Ubay, Bohol, testified that in the evening of December 15, 1992, he was also a passenger of M/V J &amp; N Princess.&nbsp; The pirates took from him P80.00 in cash and his watch worth P4,000.00 The armed men mentioned by SPO2 Reyes were the same men who aimed their guns at him.&nbsp; From pictures that were shown to him after the incident, he identified one of the armed men as Angelo Paracueles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, appellant Elmer Manalili denied that he was involved in the piracy committed on board M/V J &amp; N Princess in the evening of December 15, 1992 in the seawaters of Ubay, Bohol inasmuch as he was in his residence in Cebu City at that time.<br><br>Defense witness Jeffrey Dadula Perandos, 26, single, third year high school,&nbsp; industrial painter, testified that he knew appellant since they were neighbors at Cabantan St., Mabolo, Cebu City.&nbsp; Appellant started to live there when he was eight (8) years old and stayed with his elder brother Junior Manalili.&nbsp; He does not know appellant's father because the latter died in Camotes Island before appellant transferred to Mabolo, Cebu City.&nbsp; In 1989, appellant married Cherry Mae Elimino from Lutopan, Cebu.&nbsp; After their marriage, they stayed in Lutopan for a while, and resided in Nivel, Lahug, Cebu City in October or November 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Perandos said that he has been working as an industrial painter since he was 15 years old.&nbsp; In December 1992, he was hired to paint the house of Mr. Chua in La Guardia, Lahug, Cebu City.&nbsp; His companions were appellant, Reynaldo Cardona, Ernesto Dadula and master painter Nicomedes Baguio who was the head of their group.&nbsp; They started painting the house of Mr. Chua sometime during the first week of December, but he did not finish painting the house because he transferred to another painting job at Basak, Mandaue and stopped working with Mr. Chua about the end of January 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>According to Perandos, when they started working at La Guardia, he and Reynaldo Cardona slept at appellant's house.&nbsp; On December 14, 1992, he, appellant and Reynaldo Cardona started painting the house of Mr. Chua at 8:00 o' clock in the morning and stopped working at 5:00 o' clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; Then they proceeded to the house of appellant together with Reynaldo Cardona and ate supper there at 8:00 o' clock in the evening.

Then he saw their manager, Gervacio Uy, being escorted by two armed men.&nbsp; One was armed with an armalite pointed at Uy; the other was also armed but he did not see the kind of firearm he was carrying at his waist.&nbsp; He could identify the two armed men who escorted Uy because he was three to four meters away from them and the place was well illuminated with fluorescent lights.&nbsp; He identified one of the armed men as appellant.&nbsp; He said that the other man holding the&nbsp; armalite was also holding the collar of Uy while pushing him, while appellant "followed fast." Uy and the two armed men eventually reached the third or upper deck where the armed men destroyed the radio as reported to him by the purser who came down looking for him from the upper deck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Of the eight pirates, he could only remember and identify the two armed men who escorted Uy, because their movements were so fast and coordinated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> He stated that from the start the two armed men, one of whom he identified as the appellant, escorted Uy from the comfort room at the lower deck to the second deck and then proceeded to the third or upper deck where the radio room was located.&nbsp; They did always followed Uy, and he had a good look at them when they passed by the second deck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>From the foregoing, prosecution witness Gervacio Uy identified the two armed men, who initially pointed a gun at him in the comfort room at the lower deck, and who ordered him to go with them to the radio room at the third or upper deck, as Titing Aranas and Angelo Paracueles.&nbsp; On the other hand, prosecution witness Ernesto Magalona who saw Gervacio Uy and the two armed men as they passed by the second deck on their way to the third deck, identified one of those two armed men as appellant Elmer Manalili.<br><br>Where eyewitnesses contradict themselves on a vital question, such as the identity of the offender, the element of reasonable doubt is injected and cannot be lightly disregarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The identity of the offender, like the crime itself must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In the case at bench, there is no positive identification of the appellant inasmuch as prosecution eyewitnesses Uy and Magalona contradicted themselves on the identity of the alleged offender.<br><br>Moreover, although prosecution witness Gervacio Uy stated that one of the pirates who opened the locker of Ernesto Magalona had a tattoo on his left hand with the initials "GV," the trial court did not see any tattoo mark on the appellant's left hand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Further, witness Uy declared that he saw appellant for the first time during the investigation before the municipal judge of Ubay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> He told the municipal judge that appellant's face was "familiar among the eight seajackers," but Magalona identified appellant as one of the pirates.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Compared with the identification made by Magalona, Uy's statement that appellant's face was familiar among the pirates is characterized by uncertainty. His identification of appellant in the trial court based on the aforementioned statement retained its doubtful tenor.<br><br>Significantly, the passenger named Boiser who allegedly identified the appellant as one of the pirates before the municipal judge of Ubay was significantly not presented as a witness by the prosecution.&nbsp; The records show thus:<br><br><blockquote>FISCAL LIGASON:<br><br>I would like to made (sic) manifestation, Your Honor, that I did not present Ms. Alma Casil and Melecio Boiser, they were listed, but after I confronted them that they did not identify this accused, so that I did not present them, because there are others who can identify.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><br>From the foregoing, it appears that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that appellant was one of the eight men who committed qualified piracy in the instant case.<br><br>Appellant's defense of alibi is generally considered a weak defense.&nbsp; However, it assumes importance when his identification as an alleged offender in the crime charged is inconclusive or unreliable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Appellant asserted that at the time of the piracy in the seawaters of Ubay, Bohol, he was in his residence in Cebu City, and which alibi was corroborated by Jeffrey Perandos, Reynaldo Cardona and his wife, Cherry Mae Manalili. Although alibi can be fabricated, it is not always false and without merit, and when coupled with the improbabilities and uncertainties of the prosecution evidence, the defense of alibi deserves merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Besides, the prosecution has the burden of proof in establishing the guilt of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> When the prosecution fails to discharge its burden, an accused need not even offer evidence in his behalf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In every criminal prosecution, the identity of the offender or offenders must be established by proof beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> There must be moral certainty in an unprejudiced mind that it was accused-appellant who committed the crime.&nbsp; Absent this required quantum of evidence would mean exoneration for accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> It is our view, therefore, and we hold that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that appellant was one of the pirates who committed the crime charged.
