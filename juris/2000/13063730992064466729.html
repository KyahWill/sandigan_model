Privatization Trust (APT). In the exercise of its assigned rights, APT opted to enforce the provisions of the above-mentioned deed of assignment and its supplement.<br><br>On January 31, 1992, respondent Rosario B. Olivares filed with the Sandiganbayan an "urgent ex-parte motion to order the appearance of DBP or APT representatives to vote the 67% shares in the stockholders meeting of PJI set for February 4, 1992 at 2:00 in the afternoon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On February 3, 1992, the Sandiganbayan issued a resolution which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"<b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding the instant motion to be justified, meritorious and in order We grant the relief prayed for therein, Accordingly, the 1992 Annual Stockholders' meeting of PJI is ordered to be held on February 4,1992 at 2:00 o'clock P.M. at the training room of the PJI building at Railroad Street, Port Area, Manila, and the present PJI management, its officers, employees, security guards, agents and representatives are hereby enjoined from interfering, obstructing or preventing such meeting to be held or the stockholders from entering said building or premises and conducting said meeting in said building or any appropriate room thereat. Furthermore, the Development Bank of the Philippines/Asset Privatization&nbsp; Trust are&nbsp; hereby enjoined to send their representatives to said meeting and vote the 67 % voting rights assigned to them and, in case of their refusal or failure to comply therewith, they shall be considered to have waived their right to vote said shares in favor of the assignors thereof. Finally, in the event that the representatives of PJI, DBP and APT fail to attend the meeting, defendant Rosario Olivares is hereby authorized to act as presiding officer and call the meeting to order and proceed with the conduct of business thereat as contemplated/mandated by the By-laws."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>In compliance with the resolution of the Sandiganbayan, petitioner sent its representatives in the person of Paterno Bacani, Jr. and Fiorello E. Azura to the scheduled meeting to vote the 67% shares. During the meeting, representatives Bacani and Azura objected to respondent Olivares' presiding over the meeting because the condition for her authority to preside was not present and because of conflicting positions, made worse by the highly partisan crowd. Chairman Enrique Joaquin relinquished and delegated to whoever the 67% voting shares of petitioner APT would elect to preside over the stockholders meeting of PJI. APT in the exercise of the 67% voting shares, elected Paterno Bacani, Jr. to preside over the meeting.<br><br>In the meeting presided over by Paterno Bacani, Jr., the stockholders elected a new set of members of the Board of Directors. They were as follows:<br><blockquote>1. Enrique M. Joaquin<br><br>2. Jasim A. Cura<br><br>3. Paterno C. Bacani, Jr.<br><br>4. Maximo A. Maceren<br><br>5. Ernesto A. Aloba<br><br>6. Atlee Viray<br><br>7. Zacarias N.

Olivares on the other hand filed a manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> with the Sandiganbayan stating among other things that after the election of the board of members with the assignors of the APT 67% voting rights present and voting the assigned shares, the meeting was adjourned. Then immediately thereafter, they elected the members of the board and the duly elected board were as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="20%"><div>Alejandro Maranag - </div></td> <td width="80%">Chairman of the Board/Gen.

Villanueva.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On February 1, 1993, the Sandiganbayan promulgated its resolution, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>"<b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises duly considered, the Court whereby upholds the validity of the February 5, 1992 PJI Annual Stockholders meeting presided by defendant movant. The other meeting held by the PCGG/APT faction on the same date is hereby declared as void and illegal. In the meantime, however, the status quo is hereby ordered maintained with respect to the management and internal affairs of the company. Consequently, to ensure harmonious transfer of power and smooth operations in the company, the next annual stockholders meeting of PJI is hereby set on February 2, 1993 at 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon, in accordance&nbsp; with&nbsp; the PJI&nbsp; By-laws, to be conducted at the training room of the PJI building at railroad Street, Port area, Manila. The Development Bank of the Philippines/Asset privatization Trust are hereby enjoined to send their representatives to said meeting and vote the 67% voting rights assigned to them and, in case of their refusal or failure to comply therewith, they shall be considered to have waived their right to vote said shares in favor of the assignors thereof. They are likewise enjoined to desist from committing any untoward malicious act during the meeting, and they are only allowed to nominate and vote the PJI Board persons who are bonafide registered stock holders of the company, apart from the two (2) seats allotted to them pursuant to the loan agreement with PJI. The PCGG is hereby advised against interfering in the conduct of the meeting. Accordingly, Alejandro Maramag, being the duly-elected Chairman of the PJI Board during the February 4, 1992 annual stockholders meeting presided by defendant-movant, is hereby authorized to act as the presiding officer thereof, and call the meeting to order and proceed with the conduct of business thereat as mandated/ contemplated by PJI By-laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>Considering the proximity of the notice to the actual date of the meeting which was only effectively 24 hours, petitioner did not have any other plain, adequate and speedy remedy but to file a petition for certiorari.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The issues raised are as follows:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Whether the assignment to DBP and later to APT of voting shares of the PJI was an assignment of voting rights or voting shares.<br><br></li><li>Whether the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction to decide who were the duly elected officers of the PJI.<br></li></ol></blockquote>We find the petition impressed with merit.<br><br>The Deed of Assignment is very clear that what was assigned to DBP (APT) were <b>voting shares</b> as distinguished from non-voting shares. Obviously, it meant that the assignees of the shares had the right as though they were owners of the shares. It is true that the assignment was predicated on the intention that it would serve as security vis-à-vis DBP's financial accommodation extended to PJI, but it was a valid and duly executed assignment, subject to a resolutory condition, which was the settlement of PJI's loan obligation with DBP.<br><br>Private respondent Olivares submitted the view that what was assigned to DBP/APT was merely voting rights and adduced the endorsements attached to each stock certificate representing the assigned shares to DBP/APT. The endorsement states:<br><blockquote>"For and in consideration of the guarantee for US $1,745,000.00 issued by the Development Bank of the Philippines for the account of Philippine Journalist, Inc., of the obligations thereunder, I hereby transfer and as security for the faithful performance by Philippine Journalist Inc. of the obligations thereunder, I hereby <b>transfer and assign</b> in favor of the Development Bank of the Philippines the shares covered by the within certificate of Stock no. 31.-100 shares<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">Rosario Olivares<br>Stockholder<br></div><br>Date May 7,1997<br><br>Voting rights of the shares are assigned to the Development Bank of the Philippines.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">Delia S. Tantuico<br>Corporate Secretary"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></div></blockquote>It is clear in the endorsements that what was given to DBP was not just voting rights but a transfer and assignment of the shares. The phrase counter-signed by Delia S. Tantuico simply clarifies that the transfer and assignment include also the right to vote the shares. The deed executed between DBP and the assignors was denominated as a <b>Deed of Assignment of voting shares,</b> not of voting rights.<br><br>The private respondent contends that since the shares involved were sequestered shares, jurisdiction over the subject of the dispute lies with the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>Of the 67% shares assigned to DBP, which total 3,350 shares, only 500 shares representing part of the shares of private respondent Olivares were sequestered. Private respondent admitted this in her reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> So, out of the 3,350 assigned shares to APT, only 500 of the assigned shares were under sequestration, and included in the case pending with the Sandiganbayan (Civil Case No. 0035, against Benjamin Romualdez).<br><br>It is also worthy to note that APT's exercise of the right to vote the 67% shares was by virtue of the deed of assignment executed by the assignors in favor of DBP in consideration of the loan secured from DBP in 1977, long before PJI was sequestered. The power of APT then emanates from a contractual relation existing between DBP and the stockholders of PJI, including Olivares, who assigned their shares to DBP as security for the loan taken from the bank. And of the shares assigned to DBP/APT only 500 shares of Olivares were under sequestration, the remaining 2,850 shares assigned to DBP/APT were released from sequestration.<br><br>Strictly speaking then, the 67% shares assigned by DBP to APT were mostly not sequestered shares. The point that requires more emphasis is the categorical statement in the resolution of the Sandiganbayan dated February 3, 1992. The resolution clearly spelled out the only instance that private respondent Olivares may preside over the stockholders' meeting, that is:<br><blockquote>"Finally, in the event that the representatives of PJI, DBP and APT fail to attend the meeting, defendant Rosario Olivares is hereby authorized to act as presiding officer and call the meeting to order and proceed with the conduct of business thereat as contemplated/mandated by the By-laws."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>This situation never came into play during the February 4, 1992, stockholders' meeting.&nbsp; APT sent its representatives in the persons of Paterno Bacani, Jr. and Fiorello E. Azura. It is odd to say the least, that the Sandiganbayan will recognize the authority of respondent Olivares after she clearly violated the resolution of the Sandiganbayan by presiding over the meeting, and worse conducting an election of members of the board of PJI despite the appearance and willingness to vote of the APT representatives.<br><br>The election of the two sets of officers and members of the board of PJI occurred because respondent Olivares refused to follow the resolution of the Sandiganbayan. Respondent Olivares proceeded with the meeting and election despite the opposition of the APT representatives, who were just upholding the above-mentioned resolution of the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>The issue between APT and respondent Olivares involved a dispute between stockholders, clearly intra-corporate in nature, hence, outside the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan and squarely was within the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In the case of San Miguel Corporation vs. Kahn, we held that "De los Angeles' dispute, as stockholder and director of SMC, with other SMC directors, an intra-corporate one, to be sure, is of no concern to the Sandiganbayan, having no relevance whatever to the ownership of the sequestered stock."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Court hereby <b>GRANTS</b> the petition, <b>REVERSES</b> and <b>SETS ASIDE</b> the resolution of the Sandiganbayan promulgated on February 1, 1993, in Civil Case No. 0035.<br><br>Considering that Civil Case No. 0035 was filed with the Sandiganbayan as early as July 31, 1987, let the records be remanded to the Sandiganbayan for further proceedings which must be conducted with all deliberate dispatch and completed within six (6) months from notice of this decision.
