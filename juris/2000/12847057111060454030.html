In view of their failure to attend, Joaquin Castano, Acting Division Manager, Resettlement Division, NHA, wrote a memorandum to the Department Manager, Resettlement Department, NHA, recommending the issuance of a demolition clearance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On January 21, 1982, NHA General Manager Tobias granted clearance to dismantle and remove all illegal structures on petitioner’s property within three (3) months from receipt of the order. Clearance was also granted for the relocation of the 24 families to the Sapang Palay Resettlement Project. The clearance was addressed to Mayor Asistio and reads as follows: <br><blockquote>"Sir:<br><br>This has reference to the letter of Mr. Pilo Melitante[sic] which was received by our Office on 24 September 1981 regarding his request for the relocation of the families presently occupying his property situated at G. de Jesus Street, Balintawak, that City, covered by TCT Nos. 53066, 53067 and 53068, subject of 1st Indorsement of City Engineer Jose Uson.<br><br>Evaluation of the request shows the same to merit favorable consideration.

In 1987, petitioner, through an authorized representative, made an initial offer of P200.00 per square meter. The NHA made a counter-offer of P175.00 per square meter. Petitioner increased his price to P1,000.00 and later to P3,000.00. NHA General Manager Raymundo R. Dizon, Jr. informed petitioner that NHA’s maximum offer was P500.00. <strong>This was rejected by petitioner, through his lawyer, in a letter dated March 20, 1989.</strong><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On September 8, 1990, petitioner, through counsel, requested for a revalidation of his demolition clearance and relocation of the squatters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On January 15, 1991, NHA General Manager Monico Jacob revalidated the demolition clearance and informed Mayor Asistio that the NHA was making available enough serviced home lots in Bagong Silang Resettlement Project for the 24 families.

At the conference of February 13, 1991, Carangdang claimed that petitioner’s land had already been declared expropriated by P.D. 1315.</strong><br><br>Petitioner then filed with the respondent Court of Appeals a "<strong>Petition for Prohibition and Mandamus</strong> with Declaration as Inexistent and Unconstitutional Presidential Decree No. 1315" against the NHA and Carangdang.<br><br>In a decision dated April 24, 1992, the respondent Court of Appeals dismissed the petition and held that petitioner failed to overcome the presumption of the decree’s constitutionality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration was also denied on August 31, 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Hence, this recourse where petitioner raises the following issues:<br><blockquote><center>"I</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT ANNABELLE CARANGDANG CAN BE COMPELLED TO EFFECT THE DIRECTIVE/ MEMORANDUM OF RELOCATION/ RESETTLEMENT SUBJECTING THE SAID 24 SQUATTER FAMILIES FROM UNLAWFULLY OCCUPYING PETITIONER’S SUBJECT PROPERTY WITHOUT DECLARING P.D. 1315 AS VOID AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL; AND <br><br><center>II</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT SAID P. D. 1315 AT LEAST UP TO THE EXTENT OF PETITIONER’S PROPERTIES ADVERSELY AFFECTED CAN BE DECLARED NULL AND VOID FOR BEING UNCONSTITUTIONAL."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>We deny the petition.<br><br><strong>First.</strong> Petitioner is not entitled to the writ of prohibition. Section 2 of Rule 65 provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 2. <em>Petition for prohibition.</em>—When the proceedings of any tribunal, corporation, board, or person, whether exercising functions judicial or ministerial, are without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion, and there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the defendant to <strong>desist</strong> from further proceedings in the action or matter specified therein.<br><br>x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>Prohibition is a preventive remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It seeks for a judgment ordering the defendant to desist from continuing with the commission of an act perceived to be illegal.<br><br>In the case at bar, petitioner does not pray that respondent Carangdang should be ordered to desist from relocating the squatters. What petitioner challenges is respondent Carangdang’s refusal to implement the demolition clearance issued by her administrative superiors. The remedy for a refusal to discharge a legal duty is mandamus, not prohibition.<br><br><strong>Second.</strong> The petitioner is not also entitled to a writ of mandamus. Section 3, Rule 65 provides:<br><br>"Sec. 3. <em>Petition for mandamus.</em>—<strong>When any tribunal, corporation, board, or person, unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law</strong>, the person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered <strong>commanding the defendant, immediately or at some other specified time, to do the act required to be done</strong> to protect the rights of petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner by reason of the wrongful acts of the defendant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Mandamus is a writ commanding a tribunal, corporation, board, or person to do the act required to be done when it or he unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, there being no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>It is incumbent upon petitioner to show that he has a well-defined, clear and certain right to warrant the grant of the writ of mandamus.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> He failed to discharge this burden. The records show that <strong>there is no direct order from the NHA General Manager addressed to respondent Carangdang to evict the squatters and demolish their shanties on the subject property</strong>. The NHA demolition clearance issued by General Tobias on January 21, 1982 was addressed to Mayor Asistio, the mayor of Caloocan City. The clearance’s revalidation by NHA General Manager Monico Jacob was likewise addressed to Mayor Asistio.<br><br>Furthermore, mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that may be availed of only when there is no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. A petition for mandamus is premature if there are administrative remedies available to the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> If superior administrative officers could grant the relief prayed for, special civil actions are generally not entertained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In the instant case, petitioner has not exhausted his administrative remedies. He may seek another demolition order from the NHA General Manager this time directly addressed to respondent Carangdang or the pertinent NHA representative. In fact, the Government Corporate Counsel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> asserts that petitioner should have brought Carangdang’s inaction to the attention of her superiors. There is therefore no extreme necessity to invoke judicial action as the administrative set-up could have easily corrected the alleged failure to act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The General Manager, as Chief Executive Officer of the NHA, has the power of supervision over the operations and internal affairs of NHA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> <br><br><strong>Third.</strong> Petitioner’s procedure in assailing the constitutionality of P.D. No. 1315 is flawed. His principal concern is the relocation of the squatters on his land. If he could attain this aim, petitioner himself admits in his Petition that "there may not be a need for declaring P.D. No. 1315 null and void."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Indeed, petitioner assails P.D. No. 1315, purely out of pique against respondent Carangdang who refused to implement the demolition order of her superior. To use petitioner’s own words, he has to attack the constitutionality of P.D. No. 1315 "to x x x break respondent Carangdang’s hypocrisy and pretension." We hold that petitioner has no privilege to assail P.D. No. 1315 as unconstitutional to serve a petty purpose.<br><br>Moreover, the facts reveal that petitioner’s land is not in clear danger of expropriation. P.D. No. 1315 was issued way back in 1975. It covered 40 hectares of land in Bagong Barrio, Caloocan City. Almost all of these 40 hectares had been expropriated as early as 1979 except the 1,590 sq. m. lot of petitioner. Considering this long lapse of time, it is doubtful if the government would still desire to expropriate petitioner’s lot which only measures 1,590 sq. m.<br><br>There is another reason why petitioner’s lot may no longer be expropriated by government. The land sought to be expropriated under P.D. No. 1315 is defined as an area "identified as a blighted area and included in the SIR Program" which means Slum Improvement and Resettlement Program. On October 2, 1981, however, HSRC Commissioner Dizon, Jr. certified that petitioner’s lot is "outside the declared Urban Land Reform Zone." With this certification, there is reason to believe that taking petitioner’s tiny lot of 1,590 sq. m. will serve no social purpose.<br><br><strong>Finally, petitioner cannot blow hot and cold on the constitutionality of P.D. No. 1315.</strong> He did not question its constitutionality when it was decreed in 1975. In 1987, he even negotiated with NHA for the price of his land. Implicitly but clearly, he recognized the validity of the decree. The negotiation unfortunately fell and the government did not take any further step to expropriate his land. It was only in 1991 after respondent Carangdang refused to eject the squatters in petitioner’s land that petitioner, out of pique, alleged that P.D. No. 1315 is constitutionally infirmed. A well recognized rule in constitutional law is that estoppel may operate to prevent a party from asserting that an act is unconstitutional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>There is also merit to the cautionary words of the Solicitor General that to allow petitioner’s flip-flopping stance "might spawn legal and social ramifications which cannot just be lightly ignored,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> since almost all of the 40 hectare land covered by P.D. No. 1315 had been expropriated and awarded to the poor people of our society without their landowners challenging the validity of the decree. In his Concurring Opinion, our esteemed colleague, Mr. Justice Mendoza, denigrates this warning and cites Alfonso v. Pasay City<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> as authority for the view that "if property is taken by the government without the benefit of expropriation proceedings and is devoted to public use, such as a road, after many years, the property owner may no longer bring an action for recovery of his land, but may simply demand payment of just compensation for his land."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> A careful reading of the Alfonso case, however, will show that this Court did not rule that the only remedy of an aggrieved landowner in such a situation is to "simply demand payment of just compensation." To be sure, this Court contemplated the remedy of restoring possession to the aggrieved landowner. If it did not order the remedy, it was only because it was no longer feasible as the lot involved had already been converted to a road. The exact ruling states:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><blockquote>"As registered owner, he could bring an action to recover possession at any time because possession is one of the attributes of ownership of land. However, said restoration of possession by the City of Pasay is neither convenient nor feasible because it is now and has been used for road purposes. So, the only relief available is for the City of Pasay to make due compensation, which it could and should have done years ago since 1925."<br></blockquote>In the case at bar, the landowners concerned may not opt for the right to be paid just compensation. The process is not an easy one and may take years especially in light of the budget difficulties of the government. We take judicial notice of the fact that the current budget deficit of the government amounts to P8.9 billion.<br><br>IN VIEW WHEREOF, the petition is dismissed.

Consistent with his claim that P.D. No. 1315 is unconstitutional, he cannot ask the NHA to relocate the 24 squatter families occupying Lot Nos. 3603, 3605, and 3607. For such power is to be exercised by the NHA only with respect to lands acquired by the government and placed under the administration of NHA. Thus, after declaring the lots enumerated therein as "expropriated," §1 of P.D. No. 1315 directs the NHA "to immediately take possession, control and disposition of the expropriated properties with the power of demolition of their improvements." Indeed, if P.D. No. 1315 is valid, the relocation of the squatters is no concern of petitioner. In such case, the distribution of the land to the squatters as beneficiaries of the law should in fact be undertaken.<br><br>Instead, what petitioner should do is to bring an action for ejectment against the squatters and, as an incident thereof, raise in issue the constitutional validity of P.D. No. 1315, since the squatters claim the right to occupy petitioner’s land by virtue of this Decree.<br><br>The majority, echoing the Solicitor General’s warning, argues that to allow petitioner to question the validity of P.D. No. 1315 many years after its promulgation, could give rise to legal and social complications. Apparently, they refer to the fact that other lots have been acquired by the government by virtue of P.D. No. 1315. I do not share this dire and apocalyptic view. As far back as 1960, this Court in <em>Alfonso v. Pasay City</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> already ruled that if property is taken by the government without the benefit of expropriation proceedings and is devoted to public use, such as a road, after many years, the property owner may no longer bring an action for recovery of his land but may simply demand payment of just compensation for his land. This ruling was reiterated in other cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and is now the settled doctrine on this matter.<br><br>The court, in an ejectment case, may accordingly pass upon the constitutionality of P.D. No. 1315 without in the least placing in doubt the validity of the previous acquisitions by the government. As already noted, P.D. No. 1315 declares petitioner’s land expropriated. Whether this can be done, or whether under the ruling in <em>Manotok v. NHA</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>, such expropriation by legislative fiat constitutes an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law, is a question which must be litigated in such action.<br><br>Petitioner’s cause of action, if any, is against those occupying his properties and the appropriate vehicle for challenging the validity of P.D. No. 1315 is to do so in an ejectment case, since the squatters justify their occupation of the lots in question as beneficiaries of the Decree. On the other hand, beyond upholding the squatters’ right under the Decree, the NHA has done nothing that is remediable by prohibition and/or mandamus.<br><br>I vote to deny the petition for review and to affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals for the reasons herein stated.<br><br>- end -<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 106 Phil. 1017 (1960).

Carangdang, to relocate the 24 squatter families occupying petitioner Pilo Militante’s land in Bagong Barrio, Caloocan City. The <em>ratio decidendi</em> of the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals is that P.D. No. 1315 is presumed constitutional. Hence, the petitioner in his second assignment of error questions whether P.D. No. 1315 can be declared void for being unconstitutional at least up to the extent of his properties adversely affected thereby.<br><br>The pertinent facts are:<br><br>Petitioner is the registered owner of three (3) parcels of contiguous land denominated as lot nos. 3603, 3605 and 3607, with an aggregate area of 1,590 square meters situated in Bagong Barrio, Caloocan City, covered and described in Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. 53066-A<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>, 53067<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and 53068<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> respectively of the Registry of Deeds of Caloocan City. Said titles were all derived from TCT No. 71357.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Around twenty-four (24) squatter families lived on petitioner’s land. They claimed to be beneficiaries of P.D. No. 1315<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which mandated the expropriation of petitioner’s land as part of the landed estate in Bagong Barrio, Caloocan City and covered by the Slum Improvement and Resettlement Program and Zonal Improvement Program.<br><br>The National Housing Authority (NHA) undertook the implementation of P.D. No. 1315 in seven (7) phases called the Bagong Barrio Project (BBP). The properties covered by phases 1 to 6 were acquired in 1978 and 1979 while those covered by phase 7, including petitioner’s subject lots, were left untouched due to inadequate funds of the NHA at that time.<br><br>During this hiatus, petitioner sought to prevent the impending expropriation of his subject lots by seeking a declaration of non-coverage from the Human Settlements Regulatory Commission (HSRC). As a result, HSRC Commissioner Raymundo R. Dizon issued a certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>, dated October 2, 1981, declaring petitioner’s lots to be outside the coverage of P.D. No. 1315. <br><br>Armed with the said certification, petitioner asked the NHA to relocate the squatters living on his land. The NHA then called them for a dialogue on January 15, 1982 to explore the possibility of an amicable settlement but they did not attend the meeting. Thus, Joaquin Castaño, Acting Division Manager of the Resettlement Division of the NHA, recommended the issuance of a demolition clearance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On January 21, 1982, Gaudencio V. Tobias, as the then General Manager of the NHA, granted the demolition clearance, and requested then Caloocan City Mayor Macario Asistio, Jr., to implement the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In 1986, an emergency fund in the amount of two million pesos (P2,000,000.00) was appropriated and approved by the NHA for the acquisition of the lots covered by phase 7 of the Bagong Barrio Project. Thus, in September 1987, the NHA started negotiations with petitioner for the acquisition of his subject lots. Initially, petitioner offered to sell his lots at P200.00 per square meter while the NHA offered to buy the same at P175.00 per square meter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> But in a letter dated April 28, 1988, petitioner upped his asking price to P1,000.00 per square meter and in another letter, the price was further increased to P3,000.00 per square meter. The NHA’s final offer was P500.00 per square meter which the petitioner rejected in a letter dated March 20, 1989.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On September 8, 1990, petitioner requested the NHA to revalidate his demolition clearance issued to him on January 21, 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> He also requested for a certification of the availability of lots in the slum relocation areas of the NHA in Sapang Palay and Bagong Silang, both located in Caloocan City, for occupancy by the squatters living on his land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On January 15, 1991, Monico V.

Carangdang as Project Director of the NHA. She, however, refused to eject the squatters on the ground that their right to occupy petitioner’s land was protected by P.D. No. 1315.<br><br>Consequently, petitioner filed with this Court a Petition for Prohibition and Mandamus with Declaration as Inexistent and Unconstitutional Presidential Decree No. 1315<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> against respondents NHA and Carangdang. However, this Court, in its Resolution dated July 11, 1991, referred the same to the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Petitioner argued that P.D. No. 1315 relied upon by respondent Carangdang is unconstitutional and does not vest in the squatters any right to occupy petitioner’s land. As such, petitioner insisted that prohibition and mandamus lie.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, however, denied the said petition. Hence, this petition for review of the said Decision and Resolution dated April 24, 1992 and August 31, 1992, respectively of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>In the instant petition for review, the petitioner alleges that respondent Court of Appeals erred in ruling only on the issue of constitutionality of P.D. No. 1315 and not on the petition for prohibition and mandamus against respondents NHA and Carangdang. In the petition for review before this Court, the petitioner states two (2) specific assignment of errors, to wit:<br><blockquote><center>"I</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT ANNABELLE CARANGDANG CAN BE COMPELLED TO EFFECT THE DIRECTIVE/MEMORANDUM OF RELOCATION/RESETTLEMENT SUBJECTING THE SAID 24 SQUATTER FAMILIES FROM UNLAWFULLY OCCUPYING PETITIONER’S SUBJECT PROPERTY WITHOUT DECLARING P.D. 1315 AS VOID AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL; AND<br><br><center>II</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT SAID P.D. 1315 AT LEAST UP TO THE EXTENT OF PETITIONER’S PROPERTIES ADVERSELY AFFECTED CAN BE DECLARED NULL AND VOID FOR BEING UNCONSTITUTIONAL."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The sequence of events that transpired in the instant case reveals an unmistakable attempt by petitioner to eject the squatters occupying his land first by purely executive action on the part of respondent NHA in coordination with the local officials of Caloocan City, and then when that did not materialize, <em>via</em> prohibition and mandamus proceedings which was first instituted in this Court but later referred to and then ultimately denied by respondent Court of Appeals. We cannot countenance such an underhanded scheme to circumvent our laws vesting in the metropolitan and municipal trial courts the exclusive and original jurisdiction over ejectment cases. Having resorted to judicial intervention with "unclean hands," so to speak, petitioner deserves no relief from us. Since it is truly the ejectment of the squatters living on his land that petitioner seeks, it is an ejectment case that he should file in the proper court. Besides, prohibition is manifestly the wrong remedy in this case.<br><br>However, we reverse respondent Court of Appeals insofar as it held that P.D. No. 1315 is still presumed constitutional. Insofar as the second issue explicitly raised by the petitioner in this instant petition for review is concerned, we hereby declare P.D. No. 1315 as unconstitutional for being inherently so and in the light of our ruling in the 1987 case of <em>Manotok v.

No. 1315 is the need to rule on the second assignment of error ("Whether or not said P.D. 1315 at least up to the extent of petitioner’s properties adversely affected can be declared null and void for being unconstitutional") considering that the explicit <em>ratio decidendi</em> of the assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals, that is, that "P.D. is presumed constitutional". As a Filipino citizen, entitled to certain constitutional rights including due process and just compensation, the petitioner has the right, not merely a privilege, to seek the explicit ruling of this Court on the unconstitutionality of P.D. No. 1315 inasmuch as the squatters on his subject three (3) parcels of land claim the right to occupy the petitioner’s land by virtue of that Presidential Decree.<br><br>Contrary to the <em>ponencia</em>, the petitioner, in the light of the facts in the case at bar, is not estopped from asserting that P.D. No. 1315 is unconstitutional. It was not the petitioner but the NHA that sought to implement Pres. Decree No. 1315. Petitioner even rejected the final offer of NHA to purchase his lots at Php500.00 per square meter.<br><br>I reject the apprehension and dispute the view in the ponencia, apparently believing the exaggerated and baseless warning of the Solicitor General, that to allow the petitioner to question the constitutionality of P.D. No. 1315 many years after its promulgation "might spawn legal and social ramification which cannot be lightly ignored." The warning refers to the fact that other parcels of land have been earlier purchased in 1978 and 1979 by the government by virtue of P.D. No. 1315. However, this Court has already ruled in at least two (2) cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> that if property is taken by the government without the benefit of proper expropriation proceedings and is devoted for public use for many years, the property owner may no longer bring an action for recovery of his land but may only demand payment of just compensation thereof. Besides, any action for recovery of those other lots purchased and acquired by the government in 1978 and 1979 and/or for just compensation has already <em>prescribed.</em><br><br>Finally, it appears that: (1) prohibition, is manifestly the wrong remedy in this case and needs no further discussion; and (2) mandamus will not lie for failure of petitioner to exhaust administrative remedies. Petitioner could have appealed to the General Manager and/or Board of Directors of the NHA to compel respondent Annabelle D. Carangdang, NHA Project Manager, to effect the Directives/Memorandum of Relocation/Settlement of the 24 squatter families who are occupying the petitioner’s subject property. But he did not.<br><br>ACCORDINGLY, it is my considered opinion that P.D. No. 1315 should be as it is hereby declared unconstitutional. The assailed Decision dated April 24, 1992 and the Resolution dated August 31, 1992 of the Court of Appeals are hereby <strong>AFFIRMED</strong>, with the modification that the petition for mandamus is hereby <strong>DISMISSED</strong> for failure of petitioner to exhaust administrative remedies. The petition for prohibition is also <strong>DISMISSED</strong> for being patently the wrong remedy in the case at bench.<br><br>- end -<br><br><br><hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Associate Justice Jose C.
