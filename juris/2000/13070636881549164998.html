				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The case is an administrative complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for the dismissal of Judge Daniel B. Liangco, Municipal Trial Judge, Municipal Trial Court, San Fernando, Pampanga, and Acting Judge, Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Mexico-San Luis, Pampanga for serious misconduct, gross inefficiency and incompetence. This is in relation to his handling of a petition for declaratory relief filed by the Sangguniang Bayan of San Luis, Pampanga,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> which sought his legal opinion on the validity of Resolution No. 34-96 which provided that Lot No. 114, belonging to the municipality of San Luis, but occupied by the family of Hermogenes T. Gozun, be used for the construction of the Rural Health Center of San Luis, Pampanga. <p> We state the antecedent facts. </p><p> Complainant Hermogenes T. Gozun (hereinafter referred to as "Gozun") was in open and adverse possession of subject land for a period of more than thirty years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> His family's house was erected on the land. The house was made of old vintage lumber, cement, hollow blocks, G.I. sheet roofing and other strong materials. Gozun inherited the house and lot from his parents. </p><p> The municipality of San Luis, Pampanga claimed to own the same lot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p><p> On January 12, 1996, the Sangguniang Bayan of San Luis, Pampanga issued Resolution No. 26-96,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> stating:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> <p> “RESOLVED AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED that the Sangguniang Bayan of San Luis, Pampanga do hereby consider (sic) the lot under Tax Dec. No. 114 owned by the Municipal Government of San Luis, Pampanga, specifically the lot where Mr. Hermogenes Gozun and family were squatting (sic) as the new site of the Rural Health Center will rise (sic).” </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> On May 17, 1996, the Sangguniang Bayan issued Resolution No. 34-96 to amend and correct Resolution No. 26-96.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p><p> On May 24, 1996, Romulo M. Batu, Vice Mayor, on behalf of the Sangguniang Bayan, filed with the MTC, San Luis, Pampanga, a petition for declaratory relief. We quote the petition:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><blockquote> <p> “PETITION FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF </p> <p> “THE HONORABLE JUDGE DANIEL LIANGCO </p> <p> “In behalf of the Sangguniang Bayan of San Luis, Pampanga, We would like to petition your good office to render legal opinion on the following matters, to wit: </p> <blockquote> <p> “1. The validity of the attached Resolution. </p> <p> “2. The powers of the Municipal Mayor to enforce said Resolution. </p> <p> “3. To issue an order to the PNP to assist the Municipal Mayor in implementing said Resolution. </p> <p> “These request are (sic) in connection with our plan to construct a new site for the Rural Health Center of San Luis, Pampanga. However, the designated place thereof is presently being squatted (sic) by a certain Mr. Hermogenes Gozun and inspite of the official notice of Atty. Benalfre S. Galang, our Provincial Legal Officer, and personal request of our Municipal Mayor Jovito C. Bondoc to Mr. Gozun to vacate his (sic) premises, he continues to defy such notices and request to the detriment of the proposed project. </p> <p> “WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that this petition will merit your favorable consideration and appropriate action for the sake of public interest.” </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> On the very same day, May 24, 1996, respondent judge issued a resolution, reasoning: First, the municipality of San Luis, Pampanga through its Sangguniang Bayan may enact resolutions and ordinances to regulate the use of property within its jurisdiction. Second, Resolution No. 34-96 is not contrary to law, morals and public policy. Third, the municipal mayor through an executive order may order the Philippine National Police or any government law enforcement agency to enforce or implement the resolution, using reasonable force if necessary and justified. Fourth, squatting in government property is considered a "nuisance per se". Respondent judge ruled:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><blockquote> <blockquote> <p> “With the issuance by the Municipal Mayor of an executive order, the municipality of San Luis may order the Philippine National Police (PNP) stationed in San Luis, Pampanga to effect the eviction of Hermogenes Gozun and all other persons who may be claiming any right under him from Lot No. 114 covered by Tax Declaration No. 6030 (underscoring ours)." </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> Again, on the same day, March 24, 1996, the municipal mayor, Jovito C. Bondoc, pursuant to the aforequoted resolution, issued Executive Order No. 1, series of 1996, ordering the PNP to implement Resolution No. 34-96.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> Note that complainant Gozun was not served with summons or given notice of the petition for declaratory relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> On June 2, 1996, complainant Gozun learned about the resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p><p> On June 3, 1996, complainant Gozun's wife<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> together with other public school teachers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> went to the office of respondent judge. When asked about the resolution, respondent judge answered, "I<em>ng Apung Guinu yu y Mayor Bondoc at kaya ko makisabi</em>" ("Your God is Mayor Bondoc and you should talk to him”).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p> On August 8, 1996, agents of the municipal government demolished complainant Gozun's house, using respondent judge's resolution and the mayor's executive order as basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p> On December 18, 1996, complainant Gozun filed this administrative complaint with the Office of the Court Administrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> He averred that respondent judge's issuance of the resolution amounts to "gross misconduct, gross inefficiency and incompetence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Complainant Gozun further accused the municipal mayor of having bribed respondent judge. Mayor Bondoc told complainant Gozun that "the respondent judge is in his pocket ...because he (Mayor Bondoc) has given him (respondent judge) a lot of things ("<em>dacal naku a regalo kaya</em>").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p><p> On January 20, 1997, the Office of the Court Administrator<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> submitted the petition to this Court for its consideration, recommending that the complaint be given due course.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> On March 21, 1997, the Court resolved to require respondent judge to comment thereon, within ten (10) days from notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p> On May 15, 1997, respondent judge submitted his comment, denying the charges and urging that the case be dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p><p> On June 23, 1997, we referred the case back to the Office of the Court Administrator for evaluation, report and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p> On April 13, 2000, after investigation, Court Administrator Alfredo L. Benipayo submitted a memorandum, recommending the dismissal from office of respondent judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p> We agree with the recommendation of the Court Administrator. </p><p> Under the 1964 Revised Rules of Court, a petition for declaratory relief may be filed by any person interested under a deed, will, contract or other written instrument, or whose rights are affected by a statute, executive order or regulation, or ordinance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The purpose of the petition is to determine the construction or validity of a statute or ordinance and to seek a judicial declaration of the parties' rights or duties thereunder. Such “action for declaratory relief must be brought in the proper Court of First Instance (now the Regional Trial Court).”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><p> In this case, respondent judge not only acted without jurisdiction, but in so acting ignored blatantly the basic rules of fair play. Complainant was not notified of nor made party to the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The purpose of notice is to afford the parties a chance to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> This chance was not given to complainant Gozun, and consequently, because of an arbitrary act of respondent judge, complainant's house was demolished and he and his family were rendered homeless. </p><p> To escape our disciplining wrath, respondent judge argues that the "resolution" he issued was a mere expression of his legal opinion and not a judgment or order "which adjudicates and settles rights and obligations of the parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> He said that the petition for declaratory relief, earlier quoted, is not a pleading, but a mere letter-request for a legal opinion. Hence, complainant Gozun was not entitled to notice and hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> Respondent's argument betrays either gross ignorance of or contempt for the law, neither of which is acceptable, for it is given that a member of the bench must keep himself constantly abreast of legal and jurisprudential developments, bearing in mind that this learning process never ceases even as it is so indispensable in the correct dispensation of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> When the law violated is elementary, the failure to know or observe it constitutes gross ignorance of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> </p><p> The resolution, suffice it to say, is legally flawed, bore all earmarks and characteristics of an order or judgment disposing of the case. Sans reception of evidence, respondent judge made conclusions of fact, labeling complainant as a "squatter", stating that his house was a nuisance per se. Without citing any law or jurisprudence, respondent judge gave the municipality a "go signal" to demolish complainant's house even using force. </p><p> Undeniably, respondent judge had an inkling of the nature of the petition. The petition was docketed as Special Proceeding No. 96-001. A special proceeding is a litigated action. Respondent judge must know this. In fact, he named complainant as respondent therein, yet never gave him notice. </p><p> His excuse that the resolution was a mere expression of his own legal opinion is an afterthought. </p><p> Besides, even assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the resolution was a mere legal opinion, still respondent must know that rendering of "legal opinions" is not the function of a judge. The function of the court is limited to adjudication of actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable or enforceable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Unlike lawyers, judges cannot render legal advice. Judges<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> are expressly prohibited from engaging in the private practice of law or from giving professional advice to clients.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> </p><p> Unfamiliarity with the Rules of Court is a sign of incompetence, which goes against Canon 3, specifically Rule 3.01,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> of the Code of Judicial Conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p> Judges are required to be objective. Judges cannot innovate at pleasure and justify such innovations by their own perception of what is ideal or good. Their authority is limited by substantive and procedural rules and by Constitutional precepts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> We further note that the resolution was released the same day that the petition was filed. This reinforces complainant's allegation that respondent judge acted with manifest partiality in favor of the municipal government represented by the mayor. </p><p> It is the duty of the members of the bench to avoid any impression of impropriety to protect the image and integrity of the judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> A judge who tarnishes the image of the judiciary or brings it to public contempt, dishonor or disrespect must be administratively dealt with and punished accordingly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p> The rule of impartiality is applied more strictly to municipal, metropolitan and regional trial court judges. This is because they are "judicial front liners" who have direct contact with the litigating parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p> One who accepts the exalted position of a judge owes the public and the court the ability to be proficient in the law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> and the duty to maintain professional competence at all times. Basic rules must be at the palm of his hand. He must be acquainted not only with legal norms and precepts, but with procedural rules as well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> Early this month, we suspended respondent judge from office for six (6) months without pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> He was disciplined for assigning fifty four (54) cases of violation of P. D. No. 1602<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> to his own court <strong>without raffle</strong> in violation of Supreme Court Circular No. 7, dated September 23, 1974, as amended. </p><p> We note that there are three other administrative cases against respondent judge pending before the Court. One is for dishonesty and the other, gross ignorance of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Still another is for direct bribery,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> wherein respondent judge was caught by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in an "entrapment operation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> </p><p> In the present case, respondent's maleficent acts must be brought to an end. He has shamed the judiciary. He gave judicial imprint to a procedure decidedly beyond the jurisdiction and authority of the court presided over by him. For this, the Court believes that the penalty of dismissal is warranted. </p><p> <strong>IN VIEW WHEREOF,</strong> the Court <strong>hereby orders the DISMISSAL</strong> of respondent Judge Daniel B. Liangco, Municipal Trial Judge, Municipal Trial Court, San Fernando, Pampanga, and Acting Judge, Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC), Mexico-San Luis, Pampanga, from the service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and accumulated leave credits, if any, and with prejudice to reinstatement or reemployment in any branch, instrumentality or agency of the Government, including government-owned or controlled corporations. </p><p> The Court directs the Court Administrator to initiate disbarment proceedings against respondent Judge for misconduct as a member of the bar within thirty (30) days from finality of this decision. </p><p> This decision is immediately executory. </p><p><strong> SO ORDERED. </strong></p> <i>Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Kapunan, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Purisima, Pardo, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, Ynares-Santiago,</i> and <i>De Leon, Jr., JJ., </i>concur. <br> <br> <br> <hr width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade" size="1"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Filed by Hermogenes T.
