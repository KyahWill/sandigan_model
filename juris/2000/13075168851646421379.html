				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Accused-appellant Rodegelio Turco, Jr. (aka "Totong") was charged
 with the crime of rape in Criminal Case No. 2349-272, Branch I of the 
Regional Trial Court of Basilan of the 9th Judicial Region, stationed in
 Isabela, Basilan, under the following Information:
<blockquote>
  <p>That on or about the 8th day of July, 1995, and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, viz., at Km. 6, Begang Barangay, 
Municipality of Isabela, Province of Basilan, Philippines, the 
above-named accused, by the use of force, threat and intimidation, did 
then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously grab the 
undersigned complainant by her neck, cover her mouth and forcibly make 
her lie down, after which the said accused mounted on top of her and 
removed her short pant and panty. Thereafter, the said accused, by the 
use of force, threat and intimidation, inserted his penis into the 
vagina of the undersigned complainant and finally succeeded to have 
carnal knowledge of her, against her will.
  </p>
  <p>CONTRARY TO LAW.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(p. 6, Rollo.)
</p><p>At his arraignment on November 8, 1995, accused-appellant entered a plea of not guilty, after which trial ensued.
  </p>
<p>The prosecution's version of the generative facts, as gathered from 
the testimony of its witnesses - Alejandra Tabada, mother of the victim;
 PO3 Celso Y. Tan Sanchez, the police officer who investigated the case;
 Orlando Pioquinto, brother-in-law of the victim; Escelea Tabada, the 
13-year-old victim; and Felicitas delos Santos Timorata, the medical 
record clerk who used to be the medical officer under Dr. Rimberto 
Sanggalang, the physician who physically examined the victim after the 
incident - is abstracted in the Appellee's Brief in this wise:
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Escelea Tabada and appellant Rodegelio Turco were neighbors in 
lower Begang, Isabela, Basilan, their houses being only about sixty (60)
 meters apart (p. 6 and p. 8, t.s.n.; August 19, 1996). Escelea was then
 staying with her father, Alejandro and her deaf grandmother, 
Perseveranda (p. 9, id). She was twelve (12) years and six (6) months 
old at the time of incident, having been born on December 3, 1982 (p. 3,
 id).
  </p>
  <p>The nightmare of Escelea began in the evening of July 1995. At 
around seven o'clock (7:00 p.m.) in the evening, Escelea, after (pp. 
11-12, id) [sic]. She was accompanied by a certain Cory Macapili, the 
granddaughter of her neighbor, Leonora Cabase (p. 13, id).
  </p>
  <p>Cory left upon reaching Escelea's home.  Escelea went upstairs to 
join her grandmother who was already sleeping in the room. About to 
enter the said room, Escelea heard a call from outside. She recognized 
the voice and when she asked who was it, the party introduced himself as
 the appellant, viz:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Q.   After you heard your named was mentioned, what did you say if any?
    </p>
    <p>A.    I answered: "Who is that?"
      </p>
    <p>Q.   Did the person calling your name answer you?
    </p>
    <p>A.    I heard, sir, "me Totong". </p>
    <p>Q.   When you say the person who called your name "Lea" was "Totong" you are referring to whom? </p>
    <p>A.    Rodegelio, sir.
    </p>
    <p>(p. 15, id; Underscoring supplied)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>She recognized appellant Turco immediately as she had known him for
 four (4) years and appellant is her second cousin (p. 34, id). Unaware 
of the danger that was about to befall her, Escelea forthwith opened the
 door. Appellant Turco, with the use of towel, covered Escelea's face. 
Appellant, aside from covering the victim's mouth, even placed his right
 hand on the latter's neck.
  </p>
  <p>Appellant bid Eseelea to walk. When they reached a grassy part, 
near the pig pen which was about twelve (12) meters away from the 
victim's house, appellant lost no time in laying the victim on the 
grass, laid on top of the victim and took off her shortpants and panty 
(pp. 17-19, id). Escelea tried to resist by moving her body but to no 
avail. Appellant succeeded in pursuing his evil design-by forcibly 
inserting his penis inside Escelea's private part. The victim felt 
terrible pain (p. 20, id). Still dissatisfied, after consummating the 
act, appellant kissed and held the victim's breast. Thereafter, 
appellant threatened her that he will kill her if she reports the 
incident to anybody, thus:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"He threatened me, that if you will reveal the incident to anybody I will kill you. </p>
    <p>(p. 21, id; Underscoring supplied)
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Finally, after having satisfied his lust, appellant hurriedly went 
home. Escelea, on the other hand, upon reaching home, discovered that 
her shortpants and panty were filled with blood (p. 23, id). For almost 
ten (10) days, she just kept to herself the harrowing experience until 
July 18, 1995 when she was able to muster enough courage to tell her 
brother-in-law, Orlando Pioquinto, about the said incident. Orlando in 
turn informed Alejandro, the victim's father, about the rape of his 
daughter. Alejandro did not waste time and immediately asked Escelea to 
see a doctor for medical examination (p. 27, id).
  </p>
  <p>Escelea was accompanied by her sister Clairlyn Pioquinto to the 
Provincial Hospital. She was examined by Dr. Rimberto Sanggalang. After 
the issuance of the medical certificate, they went to Isabela Municipal 
Station and filed Escelea's complaint against appellant (pp. 30-33, id).
  </p>
  <p align="right">(pp. 97-100, Rollo.)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defense presented Leonora Cabase, neighbor of accused-appellant; 
her granddaughter Corazon Macapili, and accused-appellant himself. 
Accused-appellant denied the charge. The defense that the victim and him
 were sweethearts was also advanced. Leonora Cabase mentioned this in 
her direct testimony.
</p><p>In reaching a moral certainty of guilt, the trial court held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>While the accused denies the charge of rape, his witness, Mrs. 
Leonora Cabase was trying to project that the complainant Escelea Tabada
 and the accused Rodegelio Turco, Jr. are sweethearts. In the case of 
People vs. Casil, 241 SCRA 285, the Supreme Court agrees with the trial 
court that the "sweetheart story" was a mere concoction of appellant in 
order to exculpate himself from criminal liability. The claim of 
voluntary love affair is an affirmative defense, the allegation of a 
love affair needed proof. Nowhere in the record of the case that the 
same was substantiated, though mentioned by Mrs. Leonora Cabase. The 
accused and/or his witnesses must present any token of the alleged 
relationship like love notes, mementos or pictures and the like. Such 
bare allegation of the defense, not to mention its utter lack of proof, 
is incredulous. It is hard to understand how such a relationship could 
exculpate a person from the rape of a terrified young child barely a 
little over the age of twelve (12) years old. Indeed, a love 
relationship, even if true, will not necessarily rule out force (<em>People vs. Sergio Betonio</em>,
 G.R. No. 119165, September 26, 1997, Case Digests of Supreme Court 
Decisions, Vol. 36, No. 3, September 1-29, 1997, pp. 695-697). </p>
  <p>There are guiding principles in rape cases as cited in People vs. 
Victor Abrecinoz, G.R. No. 122474, October 17, 1997, Case Digests of 
Supreme Court Decisions, Vol. 37, No. 1, October 2-31, 1997, pp. 
157-160, and they are: (1) an accusation for rape can be made with 
facility, it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person 
accused, though innocent, to disprove it; (2) in view of the intrinsic 
nature of the crime of rape where two persons are usually involved, the 
testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; 
and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own 
merit, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the 
evidence for the defense. Thus, the credibility of the complainant is a 
paramount importance, and if her testimony proves credible, the accused 
may be convicted on the basis thereof.
  </p>
  <p>It should be noted that the complainant and the accused are second 
degree cousin or they are sixth civil degree relatives. The mother of 
the accused is a first degree cousin of the father of the complainant. 
In the culture of the Filipino family on extended family, the 
relationship between the complainant and the accused being only second 
degree cousin, it becomes the duty of an older relative (the accused) to
 protect and care for a younger relative (the complainant). It is very 
hard to understand or comprehend why a cousin files a case of rape 
against her cousin, unless it is true.  There is no showing that there 
was compelling motive why the case be filed against the accused, except 
that the rape really happened.

  </p>
  <p>It is noted that there was no underlying reason why the complainant
 and/or her father would bring an action against the accused, except 
that the accused had raped Escelea Tabada on July 8, 1995, at about 7:00
 o'clock in the evening. If it were not true that she was raped by the 
accused, why would she expose herself to an embarrassment and traumatic 
experience connected with the litigation of this rape case. We are aware
 of the Filipino culture especially on virginity. We likened it as a 
mirror, once dropped and broken, it can no longer be pieced together ...
 not ever. This is true among the Filipino folks that the complainant 
belonged, poor and helpless and everything is entrusted to God. The 
complainant is a young girl, a little over twelve (12) years old and 
almost illiterate, having attended school up to Grade III only. So poor 
that her family cannot even buy the cheapest television set and she has 
to go to a house of a neighbor for the meager joy of seeing a television
 show ... and expose herself to the danger of the dark night. All said, 
it is very difficult to be poor. Going to the court is a shout for help 
... let us try to hear it.

<p>In accused-appellant's brief, he assigns the following alleged errors:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">I
  </p>
  <p>THAT THE HONORABLE COURT A QUO SERIOUSLY ERRED IN FINDING THE 
ACCUSED GUILTY OF RAPE BASED ON THE TESTIMONIES OF THE COMPLAINANT

 DOUBT THAT THE ACCUSED COMMITTED THE CRIME OF RAPE AGAINST THE 
COMPLAINANT.
  </p>
  <p align="center">III
  </p>
  <p>THAT THE HONORABLE COURT A QUO SERIOUSLY ERRED IN SENTENCING THE 
ACCUSED TO SUFFER THE PENALTY OF RECLUSION PERPETUA AND TO INDEMNIFY THE
 COMPLAINANT THE AMOUNT OF P50,000.00 REPRESENTING MORAL DAMAGES BASED 
ON THE EVIDENCES PRESENTED BY THE PROSECUTION.
  </p>
  <p align="right">(p. 101, Rollo.)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He particularly argues that his conviction is not supported by proof 
beyond reasonable doubt considering that other than the written 
statement of the complainant before the Police Station of Isabela and 
before the Clerk of Court of the Municipal Trial Court, and her 
testimony during direct examination, no other evidence was presented to 
conclusively prove that there was ever rape at all; that she only 
presumed that it was accused-appellant who attacked her since she 
admitted that immediately upon opening the door, the perpetrator hastily
 covered her face with a towel; that nothing in her testimony clearly 
and convincingly shows that she was able to identify accused-appellant 
as the perpetrator; that complainant implicated accused-appellant only 
because her father forced her to do so; and lastly, that no actual proof
 was presented that the rape of the complainant actually happened 
considering that although a medical certificate was presented, the 
medico-legal officer who prepared the same was not presented in court to
 explain the same.
</p><p>We agree with the trial court.
</p><p>As aptly recalled by the trial court, there are three guiding 
principles in the review of rape cases, to wit: (1) an accusation of 
rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more 
difficult for the person accused, although innocent, to disprove; (2) in
 view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two 
persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant is 
scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for the 
prosecution stands or falls on its own merits and cannot be allowed to 
draw strength from the weakness of the defense (<em>People vs. Gallo</em>, 284 SCRA 590 [1998]; <em>People vs. Balmoria</em>, 287 SCRA 687 [1998]; <em>People vs. Auxtero</em>, 289 SCRA 75 [1998]; <em>People vs. Sta. Ana</em>, 291 SCRA 188 [1998]).
</p><p>Accordingly, the primordial consideration in a determination 
concerning the crime of rape is the credibility of complainant's 
testimony.
</p><p>The trial court described complainant as "a young girl, a little 
over twelve (12) years old and almost illiterate, having attended school
 up to Grade III only. So poor that her family cannot even buy the 
cheapest television set and she has to go to a house of a neighbor for 
the meager joy of seeing a television show ... and exposes herself to 
the danger of the dark night." But verily, age, youth, and poverty are 
not guarantees of credibility. Hence, thorough scrutiny must be made by 
the Court.
</p><p>Complainant narrated the incident in this wise:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Q    While you went upstairs and about to enter the room of your grandmother, did you hear anything?

<p>On cross-examination, the victim did display some apparent confusion 
when the defense counsel asked her about the events that transpired 
before the ill-fated July 8, 1995. The query prompted her to narrate the
 incident prior to said date when she also watched television at the 
home of Leonora Cabase, and that when she arrived home, 
accused-appellant came and called her "Lea" and when she asked who was 
it, he answered "so Totong". When she asked what he wanted, he said he 
wanted to borrow a guitar. She said that she could not lend him the 
guitar since her father was not yet around. He insisted but to no avail,
 and hence he just went home. She went to sleep afterwards. On re-direct
 examination, she clarified that when accused-appellant came to borrow 
the guitar on July 8, 1995, it was about 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon. 
Lastly, she said that the incident of the borrowing of the guitar and 
the incident that transpired at 7 o'clock in the evening on July 8, 1995
 were separate incidents.
</p><p>Significantly, three things could be perceived: complainant's 
youth, her apparent confusion concerning the events that transpired, and
 her fear of both accused-appellant and her father.
</p><p>At the outset, it should be remembered that the declarations on 
the witness stand of rape victims who are young and immature deserve 
full credence (<em>People vs. Bernaldez</em>, 294 SCRA 317 [1998]). 
Succinctly, when the offended parties are young and immature girls from 
the ages of twelve to sixteen, courts are inclined to lend credence to 
their version of what transpired, considering not only their relative 
vulnerability but also the shame and embarrassment to which they would 
be exposed by court trial if the matter about which they testified were 
not true (<em>People vs. Clopino</em>, 290 SCRA 432 [1998]). In 
addition, we take cognizance of the trial court's observation on the 
segment of the Filipino society to which the victim belongs - almost 
illiterate, having attended school up to the third grade only, and so 
poor that she had to go to a neighbor's house to watch television, yet 
one who values her virginity which like a "mirror, once dropped and 
broken ... can no longer be pieced together ... not ever," this being 
"true among the Filipino folks [to which] complainant belonged, poor and
 helpless everything is entrusted to God" (p. 35, Rollo).
</p><p>The victim's relatively low level of intelligence explains the 
lapses in her testimony, having intermingled two incidents. Nonetheless,
 it can easily be gathered from the record that the defense counsel may 
have contributed to this confusion when he asked the victim what 
transpired "before" the incident (tsn, August 19, 1996, p. 37). Minor 
lapses in a witness' testimony should be expected when a person recounts
 details of an experience so humiliating and so painful to recall as 
rape (<em>People vs. Gementiza</em>, 285 SCRA 478 [1998]).Rape, as a 
harrowing experience, is usually not remembered in detail. For, such an 
offense is not something which enhances one's life experience as to be 
worth recalling or reliving but, rather, something which causes deep 
psychological wounds and casts a stigma upon the victim for the rest of 
her life, which her conscious or subconscious mind would prefer to 
forget (<em>People vs. Garcia</em>, 281 SCRA 463 [1997]). These lapses 
do not detract from the overwhelming testimony of a prosecution witness 
positively identifying the malefactor (People vs. Baccay, 284 SCRA 296 
[1998]). Further, the testimony of a witness must be considered and 
calibrated in its entirety and not by truncated portions thereof or 
isolated passages therein (<em>People vs. Natan</em>, 193 SCRA 355 [1991]).
</p><p>The Court finds that the victim had no motive to falsely testify 
against accused-appellant. Her testimony deserves the credence accorded 
thereto by the trial court (<em>People vs. Luzorata</em>, 286 SCRA 487 
[1998]). Pertinently, no woman, especially one of tender age, would 
concoct a story of defloration, allow an examination of her private 
parts, and thereafter pervert herself by being subjected to a public 
trial if she was not motivated solely by the desire to have the culprit 
apprehended and punished (<em>People vs. Taneo</em>, 284 SCRA 251 [1998]).
</p><p>Another point to consider is the blood relationship between 
accused-appellant and the victim. At this juncture, we reiterate the 
trial court's observation thereon - the mother of accused-appellant 
being a first degree cousin of the victim's father, that makes the 
victim and accused-appellant second degree cousins or sixth civil degree
 relatives. Filipino culture, particularly in the provinces, looks at 
the extended family as closely-knit and recognizes the obligation of an 
older relative to protect and take care of a younger one. On the 
contrary, in the instant case, the victim initiated the prosecution of 
her cousin. If the charge were not true, it is indeed difficult to 
understand why the victim would charge her own cousin as the malefactor.
 Too, she having no compelling motive to file said case against 
accused-appellant, the conclusion that the rape really happened is 
logically reinforced.
</p><p>As regards the initial delay of the victim in reporting the rape 
incident, suffice it to state that the delay and initial reluctance of a
 rape victim to make public the assault on her virtue is not uncommon (<em>People vs. Gallo, supra</em>).
 In the case at bar, the victim's fear of her father who had moral 
ascendancy over her, was explicit. She testified that she did not 
disclose the incident to her father because of fear both of her father 
as well as of accused-appellant (tsn, August 19, 1996, pp. 23-24). Such 
reaction is typical of a twelve-year-old girl and only strengthens her 
credibility.
</p><p>The issue of credibility of the victim having been settled, there
 are a few points presented by the defense that must be passed upon:
</p><p>1. Other than their blood relationship, was there an intimate 
relationship between accused-appellant and the victim? The theory 
initially advanced by the defense in the proceedings before the court a 
quo is the "sweetheart theory". In this regard, .we agree with the trial
 court that the "sweetheart story" was a mere concoction of 
accused-appellant in order to exculpate himself from criminal liability.
 In <em>People vs. Venerable</em> (290 SCRA 15 [1998]), we held that the
 sweetheart theory of the accused was unavailing and self-serving where 
he failed to introduce love letters, gifts, and the like to attest to 
his alleged amorous affair with the victim. Hence, the defense cannot 
just present testimonial evidence in support of the theory that he and 
the victim were sweethearts. Independent proof is necessary, such as 
tokens, mementos, and photographs. It is likewise remarkable, a 
confession possibly of the bankruptcy of this theory that 
accused-appellant has not insisted on this defense in his brief, 
seemingly abandoning this line.
</p><p>We, therefore, conclude that whatever familiarity and supposed 
closeness there was between accused-appellant and the victim, is 
explained not by an intimate relationship but by their blood 
relationship. Hence, it is noticeable that on the day of the incident, 
when accused-appellant called upon the victim and the latter asked who 
he was, the victim knew right away that her caller was accused-appellant
 when the latter replied "Si Totong".
</p><p>Accused-appellant, in his direct testimony, tried to deny any 
blood relation with the victim Escelea Tabada and touched on the 
apparent friendship between them, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Q    You mentioned earlier that you know the complainant, why do you know the complainant Escelea Tabada?
  </p>
  <p>A     I only know her when I was already in jail, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q    You mean to say that you never knew the complainant before you were arrested?
  </p>
  <p>A     I do not know her, sir.
  </p>
  <p>COURT: (Questioning the witness)
  </p>
  <p>Q    Why, are you not related to the Tabadas?
  </p>
  <p>A     No, Your Honor.
  </p>
  <p>ATTY. G.V. DELA PENA III: (Continuing)
  </p>
  <p>Q    Have you ever seen the complainant in Begang?
  </p>
  <p>A     The complainant is at Begang, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q    And you mentioned that you were not related with the complainant, Mr. Witness?
  </p>
  <p>A     Yes, sir, we are only close.
  </p>
  <p>Q    So, in other words, Mr. Witness, you and the complainant Escelea Tabada were already friends?
  </p>
  <p>A     Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>(tsn, June 16, 1998, pp. 42-43.)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, on cross-examination, he notably crumbled:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Q    Now, you stated in your direct examination that you are not 
related to the Tabadas in San Antonio Begang, Isabela, Basilan, is that 
right?
  </p>
  <p>A     Yes, sir, we are only close.
  </p>
  <p>Q    Is it not a fact Mr. Witness that your mother is the first cousin of the father of Escelea Tabada?
  </p>
  <p>A     They are cousins, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q    So, indeed you are related to the Tabadas?
  </p>
  <p>A     Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q    So, when you said that you are not related to the Tabadas, you were not telling the truth?
  </p>
  <p>A     Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p align="right">(ibid, p. 51.)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. Accused-appellant argues that no actual proof was presented that 
the rape actually happened since the medico-legal officer who prepared 
the medical certificate was not presented in court to explain the same.
</p><p>In <em>People vs. Bernaldez</em> (supra), the court a quo erred 
in giving weight to the medical certificate issued by the examining 
physician despite the failure of the latter to testify. While the 
certificate could be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule since 
entries in official records (under Section 44, Rule 130, Rules of Court)
 constitute exceptions to the hearsay evidence rule, since it involved 
an opinion of one who must first be established as an expert witness, it
 could not be given weight or credit unless the doctor who issued it is 
presented in court to show his qualifications. We place emphasis on the 
distinction between admissibility of evidence and the probative value 
thereof. Evidence is admissible when it is relevant to the issue and is 
not excluded by the law or the rules (Section 3, Rule 128, Rules of 
Court) or is competent. Since admissibility of evidence is determined by
 its relevance and competence, admissibility is, therefore, an affair of
 logic and law. On the other hand, the weight to be given to such 
evidence, once admitted, depends on judicial evaluation within the 
guidelines provided in Rule 133 and the jurisprudence laid down by the 
Court. Thus, while evidence may be admissible, it may be entitled to 
little or no weight at all. Conversely, evidence which may have 
evidentiary weight may be inadmissible because a special rule forbids 
its reception (<em>Regalado</em>, Remedial Law Compendium, Vol. II, 1998 ed., p. 550).
</p><p>Withal, although the medical certificate is an exception to the 
hearsay rule, hence admissible as evidence, it has very little probative
 value due to the absence of the examining physician. Nevertheless, it 
cannot be said that the prosecution relied solely on the medical 
certificate (stating that there was "[h]ymen rupture, secondary to 
penile insertion" as well as "foul-smelling discharges." The diagnosis 
was "[r]uptured hymen secondary to rape" [p. 68, Record]). In fact, 
reliance was made on the testimony of the victim herself which, standing
 alone even without medical examination, is sufficient to convict (<em>People vs. Topaguen</em>, 369 SCRA 601 [1997]). It is well-settled that a medical examination is not indispensable in the prosecution of rape (<em>People vs. Lacaba</em>, G.R. No. 130591, November 17, 1999; <em>People vs. Salazar</em>, 258 SCRA 55 [1996]; <em>People vs. Venerable, supra</em>).
 The absence of medical findings by a medico-legal officer does not 
disprove the occurrence of rape (People vs. Taneo, supra). It is enough 
that the evidence on hand convinces the court that conviction is proper (<em>People vs. Auxtero, supra</em>). In the instant case, the victim's testimony alone is credible and sufficient to convict.
</p><p>As a final observation, it must be said that the amount awarded 
by the trial court in favor of Escelea Tabada as indemnification 
(P50,000.00 for moral damages) for the rape is incomplete based on 
established jurisprudence and must be modified. In <em>People vs. Betonio</em>
 (279 SCRA 532 [1977]), we held that the award of P50,000.00 to the 
victim as indemnity for rape not committed or qualified by any of the 
circumstances under the Death Penalty Law, needs no proof other than the
 conviction of the accused for the raped proved. This is different from 
the P50,000.00 awarded as moral damages which also needs no pleading or 
proof as basis thereof (<em>People vs. Prades</em>, 293 SCRA 411 [1998]).
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the appealed decision is hereby 
AFFIRMED, with the MODIFICATION that accused-appellant Rodegelio Turco, 
Jr. aka "Totong" is ordered to indemnify the offended party, Escelea 
Tabada, in the amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos in addition 
to the sum of P50,000.00 already awarded by the trial court as moral 
damages.
</p><p><strong>SO ORDERED.
