				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">NOEL ADVINCULA, in this petition for review, assails the 
Decision of the Court of Appeals which set aside the resolution of the Secretary 
of Justice ordering the Provincial Prosecutor of Cavite to file an Information 
for Illegal Possession of Firearms against private respondents Amando Ocampo and 
Isagani Ocampo.</p>
<p align="justify">As found by the Court of Appeals, on 1 October 1993 at around 
three o'clock in the afternoon, private respondent Isagani Ocampo was on his way 
home when petitioner Noel Advincula and two (2) of his drinking companions 
started shouting invectives at him and challenging him to a fight. Petitioner, 
armed with a bolo, ran after Isagani who was able to reach home and elude his 
attackers. Petitioner kept cursing Isagani who eventually left. A certain 
Enrique Rosas told private respondent Amando Ocampo, father of Isagani, that 
petitioner had chased his son with a bolo. Amando then got his .22 caliber gun, 
which he claimed was licensed, and confronted petitioner who continued drinking 
with his friends. But petitioner threatened to attack Amando with his bolo, thus 
prompting the latter to aim his gun upwards and fire a warning shot. Cooler 
heads intervened and Amando was pacified. He left to check on his son. Later, 
however, he saw petitioner's drinking companions firing at petitioner's 
house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner however has a different version. According to him, 
on 1 October 1993 he and his friends were having a conversation outside his 
house when Isagani passed by and shouted at them. This led to a heated argument 
between him and Isagani. Then Isagani left but returned with his father Amando 
and brother Jerry. Isagani and Amando were each armed with a gun and started 
firing at petitioner who ran home to avoid harm but private respondents Isagani 
and Amando continued shooting, hitting petitioner's residence in the 
process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">A series of criminal complaints were filed by petitioner on one 
hand and private respondents on the other. But the controversy in this petition 
arose from the complaint filed by petitioner on 5 April 1994 for Illegal 
Possession of Firearms against private respondents before the Provincial 
Prosecutor of Cavite. Petitioner's complaint was supported by his 
complaint-affidavit, the affidavit of one Federico San Miguel, photocopies of 
photographs showing bullet holes on petitioner's residence, and certification of 
the Firearms and Explosives Unit of the Philippine National Police that private 
respondents had no records in that office.</p>
<p align="justify">After private respondents submitted their counter-affidavits, 
the Assistant Provincial Prosecutor, with the approval of the Provincial 
Prosecutor, dismissed on 26 May 1994 petitioner's complaint against private 
respondents for Illegal Possession of Firearms for lack of evidence. According 
to the Provincial Prosecutor -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">After a close and careful study of the records of the instant 
case, undersigned finds and so holds that the evidence presented by the 
complainant is not sufficient to engender a well founded belief that the crime 
for Illegal Possession of Firearms has been committed and the respondents are 
probably guilty thereof. While it is true that respondent Amando Ocampo was 
possessing a gun on the date of the incident per the allegations in his 
counter-affidavit that he fired a gun upwards to prevent complainant from 
further assaulting him yet the possession of said firearm cannot be considered 
illegal or unlawful as the same is covered by a firearm license duly issued by 
the chief of the Firearm and Explosives Office.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">With respect to respondent Isagani Ocampo, no convincing 
evidence has been presented by the complainant except the allegations appearing 
in his affidavit and that of his witness which is not sufficient to establish a 
prima facie case for charging the former with Illegal Possession of Firearms. 
Even the slug depicted in the xeroxed photo copies marked as Annex "E" of the 
complaint do not show that said slugs were fired from different firearms hence 
it can be presumed that the same were fired from the gun of respondent Amando 
Ocampo an indication that during the incident, only the latter was in possession 
of a firearm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> On 21 October 1994 
petitioner filed a petition for review with the Secretary of Justice insisting 
that the pieces of evidence he presented before the Provincial Prosecutor were 
sufficient to make a <em>prima facie</em> case against private respondents and 
prayed that the dismissal of his complaint be set aside. Private respondents 
filed their opposition thereto stating in essence that Amando's gun was licensed 
and that there was no proof other than petitioner's self-serving statement that 
Isagani had carried a firearm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In his Resolution of 6 June 1996 the Secretary of Justice 
granted petitioner's appeal and ordered the Provincial Prosecutor of Cavite to 
file the corresponding charges of Illegal Possession of Firearms against private 
respondents. As the Secretary of Justice held - There is no dispute as to the 
fact that respondent Amando Ocampo, by his own admission, was in possession of a 
firearm. His defense that it was duly licensed, however, by the records of the 
Firearms and Explosives Office (FEO). Granting, however, that said firearm was 
duly licensed by the Philippine National Police, no evidence was submitted to 
prove that he is possessed of the necessary permit to carry the firearm outside 
of his residence. In other words, his possession of the firearm, while valid at 
first, became illegal the moment he carried it out of his place of abode.</p>
<p align="justify">With regard to respondent Isagani Ocampo, his bare denial 
cannot overcome his positive identification by complainant and his witnesses. 
Physical evidence, such as the bullet marks on the walls of complainant's 
residence, indeed strengthen the latter's allegation that respondents actually 
fired at him. The case was nevertheless dismissed on the ground of lack of 
evidence. This is erroneous. In cases falling under violations of PD 1866, it is 
not indispensable that the firearm used be presented in evidence as long as the 
possession and use thereof have been duly established by the testimony of 
several witnesses. (<i>People v. Jumanoy</i>, 221 SCRA 333).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On 25 June 1996, pursuant to the Resolution of the Secretary of 
Justice, the Provincial Prosecutor of Cavite filed two (2) separate Informations 
against Amando and Isagani Ocampo for Illegal Possession of Firearms before the 
Regional Trial Court of Bacoor, Cavite, docketed as Crim. Case No. B-96-141 and 
B-96-142, respectively. On 17 December 1996, private respondents filed a 
Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court with 
a prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order with the 
Court of Appeals questioning the Resolution of the Secretary of Justice.</p>
<p align="justify">In giving due course to private respondents' petition, the 
Court of Appeals agreed with the position of the Solicitor General -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">A judicious examination of the records will show that there is 
no probable cause to hail petitioners for trial for illegal possession of 
firearms.</p>
<p align="justify">The weakness of the case against petitioners is highlighted by 
the failure of the Information to allege the identity of the firearms allegedly 
possessed by petitioners at the time of the incident. No guns were seized or 
recovered from them. There is no corpus delicti. It could not therefore be 
ascertained with verisimilitude that petitioners did not have the license to 
possess or carry guns. Given the mutual recriminations which were generated by 
the incident, it would have been facile for any of the protagonists to concoct a 
charge of illegal possession of firearms against their adversary x x x x In 
crimes involving illegal possession of firearms, the prosecution has the burden 
of proving the elements thereof, viz.: The existence of the subject firearm and 
the fact that the accused who owned or possessed the firearm does not have the 
corresponding license or permit to possess the same. Negative allegation of the 
lack of a license is an essential ingredient of the offense which the 
prosecution must prove. How could the people prove beyond reasonable doubt that 
petitioners committed the offense of illegal possession of firearms when the 
firearms are not even identified with certainty x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On the basis of the evidence on record, the Court of Appeals 
granted private respondents' petition and set aside the disputed Resolution of 
the Secretary of Justice. Hence, this petition.</p>
<p align="justify">The main issue to be resolved is whether the Court of Appeals 
erred in granting private respondents' petition and in setting aside the 
Resolution of the Secretary of Justice. In determining this question, we need to 
address these questions: (a) Was there sufficient evidence to warrant the filing 
of charges for Illegal Possession of Firearms against private respondents; and 
(b) May the Court of Appeals set aside the Decision of the Secretary of Justice 
when the corresponding Information has already been filed with the trial 
court?</p>
<p align="justify">The Court of Appeals found that no charges for Illegal 
Possession of Firearms could be filed against private respondents for two (2) 
reasons: First, as to private respondent Amando Ocampo, he had the requisite 
license to possess the firearm, which was established by sufficient evidence on 
record. Second, as to private respondent Isagani Ocampo, there was no convincing 
evidence that he was in possession of a gun during the incident involving him, 
his father and petitioner, except for the eyewitness account of petitioner and 
one Federico San Miguel.</p>
<p align="justify">Indeed, the rule is well settled that in cases of Illegal 
Possession of Firearms, two (2) things must be shown to exist: (a) the existence 
of the firearm, and (b) the fact that it is not licensed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> However, it should be noted that in 
<em>People v. Ramos,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> citing 
People v. Gy Gesiong,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> this Court 
ruled: " x x x x Even if he has the license, he cannot carry the firearm outside 
his residence without legal authority therefor."</p>
<p align="justify">This ruling is obviously a reiteration of the last paragraph of 
Sec. 1 of PD 1866 -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Sec. 1. - Unlawful Manufacture, Sale, Acquisition, Disposition 
or Possession of Firearms or Ammunition or Instruments Used or Intended to be 
Used in the Manufacture of Firearms or Ammunition x x x x The penalty of 
<i>prision mayor</i> shall be imposed upon any person who shall carry any 
licensed firearm outside his residence without legal authority 
therefor.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The Secretary of Justice, in his contested Resolution, thus 
made the following findings: Even if Amando had the requisite license, there was 
no proof that he had the necessary permit to carry it outside his residence; and 
Isagani's plain denial could not overcome his positive identification by 
petitioner that he carried a firearm in assaulting him. These are findings of 
fact supported by evidence which cannot be disturbed by this Court.</p>
<p align="justify">Besides, the rulings relied upon by the Court of Appeals and 
private respondents deal with the quantum of evidence needed to convict persons 
for Illegal Possession of Firearms. This petition arose from a case which was 
still in its preliminary stages, the issue being whether there was probable 
cause to hold private respondents for trial. And probable cause, for purposes of 
filing criminal information, has been defined as such facts as are sufficient to 
engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and that 
respondent is probably guilty thereof. The determination of its existence lies 
within the discretion of the prosecuting officers after conducting a preliminary 
investigation upon complaint of an offended party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Their decisions are reviewable by the 
Secretary of Justice who may direct the filing of the corresponding information 
or to move for the dismissal of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The procedure is in no wise in the nature 
of a trial that will finally adjudicate the guilt or innocence of private 
respondents. The requisite evidence for convicting a person of the crime of 
Illegal Possession of Firearms is not needed at this point. It is enough that 
the Secretary of Justice found that the facts, as presented by both petitioner 
and private respondents, would constitute a violation of PD 1866. Hence, the 
Secretary of Justice did not commit grave abuse of discretion in directing the 
filing of criminal Informations against private respondents, and clearly, it was 
error for the Court of Appeals to grant private respondents' petition for 
certiorari.</p>
<p align="justify">The Court of Appeals also took note of the fact that 
petitioner's appeal to the Secretary of Justice was filed out of time. Per DOJ 
Circular No. 7 dated 25 January 1990, the aggrieved party has fifteen (15) days 
to appeal resolutions of, among others, the Provincial Prosecutor dismissing a 
criminal complaint. Petitioner filed his appeal four (4) months after receiving 
the Provincial Prosecutor's decision dismissing his complaint. This 
notwithstanding, the Secretary of Justice gave due course to the appeal. It can 
be surmised then that DOJ Circular No. 7, while aimed at facilitating the 
expeditious resolution of preliminary investigations, does not tie the hands of 
the Secretary of Justice if he thinks that injustice will result from the 
dismissal of the criminal complaint when there is a good ground to file it.</p>
<p align="justify">Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the Secretary of Justice was 
not able to establish probable cause to direct the Provincial Prosecutor to file 
the charges of Illegal Possession of Firearms against private respondents, the 
filing of the Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals was not the 
proper remedy for private respondents. It should be noted that when the Petition 
was filed, the Information was already filed by the Provincial Prosecutor with 
the Regional Trial Court of Bacoor, Cavite. The criminal case commenced from 
that time at its course would now be under the direction of the trial court. As 
we held in Crespo v. Mogul - <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">The preliminary investigation conducted by the fiscal for the 
purpose of determining whether a <i>prima facie</i> exists warranting the 
prosecution of the accused is terminated upon the filing of the information in 
the proper court. In turn, as above stated, the filing of said information sets 
in motion the criminal action against the accused in Court x x x x While it is 
true that the fiscal has the <i>quasi judicial</i> discretion to determine 
whether or not a criminal case should be filed in court, once the case had 
already been brought to court whatever disposition the fiscal may feel should be 
proper in the case thereafter should be addressed for the consideration of the 
Court. The only qualification is that the action of the Court must not impair 
the substantial rights of the accused, or the right of the People to due process 
of law.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Whatever irregularity in the proceedings the private parties 
may raise should be addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court which 
has already acquired jurisdiction over the case. Certiorari, being an 
extraordinary writ, cannot be resorted to when there are other remedies 
available. Private respondents could file a <em>Motion to Quash </em>the 
Information under Rule 117 of the Rules of Court, or let the trial proceed where 
they can either file a demurrer to evidence or present their evidence to 
disprove the charges against them. It is well settled that criminal prosecutions 
may not be restrained or stayed by injunction, preliminary or final, subject to 
certain exceptions, e.g., when the determination of probable cause is done with 
grave abuse of discretion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> or where a 
sham preliminary investigation was hastily conducted,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> or where it is necessary for the courts 
to do so for the orderly administration of justice or to prevent the use of the 
strong arm of the law in an oppressive and vindictive manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> None of these exceptions is present in 
the instant case. Hence, the Court of Appeals erred in granting private 
respondents' <em>Petition for Certiorari</em> and, worse, setting aside the 
Resolution of the Secretary of Justice.</p>
<p align="justify">WHEREFORE, the instant petition for review is GRANTED and the 
assailed Decision of the Court of Appeals is <strong>REVERSED.</strong> The 
Resolution dated 6 June 1996 of the Secretary of Justice is
