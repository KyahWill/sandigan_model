Diamonon against private respondent Atty. Zoilo V. de la Cruz and Sofia P. Mana-ay.<br><br>The facts of the case are the following:<br><br>Petitioner served as the National Executive Vice President of the National Congress of Unions in the Sugar Industry of the Philippines (NACUSIP) and Vice President for Luzon of the Philippine Agricultural, Commercial and Industrial Workers Union (PACIWU). <br><br>In a letter dated March 23, 1991, petitioner learned<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of his removal from the positions he held in both unions in a resolution approved during a meeting<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of the National Executive Boards of both unions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On April 22, 1991, petitioner sought<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> reconsideration of the resolution on his removal. At the same time, he initiated a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (hereafter referred to as FIRST) before the DOLE against the National President of NACUSIP and PACIWU, private respondent Atty. Zoilo V. de la Cruz, Jr., and the members of the National Executive Boards of NACUSIP and PACIWU questioning the validity of his removal from the positions he held in the two unions.<br><br>While the FIRST case was pending with the Med-Arbiter, petitioner filed on May 16, 1991 a second complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (hereafter referred to as SECOND) against private respondent Atty. Zoilo V. de la Cruz, Jr., and the National Treasurer of NACUSIP and PACIWU, Sofia P. Mana-ay. He accused them of three (3) offenses, namely: (a) wanton violation of the Constitution and By-Laws of both organizations, NACUSIP and PACIWU; (b) unauthorized and illegal disbursement of union funds of both organizations; (c) and abuse of authority as national officers of both organizations.<br><br>On August 2, 1991, an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> was issued in the FIRST case declaring that petitioner’s removal from the positions he held is null and void. Private respondents appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> this decision to the public respondent DOLE.<br><br>In view of the pendency of their appeal in the FIRST case, private respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated October 21, 1991 in the SECOND case.<br><br>In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated November 5, 1991, the Med-Arbiter dismissed the SECOND case on the ground of lack of personality of petitioner to file the complaint in view of his removal from the offices he held.<br><br>On December 27, 1991, public respondent Laguesma, acting as the then Undersecretary of DOLE, decided on the FIRST case on appeal and issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which affirmed the assailed Order dated August 2, 1991 declaring as null and void petitioner’s removal from the positions he held. <br><br>In view of the adverse Order dated November 5, 1991 dismissing the SECOND case, petitioner appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> to the public respondent DOLE. Public respondent Laguesma, issued the assailed Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated December 29, 1992, holding that petitioner’s failure to show in his complaint that the administrative remedies provided for in the constitution and by-laws of both unions, have been exhausted or such remedies are not available, was fatal to petitioner’s cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Resultantly, he affirmed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the dismissal of the complaint.<br><br>Petitioner sought<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> reconsideration of the Order dated December 29, 1992. However, public respondent in his Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> dated January 25, 1993 denied petitioner’s motion for reconsideration.<br><blockquote>Hence, this petition.<br><br>Petitioner anchors his petition on two (2) grounds, to wit: <br><br><center>"I</center><br>PUBLIC RESPONDENT HONORABLE BIENVENIDO V. LAGUESMA HAS ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT DISMISS <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[sic]</sup> THE APPEAL INTERPOSED FROM THE ORDER OF THE MED ARBITER MENESIS <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[sic]</sup> T. CRUZ, AND WHEN IT DENIED THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION ON FLIMSY GROUNDS.<br><br><center>II.</center><br>THE CASE OF THE PETITIONER IS QUITE MERITORIOUS AND TO DISREGARD THE SAME WOULD [sic] TANTAMOUNT TO WILLFULLY [sic] CLOSING OUR EYES TO AVOID SEEING AND REALIZING THE NAKED TRUTH."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner emphatically stresses that the only issue on appeal before the DOLE was petitioner’s alleged lack of personality to file the complaint. When public respondent "switched" the ground for dismissal of the complaint from "lack of personality of the [petitioner] to file the complaint" to "non-exhaustion of administrative remedies," he staunchly claims that the latter committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> For, in doing so, the challenged orders "went outside the issues and purported to adjudicate something upon which the parties were not heard."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The petition lacks merit. <br><br>Generally, an appellate court may only pass upon errors assigned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> However, this rule is not without exceptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In the following instances,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Supreme Court ruled that an appellate court is accorded a broad discretionary power to waive the lack of assignment of errors and consider errors not assigned:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><blockquote><table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">(a)</td><td width="90%" align="justify">Grounds not assigned as errors but affecting the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(b)</td><td align="justify">Matters not assigned as errors on appeal but are evidently plain or clerical errors within contemplation of law;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(c)</td><td align="justify">Matters not assigned as errors on appeal but consideration of which is necessary in arriving at a just decision and complete resolution of the case or to serve the interests of a justice or to avoid dispensing piecemeal justice;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(d)</td><td align="justify">Matters not specifically assigned as errors on appeal but raised in the trial court and are matters of record having some bearing on the issue submitted which the parties failed to raise or which the lower court ignored; Supreme</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(e)</td><td align="justify">Matters not assigned as errors on appeal but closely related to an error assigned;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(f)</td><td align="justify">Matters not assigned as errors on appeal but upon which the determination of a question properly assigned, is dependent.</td></tr></tbody></table><br></blockquote>There is no reason why this rule should not apply to administrative bodies as well, like the case before us, for the instant controversy falls squarely under the exceptions to the general rule.<br><br>In the instant case, not only did petitioner fail to comply with Section 2, Rule VIII, Book V of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Labor Code as amended<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> but also the record reveals that neither did he exhaust the remedies<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> set forth by the Constitution and by-laws of both unions. In the National Convention of PACIWU and NACUSIP held on August 10 and 11, 1991, respectively, nothing was heard of petitioner’s complaint against private respondents on the latter’s alleged unauthorized and illegal disbursement of union funds. In fact, what the National Convention resolved was to approve and adopt the resolution of the National Executive Board removing petitioner from the positions he held.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> His failure to seek recourse before the National convention on his complaint against private respondents taints his action with prematurity. Court<br><br>When the Constitution and by-laws of both unions dictated the remedy for intra-union dispute, such as petitioner’s complaint against private respondents for unauthorized or illegal disbursement of unions funds, this should be resorted to before recourse can be made to the appropriate administrative or judicial body, not only to give the grievance machinery or appeals’ body of the union the opportunity to decide the matter by itself, but also to prevent unnecessary and premature resort to administrative or judicial bodies. Thus, a party with an administrative remedy must not merely initiate the prescribed administrative procedure to obtain relief, but also pursue it to its appropriate conclusion before seeking judicial intervention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This rule clearly applies to the instant case. The underlying principle of the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies rests on the presumption that when the administrative body, or grievance machinery, as in this case, is afforded a chance to pass upon the matter, it will decide the same correctly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Petitioner’s premature invocation of public respondent’s intervention is fatal to his cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Evidently, when petitioner brought before the DOLE his complaint charging private respondents with unauthorized and illegal disbursement of union funds, he overlooked or deliberately ignored the fact that the same is clearly dismissible for non-exhaustion of administrative remedies. Thus, public respondent Bienvenido E. Laguesma, in dismissing petitioner’s complaint, committed no grave abuse of discretion.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is hereby <strong>DISMISSED</strong>, and the twin Orders dated December 29, 1992 and January 25, 1993 by public respondent Bienvenido E. Laguesma affirming dismissal of the complaint dated May 15, 1991 filed by petitioner against private respondents are <strong>AFFIRMED</strong>.
