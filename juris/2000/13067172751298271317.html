				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This Petition for Review on Certiorari seeks the reversal of the Resolution of the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>&nbsp; in CA G.R. SP No. 41985<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>&nbsp; dated January 29, 1999 which reversed and set aside its Decision dated January 30, 1998 ordering the reinstatement of Jonathan Barquin.<br><br>The following facts are undisputed:<br><blockquote>“The Philippine Carpet Employees Association (Union for brevity) is the certified sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent of all rank and file employees in Philippine Carpet Manufacturing Corporation, a local company engaged in the business of carpet and rug making. Jonathan Barquin is a union member who was hired by the company as casual worker (janitor) on July 15, 1995. Seven months later, on January 27, 1996, he was extended a probationary employment, as a helper in the Company’s weaving department.<br><br>On January 16, 1996, the Regional Tripartite Productivity Board (NCR) promulgated Wage Order No. 4 and 4-A granting a two-tier increase in the minimum wage as follows: (a) P16.00 effective February 2, 1996; and (b) P4.00 effective May 1, 1996.<br><br>On February 29, 1996, the Union wrote the company and its officers, asking for an across-the-board implementation of Wage Order No. 4 and 4-A. In the said letter, the Union invoked the Company’s ‘decades old practice of implementing wage orders across-the-board to all rank and file employees.<br><br>In a letter dated March 14, 1996, the company refused to grant the Union’s request on the ground that the company is suffering from poor business situation; that all the present workers/employees are earning above P145.00/day, hence, not covered by Wage Order No. 4 and 4-A.<br><br>On March 18, 1996, the Union reiterated its demand for an across-the-board implementation, threatening legal action against the company in the event that the said demand is denied.<br><br>In a memorandum dated March 29, 1996, the Company reiterated its position that the employees are not covered by Wage order No. 4 and 4-A for the reason that nobody in the company is receiving a salary of P145.00 a day.<br><br>In the meantime, Jonathan Barquin received a notice dated March 14, 1996 from the company, advising him that his services were to be terminated effective at the close of working hours on April 13, 1996. In lieu of the 30-day notice requirement for his termination, he was placed on forced leave status effective March 15, 1996 but was paid in full for the duration of the said leave. The company justified Baquin’s separation from the service as a valid act of retrenchment. While the Union averred that the separation is tantamount to illegal dismissal resorted to by the company to avoid compliance with the provisions of Wage Order 4 and 4-A.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </blockquote>Failing to resolve the issues in the mediation level, the parties agreed to submit the case for voluntary arbitration. On August 3, 1996, the voluntary arbitrator, Angelita Alberto-Gacutan ruled that Jonathan Barquin (BARQUIN) was hastily dismissed to avoid compliance with Wage Order Nos. 4 and 4-A, but held that he is not entitled to reinstatement because he received his separation pay and voluntarily signed the Deed of Release and Quitclaim and acquiesced to his separation. The dispositive portion of the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the voluntary arbitrator reads:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, herein Voluntary Arbitrator renders judgment ordering Respondents: <br><br>1. To pay the minimum wage to those receiving P145.00 a day or below the minimum wage of P161.00 as of February 2, 1996.<br><br>2. To pay Jonathan Barquin a salary differential based on the wage increase as of February 2, 1996 up to his separation from the service on April 13, 1996.<br><br>3. To apply the formula prescribed under section 11, Wage Order No. 4 and 4-A, thereby avoiding the possible distortion in the wage structure of the employees.<br><br>SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </blockquote>Motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> was denied prompting both the petitioners and the respondents to appeal to the Court of Appeals assailing the decision of the voluntary arbitrator. On January 30, 1998, the Court of Appeals ruled that the respondent company failed to prove actual poor financial condition as just cause for retrenchment nor prove that BARQUIN voluntarily signed the quitclaim; thus the court affirmed with modification the decision of the voluntary arbitrator and ordered BARQUIN’s reinstatement as follows:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the appealed Resolution is hereby AFFIRMED with modification that Jonathan Barquin shall be reinstated with payment of full backwages and other benefits and privileges from the time he was dismissed up to actual reinstatement.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>A motion for reconsideration filed by private respondent was partly granted; the Court of Appeals reconsidered its earlier decision and set aside the order of reinstatement of BARQUIN, on the ground that BARQUIN had the burden to prove that his execution of the Deed of Release and Quitclaim was involuntary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; The Resolution of the Court of Appeals states:<br><blockquote>“Accordingly, the motion for reconsideration is partly granted. Our Decision is hereby partly reconsidered by setting aside the reinstatement of Jonathan Barquin.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </blockquote>Motion for reconsideration of this last Resolution filed by the herein petitioners was denied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; for lack of merit; hence this present appeal wherein the petitioners state the issue as: “whether there being a finding of illegal dismissal by the voluntary arbitrator and the Court of Appeals, the relief of reinstatement follows as a matter of law as provided by Article 279 of the Labor Code and jurisprudence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; The following arguments are raised in support of the petition.<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>A</b><br></div><b><br>THE DECISION OF THE HON.

NO. 96982, SEPT. 21, 1999 (THIRD DIVISION).</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </blockquote>The only issue posed now concerns the reinstatement of BARQUIN. In essence, the petitioners maintain that since both the voluntary arbitrator and the Court of Appeals found that petitioner, BARQUIN, was illegally dismissed, he is entitled to reinstatement as a matter of right pursuant to Article 279 of the Labor Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; The petitioners also contend that contrary to the finding of both the Court of Appeals and the voluntary arbitrator, BARQUIN did not voluntarily sign the Deed of Release and Quitclaim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; It was the fact that the respondent company misled him into signing said deed by leading him to believe in bad faith that there was a valid retrenchment, which made him sign the quitclaim. Petitioners further argue that at any rate, quitclaims are not favored in this jurisdiction and it is incumbent upon the employer to prove voluntariness; that by signing the quitclaim and by accepting separation pay to tide him over while pursuing the case, BARQUIN did not renounce any right nor will the signing of the quitclaim prevent him from pursuing his case.<br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, maintain that the finding of both the voluntary arbitrator and the Court of Appeals that BARQUIN freely and voluntarily signed and executed the Deed of Release and Quitclaim is a factual finding which is conclusive and should be given great weight and respect by this Court. Moreover, the respondents claim that the consideration therein was a fair and full settlement of the amount legally due to BARQUIN who never alleged that he was physically threatened or intimidated into signing the quitclaim.<br><br>In essence, the petitioners’ position is that as a consequence of a finding that BARQUIN’s dismissal was illegal as he was misled by the company into believing that there was a valid retrenchment, which representation made him sign the quitclaim, he is entitled to reinstatement and backwages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; The respondent company, on the other hand, points out that the crux of the controversy boils down to the resolution of the issue of the validity of the Deed of Release and Quitclaim signed by BARQUIN, and both the voluntary arbitrator and the Court of Appeals ruled that it was freely and intelligently signed by him.<br><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>It is not disputed that the respondent company was guilty of illegal dismissal in terminating BARQUIN’s employment. As a rule, an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to 1) either reinstatement or separation pay if reinstatement is no longer viable, and 2) backwages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In holding that although BARQUIN was illegally dismissed he was not entitled to reinstatement, both the Court of Appeals and the voluntary arbitrator upheld the validity of the Deed of Release and Quitclaim that BARQUIN signed after concluding that he voluntarily signed the same for the reason that the respondent company did not coerce or intimidate him into signing and receiving his separation pay, and consequently ruled that he waived his right to reinstatement. The Court of Appeals added that the burden of proof to show that the quitclaim was signed and executed involuntarily is on the party who assails it inasmuch as a person is presumed to intend the consequences of his voluntary act and that a person takes ordinary care of his concerns and that private transactions have been fair and regular.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; Respondents posit that such a factual finding is conclusive upon this Court.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>The validity of quitclaims executed by laborers has long been recognized in this jurisdiction. In <i>Periquet vs. National Labor Relations Commission</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> , this Court ruled that not all waivers and quitclaims are invalid as against public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; If the agreement was voluntarily entered into and represents a reasonable settlement of the claims of the employee, it is binding on the parties and may not later be disowned simply because of a change of mind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Such legitimate waivers resulting from voluntary settlements of laborer’s claims should be treated and upheld as the law between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; However, when as in this case, the voluntariness of the execution of the quitclaim or release is put into issue, then the claim of employee may still be given due course.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; The law looks with disfavor upon quitclaims and releases by employees pressured into signing the same by unscrupulous employers minded to evade legal responsibilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In the present case, both the Court of Appeals and the voluntary arbitrator erred in concluding that BARQUIN voluntarily signed the Deed of Release and Quitclaim. Records reveal that the respondent company informed BARQUIN that his services were being terminated on the ground of retrenchment as the company was constrained to reduce the number of its personnel “due to the tremendous drop of production output since about the last quarter of 1994 up to the present”.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; However, this claim was rejected by both the voluntary arbitrator and the Court of Appeals, which ruled that the respondent company failed to prove that it was suffering from actual poor financial condition and that it was “doubtful if the retrenchment of one helper in the production department earning P145.00 a day would avert losses of the company”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; Instead, the voluntary arbitrator found that the respondent company had an ulterior motive behind BARQUIN’s dismissal and that only he was singled out and retrenched by the respondent company. The voluntary arbitrator went as far as saying that BARQUIN’s hasty dismissal in the guise of retrenchment was a feeble attempt at circumventing the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp; It was shown that BARQUIN was the only employee earning P145.00 a day and was qualified to receive the mandated wage increase granted by Wage Order Nos. 4 and 4-A. An increase in his salary would cause a wage distortion in the wage structure of the company, which would necessitate the adjustment of the wages of its other employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; It is therefore reversible error to hold, despite such findings, that BARQUIN voluntarily signed the quitclaim for the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that the respondent company feigned that it was suffering business losses in order to justify retrenchment and consequently enable it to terminate the services of BARQUIN in order to prevent the wage distortion. Respondent company’s lack of candor and good faith in informing BARQUIN that he was being terminated due to a valid retrenchment and not because it sought to avoid compliance with the mandated wage increases amounted to a deception which led BARQUIN to the mistaken belief that that there was legal ground for retrenchment and prompted him to acquiesce to his termination and sign the quitclaim. Petitioners correctly point out that such an act has been declared by this Court in the case of <i>Trendline Employees Association-Southern Philippines Federation of Labor vs. NLRC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; as tainted with bad faith and should not be countenanced as being prejudicial and oppressive to labor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>&nbsp; Verily, had the respondent company not misled BARQUIN into believing that there was a ground to retrench, it is not difficult to believe that he would have thought twice before signing the quitclaim inasmuch there was no reason for the termination of his employment.<br><br>Contrary to the assumption of both the Court of Appeals and the voluntary arbitrator, the mere fact that BARQUIN was not physically coerced or intimidated does not necessarily imply that he freely or voluntarily consented to the terms of the quitclaim. Under Article 1330 of the Civil Code, consent may be vitiated not only through intimidation or violence but also by <i>mistake</i>, undue influence or <i>fraud</i>. Mistake may invalidate consent when it refers to the substance of the thing which is the object of the contract or to those conditions which have principally moved one or both parties to enter into contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> ; there is fraud when, through insidious words or machinations of one of the contracting parties, the other is induced to enter into a contract which, without them, he would not have agreed to.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Moreover, as correctly pointed out by the petitioners, this Court has ruled in <i>Salonga vs. National Labor Relations Commisison</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; that it is the employer (respondent company) and not BARQUIN who has the burden of proving that the quitclaim was voluntarily entered into by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; The Court of Appeals therefore erred in ruling that the burden of proof to show that the Deed of Release and Quitclaim was signed and executed voluntarily was on BARQUIN.<br><br>BARQUIN’s consent to the quitclaim cannot be deemed as being voluntarily and freely given inasmuch as his consent was vitiated by mistake or fraud, we have no recourse but to annul the same. There being no valid quitclaim, BARQUIN is entitled to receive the benefits granted an employee whose dismissal on the ground of retrenchment is declared illegal. BARQUIN is therefore entitled to reinstatement to his former position without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, as there is no evidence to show that reinstatement is no longer possible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>&nbsp; He is also entitled to backwages computed from the time of his dismissal up to the time of actual reinstatement, without qualification or deduction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; However, the amount BARQUIN received as separation pay if any when he signed the Deed of Release and Quitclaim should be deducted from this monetary award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> the instant petition is <b>GRANTED</b> and the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA G.R.
