				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p>This damage suit arose from a collision of vehicles based on the following 
facts: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(O)n May 10, 1992, at around 12:00 o'clock midnight, Eduardo Edem<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> was driving a "Luring Taxi" along Ortigas 
Avenue, near Rosario, Pasig, going towards Cainta. Prior to the collision, the 
taxicab was parked along the right side of Ortigas Avenue, not far from the 
Rosario Bridge, to unload a passenger. Thereafter, the driver executed a U-turn 
to traverse the same road, going to the direction of EDSA. At this point, the 
Nissan Pathfinder traveling along the same road going to the direction of Cainta 
collided with the taxicab. The point of impact was so great that the taxicab was 
hit in the middle portion and was pushed sideward, causing the driver to lose 
control of the vehicle. The taxicab was then dragged into the nearby Question 
Tailoring Shop, thus, causing damage to the said tailoring shop, and its driver, 
Eduardo Eden, sustained injuries as a result of the incident."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>Private respondent, as owner of the taxi, filed a damage suit against 
petitioner, Thermochem Incorporated, as the owner of the Nissan Pathfinder, and 
its driver, petitioner Jerome Castro. After trial, the lower court adjudged 
petitioner Castro negligent and ordered petitioners, jointly and severally, to 
pay private respondent actual, compensatory and exemplary damages plus 
attorney's fees and costs of suit. The dispositive portion of the Decision of 
the Regional Trial Court, Branch 150 of Makati City dated September 25, 1995, 
reads: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the 
defendants, jointly and severally, to pay plaintiff the following: 
</p></blockquote>
<ol><li>The amount of P47,850.00 as actual damages; <br><br>
</li><li>The amount of P45,000.00 as compensatory damages for unrealized 
income;<br><br>
</li><li>The amount of P10,000.00 as exemplary damages;<br><br>
</li><li>The amount of P10,000.00 as and for attorney's fees; and<br><br>
</li><li>Cost of suit. </li></ol>
<blockquote>
<p>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the court <em>a 
quo</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Hence, this petition for 
review on certiorari. The petition was denied on February 2, 1998 for failure to 
submit an explanation why no personal service of copies of certain pleadings was 
made as required by Rule 13, Section 11 of the 1997 Rules of Civil 
Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Upon petitioners' motion 
for reconsideration, the petition was reinstated and private respondent was 
required to file her Comment in a Resolution dated June 22, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> A copy of the said Resolution was sent by 
registered mail to private respondent's counsel but the same was returned to 
sender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In a separate Resolution 
issued on the same date, this Court ordered that a copy of the June 22, 1998 
Resolution be served personally on private respondent's counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> As the said Resolution was also returned 
unserved, "the Court Resolved to consider the said Resolution as SERVED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> After more than a year, no Comment has 
been filed. Considering that private respondent was given only ten (10) days to 
file her Comment, that period had already lapsed ten days after the June 23, 
1999 Resolution which stated that the June 22, 1998 resolution as "served".</p>
<p>Service of notice or other pleadings which are required by the rules to be 
furnished to the parties must be made on their last address on record. If they 
are represented by counsel, such notices shall be sent instead to the counsel's 
last given address on record in the absence of a proper and adequate notice to 
the court of a change of address,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
unless service upon the party himself is ordered by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> It is the party and his counsel's 
responsibility to device a system for the receipt of mail intended for them<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> just as it is the duty of counsel to 
inform the court of a change in his address. In the case at bar, private 
respondent's counsel never notified the Court of any change of his address or 
whether he no longer holds office in his last address of record. Neither was the 
Court informed if his ties with his client has been severed. Insofar as the 
Court is concerned, the last address on record is the place where all notices 
shall be served until the Court is officially informed to the contrary. What is 
the effect of the failure of a private respondent to comply with a court order 
to file Comment?</p>
<p>Courts are given the option to dispense with the filing of the Comment and 
consider the case as deemed submitted for decision. Under Rule 46, Section 7 of 
the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
when the respondent in an original action filed with the court fails to file its 
comment, the case may be decided on the basis of the evidence on record without 
prejudice to disciplinary action against the disobedient party. Concomitant 
thereto is the rule that pursuant to Rule 51, Section 1(B)(1),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> where no comment is filed upon the 
expiration of the period to comment in an original action or a petition for 
review, the case shall be deemed submitted for decision. Both provisions are 
applicable to a petition for review filed with the Supreme Court as provided in 
Rule 56, Section 2(a) of the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> 
Moreover, a lawyer who fails to submit the required Comment manifests willful 
disobedience to a lawful order of the Supreme Court, a clear violation of the 
Canon of Professional Ethics.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Counsel 
must remember that his actions and omissions are binding on his client.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> He should not neglect legal matters 
entrusted to him as his negligence therefrom shall render him liable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p>
<p>The petition lacks merit. The issue of whether a party is negligent is a 
question of fact. It is a time-honored precept that the Supreme Court is not a 
trier of facts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> although it has 
authority to review and reverse factual findings of lower courts if these do not 
conform to evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> It is also 
settled that findings of fact of the trial court, particularly when affirmed by 
the Court of Appeals, is binding on the Supreme Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and generally conclusive,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> especially if it has not been adequately 
shown that no significant facts and circumstances were overlooked or disregarded 
which when considered would have altered the outcome of the disposition. </p>
<p>The driver of the oncoming Nissan Pathfinder vehicle was liable and the 
driver of the U-turning taxicab was contributorily liable. Contrary to 
petitioners' contention, the fact that a party had no opportunity to avoid the 
collision is of his own making and this should not relieve him of liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> From petitioner Castro's testimonial 
admissions, it is established that he was driving at a speed faster than 50 
kilometers per hour because it was a downhill slope coming from the Rosario 
bridge. But as he allegedly stepped on the brake, it locked causing his Nissan 
Pathfinder to skid to the left and consequently hit the taxicab. The sudden 
malfunction of the vehicle's brake system is the usual excuse of drivers 
involved in collisions which are the result of speedy driving, particularly when 
the road is downhill. </p>
<p>Malfunction or loss of brake is not a fortuitous event. Between the owner and 
his driver, on the one hand, and third parties such as commuters, drivers and 
pedestrians, on the other, the former is presumed to know about the conditions 
of his vehicle and is duty bound to take care thereof with the diligence of a 
good father of the family. A mechanically defective vehicle should avoid the 
streets. As petitioner's vehicle was moving downhill, the driver should have 
slowed down since a downhill drive would naturally cause the vehicle to 
accelerate. Moreover, the record shows that the Nissan Pathfinder was on the 
wrong lane when the collision occurred. This was a disregard of traffic safety 
rules. The law considers what would be reckless, blameworthy or negligent in a 
man of ordinary diligence and prudence and determines liability by that.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Even assuming arguendo that loss of 
brakes is an act of God, by reason of their negligence, the fortuitous event 
became humanized, rendering the Nissan driver liable for the ensuing 
damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the driver of the taxi is contributorily liable. 
U-turns are not generally advisable particularly on major streets. The taxi was 
hit on its side which means that it had not yet fully made a turn to the other 
lane. The driver of the taxi ought to have known that vehicles coming from the 
Rosario bridge are on a downhill slope. Obviously, there was lack of foresight 
on his part, making him contributorily liable. Most public utility drivers 
disregard signs and traffic rules especially during the night when traffic 
enforcers manning the streets disappear with the light. In driving vehicles, the 
primary concern should be the safety not only of the driver or his passengers, 
but also his fellow motorists. </p>
<p>Considering the contributory negligence of the driver of private respondent's 
taxi, the award of P47,850.00, for the repair of the taxi, should be reduced in 
half. All other awards for damages are deleted for lack of merit. </p>
<p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> based on the foregoing, the assailed decision is 
<strong>MODIFIED.</strong> Petitioners are ordered to pay, jointly and 
severally, to private respondent the amount of P23,925.00 as actual damages. All 
other awards are <strong>DELETED</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.</p>
