				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p>The prosecution of offenses committed by public officers is vested in the 
Office of the Ombudsman. To insulate the Office from outside pressure and 
improper influence, the Constitution as well as RA 6770 has endowed it with a 
wide latitude of investigatory and prosecutory powers virtually free from 
legislative, executive or judicial intervention. This Court consistently 
refrains from interfering with the exercise of its powers, and respects the 
initiative and independence inherent in the Ombudsman who, "beholden to no one, 
acts as the champion of the people and the preserver of the integrity of public 
service."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p>This <i>Petition for Certiorari</i> under Rule 65 seeks to annul and set 
aside for having been rendered with grave abuse of discretion the <i>Orders</i> 
dated 2 June 1998 and 14 August 1998 issued by Special Prosecution Officer II 
Cicero D. Jurado Jr. and approved by the Ombudsman. The first <i>Order</i> 
recommended the dismissal of the criminal case and the withdrawal of the 
<i>Information</i> against respondents Joselito Ojeda, Jesus Pollante Sr. and 
Sergio Asia for violation of Sec. 3, par. (e) of RA 3019, <i>The Anti-Graft and 
Corrupt Practices Act</i>, and the second <i>Order </i>recommended the dismissal 
of petitioners' <i>Motion for Reconsideration/Motion to Reopen 
Reinvestigation</i>.</p>
<p>Petitioners Emerenciano Espinosa, Fernandito Baronia, Bonifacio Belen and 
Lydia Ramos were all members of the Sangguniang Bayan of Mulanay, Quezon 
Province, while private respondent Joselito Ojeda was Mayor, private respondent 
Jesus Pollante Sr. was Municipal Treasurer and private respondent Sergio Asia 
was Private Secretary of the Mayor, all of the municipality of Mulanay, Quezon 
Province, when the antecedents of the instant case transpired.</p>
<p>On 1 September 1992 a certain Anita Bariata, employed as Revenue Collection 
Clerk II in the Municipality of Mulanay, wrote respondent Mayor Ojeda requesting 
permission to continue her studies and be a degree holder. Her request bore the 
handwritten approval of respondent Municipal Treasurer Jesus Pollante Sr., then 
her immediate superior, with the <i>proviso</i> that Bariata should attend to 
her classes after the usual civil service prescribed office hours.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p>Respondent Mayor Ojeda approved the request in an <i>Office Order</i> which 
stated that Bariata was to be "temporarily stationed at Lucena City" and was 
further instucted to coordinate all her official activities with respondent 
Sergio Asia, the Mayor's private secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p>
<p>Bariata then enrolled in the College of Business Administration of the Manuel 
S. Enverga University Foundation (MSEUF) in Lucena City and was a student there 
starting the second semester of school year 1992-1993 until the first semester 
of school year 1994-1995, as certified to by the Dean of the University.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<p>On 8 December 1992, during a meeting attended by Members of the Sangguniang 
Bayan of Mulanay, as well as department heads of the municipal government in the 
Office of the Mayor, petitioner Emerenciano Espinosa brought to the attention of 
respondent Mayor Ojeda what he perceived to be an anomalous situation, 
<i>i.e</i>., that Revenue Collection Clerk II Bariata continued to be a 
monthly-paid employee of the Mulanay municipal government despite the fact that 
she was a full-time student in Lucena City. To support his allegation, 
petitioner Espinosa produced the Daily Time Records of Bariata, duly certified 
by respondent Asia, showing that she had been reporting for work in Mulanay, 
Quezon, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily from Monday to Friday, and for which 
she was paid the monthly salary of P1,823.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p>
<p>Not satisfied with respondents' explanations, petitioners as Concerned 
Citizens of Mulanay, Quezon, filed with the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for 
Luzon a criminal and administrative <i>Complaint</i> against respondents Mayor 
Joselito Ojeda, Vice Mayor Meliton O. Baronia, Municipal Treasurer Jesus 
Pollante Sr., Secretary to the Mayor Sergio Asia, and Revenue Collection Clerk 
II Anita Bariata for "malversation, falsification of documents, graft and 
corrupt practices and other crimes in connection with acts they committed and 
continue to commit, in their official capacities, and by taking advantage of the 
same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> It was the contention of 
petitioners that since Anita Bariata was regularly attending classes at the 
MSEUF in Lucena City, it would have been impossible for her to have fulfilled 
her duties as Revenue Collection Clerk II in Mulanay. They noted that travel 
time between Lucena City and Mulanay was at least six (6) hours one way. Hence, 
the amounts given to her as her salary were in the nature of illegal 
disbursements which "defraud(ed) and deprive(d) the government of its property, 
in the process giving undue advantage to an individual to the prejudice of the 
public in general." </p>
<p>On 26 April 1996 respondent Ojeda submitted a <i>Counter-Affidavit</i> 
setting forth his defenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> He 
presented the <i>Office Order</i> which he issued, dated 26 October 1992, 
ordering Bariata to be temporarily stationed in Lucena City. He also presented 
Bariata's letter requesting him to allow her to continue her studies which was 
endorsed favorably by respondent Municipal Treasurer Pollante, Sr., "provided 
that the said studies (would) be done after the CSC prescribed office hours." 
</p>
<p>On 27 November 1997 the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, through 
Graft Investigation Officer Lourdes Alarilla, issued a resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> finding a <i>prima facie</i> case against 
respondents Ojeda, Pollante Sr. and Asia, and recommending the filing of an 
Information before the Sandiganbayan against them for violation of Sec. 3, par. 
(e) of RA 3019 which was approved by the Ombudsman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Respondent Vice Mayor Baronia was 
exonerated on the ground that, as found by the Graft Investigation Officer, 
Baronia's signing of the questioned payrolls was done in good faith and that he 
was not part of the conspiracy to defraud the government. But, as regards Mayor 
Joselito Ojeda, Municipal Treasurer Jesus Pollante Sr. and Secretary Sergio 
Asia, the corresponding Information was filed against them on 3 February 1998 
and docketed as Crim. Case No. 24432 of the Fifth Division of the Sandiganbayan. 
Respondents moved for reconsideration but their motion was denied on 28 April 
1998.</p>
<p>Before they could be arraigned, respondents filed with the Sandiganbayan 
(Fifth Division) a <i>Motion for Reinvestigation</i> purportedly in light of new 
evidence to be presented. They submitted certifications from Bariata's 
professors at the MSEUF indicating that she had made "special arrangements" with 
them to the effect that she would make up or attend tutorial sessions in lieu of 
regular classes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The ensuing 
reinvestigation resulted in the assailed <i>Order </i>of 2 June 1998 issued by 
Special Prosecution Officer II Cicero D. Jurado Jr., approved by Ombudsman 
Aniano A. Desierto, recommending the dismissal of the case and the withdrawal of 
the Information against respondents. The Order cited <i>Santiago v. 
Garchitorena</i> where the Court declared that there were "two (2) ways of 
violating Sec. 3, par. (e) of RA 3019: 1) causing any undue injury to any party, 
including the government; and, 2) by giving any private party any unwarranted 
benefit, advantage or preference." Since the certifications from the professors 
of Bariata proved that Bariata did not attend classes on working days in view of 
their special arrangements, her salaries could not be considered irregular 
disbursements and, consequently, the government did not suffer any undue injury. 
In the absence of this element, the accused cannot be indicted or prosecuted for 
breach of Sec. 3, par. (e), of RA 3019.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p>
<p>Petitioners filed a <i>Motion for Reconsideration/Motion to Reopen 
Reinvestigation</i> which was denied in the second assailed <i>Order</i> of 4 
August 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On 15 October 1998 the 
Sandiganbayan (Fifth Division) granted the withdrawal of the Information on 
motion of Special Prosecution Officer II Jurado Jr.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Hence this recourse.</p>
<p>The issues in the instant petition can be summed up into whether the 
Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction 
when he approved the Orders of Special Prosecution Officer II Jurado Jr. which 
reversed an earlier resolution by Graft Investigation Officer II Alarilla 
recommending the filing of a criminal case against respondents on the basis of 
new evidence presented during the reinvestigation.</p>
<p>First, the ground rules. This Court has consistently held that the courts 
will not interfere with the discretion of the fiscal or the Ombudsman in 
prosecuting or dismissing a complaint filed before him, absent a clear case of 
grave abuse of his discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p>
<p>The rule is based not only upon constitutional considerations but upon 
practical ones as well. If it were otherwise, the courts would be gravely 
hampered by innumerable petitions questioning the dismissal of investigatory 
proceedings before the Ombudsman, in much the same way that the courts would be 
swamped if they would be compelled to review the exercise of discretion on the 
part of our prosecutors each time they decide to file an information in court or 
throw out a complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p>
<p>In resolving the issues before us we are once again reminded of the duties of 
the prosecutor in the prosecution of criminal cases, so aptly stated in <i>Cruz, 
Jr. v. People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main function of the government prosecutor during the preliminary 
investigation is merely to determine the existence of probable cause, and to 
file the corresponding information if he finds it to be so. And, probable cause 
has been defined as the existence of such facts and circumstances as would 
excite the belief, in a reasonable mind, acting on the facts within the 
knowledge of the prosecutor, that the person charged was guilty of the crime for 
which he was prosecuted.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the duty of a government prosecutor to prosecute crimes does not 
preclude him from refusing to file an information when he believes there is no 
<i>prima facie</i> evidence to do so. Thus in <i>Zulueta v. Nicolas</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fiscal has for sure the legal duty to prosecute crimes where there is 
enough evidence to justify such action. But it is equally his duty not to 
prosecute when after an investigation he has become convinced that the evidence 
available is not enough to sustain a <i>prima facie </i>case. The fiscal is not 
bound to accept the opinion of the complainant in a criminal case as to whether 
or not a <i>prima facie</i> case exists. Vested with authority to determine 
whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the filing of the corresponding 
information, and having control of the prosecution of the criminal case, the 
fiscal cannot be subjected to the dictation of the offended party (<i>emphasis 
supplied</i>).</p></blockquote>
<p>The Office of the Ombudsman has the sole power to "investigate and prosecute 
on its own or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any public 
officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears to be 
illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The Court has refused to interfere with 
the Office of the Ombudsman in disapproving the findings of its special 
prosecutors,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> promulgating its own 
rules of procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> summarily 
dismissing complaints without going through preliminary investigation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> issuing orders without giving parties a 
prior oral hearing,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and even 
dismissing criminal cases filed against "a series of nine City Prosecutors who 
tossed the responsibility of conducting a preliminary investigation to each 
other with contradictory recommendations, '<i>ping-pong</i>' style,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> among others.</p>
<p>The Court will likewise refuse to intervene in the instant case. The power to 
withdraw the Information already filed is a mere adjunct or consequence of the 
Ombudsman's overall power to prosecute. It is subject, of course, to the 
approval of the Sandiganbayan. As with any other criminal case, once the same 
has been filed with the court, it is that court, and no longer the prosecution, 
which has full control of the case so much so that the information may not be 
dismissed without the approval of that court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Consequently, it is important to note 
that in the case at bar the Sandiganbayan, through its Fifth Division, gave such 
an approval, contained in its 15 October 1998 Resolution.</p>
<p>Anent petitioners' contention that they were deprived of due notice at the 
reinvestigation, we note that the Sandiganbayan found that "complainants 
actually received copy of the prosecution's <i>Motion to Withdraw 
Information</i>." The same notwithstanding, complainants did not submit any 
evidence refuting the veracity of the Enverga University certifications 
<i>other</i> than the observation that -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There would not have been any necessity for Ms. Bariata to be assigned in 
Lucena City if she were going to attend her classes on Saturdays. She could have 
worked in Mulanay, Quezon and go to Lucena every weekend to attend her 
classes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>We see no reason to disturb such findings. And even without such notice, we 
agree with the observations of the Sandiganbayan that "under the Rules of 
Procedures of the Office of the Ombudsman (Administrative Order No. 07), 
particularly Sec. 7, in relation to Sec. 4, while complainants in preliminary 
investigation before the Ombudsman actively participated therein, their 
participation is no longer accorded to them as a matter of right in the stage of 
the reinvestigation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In 
administrative proceedings, moreover, technical rules of procedure and evidence 
are not strictly applied; administrative due process cannot be fully equated 
with due process in its strict judicial sense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p>
<p>To repeat, it is well-settled that in the absence of a clear case of abuse of 
discretion, courts will not interfere with the discretion of the Ombudsman, who, 
depending on his finding and considered evaluation of the case, either dismisses 
a complaint or proceeds with it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p>
<p>Petitioners attempt to bring the case within the exception to the general 
rule of non-interference with the powers of the Ombudsman. In their 
<i>Consolidated Reply</i>, they argued that "(they) are not questioning the 
authority and discretion of Public Respondent to resolve cases brought before it 
for investigation. What they question is the manner in which Public Respondent 
exercised that discretion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p>
<p>According to petitioners, the Ombudsman's grave abuse of discretion lies in 
his failure to consider the contradictory nature of the evidence presented by 
respondents. The conflicting evidence referred to are: (a) the 
<i>Counter-Affidavit </i>presented by Mayor Joselito Ojeda in the preliminary 
investigation where he asserted that Bariata was transferred from the Office of 
the Municipal Treasurer to the Office of the Mayor and assigned to Lucena City 
where she was allowed to attend classes "subject to the condition that her 
studies (would) be done only after office hours;" and, (b) the <i>Affidavits</i> 
of five (5) professors explaining the "special arrangements" with Bariata where 
she was allowed to attend make-up classes on weekends.</p>
<p>In their Memorandum, petitioners assert that "it is obvious that Public 
Respondent failed to compare the two sets of evidence or to even consider the 
first set submitted during the preliminary investigation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p>
<p>In raising this point, petitioners would have the Court review findings of 
fact made by the Ombudsman through Special Prosecution Officer II Jurado Jr. To 
consider their arguments will necessarily entail a review of the Ombudsman's 
appreciation of the facts. This is, to quote a case, "a mere desperate attempt 
to lure this Court into reviewing the factual findings of the Office of the 
Ombudsman."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Petitioners are well 
aware that the Court is not a trier of facts, more so in the consideration of 
the extraordinary writ of certiorari where neither questions of fact nor even of 
law are entertained, but only questions of lack or excess of jurisdiction or 
grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p>
<p>On the other hand, findings of fact by the Office of the Ombudsman when 
supported by substantial evidence are conclusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Absent a clear showing of grave abuse of 
discretion, we shall not disturb such findings. There is no reason to do so in 
this case.</p>
<p><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <strong>DISMISSED</strong> there being no 
showing that the assailed <i>Orders</i> of 2 June 1998 and 14 August 1998 of 
Special Prosecution Officer II Cicero D. Jurado Jr., and approved by the 
Ombudsman, were issued in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess 
of jurisdiction.</p>
