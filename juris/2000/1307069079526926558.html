However, in the same letter, Victorino was advised to advise his supplier "to proceed (with) production pending frequency information." Victorino was also assured of Guerrero's financial capability to comply with the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> On October 6, 1972, Guerrero informed Aligada of the frequency number<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> assigned by Subic Naval Base authorities. Aligada was instructed to "proceed with the order thru Spectrum Electronics Laboratories."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p> On October 7, 1972, Aligada informed Magat of the assigned frequency number. Aligada also advised Victorino to "proceed with the order upon receipt of letter of credit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> On January 10, 1973, Guerrero applied for a letter of credit with the Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; This application was not pursued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> On March 27, 1973, Victorino, represented by his lawyer, Atty.

Should the contract be canceled, the Japanese firm would forfeit 30% of the deposit and charge a cancellation fee in an amount not yet known, Guerrero to bear the loss.

Stated differently, whether the transceivers subject of the contract were banned/ contraband items prohibited by the LOI and the Administrative Circular to import. </strong>&nbsp; </p><p> The contract was valid; the radio transceivers were not contraband. </p><p> "Contraband" generally refers to "any property which is unlawful to produce or possess." It refers to goods which are exported and imported into a country against its laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> </p><p> In declaring the contract void <em>ab initio</em>, the Court of Appeals ruled that the importation of the transceivers meant the inevitable passing of such goods through Philippine Ports, where the LOI and the Administrative Circular have to be observed and applied with full force and effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The Court of Appeals declared that the proposed importation of such goods was contrary to law, hence, the nullity of the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p><p> We do not agree. The contract was not <em>void ab initio</em>. Nowhere in the LOI and Admin. Circular is there an express ban on the importation of transceivers. </p><p> The LOI and Administrative Circular did not render "radios and transceivers" illegal<em> per se</em>. The Administrative Circular merely ordered the Radio Control Office to suspend the "acceptance and processing .... of applications... for permits to possess, own, transfer, purchase and sell radio transmitters and transceivers..."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Therefore, possession and importation of the radio transmitters and transceivers was legal provided one had the necessary license for it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Transceivers were not prohibited but merely regulated goods. The LOI and Administrative Circular did not render the transceivers outside the commerce of man. They were valid objects of the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> Affirming the validity of the contract, we next discuss whether the contract was breached. </p><p> Guerrero testified that a permit to import the transceivers from Japan was denied by the Radio Control Board. He stated that he, together with Aligada, Victorino and a certain John Dauden personally went to the Radio Control Office, and were denied a permit to import. They also went to the Office of the President, where Secretary Ronaldo B. Zamora explained that radios were "banned like guns because of martial law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Guerrero testified that this prevented him from securing a letter of credit from the Central Bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> This testimony was not rebutted. </p><p> The law provides that "[w]hen the service (required by the contract) has become so manifestly beyond the contemplation of the parties, the obligor may also be released therefrom, in whole or in part."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Here, Guerrero's inability to secure a letter of credit and to comply with his obligation was a direct consequence of the denial of the permit to import. For this, he cannot be faulted. </p><p> Even if we assume that there was a breach of contract, damages cannot be awarded.<em> Damnum absque injuria</em>. </p><p> There was no bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence. It imports a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of wrong. It means a breach of a known duty through some motive or interest or ill will that partakes of the nature of fraud.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Guerrero honestly relied on the representations of the Radio Control Office and the Office of the President. </p><p> True, Guerrero borrowed equipment from the Subic Naval Base authorities at zero cost.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; This does not automatically translate to bad faith. Guerrero was faced with the danger of the cancellation of his contract with Subic Naval Base. He borrowed equipment as a prudent and swift alternative. There was no proof that he resorted to this option with a deliberate and malicious intent to dishonor his contract with Victorino. An award of damages surely cannot be based on mere hypotheses, conjectures and surmises. Good faith is presumed, the burden of proving bad faith rests on the one alleging it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Petitioners did not effectively discharge the burden in this case. </p><p>To recover moral damages in an action for breach of contract, the breach must be palpably wanton, reckless, malicious, in bad faith, oppressive or abusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> This is not the case here. </p><p> Exemplary damages also cannot be awarded. Guerrero did not act in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive or malevolent manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> Neither can actual damages be awarded. True, indemnification for damages contemplates not only actual loss suffered (<em>damnum emergens</em>) but unrealized profits (<em>lucrum cessans</em>) as well.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> However, to be entitled to adequate compensation for pecuniary loss, the loss must be actually suffered and duly proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> To recover actual damages, the amount of loss must not only be capable of proof, but must be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty. The claim must be premised upon competent proof or upon the best evidence obtainable,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> such as receipts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> or other documentary proof. </p><p> Only the testimony of Aligada was presented to substantiate petitioners' claim for unrealized profits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Aligada testified that as a result of the cancellation of the contract, Victorino had to suspend transactions with his Japanese supplier for six (6) months. Aligada stated that the volume of Victorino's business with Subic Naval Base also diminished significantly. Aligada approximated that Victorino's unrealized business opportunities amounted to P400,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Being a witness for Victorino's heirs and standing to gain from the contract's fulfillment, Aligada's testimony is self-serving. It is also hearsay. We fail to see how this "evidence" proves actual damages with a "reasonable degree of certainty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> If proof is "flimsy", we cannot award actual damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup>&nbsp; </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, we <strong>AFFIRM</strong> the decision of the Court of Appeals promulgated on October 11, 1995, in CA-G.
