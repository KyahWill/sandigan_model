The Court of Appeals reasoned that since petitioners interposed a counterclaim for moral and exemplary damages in Civil Case No. 658, they were barred from instituting Civil Case No. 16890. The Court of Appeals dismissed Civil Case No. 16890, as follows:<br><br><blockquote><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the complaint filed by plaintiffs-appellees against defendants-appellants is hereby DISMISSED.&nbsp; With costs against plaintiffs-appellees.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>On June 27, 1996, petitioners filed with the Court of Appeals a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>On September 12, 1996, the Court of Appeals denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Hence, this appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;">The Issue</center><br>The sole issue raised is whether the causes of action complained of in the Regional Trial Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> were in the nature of compulsory counterclaims that must be pleaded in Civil Case No. 658 of the Municipal Trial Court.<br><br>Petitioners argue that the acts complained of in Civil Case No. 16890 arose<i> after the filing of </i>the complaint and the answer in Civil Case No. 658.&nbsp; Thus, damages arising from such acts could not be raised therein as compulsory counterclaims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;">The Court's Ruling</center><br>We find the appeal meritorious.<br><br>We agree with petitioners that the causes of action pleaded in Civil Case No. 16890 are different from those in Civil Case No. 658, and that such causes could not have been raised as compulsory counterclaims therein.<br><br>Nonetheless, we find that the trial court erred in Civil Case No. 16890 for touching on the propriety of the ejectment case which was settled in Civil Case No. 658 and affirmed on appeal in Civil Case No. D-9996.<br><br>We discuss these points <i>seriatim</i>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not Compulsory Counterclaims</span><br></div><br>Rule 11 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides:<br><br><blockquote><blockquote>"Sec. 8. <i>Existing counterclaim or cross-claim</i> - A compulsory counterclaim or a cross-claim that a defending party has at the time he files his answer shall be contained therein." (<i>underscoring ours</i>)</blockquote></blockquote><br>A counterclaim is compulsory where: (1) it arises out of, or is necessary connected with, the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (2) it does not require the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction; and (3) the trial court has jurisdiction to entertain the claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The following are the tests by which the compulsory nature of a counterclaim can be determined: (1) Are the issues of fact and law raised by the claim and counterclaim largely the same? (2) Would <i>res judicata</i> bar a subsequent suit on defendant's claim absent the compulsory counterclaim rule? (3) Will substantially the same evidence support or refute plaintiff's claim as well as defendant's counterclaim? (4) Is there any logical relation between the claim and counterclaim?<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>We do not agree with the Court of Appeals that the claims in Civil Case No. 16890 may be pleaded as compulsory counterclaims in Civil Case No. 658.<br><br><b>First</b>. In Civil Case No. 16890, the damages prayed for arose not from contract but from <i>quasi-delict</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> They constitute separate and distinct causes of action.<br><br>A cause of action has the following elements: (1) the legal right of plaintiff, (2) the correlative obligation of the defendant, and (3) the act or omission of the defendant in violation of said legal right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cause of Action in Civil Case No. 658</span><br></div><br>Civil Case No. 658 involves a complaint for unlawful detainer and damages.&nbsp; In an unlawful detainer case, the issue is the right to physical possession of the premises or possession<i> de facto</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The basis is a contract of lease.<br><br>Causes of Action in Civil Case No. 16890<br><br>The acts complained of in Civil Case No. 16890 were:<br><br><blockquote><blockquote>"1.&nbsp; Removal of the signboard in front of the stall of Marcelo Arenas, which is being used as an eye clinic and the refusal of Conrado Rojas or his failure to return it;<br><br>"2.&nbsp; Dumping of gravel and sand in front of the stall as well as the fencing of the front of the stall in question thus effectively preventing patients and customers from coming in;<br><br>"3.&nbsp; Cutting off the electric connection to the eye clinic."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>We agree with petitioners that the acts complained of were not founded on the contract of lease but could constitute violations of the Civil Code provisions on Human Relations, specifically:<br><br><blockquote><blockquote>"Art. 19.&nbsp; Every person must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith.<br><br>"Art. 20.&nbsp; Every person who, contrary to law, willfully or negligently causes damage to another, shall indemnify the latter for the same.<br><br>"Art. 21. Any person who willfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the damage."</blockquote></blockquote><br>Here, respondents' duty to respect petitioners' rights is an obligation sourced not from contract but from <i>quasi-delict.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><b>Second</b>. In <i>de Leon v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> we held that "[W]here the issues of the case extend beyond those commonly involved in unlawful detainer suits, the case is converted from a mere detainer suit to one `incapable of pecuniary estimation' thereby placing it under the exclusive jurisdiction of the regional trial courts." Verily, since the municipal trial court could not have taken cognizance of the claims in Civil Case No. 16890, then such claims could not be considered as compulsory counterclaims in Civil Case No. 658.<br><br>The fact that the rule on summary procedure governs ejectment cases emphasizes the point that an action for damages incapable of pecuniary estimation can not be pleaded as counterclaims therein. It cannot be overemphasized that the reason for the rule on summary procedure is to prevent undue delays in the disposition of cases. To achieve this, the filing of certain pleadings is prohibited and the periods for acting on motions as well as on the case itself are relatively reduced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><b>Third</b>. The acts complained of were committed after the complaint and the answer were filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br style="text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trial Court Ruling in Civil Case No. 16890 Erroneous</span><br></div><br>However, as the Court of Appeals erred, so did the trial court.<br><br>In Civil Case No. 16890, the trial court ruled that the lease was still subsisting and that the ejectment case was maliciously brought. It should not have done so.&nbsp; These issues were already decided in Civil Case No. 658 and affirmed on appeal in Civil Case No. D-9996. These issues, stemming from the lease contract are barred by <i>res judicata</i>.<br><br><i>Res judicata</i> exists when the following elements are present:<br><br><blockquote>"(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the former judgment must be final;<br><br>"(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the court which rendered judgment had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter;<br><br>"(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it must be a judgment on the merits;<br><br>"(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and there must be between the first and second actions identity of parties, subject matter, and cause of action."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote><br>The doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> is a rule which pervades every well regulated system of jurisprudence and is founded upon two grounds embodied in various maxims of the common law, namely: (1) public policy and necessity which makes it to the interest of the State that there should be an end to litigation, <i>interest reipublicae ut sit finis litum</i>, and (2) the hardship on the individual that he should be vexed twice for the same cause, <i>memo debet bis vexari et eadem causa</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 39, Lingayen, Pangasinan in Civil Case No. 16890 touched on matters already decided. There must be an end to litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The issue of whether ejectment was proper was fully and fairly adjudicated in Civil Case No. 658.<br><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;">Remand Case<br></center><br>Whether or not the acts of respondents complained of in Civil Case No. 16890 prejudiced petitioners may be objectively determined by the trial court, <b>independent of the issues of the propriety of the ejectment and malicious prosecution.</b><br><br>To settle this, it must be determined whether respondents committed <i>quasi-delict</i> and acted in bad faith.&nbsp; Malice or bad faith implies a conscious and intentional design to do a wrongful act for a dishonest purpose or moral obliquity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The determination of whether one acted in bad faith and whether damages may be awarded is evidentiary in nature.&nbsp; As a matter of defense, it can be best passed upon after a full-blown trial on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Thus, there is a need to remand the case to the court of origin.<br><br><center style="text-decoration: underline;">The Fallo<br></center><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTS </span>the petition, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">SETS ASIDE</span> the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.
