				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a Petition for Review on 
<em>Certiorari </em>under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, 
seeking the reversal of the June 7, 1999 Decision of the Court of 
Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  in CA-G.R. SP No. 51294 and the September 30, 1999 Resolution denying 
the motion to reconsider said decision.  The challenged decision 
dismissed, for lack of merit, the petition for 
<em>certiorari</em>, to 
annul the Resolutions dated October 2, 1998 and January 18, 1999 of the 
Regional Trial Court of Misamis Oriental (Branch 23) in Civil Case No. 
97-559 which, respectively, denied the motion to set aside judgment by 
default and quash writ of execution; and denied the motion for 
reconsideration.
<p>
The facts are summarized by the Court of Appeals in this wise:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "In August, 1997, private respondent Domingo Estomo filed 
against 
petitioner Joel Umandap an action for damages based on breach of 
contract.  On February 3, 1998, Process Server Marmolejo effected 
substituted service of the summons and copy of the Complaint upon 
petitioner, by leaving a copy thereof at petitioner's home and office 
address to a certain Joseph David who refused to receive and acknowledge
 the same (Officer's Return, <em>Rollo</em>, p. 27). 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioner failed to file his Answer and, on motion of private 
respondent, was declared in default.  Thereafter, private respondent was
 allowed to adduce his evidence ex parte.  On May 8, 1998, the trial 
court rendered a judgment against petitioner, the dispositive portion of
 which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, premises above-considered and pursuant to 
applicable 
law on the matter and plaintiff having proven by preponderance of 
evidence his right to the relief prayed for, judgment is hereby rendered
 in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant Joel R. Umandap 
holding the latter liable to plaintiff and ordering the defendant to pay
 to the plaintiff: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "1.  The amount of P304,393.25 representing the unremitted
 collections from MORESCO/NEA received by defendant; </p>
    <p>
      2.  The amount of P200,000.00 as reimbursement of interest 
incurred and paid by plaintiff to finish the contracted project;
    </p>
    <p> "3.  P50,000.00 as moral damages; </p>
    <p> "4.  P75,000.00 as attorney's fees; </p>
    <p> "5.  Litigation expenses of P5,547.00; and </p>
    <p> "6.  Cost of this suit. </p>
    <p> "SO ORDERED."
      </p>
    <p>
      (<em>Rollo</em>, p. 33).
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
On July 8, 1998, a Writ of Execution was issued and petitioner's deposit
 and receivables were garnished.  On August 3, 1998, petitioner filed a 
Motion to Set Aside Judgment by Default and Quash Writ of Execution 
which respondent Court denied in an Order dated October 2, 1998.  
Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was likewise denied in the 
Court’s order of January 18, 1999. xxx.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><p>
Aggrieved, petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals a Petition for 
<em>Certiorari </em>under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court 
assailing the resolutions of the trial court dated October 2, 1998 and 
January 18, 1999.
</p><p>
Petitioner argued before the Court of Appeals that the trial court never
 acquired jurisdiction over his person because there has been no valid 
service of summons; that the substituted service of summons was improper
 and invalid since the process server's return failed to show on its 
face the impossibility of personal service.
</p><p>
In dismissing the petition, the Court of Appeals found that the process 
server's Return is "valid and regular on its face, and readily reveals 
that earnest efforts were exerted to find the defendant personally but 
such efforts failed." The Court of Appeals also held that the "return is
 clothed with the mantle of presumption of regularity under Section 
3[m], Rule 131 of the New Rules on Evidence; and that said presumption 
is not overcome by petitioner's unsubstantiated and self-serving 
assertion that the process server went to his home and office address 
only once."
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    Hence, this recourse to this Court.
  </p>
  <p>
    In his Memorandum, petitioner raises the following issues:
  </p>
    <p>
      1.  Whether or not the substituted service of summons made on 
petitioner through Joseph David on February 3, 1998 was valid and 
regular.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.  On the assumption that the service of summons made on 
petitioner was valid, whether or not the Court of Appeals acted in 
accord with law and the applicable decisions of this Court when it 
refused to set aside the default judgment rendered against petitioner in
 Civil Case No. 97-559 (RTC-Misamis oriental, Branch 23; Cagayan de Oro 
City) and giving the latter a chance to present his evidence therein so 
as to rebut or even defeat private respondent's claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The main issue in this petition is whether or not petitioner was served 
valid summons so as to bring him within the jurisdiction of the court.
</p><p>
There can be no dispute that service of summons upon the defendant is 
necessary in order that a court may acquire jurisdiction over his 
person.  Any judgment without such service in the absence of a valid 
waiver is null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
Pursuant to Section 6, Rule 14 of the Revised Rules of Court, the 
general rule in this jurisdiction is that summons must be served 
personally on the defendant, it reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 6. <em>Service in person on 
defendant.</em> - Whenever 
practicable, the summons shall be served by handing a copy thereof to 
the defendant in person, or, if he refuses to receive and sign for it, 
by tendering it to him."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, when the defendant cannot be served personally within a 
reasonable time after efforts to locate him have failed, substituted 
service may be made.  Section 7, Rule 14 of the Revised Rules of Court 
reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 7. <em>Substituted Service</em>. - If, for
 justifiable 
causes, the defendant cannot be served within a reasonable time as 
provided in the preceding section, service may be effected (a) by 
leaving copies of the summons at the defendant's residence with some 
person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein, or (b) by 
leaving the copies at defendant's office or regular place of business 
with some competent person in charge thereof."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In fine, the two modes for effecting substituted service of summons are:
  (a) by leaving copies of the summons at the defendant's residence with
 some person of suitable age and discretion; and (b) by leaving copies 
at defendant's office or regular place of business with some competent 
person in charge thereof. Among these two modes of substituted service, 
the sheriff or the process server may choose that which will more likely
 insure the effectiveness of the service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
In <em>Venturanza vs. Court of Appeals,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  this Court described 
how the impossibility of personal service should be shown:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The substituted service should be availed only when the 
defendant
 cannot be served promptly in person.  Impossibility of prompt service 
should be shown by stating the efforts made to find the defendant 
personally and the failure of such efforts.  The statement should be 
made in the proof of service.  This is necessary because substituted 
service is in derogation of the usual method of service.  Substituted 
service is a method extraordinary in character, and hence may be used 
only as prescribed in the circumstances authorized by statute.  Thus, 
the statutory requirements of substituted service must be followed 
strictly, faithfully, and any substituted service other than that 
authorized by the statute is considered ineffective."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The proof of service alluded to is the return required by Section 4 of 
Rule 14 which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 4. <em>Return</em>. - When the service has
 been completed, 
the server shall, within five (5) days therefrom, serve a copy of the 
return, personally or by registered mail, to the plaintiff's counsel, 
and shall return the summons to the clerk who issued it, accompanied by 
proof of service."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Central to the instant controversy is the process server's return which 
petitioner relies upon to show the invalidity of the substituted service
 of summons.  He points to the following alleged defects:  (1) it does 
not state the efforts exerted or the alleged occasions on which attempts
 were made to personally serve the summons upon petitioner; (2) it does 
not state that Joseph David, to whom the process server left or tendered
 the summons and a copy of the complaint was a person of suitable age 
and discretion then residing therein or a competent person in charge of 
petitioner's residence or office; and, (3) it is not entitled to the 
presumption of regularity since there is no compliance with the rules on
 substituted service.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    We find petitioner's contentions to be devoid of merit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process server's return reads in full:
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">
OFFICER'S RETURN
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "THIS IS TO CERTIFY, that on the 3rd day of February 1998, 
undersigned served copy of the summon with the copy of the complaint and
 its annexes, upon the defendant Joel R. Umandap Jofel Construction, at 
No. 14-3rd St., New Manila, Quezon City by leaving/tendering the copy to
 Joseph David receiving of said office, but he refused to sign in 
receipt of the copy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That despite efforts exerted to serve said process personally upon the 
defendant on several occasions the same proved futile, for the reason 
that herein defendant was not around, thus substituted service was made 
in accordance with the provision of Section 8, Rule 14 of the Revised 
Rules of Court, and that this return is now being submitted to the Court
 of origin with the information DULY SERVED.
</p><p>
Quezon City, Metro Manila, February 13, 1998.

</blockquote>
<p>
We are inclined to uphold the view of the Court of Appeals that the 
presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions holds
 in this case.  Indeed, in the absence of contrary evidence, a 
presumption exists that a sheriff has regularly performed his official 
duty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  To 
overcome the presumption arising from the sheriff’s certificate, the 
evidence must be clear and convincing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
</p><p>
In the instant case, no proof of irregularity in the process server's 
return was presented by petitioner.  On the contrary, a perusal of the 
process server's return in the instant case shows compliance with the 
requirements of substituted service in accordance with the requirements 
set forth in <em>Laus vs. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  enumerated as follows:  (a) indicate the impossibility of service of 
summons within a reasonable time, (b) specify the efforts exerted to 
locate the petitioners and (c) state that it was served on a person of 
sufficient age and discretion residing therein.
</p><p>
First.  The return indicates the location or address of the defendant 
where the summons was served.  Second.  It indicates the efforts and/or 
prior attempts at personal service made by the process server and that 
such attempts had proved futile, prompting the latter to resort to 
substituted service.  Third.  It indicates that summons was left or 
tendered to Joseph David "receiving of said office."
</p><p>
As it turns out, petitioner's allegation that the process server went to
 his home and office address only once is, as correctly pointed out by 
the Court of Appeals, "unsubstantiated and self-serving assertion of the
 petitioner." We have no reason to disbelieve or disregard the statement
 in the return that personal service of summons was attempted on several
 occasions.  It is likewise not denied that the address stated therein, 
No. 14-3rd St., New Manila, Quezon City, is both the residence and 
office address of petitioner at the time the summons was served.  Thus, 
the place of service is not in issue.  Significantly, petitioner 
admitted receipt by Joseph David, nephew of his wife, of the summons and
 the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  He 
claims; however, that his nephew misplaced the same and ultimately 
failed to inform defendant thereof.  The return indicates that Joseph 
David was the "receiving of said office", which sufficiently conveys 
that he was a person of sufficient age and discretion residing therein, 
tasked as he is to receive for the office.  In any event, petitioner 
never alleged in any of his pleadings filed before the lower and 
appellate courts, and even in this Court, that Joseph David was 
incompetent to receive the summons and a copy of the complaint and that 
he was not a resident therein.  The presumption that the process server 
left or tendered the summons upon a person of sufficient age and 
discretion stands unrebutted.
</p><p>
In light of these facts, the appellate court's reliance on the process 
server's return that summons upon petitioner through Joseph David was 
validly served in consonance with the principle of presumption in favor 
of regularity of performance of official functions of a public officer 
rests on a firm basis.  The requirements of substituted service as 
emphasized in the Laus case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  were all complied with.
</p><p>
Finally, petitioner's argument that assuming the summons was validly 
served the Court of Appeals should have nevertheless set aside the 
default judgment rendered against him invoking the liberal construction 
of the rules is clearly untenable.  Liberal construction of the Rules 
may be invoked in situations wherein there may be some excusable formal 
deficiency or error in a pleading, provided that the same does not 
subvert the essence of the proceeding and connotes at least a reasonable
 attempt at compliance with the Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  In the instant case, we agree with the trial court's observations of 
petitioner's resort to technicalities in an apparent attempt to 
frustrate the ends of justice.  We quote:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "In the case at bar, defendant never rebutted the fact that 
they 
received copies of the summons and its annexes but rather questioned the
 process in which summons was served by the sheriff.  Certificate of 
service of summons by the sheriff is prima facie evidence of the facts 
set out in such certificate and to overcome the presumption arising from
 the sheriff's return, the evidence must be clear and convincing.  But 
petitioner failed to overcome this presumption.  (Ramon Orosa, et al., 
vs. CA, et al., G. R. No. 118698, September 3, 1996).  Besides, 
respondent judge had the right to rely on the sheriff's return because 
there is the presumption of regularity in the performance of their 
duties.  (Claridad vs. Santos, January 27, 1998; Sec. 39m) Rule 131 of 
the Rules of Court). </p>
  <p>
  Defendant Umandap could hardly feign ignorance of the existence of 
this instant case considering the fact that he received a copy of order 
of this Court under date March 18, 1998 declaring him in default as 
evidenced by the Return and attached to the records of this case dated 
March 27, 1998.  Likewise, defendant received a copy of the judgment of 
this Court Order dated May 8, 1998 as evidenced by Registry Return Slip 
dated May 29, 1998 attached to the records of this case. Isn't this a 
case of a person who feigned to be asleep but who is really awake?
  </p>
  <p>
  Defendant Umandap in his affidavit of merit admitted that Joseph David
 (the person to whom RTC Process Server Marmolejo gave the summons) was 
his wife's nephew.  Defendant never rebutted the fact that he received a
 copy of the judgment of this Court through a certain Bobby Santiago, 
the Auditor of his company.
  </p>
  <p> It is very clear that defendant Umandap is guilty of laches 
for 
failure to seasonably act on those lawful Order he received from this 
Court.  It was only when his receivables were garnished that defendant 
filed these motions.  This Court cannot help but conclude that all the 
allegations made by defendant as to the regularity of service of notice 
are feeble and desperate attempts to prevent the garnishment of his 
funds.  Based on existing fact and jurisprudence on the matter, they 
hardly deserve any consideration by the Court.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Considering that petitioner received a copy of the Order dated March 18,
 1998 declaring him in default on March 27, 1998 and a copy of the 
judgment dated May 8, 1998 on May 29, 1998, as evidenced by registry 
return receipts, he could have protected his rights by availing himself 
of several avenues of redress, including, filing a motion to set aside 
the order of default in accordance with Sec. 3 (b), Rule 9 of the Rules 
of Court; or he could have taken an ordinary appeal to the Court of 
Appeals in accordance with Sec. 2 (a), Rule 41 of the Rules of Court 
questioning the judgment of the trial court.
