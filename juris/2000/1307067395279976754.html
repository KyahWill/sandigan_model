				<BR><BR><p align="justify">For review before us is the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 13, 
Ligao, Albay, finding accused-appellant Emelito Brondial y Culaway guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime of rape of his 12-year old daughter, Imelda 
Brondial, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of death and to indemnify the 
victim in the amount of P50,000.00<i> </i>and to pay the costs.</p>
<p align="justify">The information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
against accused-appellant alleged -</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"That in the early morning of June 2, 1997, at Barangay Rawis, 
Municipality of Libon, Province of Albay, Philippines and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd design, 
and with grave abuse of his parental authority, did then and there wilfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously had sexual intercourse with his daughter, Imelda 
Brondial, a 12-year old girl, against her will and consent, to her damage and 
prejudice.</p>
<p align="justify">"ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">When arraigned, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the 
charge, whereupon trial commenced.</p>
<p align="justify">The prosecution presented evidence tending to establish the 
following facts:</p>
<p align="justify">Complainant Imelda Brondial, then 12 years old, is the second 
eldest daughter of accused-appellant Emelito Brondial y Culaway by his wife 
Beverly Brondial. The couple has five other children, namely, Teresa, Junior, 
Allan, Jayson, and Loney.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> On January 
15, 1997, accused- appellant's wife, Beverly, went to Manila to work as a 
laundrywoman. The children were left to the care of accused-appellant, although 
at times they would stay with accused-appellant's brother, Abad Brondial, and 
the latter's family.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">In the evening of June 2, 1997, Imelda and her siblings slept 
on the floor beside their father accused-appellant, in their house in Rawis, 
Libon, Albay. Imelda lay near the wall of the house. To her left was Junior, 
followed by Loney, Allan, Jayson, and Teresa, the eldest. Accused- appellant 
slept near the door. Imelda was awakened when accused- appellant removed her 
short pants and underwear and lay on top of her. Imelda felt some pain as 
accused-appellant inserted his penis into her vagina. She shouted and cried but 
her siblings, who were awakened, could do nothing to stop their father in 
abusing her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">Early the following day, while accused-appellant was still 
asleep, Imelda and her younger sister Loney left their house and decided to go 
to the house of their uncle Abad (Abad Brondial) in Cabugao, Pantao, Libon, 
Albay. As they did not know the exact location of their uncle's house, they 
waited for students of the school in Pantao to be dismissed from class and 
walked with them to go to Cabugao. Imelda and Loney reached their uncle's house 
at about 3:00 p.m. Imelda related her ordeal to Abad and his wife, Conching, who 
lost no time in taking Imelda to the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory 
at Camp General Simeon A. Ola in Legazpi City for medical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">On June 9, 1997 Imelda, assisted by her uncle Abad, filed a 
criminal complaint (Exh. A)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> for rape 
against accused-appellant before the 6th Municipal Circuit Trial Court of 
Polangui-Libon, Albay.</p>
<p align="justify">Dr. Lilli-Melrose Pantua Camara, a police senior inspector and 
a medico-legal officer, conducted the examination on Imelda and her report (Exh. 
C)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> yielded the following results: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"FINDINGS: <br><u>GENERAL AND EXTRAGENITAL</u></p>
<p align="justify">Fairly developed, fairly nourished and coherent female child 
subject. Breasts are underdeveloped, slightly protruding. Abdomen is flat and 
tight.</p>
<p align="justify"><u>GENITAL</u></p>
<p align="justify">Pubic hair is absent. Labia majora are full, convex and 
slightly gaping, with pinkish labia minora presenting in between. On separating 
the same is observed an elastic, fleshly-type hymen with deep, healed laceration 
at 6 o'clock and shallow healed laceration at 3 o'clock. External vaginal 
orifice offers slight resistance to the introduction of the examining index 
finger. Vaginal canal is narrow with slightly shallow rugosities.</p>
<p align="justify">CONCLUSION:</p>
<p align="justify">There are no external signs of recent applications of any form 
of trauma.</p>
<p align="justify">Subject is in non-virgin [state] physically.</p>
<p align="justify">REMARKS:</p>
<p align="justify">Vaginal and peri-urethral smears are negative for gram-negative 
diplococci and spermatozoa." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Dr. Camara testified that the lacerations in the hymen could 
have been caused by a blunt object or a man's penis. Based on her impression of 
the hymenal lacerations, she estimated that sexual intercourse could have taken 
place about a week prior to Imelda's examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">Accused-appellant testified in his own behalf. He admitted that 
he is the father of the complainant Imelda Brondial and that Abad Brondial is 
his brother. He said he had nine children by his wife, but only six were living. 
Of the six, only Junior, Allan, and Jayson were living with him because Imelda 
and Loney were staying with his brother Abad, while Teresa was staying in 
Polangui. His wife Beverly had been staying in Manila since March 26, 1997, 
working as a laundrywoman.</p>
<p align="justify">Accused-appellant denied that he committed the crime and 
claimed that he was in his house in Rawis, Libon, Albay on June 2, 1997, the 
date of the commission of the crime. He averred that he could not have raped 
Imelda on the night of June 2, 1997 because Imelda was then in the custody of 
her uncle Abad in Cabugao, Pantao, Libon, Albay, about five kilometers away from 
where he was, the distance of which could be covered only by motorboat in about 
half an hour. According to accused-appellant, Imelda had been staying with Abad 
since she was four years old. Abad had agreed to spend for Imelda's schooling. 
Accused-appellant said that from the time Imelda was taken away from him by 
Abad, Imelda never visited him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">Accused-appellant declared that Abad was quite mischievous with 
women. He was once hit on the face by Melita Quideng, the reason he has a scar 
on his left cheek. He claimed that he and Abad had a misunderstanding over a 
two-hectare land in Rawis which their father owned. Abad allegedly sought to 
deprive accused-appellant of the produce despite the fact that it was 
accused-appellant and their father who cultivated the land. He surmised that 
Abad had instigated Imelda to file the case against him so that Abad could have 
the land and its produce.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">On August 27, 1998, the trial court rendered a decision finding 
accused-appellant guilty of raping Imelda. The dispositive portion of its 
decision reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing consideration and finding 
the accused Emelito Brondial y Culaway guilty beyond any reasonable doubt of the 
crime of rape against his 12-year old daughter Imelda Brondial, [accused is 
sentenced] to suffer the penalty of DEATH and to indemnify the offended party 
the amount of P50,000.00<i>, </i>and to pay the cost<b>.</b></p>
<p align="justify">"Pursuant to the constitutional provision for automatic review, 
the records of this case, together with all the exhibits and stenographic notes, 
are hereby ordered immediately elevated to the Supreme Court."</p>
<p align="justify">"SO ORDERED." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Accused-appellant seeks reversal of his conviction on the 
ground that his guilt was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p align="justify">In prosecutions for rape, this Court has been guided by the 
following principles in its review of trial court decisions: (1) an accusation 
for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult 
for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the nature 
of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony 
of the complainant is scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the evidence for 
the prosecution stands or falls on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw 
strength from the weakness of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">In rape cases, the accused may be convicted solely on the 
testimony of the rape victim if her testimony is credible, natural, convincing, 
and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things. For, by its 
very nature, rape is committed with the least possibility of being seen by the 
public. In fact, the presence of an eyewitness, other than the victim, could 
even raise serious doubts of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">In this regard, our review of the evidence adduced by both 
parties confirms the finding of the trial court that accused-appellant is guilty 
of sexually abusing complainant Imelda. The trial court had the opportunity to 
observe complainant's demeanor, particularly her scorn and outrage against her 
own father, and it gave full credence to her testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The trial court's appreciation of the 
evidence will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is good reason for doing 
otherwise. Accused-appellant failed to adduce evidence that the trial court 
misappreciated the evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Imelda 
told the court in a categorical and straightforward manner how she was violated 
by her very own father, thus: </p>

<p align="justify">It may be noted that while the information alleges that the 
rape took place "in the early morning of June 2, 1997," the prosecution evidence 
shows that it occurred "in the evening of June 2, 1997." Such discrepancy, 
however, is insignificant and does not diminish the quantum of proof established 
by the prosecution. The precise time of the commission of the crime is not an 
essential element of rape. Even a variance of a few months between the time set 
out in the indictment and that established by the evidence during trial has been 
held not to constitute such a serious error as to warrant the reversal of a 
conviction solely on that score.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> 
Moreover, the record does not show that accused-appellant objected to the time 
of the commission of the rape.</p>
<p align="justify">Accused-appellant points out alleged inconsistencies in the 
evidence of the prosecution.</p>
<p align="justify"><i>First. </i>Accused-appellant makes much of the fact that 
when Imelda shouted and cried while being raped by accused-appellant, her 
brothers and sisters did nothing to help her despite the fact that they had been 
awakened. He argues that there was no evidence showing that he intimidated and 
silenced them.</p>
<p align="justify">Where resistance would be futile in a rape committed by a 
father against his own daughter, the former's moral ascendancy and influence 
over the latter sufficiently takes the place of violence or intimidation. That 
ascendancy or influence flows from the father's parental authority over his 
children and from the latter's correlative duty to obey and observe reverence 
and respect towards the former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The 
force of such authority and its hold on young minds cannot be underestimated. 
Children trained to obedience are not likely to have the courage to protest 
against anything done to them the first time it is committed. It is not 
therefore surprising for the children to just freeze in fear when they realized 
what was being done to Imelda. </p>
<p align="justify"><i>Second. </i>Accused-appellant contends that if, as Imelda 
claimed, she and her sister Loney left the house in the morning to go to Abad's 
house, they should have arrived there before noon and not at 3:00 p.m. As Imelda 
explained, however, she and her sister did not know how to get to Cabugao where 
Abad lived. They had to wait until the students, who were from Cabugao, were 
dismissed from school and then they followed them in going to Cabugao. Thus, 
they were able to reach the place of Abad only in the afternoon. Imelda 
testified: </p>

<p align="justify"><i>Third. </i>Accused-appellant claims that he has been framed. 
He claims that he is not in speaking terms with his brother Abad and insinuates 
that the filing of the criminal complaint for rape against him was prompted by 
their dispute over the two-hectare land which their father owned<i>.</i> </p>
<p align="justify">This was denied by Abad Brondial. Abad said he and accused- 
appellant had been in good terms. They ceased to communicate only after the 
criminal complaint for rape had been lodged before the court. When Abad informed 
Imelda's mother Beverly Brondial about the incident, she was outraged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Imelda testified on rebuttal that she 
lost her love and affection for accused-appellant after he defiled her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> To reiterate, we find the testimony of 
Imelda credible. She had no motive to testify falsely against her own 
father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> On the other hand, she was 
aware that a prosecution for rape would inevitably expose her to public 
scrutiny. As we have said many times, no woman would want to go through the 
humiliation of a trial unless she has actually been so brutalized that she 
desires justice for her suffering.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It 
takes a certain amount of psychological depravity for a young woman to concoct a 
story which could cause the life of her own father and drag the rest of the 
family, including herself, to a lifetime of shame.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Imelda's mother would not allow her child 
to be exposed to public trial, if the charges she makes are not true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> When asked how she felt upon learning 
that it was her husband who molested her daughter Imelda, Beverly testified that 
she was furious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify">Neither can we detect any ill motive on the part of Abad in 
accompanying Imelda for her medical examination, taking custody over her after 
the rape incident, and supporting her throughout the trial of the case and even 
testifying for the prosecution. Nor can we surmise that Imelda would willingly 
allow herself to be used as an instrument for Abad to exact vendetta against 
accused-appellant over a parcel of land owned by their father. </p>
<p align="justify"><i>Fourth. </i>Accused-appellant insists that the medical 
finding that there were "no external signs of recent application of any form of 
trauma" negates the fact of sexual abuse upon Imelda.</p>
<p align="justify">Such conclusion is inaccurate. Imelda's positive testimony, 
coupled with the findings of a deep healed laceration at 6 o'clock and a shallow 
healed laceration at 3 o'clock on complainant's labia majora, confirms the 
sexual intercourse. It is settled that when the victim's testimony is 
corroborated by the physician's finding of penetration, there is sufficient 
foundation to conclude the existence of the essential requisite of carnal 
knowledge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Laceration, whether healed 
or fresh, are the best physical evidence of forcible defloration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> On the other hand, the absence of 
spermatozoa in the genitalia of complainant does not negate the finding of rape 
since ejaculation is not an element thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> What consummates the felony is the 
contact of the penis of the perpetrator, however slight, to the vagina of his 
victim without her consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In fact, 
a medical examination is not a requisite for a rape charge to prosper as long as 
the victim categorically and consistently declares that she has been raped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">Accused-appellant used threat and intimidation to overcome 
Imelda's will and break her resistance. Thus, the fact that no external physical 
injury was noted on Imelda does not negate the fact that she was raped. 
Intimidation would also explain why there are no traces of struggle which would 
indicate that the victim fought off her attacker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Indeed, the law does not even impose a 
burden of proving resistance on the part of the rape victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p>
<p align="justify"><i>Fifth. </i>Accused-appellant contends that, since Imelda had 
been living in the house of her uncle Abad for quite some time prior to the rape 
incident and was not used to staying in his house, she could have mistaken him 
for someone else as the kerosene lamp was unlighted on that night.</p>
<p align="justify">Accused-appellant's bare and uncorroborated denial of the crime 
charged is insufficient to refute the prosecution evidence, especially in the 
face of his positive identification by complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> No daughter can possibly be mistaken 
about the identity of her father who forces himself on her in the presence of 
her other siblings, there being no evidence that there were other adult male 
occupants who could have gained unlawful entry into the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Denial is a negative self-serving 
evidence which cannot be given greater weight than the testimony of credible 
witnesses who testified affirmatively. Between the positive declarations of 
prosecution witnesses and the negative statements of the accused, the former 
deserves more credence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">Finally, the trial court found accused-appellant guilty of 
raping her daughter Imelda and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of death and 
to indemnify her in the amount of P50,000.00<i> </i>plus costs.</p>
<p align="justify">Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic 
Act No. 7659, provides: </p>
<p align="justify">"The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape 
is committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1. when the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the 
offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by 
consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree or the common-law spouse 
of the parent of the victim." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The information alleged that accused-appellant had sexual 
intercourse with his daughter, Imelda Brondial, then 12 years old. The evidence 
clearly shows Imelda's age and filiation to accused-appellant. The prosecution 
presented the marriage contract (Exh. G) between accused-appellant and Beverly 
P. Sandigan (Imelda's mother), which stated that their marriage was duly 
solemnized on November 25, 1981 by Fr. Manuel B. Balute. Six children were born 
to the couple, namely, Teresa, complainant Imelda, Junior, Allan, Jayson, and 
Loney. Per her Certificate of Live Birth (Exh. H), Imelda, having been born on 
May 12, 1985, was 12 years old when she was raped. Imelda testified that she was 
12 years old when she was sexually abused by her own father, accused-appellant, 
and this fact was corroborated by her mother, Beverly Brondial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Accused-appellant even admitted his 
paternity in open court and the fact of Imelda's minority at the time of the 
commission of the rape.</p>
<p align="justify">The concurrence of minority of the complainant and her 
relationship to the offender, having been alleged in the information and duly 
proved with certainty and clearness as the crime itself during trial, constrains 
the Court to affirm the conviction of accused-appellant of qualified rape, 
justifying the imposition of the death penalty on him. Four (4) members of the 
Court, although maintaining their adherence to the separate opinions expressed 
in <i>People vs. Echegaray</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><i> 
</i>that R.A. No. 7659, insofar as it prescribes the penalty of death, is 
unconstitutional, nevertheless submit to the ruling of the majority that the law 
is constitutional and that the death penalty should accordingly be imposed.</p>
<p align="justify">As to the civil liability of accused-appellant, the Court finds 
that the award of P50,000.00<i> </i>for civil indemnity should be increased to 
P75,000.00<i>, </i>consistent with recent rulings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> that if the crime of rape is qualified by 
circumstances which warrant the imposition of the death penalty by applicable 
amendatory laws, the complainant should be awarded P75,000.00 as civil 
indemnity. In addition, moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00<i> </i>must be 
awarded without need of proof for it is assumed that the victim has suffered 
moral injuries entitling her to such an award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p>
<p align="justify"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Regional Trial Court, 
Branch 13, Ligao, Albay, finding accused-appellant Emelito Brondial y Culaway 
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and imposing upon him the 
penalty of death, is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that accused- appellant is 
ordered to pay complainant Imelda Brondial P75,000.00<i>, </i>as civil 
indemnity, and, in addition, P50,000.00<i> </i>as moral damages.</p>
<p align="justify">In accordance with Section 25 of R.A. No. 7659, amending 
Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, upon finality of this decision, let the 
records of this case be forthwith forwarded to the Office of the President in 
case he decides to exercise his prerogative of mercy.</p>
