				<BR><BR>Conspiracy must be established by proof beyond reasonable doubt. In the present appeal, the prosecution eyewitness testified that one of the appellants had joined the other accused in approaching the victim, but subsequently tried to prevent them from stabbing this same victim. Such dubious participation is insufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the said appellant conspired with the others in committing the offense. Accordingly, the constitutional presumption of innocence must be upheld. He must be acquitted.<br><div align="justify"><br><center><u><strong>The Case</strong></u></center><br>Vincent Dejoras and Ignacio Cupino<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> appeal the March 6, 1995 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Cagayan de Oro City (Branch 25).

Cupino, Dejoras and Galos ganged up on Valiente who also fought back (Testimony of Silverio Bahian at pp. 6-7, supra; Testimony of Ferdinand Bangayan at p. 7, supra.). Beaten and outnumbered, Valiente ran away towards the direction of a small pathway leading to the store of a certain Major Grio, which was beside Dod's Store. The trio chased x x x him (Testimony of Ferdinand Bangayan at p. 10, id.). Galos caught up with Valiente and then stabbed him twice in the stomach with a small bolo (Testimony of Silverio Bahian at pp. 9-10, supra.).<br><br>"With the bolo still embedded on his stomach, Valiente crawled along the pathway. Cupino also caught up with Valiente (pp. 11-12, id.). Then Cupino pulled the bolo from the victim's body and was about to stab the victim again when Dejoras tried to grab Cupino's hands, but instead Dejoras got hold of the blade of the bolo and was injured in the process. Dejoras left, coming out of the pathway with his wounded right hand (pp. 12-13, id.).<br><br>"Meanwhile, Cupino proceeded to stab the victim twice in the stomach. Afterward, Cupino and Galos fled from the scene of the crime (p. 14, id.). Valiente, who was seriously wounded and soaked in his own blood, cried for help. He was brought to a hospital but later died (p. 19, id.; Testimony of Ferdinand Bangayan at pp. 12-13, supra.).<br><br>"The autopsy conducted on the victim's body revealed that he sustained four (4) stab wounds: one on the left subpostal margin, another wound on the right subpostal margin, and two (2) sutured wounds on the left cocital area. The wound that was inflicted on the pancreas of the victim was considered fatal since it caused the massive hemorrhage. The cause of death was attributed to massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage due to multiple stab wounds (Testimony of Dr. Apolinar Vacalares, TSN, February 13, 1991, pp. 6-7)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote><u><em>Version of the Defense</em></u><br><br>For their part, appellants submit the following as the facts of the case:<br><blockquote>"On August 16, 1999, Ignacio Copino celebrated the town fiesta of Patag, Cagayan de Oro City at home with his family and friends, one of whom was Vincent Dejoras. After eating dinner at around 7:00 p.m., Dejoras, together with his co-workers, headed for home. Copino decided to accompany the group and at the Patag crossing, he was able to convince Dejoras to go to the 'perya' and gamble, as he had P30 with him.<br><br>"The pair lost all of the P30 in the 'pula-puti' game and decided to call it quits. On their way home, they saw Ramon Galos 'alias Panit' and Grom[yk]o Valiente 'alyas Bobong', two of their acquaintances, apparently having an altercation.<br><br>"They were about two meters from Galos and Valiente when Galos suddenly said: 'Nasi is here (referring to Copino), you hit him.' (Transcript of Stenographic Notes, VINCENT DEJORAS, Hearing April 4, 1991, page 7). Galos then kicked Valiente and the latter fell down. Valiente was able to get up and run towards an alley at the back of Dod's store with Galos in close pursuit. Copino and Dejoras ran after the two with the intention to pacify the fighters. Galos was able to corner Valiente and once again, the two traded blows. When Copino and Dejoras were finally able to catch up with the two, they noticed that Valiente was already bleeding. Eyewitness Silverio Bahian later recounted that he saw Panit pull out a bolo and stab Bobong.<br><br>"Dejoras, on his part, tried to stop Galos from inflicting more wounds and he too was wounded in the process. What happened was that instead of holding Galos' hand, he was able to hold the blade of the knife, thereby injuring himself. Galos then ran away. Upon the realization that his right hand was bloodied, and fearing that more harm would fall upon them, Copino and Dejoras too ran away.<br><br>"Dejoras went to City Hospital to have his wound treated and then they went home. At midnight of the same day, a policeman went to his house and brought him to the OKK Police Station where he was booked into the police blotter. The following day, Copino and Dejoras learned that Gromyko Valiente had died. Together with their parents the[y] went to the Tourism Hall to have their statements taken by the police."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote><center><u><strong>Ruling of the Trial Court</strong></u></center><br>The trial court ruled that (1) appellants were guilty of murder, as the killing was qualified by treachery; (2) conspiracy was proven by the chain of circumstantial evidence submitted; and (3) the aggravating circumstance of superior strength was absorbed by treachery and may no longer be used to increase the penalty to its maximum period.<br><br><center><u><strong>The Issues</strong></u></center><br>Appellants aver that the court <em>a quo</em> committed the following errors:<br><blockquote>"I. In failing to appreciate the testimony of accused-appellants and in giving full weight and credit to the version of prosecution witnesses.<br><br>II. In holding that there was conspiracy between accused-appellants.<br><br>III. In holding that accused-appellants herein [were] guilty as charged."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>We shall discuss the foregoing issues in the following sequence: (1) credibility of the prosecution evidence, (2) conspiracy and (3) proper penalty.<br><br><center><u><strong>The Court’s Ruling</strong></u></center><br>This appeal is partly meritorious. We affirm the challenged Decision in regard to Ignacio Cupino, but reverse it in regard to Vincent Dejoras.<br><br><center><u><strong>First Issue<br><em>Credibility of Prosecution Witnesses</em></strong></u></center><br>Appellants challenge the trial court’s assessment of the credibility of the prosecution witnesses. They argue that there are contradictions patent in their testimonies. We disagree. As we have repeatedly said, the trial court’s assessment of the credibility of witnesses is generally binding upon us.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> After a thorough review of the records before us, we find no reason to disagree with the trial court in finding no material inconsistency in the prosecution witnesses’ testimonies.<br><br>Neither are we impressed with appellants’ assertion that the evidence for the prosecution is weak.

Both of them showed their common intent to kill Valliente. On the part of Galos, conspiracy was shown by his act of grabbing the fleeing victim, simultaneously drawing his small bolo or <em>pisaw</em>, and stabbing the latter twice. By running after the wounded victim, Cupino showed unity of purpose with Galos. When he eventually caught up with the victim, Cupino pulled out the bolo that was embedded in the body of the latter and used it to stab him again. Clearly, by the consonance of their deeds, both assailants conspired to kill Valliente.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>We agree with the court <em>a quo</em> that treachery qualified the slaying to murder. By diverting the attention of Valliente to the approaching Dejoras and Cupino, Galos was obviously making sure that the victim could not defend himself. When Valliente turned his back, Galos began his attack, which eventually led to the stabbing of the former. Treachery was not necessarily precluded by either the occurrence of a tussle before the victim was killed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> or by the frontal nature of the attack.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> We also agree with the lower court that the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength was absorbed by alevosia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><center><u><strong>Second Issue<br><em>Conspiracy: Dejoras’ Liability</em></strong></u></center><br>Though we uphold the findings of the trial court with regard to Appellant Cupino, we differ with its conclusion that Appellant Dejoras was guilty.<br><br>It is axiomatic that the prosecution must establish conspiracy beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Conspiracy is not a harmless innuendo to be taken lightly or accepted at every turn. It is a legal concept that imputes culpability under specific circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> As such, it must be established as clearly as any element of the crime. The quantum of evidence to be satisfied is, we repeat, beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In <em>People v. Elijorde</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> a case with similar facts, we said:<br><blockquote>"Indeed, with respect to accused Reynaldo Punzalan, the Court cannot assert with moral certainty that he is guilty of murder. Conspiracy must be proved as indubitably as the crime itself through clear and convincing evidence, not merely by conjecture. To hold an accused guilty as a co-principal by reason of conspiracy, he must be shown to have performed an overt act in pursuance or furtherance of the complicity. Hence, conspiracy exists in a situation where at the time the malefactors were committing the crime, their actions impliedly showed unity of purpose among them, a concerted effort to bring about the death of the victim. In a great majority of cases, complicity was established by proof of acts done in concert, i.e., acts which yielded the reasonable inference that the doers thereof were acting with a common intent or design. Therefore, the task in every case is determining whether the particular acts established by the requisite quantum of proof do reasonably yield that inference." (Footnotes omitted)<br></blockquote>Thus, in <em>Elijorde</em> we found one of the accused, a certain Punzalan, innocent under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Similarly, in the present case, we find Appellant Vincent Dejoras not guilty.<br><br>Unlike the trial court, we are quite mindful of the testimony of Prosecution Eyewitness Bahian regarding Appellant Dejoras’ participation in that bloody incident on the eve of the <em>fiesta</em>. His answers to the propounded questions merely established that Dejoras joined Galos and Cupino when they approached the victim. The prosecution failed, however, to show what Dejoras specifically did that proved his participation in the conspiracy. Rather, what the said eyewitness said was that Dejoras tried to prevent Cupino from stabbing the victim, clearly showing that he did not support the criminal intent and conspiracy of the other two accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> These incontrovertible data lead to one conclusion: there is reasonable doubt on whether Dejoras conspired with Galos and Cupino in killing Valliente. We are therefore constrained to exonerate him. Indeed, guilt must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. In this case, there is reasonable doubt on the culpability of Appellant Dejoras as a principal.<br><br>Dejoras cannot be held liable as an accomplice, either.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In <em>Elijorde</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> we said:<br><blockquote>"The cooperation that the law punishes is the assistance knowingly or intentionally rendered which cannot exist without previous cognizance of the criminal act intended to be executed. It is therefore required in order to be liable either as a principal by indispensable cooperation or as an accomplice that the accused must unite with the criminal design of the principal by direct participation."<br></blockquote>The acts of Appellant Dejoras showed that he was not aware of his companions’ intent to kill Valliente; at the very least, there is reasonable doubt as to his knowledge thereof.

There is no other evidence to show unity of purpose and design between Punzalan and Elijorde in the execution of the killing, which is essential to establish conspiracy. His act of kicking Hierro prior to the actual stabbing by Elijorde does not of itself demonstrate concurrence of wills or unity of purpose and action. For it is possible that the accused Punzalan had no knowledge of the common design, if there was any, nor of the intended assault which was committed in a place far from where he was. The mere kicking does not necessarily prove intention to kill. The evidence does not show that Punzalan knew that Elijorde had a knife and that he intended to use is to stab the victim."
