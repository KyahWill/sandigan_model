				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the 
Rules of Court, petitioners seek the reversal of the 21 March 1997 
decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R. No. CV-38131.  The assailed decision set aside the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 dated 4 March 1992 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 
146 in Civil Case No. 7119 insofar as it dismissed the 
complaint-in-intervention of private respondent China Banking 
Corporation.
<p>The facts of the case are as follows:
</p><p>To finance the acquisition of seven (7) ocean-going vessels, 
namely M/V “Asean Liberty,” M/V “Asean Independence,” M/V “Asean 
Mission,” M/V “Asean Knowledge,” M/V “Asean Nations,” M/V “Asean 
Greatness,” and M/V “Asean Objectives,” the Philippine International 
Shipping Corporation (hereinafter “PISC”) applied for and was granted by
 petitioner National Investment and Development Corporation (hereinafter
 “NIDC”) the following guaranty accommodations:
</p><blockquote>
<ol start="" type="a"><li>  US$9.44 Million in favor of Ultrafin A.G. of Zurich, Switzerland 
as Agent for the banks/financial institutions as evidenced by and 
subject to the terms and conditions of a Guaranty Agreement dated 
December 7, 1978 to partly finance the acquisition of two (2) 
ocean-going vessels;
</li><li>  US$23.60 Million in favor of the Philippine National Bank 
(hereinafter “PNB” as evidenced by and subject to the terms and 
conditions of a Consolidated Amendatory Agreement dated January 25, 1979
 to finance the acquisition cost of four (4) additional ocean-going 
vessels; and
</li><li>  US$1.291 Million in favor of PNB as evidenced by and subject 
to the terms and conditions of that Second Consolidated Amendatory 
Agreement dated July 17, 1979 to finance the additional acquisition cost
 of one (1) ocean-going vessel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
</li></ol>
</blockquote>
<p>As security for these guaranty accommodations, PISC executed in favor of petitioners the following mortgage documents:
</p><blockquote>
<ol start="" type="a"><li>  Deed of Chattel Mortgage dated September 14, 1979 constituted on 
M/V “Asean Liberty” and M/V “Asean Nation” and recorded on September 25,
 1979 with the Philippine Coast Guard Headquarters;
</li><li>  Supplemental Chattel Mortgage dated October 2, 1979 
constituted on M/V “Asean Independence,” M/V “Asean Mission,” M/V “Asean
 Knowledge,” and M/V “Asean Objectives” and recorded with the Philippine
 Coast Guard Headquarters on February 13, 1980; and
</li><li>  Supplemental Chattel Mortgage constituted on M/V “Asean 
Greatness” and recorded with the Philippine Coast Guard Headquarters on 
February 3, 1981.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
</li></ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, on March 12, 1979, PISC entered into a Contract Agreement 
with Hong Kong United Dockyards, Ltd. for the repair and conversion of 
the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty” at a contract price of HK$2,200,000.00 
variable as provided therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
</p><p>On May 28, 1979, the Central Bank of the Philippines authorized 
PISC to open with private respondent China Banking Corporation 
(hereinafter “CBC”) a standby letter of credit for US$545,000.00 in 
favor of Citibank, N.A. (hereinafter “Citibank”) to cover the repair and
 partial conversion of the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty”.  This was 
pursuant to the letter of the Central Bank of the Philippines dated May 
28, 1979 as amended on June 20, 1979.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
</p><p>On June 15, 1979, PISC executed an Application and Agreement for 
Commercial Letter of Credit for $545,000.00 with private respondent CBC 
in favor of Citibank. Pursuant to this application and agreement, 
private respondent CBC issued on September 12, 1979 its Irrevocable 
Standby Letter of Credit No. 79/4174 for US$545,000.00 in favor of 
Citibank for account of PISC.
</p><p>On September 17, 1979, a Promissory note for US$545,000.00 was 
executed by PISC in favor of Citibank pursuant to the Loan Agreement for
 US$545,000.00 between PISC, as borrower, and Citibank, as lender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
</p><p>Upon failure of PISC to fulfill its obligations under the said 
promissory note, Citibank sent to private respondent CBC a letter dated 
March 25, 1983 drawing on Letter of Credit No. 79/4174.  In this letter,
 Citibank certified that the draft attached thereto for US$242,225.00 
represented the principal balance due to Citibank as of March 17, 1983 
under the promissory note executed by PISC, the proceeds of which were 
used for the repair and conversion of M/V Asean Liberty.  Thus, on March
 30, 1983, CBC instructed its correspondent Irving Trust Co., by cable, 
to pay to Citibank the amount of US$242,225.00.  On the same date, 
Irving Trust Co. advised private respondent CBC by mail that the amount 
of US$242,225.00 had been debited against CBC’s Account No. 8033278269 
and remitted to Citibank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
</p><p>On May 10, 1983, for failure of PISC to settle its obligations in
 the amount of US$64,789,470.96, petitioner PNB conducted, thru the 
Sheriff’s Office, an auction sale of the mortgaged vessels, except for 
the vessel M/V “Asean Objective.”  Petitioner NIDC emerged as the 
highest bidder in these auctions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
</p><p>On May 27, 1983, claiming that the foreclosure sale of its 
mortgaged vessels was illegal, unjust, irregular, and oppressive, PISC 
instituted before the Regional Trial Court of Makati, a civil case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> against petitioners for the annulment of the foreclosure and auction sale of its vessels and damages.
</p><p>As accurately narrated in the trial court’s Order and adopted by 
the Court of Appeals in its Decision of March 21, 1997, the following 
proceedings transpired in the lower court:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Records show that on May 27, 1983, PISC (Philippine International 
Shipping Corporation) filed suit against National Investment and 
Development Corporation (NIDC, for short) and Philippine National Bank 
(PNB, for short) for annulment of foreclosure of mortgage and auction 
sale with damages vis-à-vis the sale on foreclosure of vessels Asean 
Mission, Asean Knowledge, Asean Nations and Asean Greatness (as well as 
Asean Liberty and Asean Independence).  NIDC answered the complaint, and
 in an amended answer impleaded additional counterclaim defendants.  In 
an Order dated September 29, 1984, then Judge Jose L. Coscolluela, Jr. 
dismissed the complaint as against PNB and the counterclaimed 
defendants. And under date of November 3, 1986, the complaint itself 
against and the NIDC counterclaims were dismissed with prejudice. </p>
  <p>In the meantime, NIDC acquired the vessels as highest bidder in the
 foreclosure thereof initiated by PNB, NIDC having thereafter disposed 
of said vessels in favor of the National Steel Corporation (NSC).
  </p>
  <p>Complaints in intervention were filed by and for Unitor Ships 
Services PTE, Ltd., IMO Industries AB, UDDVALLARVARVET AB, Hyundai, 
Shipyard Co., Lloyd’s, China bank, Chiang Tung Enterprises Co., Ltd., 
Pan Asia, Inc., and HANMF Marine Service, Co., Ltd., for recovery upon 
maritime liens against the proceeds of the sale of the foreclosed 
vessels.  The parties concerned, except for intervenors Lloyd’s and 
China Bank, eventually submitted a Compromise Agreement dated July 12, 
1989, and made the basis for the Decision of August 23, 1989. </p>
  <p>As first stated, there now remain only Lloyd’s and China Bank 
claims in intervention, recovery upon which is covered by a PNB bank 
guarantee therefor if found matters of entitlement (sic) by said 
intervenors. </p>
  <p>Intervenor Lloyd’s claim is for ‘the service of herein intervenor 
Lloyd’s Register of Shipping to class aforementioned vessels (M/V Asean 
Nations and Asean Greatness) during the period covering July 22, 1981 to
 July 14, 1983 and the cost for said maritime surveys in the sum of 
HK$65,930.00, UKC10,363.45 and P9,653.00’ said to have been unpaid by 
PISC despite demands.  NIDC traversed the Lloyd’s claim as not being 
preferred maritime liens and in any event inferior in nature. </p>
  <p>Intervenor China Bank’s claims are predicated on (i) a China Bank 
Standby Letter of Credit in favor of Citibank, N. A. purportedly to 
cover repair and partial conversion of M/V Asean Liberty, to the extent 
of US$242,225.00 paid by China Bank to Citibank, and said to be now 
owing by PISC together with stipulated interest; (ii) a China Bank loan 
of US$2,700,000.00 as evidenced by a promissory note, the loan proceeds 
said to have allowed PISC to reduce overhead expenses and afford it 
competitive advantage in overseas shipping, and to pay for bunker fuel, 
defray port expenses and storage, container rental and insurance, as 
well as salaries and wages of crew members; and (iii) a China bank 
commercial letter of credit to PISC in favor of Bank of America, 
particularly a BA Draft for US$648,002.54 said to have been applied 
towards vessel repair and conversion by the China Shipbuilding 
Corporation of Taiwan, together with stipulated interests due from PISC.
  China Bank’s claims are premised on the above as being preferred 
maritime liens.  NIDC rejects said claims as not being maritime liens, 
much less preferred maritime liens. </p>
  <p>Shortly after the undersigned penning Judge assumed his duties in 
this Court, Lloyd’s and China Bank were enjoined to furnish opposite 
counsel with copies of the documentation of their respective claims, to 
obviate the necessity of adducing evidence in point on matters capable 
of stipulation.  Thus, failing formulation of any amicable settlement in
 the manner arrived at by all other intervenors, pre-trial proceedings 
for the subject last remaining claims in intervention by and for Lloyd’s
 and China Bank resulted in an August 9, 1991 Pre-Trial Order which set 
forth- </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>‘A. NATURE OF THE CASE </p>
    <p>Claimant-intervenor Lloyd’s Register of Shipping seeks recovery 
as unpaid creditor of HK$65,930., UK Pounds C10,363.45 and P9,653.00 as 
being in the nature of preferred maritime liens on the vessels M/V 
“ASEAN NATIONS” and “ASEAN GREATNESS”, representing costs for maritime 
services rendered for said vessels for the period July 22, 1981 to July 
14, 1983. </p>
    <p>Intervenor-claimant China Banking Corporation seeks recovery, as 
being in the nature of a preferred maritime lien, of the sum of 
US$3,890,227.53, representing the totality of loans extended by said 
intervenor-claimant said to have been expended in financing repair and 
conversion costs, for expenses and storage container rentals and 
insurance premium paid out by it.
    </p>
    <p>Plaintiffs admit the recoverability of said claims as being in 
the nature of preferred maritime liens, whereas PNB-NIDC contests the 
said claims.
    </p>
    <p>B. STIPULATIONS AND ADMISSIONS.
    </p>
    <p>Plaintiffs, PNB-NIDC and intervenor-claimant Lloyd’s Register of 
Shipping stipulate and admit that the totality of its claims as fully 
supported by documentation already verified by the parties are in the 
sums of HK$65,930,00, UKC10,363.45 and P9,653.00. </p>
    <p>Plaintiffs, PNB-NIDC and intervenor-claimant China Banking 
Corporation stipulate and admit that the totality of its claim is in the
 sum of US$3,870,227.53 as fortified by documentation already verified 
in point.
    </p>
    <p>C. ISSUES.
    </p>
    <p>The parties have agreed to limit the resolution of the last two 
remaining claims in intervention aforementioned to the following legal 
questions:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>i.          Whether or not said claims, in the context in which
 they sought to be recovered, are preferred maritime lien as would 
entitle said claims to recover, and
      </p>
      <p>ii.          Whether or not assuming recoverability thereon as 
being in the nature of maritime liens, such recovery may be allowed in 
relation with PNB’s being the mortgagee of the assets from which 
recovery is sought. </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Considering that the issues to be addressed are purely legal in 
nature, presentation of evidence and/or witnesses in point is 
unnecessary.’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the parties submitted their respective memoranda, the trial 
court issued on March 4, 1992 an Order dismissing the 
complaint-in-intervention filed by private respondent CBC for lack of 
merit.  In dismissing the complaint-in-intervention, the trial court 
ruled that the claim of private respondent CBC was not a preferred 
maritime lien but was merely a loan extended to PISC by CBC.
</p><p>Private respondent CBC appealed the Order of the trial court to 
the Court of Appeals.  In its appeal, private respondent CBC imputed the
 following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:
</p><blockquote>
<ol start="" type="a"><li>  the trial court erred in holding that the loans extended by China 
Banking Corporation to the Philippine International Shipping Corporation
 did not create maritime liens.
</li><li>  assuming that the loans are not themselves maritime liens, 
the trial court erred in holding that the China Banking Corporation did 
not acquire the maritime liens of Philippine International Shipping 
Corporation's creditors by subrogation.
</li></ol>
</blockquote>
<p>For its part, herein petitioners PNB/NIDC raised as an issue in its 
Appellee’s Brief before the Court of Appeals the lack of jurisdiction of
 the appellate court to entertain and pass upon the appeal interposed by
 CBC on the ground that the issues raised therein were purely legal; and
 that the appeal of CBC should have been lodged with the Supreme Court 
by petition for review on certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
</p><p>On March 21, 1997, the Court of Appeals promulgated its questioned decision, the dispositive portion of which states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“WHEREFORE, insofar as the appellant CBC is concerned, the appealed Order is hereby SET ASIDE and judgment is rendered: </p>
  <p>(a) Directing the appellee Philippine National Bank/National 
Investment and Development Corporation to pay the appellant China 
Banking Corporation from the proceeds of the foreclosure sale of M/V 
Asean Liberty the amount of US$242,225.00 or its Philippine Peso 
Equivalent at the time of payment, with interest thereon at the legal 
rate from November 7, 1984, the date of filing of CBC’s 
complaint-in-intervention, until fully paid; and </p>
  <p>(b) Ordering the appellee Philippine International Shipping 
Corporation to pay the same CBC the amounts of US$648,002.54 and US$2.7 
Million plus stipulated interests, arrangement fees, swap premiums, 
expenses, losses, taxes and penalties,
  </p>
  <p>xxx
  </p>
  <p>SO ORDERED.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the said decision, the appellate court held petitioners PNB/NIDC 
liable to CBC only for the amount of US$242,225.00, which was used for 
the repair and conversion of the M/V “Asean Liberty”, as it was only 
this amount which CBC was able to prove as being a preferred maritime 
lien.  Moreover, such amount was to be paid by petitioners PNB/NIDC from
 the proceeds of the foreclosure sale of the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty”.
 Private respondent CBC’s other claims of US$648,000.54 and US$2.7 
Million were found by the appellate court as not being in the nature of 
maritime liens and as such, recoverable only from PISC, not from herein 
petitioners PNB/NIDC.
</p><p>Not satisfied with the decision of the appellate court, 
petitioners PNB/NIDC institute the present petition for review on 
certiorari where they raise the following issues: 
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">I.
  </p>
  <p>WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS HAS APPELLATE JURISDICTION TO 
ENTERTAIN AND PASS UPON THE APPEAL INTERPOSED BY PRIVATE RESPONDENT CBC 
FROM THE ORDER OF THE TRIAL COURT OF MARCH 4, 1992 WHICH INVOLVED PURE 
QUESTIONS OF LAW.
  </p>
  <p align="center">II.
  </p>
  <p>WHETHER OR NOT PRIVATE RESPONDENT CBC’S CLAIM FOR US$242,225.OO AS 
EVIDENCED BY ITS IRREVOCABLE LETTER OF CREDIT NO. 79/4174 OF SEPTEMBER 
12, 1979 IS IN THE NATURE OF A MARITIME LIEN UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 
P.D. NO. 1521; AND IF SO, WHETHER OR NOT SAID MARITIME LIEN IS PREFERRED
 OVER THE MORTGAGE LIEN OF PETITIONER PNB/NIDC ON THE FORECLOSED VESSEL 
M/V “ASEAN LIBERTY”. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the first issue, petitioners argue that the Court of Appeals 
committed grave error in law in taking cognizance of the appeal 
interposed by private respondent CBC from the Order of the trial court 
dated 4 March 1992 involving as it does pure questions of law.  They 
claim that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to entertain and 
pass upon the appeal interposed by private respondent CBC as the issues 
raised therein are purely legal.  As such, petitioners continue, the 
appeal of CBC should have been lodged directly with the Supreme Court by
 way of petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised 
Rules of Court.  Citing the pronouncement of this Court <em>en banc</em> in  <em>Anacleto Murillo vs. Rodolfo Consul</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>,
 the petitioners conclude that the appeal made by private respondent CBC
 to the Court of Appeals should have been dismissed by the respondent 
court for lack of jurisdiction.
</p><p>It is true that the decisions of the Regional Trial Court may be 
directly reviewed by the Supreme Court on petition for review if pure 
questions of law are raised.  Circular 2-90,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 which petitioners cite and which outlined the applicable rules of 
procedure on this matter at that time, indirectly states that cases from
 the Regional Trial Court raising only questions of law should be taken 
to the Supreme Court.  Paragraphs No. 4(c) and (d) of the said Circular 
provide as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“4. Erroneous Appeals. – An appeal taken to either the Supreme 
Court of the Court of Appeals by the wrong or inappropriate mode shall 
be dismissed. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>xxx  xxx                              xxx
    </p>
    <p>(c) Raising issues purely of law in the Court of Appeals or 
appeal by wrong mode. – If an appeal under Rule 41 is taken from the 
Regional Trial Court to the Court of Appeals and therein the appellant 
raises only questions of law, the appeal shall be dismissed, issues 
purely of law not being reviewable by said court.  xxx </p>
    <p>(d) No transfer of appeals erroneously taken. – No transfers of 
appeals erroneously taken to the Supreme Court or to the Court of 
Appeals to whichever of these Tribunals has appropriate appellate 
jurisdiction will be allowed; continued ignorance or willful disregard 
of the law on appeals will not be tolerated.”
      </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>From the cited provisions, it is clear that the Court of Appeals does
 not have jurisdiction over appeals from the Regional Trial Court that 
raise purely questions of law.  Appeals of this nature should be raised 
to the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> 
Furthermore, transfer of erroneous appeals is not allowed and the 
tribunal which receives the erroneous appeal should perforce dismiss the
 same for lack of jurisdiction.
</p><p>Notwithstanding this legal rule, the appeal brought before the 
Court of Appeals by the private respondent CBC must first be analyzed as
 to whether the same raised questions or errors of law alone.  If the 
petition raised only questions of law, then the Court of Appeals had no 
jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case and should have dismissed 
the case outright.  On the other hand, if the petition raised only 
questions of fact or questions of both fact and law, then the Court of 
Appeals correctly exercised jurisdiction over the issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
</p><p>As such, even if, as in this case, the documentary evidence 
adduced by the parties was admitted without objection, a question of 
fact is still involved when the query necessarily invites the 
calibration of the whole evidence including the relevancy of surrounding
 circumstances and their relation to each other.
</p><p>On this point, we note with approval the following justification 
made by the respondent court in assuming jurisdiction over the case: 
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“A question of fact has been distinguished from a question of law in this wise: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>‘At this point, the distinction between a question of fact and a 
question of law must be clear.  As distinguished from a question of law 
which exists ‘when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is 
on certain state of facts’ – ‘there is a question of fact when the doubt
 or difference arises as to the truth or the falsehood of alleged 
facts;’ or when the query necessarily invites calibration of the whole 
evidence considering mainly the credibility of witnesses, existence and 
relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances, their relation to each 
other and to the whole and probabilities of the situation.’(Bernardo vs.
 Court of Appeals, 216 SCRA 224) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Stated differently, a question of law does not involve an 
examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the 
litigants or any of them; otherwise, if such examination and 
re-evaluation of the evidence is called for, a question of fact is 
raised.
  </p>
  <p>“In the decision from which the CBC appealed, the trial court 
primarily held that the former is a mere money lender and not a maritime
 lienor.  In its appeal, the CBC argues that in so holding, the trial 
court disregarded the maritime purposes for which the loans it extended 
to the Philippine International Shipping Corporation (PISC) were availed
 of and used.  The issue thus raised cannot be judiciously resolved 
without reviewing the probative weight of the evidence on record 
consisting in the main of the various documents, contracts and 
transactions attached to CBC’s complaint-in-intervention.  It is, 
therefore, indubitable that mixed questions of fact and of law are 
involved over which this Court has jurisdiction.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, in resolving the issues raised by private respondent in the 
Court of Appeals, the appellate court had to make a factual inquiry, 
among others, on the nature and terms of the contracts among the 
different parties, the relationship of the different parties with one 
another and with respect to the vessels involved in the case, how the 
proceeds of the loans were used, and the correct dates when the maritime
 and mortgage liens were constituted on the vessels.  The determination 
of these facts is crucial as it will resolve whether the amount advanced
 by respondent CBC is in the nature of a maritime lien and if so, 
whether the lien is superior to the mortgage lien of petitioners.  If 
the appellate court, in the exercise of its review power, finds that the
 amount advanced by CBC was used for the repair of the vessels, then a 
mortgage lien was indubitably established over the shipping vessels.  
Moreover, a determination of the dates when the respective liens of the 
parties were constituted over the vessels will answer the question as to
 which lien is preferred over the other.  In short, in order to address 
fully the issues raised by the parties in their pleadings, the appellate
 court necessarily had to make factual findings.
</p><p>Verily, the issues raised by private respondent in the appellate 
court were cognizable by the said court, the issues being mixed 
questions of fact and law.  Respondent court was therefore acting within
 its jurisdiction when it promulgated its questioned decision.
</p><p>The next issue brought up by petitioners is whether or not 
private respondent CBC’s claim for US$242,225.00 is in the nature of a 
maritime lien. It is the contention of petitioners that “(t)he Court of 
Appeals gravely erred in law in holding that private respondent CBC’s 
claim under its Standby Letter of Credit No. 79/4174 is a maritime lien,
 and that said maritime lien is preferred over the mortgage lien of 
petitioners PNB/NIDC on the foreclosed vessel M/V Asean Liberty.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
</p><p>The applicable law on the matter is Presidential Decree No. 1521,
 otherwise known as the Ship Mortgage Decree of 1978.  Sections 17 and 
21 of the said Presidential Decree provides as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“Sec. 17. <em>Preferred Maritime Liens, Priorities, Other Liens</em>
 – (a) Upon the sale of any mortgaged vessel in any extra-judicial sale 
or by order of a district court of the Philippines in any suit in rem in
 admiralty for the enforcement of a preferred mortgage lien thereon, all
 pre-existing claims on the vessel, including any possessory common-law 
lien of which a lienor is deprived under the provisions of Section 16 of
 this Decree, shall be held terminated and shall thereafter attach, in 
like amount and in accordance with the priorities established herein to 
the proceeds of the sale.  The preferred mortgage lien shall have 
priority over all claims against the vessel, except the following claims
 in the order stated: (1) expenses and fees allowed and costs taxed by 
the court and taxes due to the government; (2) crew’s wages; (3) general
 average; (4) salvage; including contract salvage; (5) maritime liens 
arising prior in time to the recording of the preferred mortgage; and 
(6) damages arising out of tort; and (7) preferred mortgage registered 
prior in time. </p>
  <p>(b) If the proceeds of the sale should not be sufficient to pay all
 creditors included in one number or grade, the residue shall be divided
 among them pro rata.  All credits not paid, whether fully or partially 
shall subsist as ordinary credits enforceable by personal action against
 the debtor.  The record of judicial sale or sale by public auction 
shall be recorded in the Record of Transfers &amp; Encumbrances of 
Vessels in the port of documentation.”
  </p>
  <p>“Sec. 21. <em>Maritime Lien for Necessaries; persons entitled to such lien</em>.
 – Any person furnishing repairs, supplies, towage, use of dry dock or 
maritime railway, or other necessaries to any vessel, whether foreign or
 domestic, upon the order of the owner, shall have a maritime lien on 
the vessel, which may be enforced by suit in rem, and it shall be 
necessary to allege or prove that credit was given to the vessel.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under these provisions, any person furnishing repairs, supplies, or 
other necessaries to a vessel on credit will have a maritime lien on the
 said vessel. Such maritime lien, if it arose prior to the recording of a
 preferred mortgage lien, shall have priority over the said mortgage 
lien.
</p><p>In the instant case, it was Hongkong United Dockyards, Ltd. which
 originally possessed a maritime lien over the vessel M/V “Asean 
Liberty” by virtue of its repair of the said vessel on credit.  Under 
the Contract Agreement dated March 12, 1979 between Hongkong United 
Dockyards, Ltd. and PISC, the former, as contractor, obligated itself to
 repair and convert the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty,” which was owned by 
PISC.  Section 7 of the said Agreement provides as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“(7) a)       The Owner will, before the commencement of work, 
provide an Irrevocable Documentary Credit for the Contract Price plus an
 estimate to cover the cost of extra work.  The banks and wording of the
 Credit are to be agreed by the Contractor. </p>
  <p>       b)       Payment will be:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1)        Before departure of vessel from Contractor’s yard: 20% of contract price; </p>
    <p>(2)        60 days from departure of vessel from Contractors yard:  40% of contract price;
    </p>
    <p>(3)        90 days from departure of vessel from Contractors yard: 40% of contract price.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
      </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The foregoing provision of the contract agreement indubitably shows 
that credit was given to the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty” by Hongkong 
United Dockyards, Ltd. and as a result, a maritime lien in favor of 
Hongkong United Dockyards, Ltd. was constituted on the said vessel by 
virtue of Section 21 of the Ship Mortgage Decree of 1978.
</p><p>It is the contention of private respondent CBC however, that it 
ultimately acquired the maritime lien of Hongkong United Dockyards, Ltd.
 over the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty”. As shown by the documentary 
evidence offered by private respondent CBC, its proof that it acquired 
said maritime lien is as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>(a) On March 12, 1979, PISC entered into a Contract Agreement with 
Hongkong United Dockyards, Ltd., as contractor, for the repair and 
conversion of its vessel M/V “Asean Liberty” for a contract price of 
HK$2,200,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>;
  </p>
  <p>(b) On May 28, 1979, the Central Bank of the Philippines approved 
PISC’s request to open with private respondent China Banking Corporation
 a Standby Letter of Credit for US$545,000.00 in favor of Hongkong 
United Dockyards, Ltd. This May 28, 1979 letter stated that the credit 
for US$545,000 would be used “to cover the partial conversion cost of 
the vessel ‘Asean Liberty’”. On June 20, 1979, the Central Bank approved
 the request of PISC to change the beneficiary of the said Standby 
Letter of Credit from Hongkong United Dockyards, Ltd. to Citibank<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>;
  </p>
  <p>(c) On June 15, 1979, PISC executed an Application and Agreement 
with private respondent CBC for the opening of a Standby Letter of 
Credit for US$545,000.00 in favor of Citibank, N.A., Makati, Metro 
Manila as beneficiary.  The agreement confirmed that the letter of 
credit would be used to guarantee the loan in the amount of 
US$545,000.00, the proceeds of which will be used “to finance partially 
the conversion cost of the vessel MV ‘ASIAN LIBERTY’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>;
  </p>
  <p>(d) On September 12, 1979, private respondent CBC issued an 
Irrevocable Standby Letter of Credit in favor of Citibank for any sum or
 sums not exceeding a total of US$545,000.00.  Per express terms of the 
Letter of Credit, its purpose was “to guarantee (Citibank’s) loan to 
Philippine International Shipping Corporation, the proceeds of which 
loan, according to accountee, are to finance partially the conversion 
cost of the vessel M/V ‘ASIAN LIBERTY’”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>;
  </p>
  <p>(e) Pursuant to its loan agreement with Citibank, PISC executed on 
September 17, 1979 a promissory note for US$545,000.00 in favor of 
Citibank, promising to pay the latter the principal sum of US$545,000.00
 in nine (9) consecutive semi-annual installments of US$60,555.00 
commencing one (1) year from date hereof or on September 17, 1980 until 
September 17, 1984<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>;
  </p>
  <p>(f) On March 25, 1983, Citibank sent a letter to private respondent
 CBC calling and drawing on CBC’s Letter of Credit No. 79/4174 and 
certifying that the draft attached thereto for US$242,225.00 represents 
the principal balance due to Citibank as of March 17, 1983 under PISC’s 
Promissory Note of September 17, 1979<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>.
 This March 25, 1983 letter likewise indicated that the loan due from 
PISC was used to finance partially the conversion cost of the vessel M/V
 “Asian Liberty”; </p>
  <p>(g) On March 30, 1983, private respondent CBC instructed by cable 
its correspondent, Irving Trust Co., to pay Citibank US$242,225.00. On 
the same date, Irving Trust Co., advised private respondent CBC by mail 
that the sum of US$242,225.00 was debited against CBC’s Account No. 
8033278269 and remitted to the Citibank Foreign Currency Deposit Unit, 
Makati<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>;
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the documentary evidence thus presented, it is clear that 
private respondent’s claim is predicated on the payment it made to 
Citibank by virtue of the Irrevocable Letter of Credit it established in
 the latter’s favor.  Per express provisions of the Letter of Credit, 
the same was established to “guarantee your (Citibank) loan in the 
principal amount of US$545,000.00 to Philippine International Shipping 
Corporation, the proceeds of which loan, according to accountee, are to 
finance partially the conversion cost of the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>
</p><p>In short, private respondent CBC was a guarantor of the loan 
extended by Citibank to PISC.  It was Citibank, which advanced the money
 to PISC.  It was only upon the failure of PISC to fulfill its 
obligations under its promissory note to Citibank that private 
respondent CBC was called upon by Citibank to exercise its duties under 
the Standby Letter of Credit.
</p><p>It is the holding of the appellate court, however, that private 
respondent stepped into the shoes of Hongkong United Dockyards, Ltd. by 
legal subrogation and thus acquired the maritime lien of the latter over
 the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty.”  Thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>“It is not disputed that CBC’s claim for US$242,225.00 and 
US$648,002.54 refer to the repair and conversion of two (2) of PISC’s 
vessels, namely M/V Asean Liberty and M/V Asean Mission, undertaken by 
Hongkong United Dockyards, Ltd. and the China Shipbuilding Corporation 
of Taiwan, respectively, upon the order of the owner, as deposed by 
George Lim, the President of the PISC.  Such being the case, maritime 
liens on the vessels concerned arose conformably with the aforequoted 
provision of Section 21 of P.D. No. 1521.  True it is that under the law
 the persons entitled to the lien are the Hongkong United Dockyards, 
Ltd. and the China Shipbuilding Corporation of Taiwan, they being the 
ones who furnished the repair works.  However, since it was CBC who paid
 off these lienors, it stepped into the shoes of the latter by 
subrogation.  This is the prevailing doctrine in American jurisprudence 
which holds that: ‘A creditor who advances money specifically for the 
purpose of discharging a maritime lien is subrogated to the lienor’s 
rights.’  Significantly, the Federal Maritime Lien Act, like our Ship 
Mortgage Decree of 1978, provides that, ‘any person furnishing repairs, 
supplies, towage, use of drydock or marine railway, or other 
necessaries, to any foreign or domestic vessel on the order of the owner
 of such vessel, or of a person authorized by the owner of such vessel, 
or of a person authorized by the owner has a maritime lien on the vessel
 which may be enforced by suit in rem.’ The only difference is that 
under the Federal Maritime Lien Act, it is not necessary to allege or 
prove that the credit was given to the vessel.  Hence, insofar as the 
creation of the lien and the persons entitled to the lien are concerned,
 American jurisprudence is highly persuasive.  Furthermore, Article 1302
 (2) of our Civil Code explicitly provides: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>‘Art. 1302 (2).  It is presumed that there is legal subrogation: </p>
    <p align="center">xxx  xxx                              xxx
    </p>
    <p>(2) When a third person not interested in the obligation pays with the express or tacit approval of the debtor;
    </p>
    <p align="center">xxx  xxx                              xxx.’
      </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Accordingly, since CBC’s payment to the lienors was with the 
express consent of the debtor owner of the vessels repaired, legal 
subrogation took place in CBC’s favor.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Petitioners do not question the abovequoted rationale of the Court of
 Appeals.  It takes exception however to the appellate court’s finding 
and conclusion that it was ultimately private respondent CBC which paid 
off the maritime lienor and that the US$545,000.00 advanced by Citibank 
was actually paid to the persons who furnished the repairs on the 
vessels.  On this point, petitioners argue that the entirety of the 
documentary evidence of private respondent CBC does not show that the 
latter actually paid off the maritime lienholder for the repair of M/V 
“Asean Liberty” as required by Section 21 of the Ship Mortgage Act of 
1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Furthermore, 
petitioners claim that the respondent court committed serious error in 
law when it considered and gave credence to the written deposition of 
Mr. George Lim, the President of PISC, as basis for the said finding 
considering that the same had earlier been denied admission by the trial
 court.
</p><p>There is no merit in the contentions of petitioners.
</p><p>The provisions of our Ship Mortgage Decree of 1978 were patterned quite closely after the U.S. Ship Mortgage Act of 1920.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>
 Significantly, the Federal Maritime Lien Act of the United States, like
 our Ship Mortgage Decree of 1978, provides that “any person furnishing 
repairs, supplies, towage, use of drydock, or marine railway, or other 
necessaries, to any foreign or domestic vessel on the order of the owner
 of such vessel, or of a person authorized by the owner has a maritime 
lien on the vessel, which may be enforced by suit in rem.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>
 Being of foreign origin, the provisions of the Ship Mortgage Decree of 
1978 may thus be construed with the aid of foreign jurisprudence from 
which they are derived except insofar as they conflict with existing 
laws or are inconsistent with local customs and institutions.
</p><p>As held by the public respondent Court of Appeals, those who 
provide credit to a master of a vessel for the purpose of discharging a 
maritime lien also acquire a lien over the said vessel.  Under American 
jurisprudence, “(f)urnishing money to a master in good faith to obtain 
repairs or supplies or to remove liens, in order to forward the voyage 
of the vessel, raises a lien just as though the things (for which) money
 was obtained to pay for had been furnished by the lender.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>
 Likewise, “(a)dvances to discharge maritime liens create a lien on the 
vessel, and one advancing money to discharge a valid lien gets a lien of
 equal dignity with the one discharged.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
 There is no reason why these doctrines cannot be given persuasive 
application in the instant case considering that they do not violate or 
contravene any of our existing laws.  Moreover, as pointed out by the 
appellate court, these doctrines are in accord with our provisions on 
subrogation particularly Art. 1302, paragraph 2 of the New Civil Code 
which provides that there is legal subrogation “when a third person, not
 interested in the fulfillment in the obligation, pays with the express 
or tacit approval of the debtor.”
</p><p>Under these doctrines, a person who extends credit for the 
purpose of discharging a maritime lien is not entitled to the said lien 
“where the funds were not furnished to the ship on the order of the 
master and there was no evidence that the money was actually used to pay
 debts secured by the lien.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>
 As applied in the instant case, it becomes necessary to prove that the 
credit advanced by Citibank to PISC was actually utilized for the repair
 and conversion of the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty.” Otherwise, Citibank 
could not have acquired the maritime lien of Hongkong United Dockyards, 
Ltd. over the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty.”
</p><p>On this point, we agree with the position of private respondent 
that the question of whether or not the proceeds of the loans extended 
by Citibank were used for the repair and conversion of M/V “Asean 
Liberty” is a factual issue<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> which the Court cannot review absent a showing that it was arbitrarily resolved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>
</p><p>Contrary to the assertions of petitioners, the records are 
replete with documents that show that the proceeds of the loans were 
used for the repair and conversion of the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty.” 
Even without the written deposition of Mr. George Lim, there is still 
sufficient documentary evidence in the records supporting the appellate 
court’s findings.  The correspondences between PISC and the Central 
Bank, the Application and Agreement, and the Standby Letter of Credit 
itself explicitly state that the proceeds of the loan applied for by 
PISC are to be used to finance partially the conversion cost of the 
vessel M/V “Asean Liberty.”  Moreover, the March 25, 1983 letter of 
Citibank to private respondent CBC drawing on the latter’s letter of 
credit, confirmed that the loan due from PISC was used to finance 
partially the conversion cost of the said vessel.
</p><p>In the presence of such documentary evidence, which were admitted
 without objection from the petitioners, we cannot say that the Court of
 Appeals resolved the issue arbitrarily.  The appellate court’s finding 
that the amount sought to be recovered by petitioner was actually used 
for the repair and conversion of the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty” is based
 on substantial evidence.
</p><p>From the foregoing, it is clear that the amount used for the 
repair of the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty” was advanced by Citibank and 
was utilized for the purpose of paying off the original maritime lienor,
 Hongkong United Dockyards, Ltd.  As a person not interested in the 
fulfillment of the obligation between PISC and Hongkong United 
Dockyards, Ltd., Citibank was subrogated to the rights of Hongkong 
United Dockyards, Ltd. as maritime lienor over the vessel, by virtue of 
Article 1302, par. 2 of the New Civil Code.  By definition, subrogation 
is the transfer of all the rights of the creditor to a third person, who
 substitutes him in all his rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>
 Considering that Citibank paid off the debt of PISC to Hongkong United 
Dockyards, Ltd. it became the transferee of all the rights of Hongkong 
United Dockyards, Ltd. as against PISC, including the maritime lien over
 the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty.”
</p><p>Private respondent CBC, as guarantor, was itself subrogated to 
all the rights of Citibank as against PISC, the latter’s debtor.  
Article 2067 of the New Civil Code provides that “(t)he guarantor who 
pays is subrogated by virtue thereof to all the rights which the 
creditor had against the debtor.” Private respondent, having paid off 
the debt of PISC to Citibank, was therefore, subrogated to all the 
rights Citibank had against its debtor PISC.  Considering that Citibank 
had a maritime lien over the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty,” private 
respondent was likewise subrogated to this right when it paid off 
Citibank under the contract of guarantee.
</p><p>Having thus established that private respondent CBC possessed a 
maritime lien over the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty,” the next issue is 
whether the said maritime lien is preferred over the mortgage lien of 
petitioners.
</p><p>In the case at bench, petitioners’ mortgage lien arose on 
September 25, 1979 when the said mortgage was registered with the 
Philippine Coast Guard Headquarters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>
 As such, in order for the maritime lien of private respondent CBC to be
 preferred over the mortgage lien of petitioners, the same must have 
arisen prior to the recording of the mortgage on September 25, 1979.
</p><p>On this point, petitioners argue that inasmuch as the Standby 
Letter of Credit was in the nature of a guarantee, the right of private 
respondent CBC to claim or to collect the maritime lien arose only at 
the time CBC actually paid off the said lien to Citibank on March 30, 
1983.  Otherwise stated, it is the contention of petitioners that 
private respondent CBC’s maritime lien under its Standby Letter of 
Credit No. 79/4174 arose only on March 30, 1983 when CBC actually paid 
off the outstanding obligation of PISC to Citibank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>
 Considering that its mortgage lien arose on September 25, 1979, 
petitioners thus conclude that its lien is preferred as against private 
respondent CBC’s maritime lien.
</p><p>There is no merit in this contention.
</p><p>As stated by a noted commentator on the subject, a maritime lien 
“constitutes a present right of property in the ship, a jus in re, to be
 afterward enforced in admiralty by process <em>in rem</em>.  From the 
moment the claim or privilege attaches, it is inchoate, and when carried
 into effect by legal process, by a proceeding <em>in rem</em>, it relates back to the period when it first attached.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>
</p><p>In the case at bench, the maritime lien over the vessel M/V 
“Asean Liberty” arose or was constituted at the time Hongkong United 
Drydocks, Ltd. made repairs on the said vessel on credit.  As such, as 
early as March 12, 1979, the date of the contract for the repair and 
conversion of M/V “Asean Liberty,” a maritime lien had already attached 
to the said vessel. When Citibank advanced the amount of US$242,225.00 
for the purpose of paying off PISC’s debt to Hongkong United Dockyards, 
Ltd., it acquired the existing maritime lien over the vessel.  When 
private respondent honored its contract of guarantee with Citibank on 
March 30, 1983, it likewise acquired by subrogation the maritime lien 
that was already existing over the vessel M/V “Asean Liberty.”  Thus, 
when private respondent CBC chose to exercise its right to the maritime 
lien during the proceedings in the trial court, it was actually 
enforcing a privilege that attached to the ship as early as March 12, 
1979.
</p><p>The maritime lien of private respondent CBC thus arose prior in 
time to the recording of petitioners’ mortgage on September 25, 1979.  
As such, the said maritime lien has priority over the said mortgage 
lien.  Pursuant to Section 17 of the Ship Mortgage Decree of 1978, a 
“preferred mortgage lien shall have priority over all claims against the
 vessel” except, among others, “maritime liens arising prior in time to 
the recording of the preferred mortgage.” The respondent court thus 
committed no reversible error when it ruled that the maritime lien of 
private respondent CBC is superior to the mortgage lien of petitioners.
</p><p><strong>WHERFORE</strong>, in view of the foregoing, the petition
 is denied and the decision of the Court of Appeals dated March 21, 1997
