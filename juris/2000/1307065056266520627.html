Tanod Venancio Dacallos brought Roselle Labenia to the barangay hall because of her complaint that she was raped by her uncle Oscar Nogar; that at about 7:30 o'clock in the evening, upon instruction of the barangay captain, he and some barangay tanods went to the house of Oscar Nogar and invited him to go with them to the barangay hall; that when told about the complaint of Roselle, Oscar did not say anything; that, thereafter, Oscar Nogar was brought to the police headquarters in Pasig City; that Roselle was brought to the PNP CLS, Camp Crame, Quezon City for medico-legal examination.<br><br>"Dr. Jesusa Vergara of the PNP CLS, who examined Roselle on February 14, 1996, prepared and submitted a Medico-Legal Report with the following findings:<br><blockquote>"`<u>GENERAL AND EXTRAGENITAL:</u><br><br>- Fairly nourished, fairly developed and coherent female child.

The trial court rejected these documents as being of doubtful probative value. It observed that the Certificate of Live Birth was filed only on 24 July 1996 or after the filing of the Information in this case; the "baptismal certificate" was a mere certification by the Parish Registrar, Mr. Edgar S. Amistoso, and the Parish Priest, Rev. Rolando M. Guiuan, to the effect that the baptismal record of Roselle could not be found in the office of the parish but that "according to some reliable persons" she was baptized on 16 July 1984; and the progress report card for the school year 1992-1993, stating that Roselle was 10-1/4 years old, did not indicate the person who supplied the information. Be that, as it might be, Roselle herself testified that she was over twelve (12) years old at the time of the commission of the offense.<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">"CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ATTY.

Accused-appellant claims that because the information has also alleged the sexual intercourse with Roselle Labenia to have been "against her will and consent," the Information, in effect, has charged not one but two offenses which violates the proscription in Section 13, Rule 110, of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure against duplicity of offenses. The Court need not belabor this issue. If accused-appellant feels there has been such an infringement, it is now too late in the day for him to still challenge the duplicitous character of the Information. This kind of an objection should be raised in a motion to quash before a plea to the Information is made; otherwise, like here, the defect is deemed waived,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; and the court, pursuant to Section 3 of Rule 120, of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure, could convict the accused of as many offenses as are charged and proved and thereupon impose on him the penalty for each and every one of them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The real point of contention is whether, based on the testimony of the witnesses and the evidence presented, the conviction of accused-appellant can be sustained by this appeal.<br><br>This Court will disturb the factual findings of a trial court only when the latter evidently has overlooked, misapprehended or misapplied facts of weight and substance which, if properly considered, would warrant a different conclusion and justify an acquittal of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Unfortunately for accused-appellant, the Court finds nothing in the records that can support a judgment different from that reached by the trial court.<br><br>True, the testimony of Roselle was not without any inconsistency. She stated that four children were in the room with her<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; but, in a subsequent account, she said that five, instead of four, children were with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; She averred that she was born on 05 October 1983<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; but later said that she did not know her exact age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Nevertheless, these minor inconsistencies did not adversely affect Roselle's testimony; on the contrary, it strengthened, rather than impaired, her credibility,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; by effectively erasing any suspicion of a rehearsed testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The victim was a young woman, barely in her teens, when subjected to an assault on her innocence, and she should not be expected to narrate vividly her sad experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0,

Time and again, the Court has declared that lust is no respecter of time and place<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; and rape can be committed even in places where people congregate: in parks, along the roadside, within the school premises, inside a house where there are several occupants and even in the same room where other members of the family are sleeping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>It is also not required, for the commission of rape, that there be marks of physical violence on the victim's body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Intimidation is addressed to the mind of the victim and, being subjective, its presence cannot be tested by any hard and fast rule but should, instead, be viewed in the light of the victim's perception and judgment at the time of the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; The moral influence of accused-appellant over the victim, such as in this case, could even be enough in cowering the young girl to submission.<br><br>The defense of <i>alibi</i> proffered by accused-appellant is unacceptable. <i>Alibi</i> cannot prevail over the positive identification made by the victim of her offender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Moreover, accused-appellant has failed to prove physical impossibility on his part of being present at the time and place of commission of the crime. As has so aptly been pointed out by the trial court, "at midnight or early in the morning when vehicular traffic is very light the distance between Pasig City and the Navotas Fish Port can be negotiated in less than an hour."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Finally, the Court must deny to the defense any significant value on the supposed letter of Roselle to her uncle asking for forgiveness. Apparently, the letter has merely been copied by the victim from another letter at the instructions of another uncle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; The letter, moreover, merely states the phrases, "<i>pasinsiya na po kayo</i>," "<i>mali pala ako,</i>" and "<i>(p)atawad po,</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; without specifying what it is that she asks forgiveness for.<br><br>The Court agrees, however, with accused-appellant, as well as the Office of the Solicitor General, that the penalty of death could not be imposed in this case. The special qualifying circumstance of the relationship of accused-appellant with the victim has not at all been alleged in the Information for it to be considered in the imposition of the death penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In line with prevailing jurisprudence, an additional award of civil indemnity <i>ex delicto</i> of P50,000.00, aside from the P50,000.00 moral damages, should be awarded in favor of the victim.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City, Branch 166, finding Oscar Nogar y Maceda guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION by reducing the penalty of death imposed by the court <i>a quo</i> to <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> and granting an additional award, aside from the P50,000.00 moral damages given by the trial court, of civil indemnity in the like amount of P50,000.00.
