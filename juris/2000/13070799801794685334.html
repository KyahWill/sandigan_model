				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the <i>Partial Decision</i> of the Regional Trial Court finding accused LOURDES GAMBOA alias <i>Des</i> or <i>Lourdes Gamboa y Golfe guilty of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale</i> under RA 8042, otherwise known as <i>The Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995</i>, and imposing upon her life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>From March 1996 to August 1997 the four (4) accused led by Bonifacio Miñoza and Melba Miñoza promised overseas employment for a fee to complaining witnesses Marissa Balina, Anna Marie Pili, Romulo Macaraeg, Ernesto Magadan, Domingo Magadan, Jr., Roger Castro and Nemia Beri. The accused were then holding office at Room 302, Ermita Building, Arquiza St., Ermita, Manila, where they conducted most of their recruitment activities. To entice complainants the accused represented to them that they were affiliated with Bemil Management Trading and Manpower Services, a duly licensed recruitment agency, and that they had the capacity to send workers to Taiwan, Brunei and Japan. Thus, on different dates, complainants went to the office of the accused and filed their applications together with their NBI Clearances, pictures and other supporting documents. The accused then collected from them placement fees: (a) Marissa Balina, P40,000.00, (b) Anna Marie Pili, P40,000.00, (c) Romulo Macaraeg, P25,000.00, (d) Ernesto Magadan, P20,000.00, (e) Domingo Magadan, Jr., P20,000.00, (f) Roger Castro, P24,000.00, and (g) Nemia Beri, P10,000.00, in addition to P900.00 for medicare and P70.00 for Pre-Departure Orientation Seminar (PREDOS).<br><br>However, despite the promises and assurances made by the accused, not one of the complainants was deployed for employment abroad, nor were they able to recover the money they paid to the accused. Hence, complainants lodged separate complaints against the accused before the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On 15 August 1997 PNP Senior Inspector Ligaya Cabal of the POEA-CIG Task Force Anti-Illegal Recruitment spearheaded a police operation to entrap the accused. Elements of the PNP together with some members of the media proceeded to Ermita Building and placed it under surveillance. Police Officer Cabal, who was in civilian clothes, went alone to the office of the accused in the third floor and posed as a job applicant. The accused inquired if she was applying as there was a vacancy for chambermaid in Brunei. When Officer Cabal answered yes, the accused forthwith furnished her bio-data and visa application forms and instructed her to fill them up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Officer Cabal promptly accomplished the bio-data and application forms. To obviate any suspicion on the part of the accused as to her true identity, she used the assumed name "Joy S. Garcia."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; The accused then required Officer Cabal to pay the initial amount of P1,500.00 for medical and processing fees. At the instruction of the accused, a certain Teresita Reyoberos received the marked money from Officer Cabal and issued the corresponding receipt therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; The police dragnet having been laid, Officer Cabal with the use of her cellular phone made the pre-arranged signal to the police operatives waiting outside the building that the marked money had been delivered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; Accused Lourdes Gamboa and Teresita Reyoberos were thus apprehended, but the rest of their cohorts eluded arrest and remained at large.<br><br>Later, however, Teresita Reyoberos was not included in the criminal information after State Prosecutor Zenaida M. Lim found that she was also a job applicant at the office of the accused who merely acceded to the request of accused Melba Miñoza to temporarily man the office in her absence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; Consequently, only Lourdes Gamboa was hailed to court and indicted for <i>Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale.</i><br><br>In convicting accused-appellant Lourdes Gamboa of the crime charged, the trial court held -<br><blockquote>x x x x the proofs adduced by the prosecution have clearly and conclusively demonstrated that the accused, conspiring and confederating with three others, has offered, enlisted and promised overseas employment to [complainants]. Against the mass of evidence arrayed by the prosecution, all that the accused could offer was her bare and unconfirmed denials and explanation x x x x The court, however, is not inclined to uphold and sustain the denials and explanations of the accused, which are negative in character and self-serving in nature. Her unconfirmed version cannot, certainly, outweigh and command greater evidentiary measure than the overwhelming testimonies of the People’s principal witnesses, who narrated in vivid and clear-cut details the various aspects of her recruitment and placement activities.<br><br>x x x x the evidence for the People has likewise conclusively established that the accused is neither personally licensed nor authorized by the POEA to recruit workers for overseas employment (Exhibit B). Although the defense has shown that the license and authority of the Bemil Management Trading and Manpower Services to recruit, process and deploy land-based workers had been renewed and validated for the period from October 26, 1995 to October 25, 1997 (Exhibit 11), the evidence clearly indicates that the accused was neither an employee of, nor was she connected with, the said management and manpower services. It was not also proved that any of her cohorts from whom the accused derived her authority to recruit workers were authorized personnel of Bemil, notwithstanding the fact that the POEA has records of the officers and employees of Bemil from the highest to the lowest.</blockquote>In this appeal, accused-appellant faults the court <i>a quo</i> in finding her guilty of <i>Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale.</i> The centerpiece of her defense is three-fold: <i>first</i>, the prosecution failed to prove conspiracy between her and the other accused; <i>second</i>, she was not responsible for the recruitment of the complaining witnesses nor for their non-deployment abroad since she was also a job applicant herself at the office of the other accused and was merely utilized as a worker thereat while waiting for her deployment abroad, just like Teresita Reyoberos; and <i>third</i>, she cannot be held liable for illegal recruitment since she never represented to the complainants that she had the capacity to send them abroad for employment.<br><br>We find no reason to reverse accused-appellant’s conviction, hence, we affirm.<br><br>Preliminarily, the proliferation of illegal job recruiters and syndicates preying on innocent people anxious to obtain employment abroad is one of the primary considerations that led to the enactment of <i>The Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; Aimed at affording greater protection to overseas Filipino workers, it is a significant improvement on existing laws in the recruitment and placement of workers for overseas employment. Otherwise known as the Magna Carta of OFWs, it broadened the concept of illegal recruitment under the Labor Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; and provided stiffer penalties thereto, especially those that constitute economic sabotage, i.e., <i>Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and Illegal Recruitment Committed by a Syndicate.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In a litany of cases we held that to constitute <i>Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale</i> three (3) elements must concur: (a) the offender has no valid license or authority required by law to enable him to lawfully engage in recruitment and placement of workers; (b) the offender undertakes any of the activities within the meaning of "recruitment and placement" under Art. 13, par. (b), of the Labor Code, or any of the prohibited practices enumerated under Art. 34 of the same Code (now Sec. 6 of RA 8042); and, (c) the offender committed the same against three (3) or more persons, individually or as a group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, there can be no question that the foregoing elements were sufficiently proved by the prosecution. The POEA certified that accused Melba Miñoza and her group, which included accused-appellant Lourdes Gamboa, were neither licensed nor authorized to recruit workers for overseas employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; That they recruited seven (7) persons - herein complaining witnesses Marissa Balina, Anna Marie Pili, Romulo Macaraeg, Ernesto Magadan, Domingo Magadan, Jr., Roger Castro and Nemia Beri - not to mention Police Officer Ligaya Cabal, who disguised herself as a job applicant, whom accused-appellant likewise attempted to recruit. Evidently, the illegal recruiters gave complainants the impression that they had the power and ability to send the latter to work in various foreign destinations, when in fact they had none. Relying on their assurances and promises of employment abroad, complainants, with much hope and expectation for immediate deployment, agreed to part with their hard-earned money to expedite the processing and approval of their applications.<br><br>We find no cogent reason likewise to disturb the lower court’s findings on the existence of a conspiracy since each accused played a part in the recruitment of complainants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, the testimonies of the complaining witnesses indubitably show a delineation of roles among the accused. Bonifacio Miñoza and Melva Miñoza were the managers/heads of the illegal recruitment office. Gloria Sarmiento was the field recruiter actively enlisting prospective job applicants together with Bonifacio and Melba Miñoza. Accused-appellant Lourdes Gamboa was the office assistant who answered the queries of applicants and performed clerical work. Conspiracy to defraud aspiring overseas contract workers was evident from the acts of the malefactors whose conduct before, during and after the commission of the crime clearly indicated that they were one in purpose and united in its execution. Direct proof of previous agreement to commit a crime is not necessary as it may be deduced from the mode and manner in which the offense was perpetrated or inferred from the acts of the accused pointing to a joint purpose and design, concerted action and community of interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; As such, all the accused, including accused-appellant, are equally guilty of the crime of illegal recruitment since in a conspiracy the act of one is the act of all.<br><br>Accused-appellant assails the factual basis of the trial court in ruling that she engaged in illegal recruitment, arguing that she was just an applicant herself whom accused Melba Miñoza utilized to help in the office work while waiting for deployment abroad. Her active participation however in the illegal recruitment process belies her profession of innocence.

recruitment scheme is very clear from the foregoing testimonies. She was present when the complainants were being recruited and in fact personally recruited some of them, providing and assisting them in filling up the application forms, answering their queries, receiving documents and payments, and repeatedly assuring them that they would be able to leave for their respective jobs abroad. These acts demonstrated beyond any cavil of doubt that she was a <i>knowing</i> and <i>willing</i> participant in the recruitment activities of Melba Miñoza and her group.<br><br>Moreover, accused-appellant’s bare denials and self-serving assertion that she was a mere job applicant herself certainly cannot prevail over the positive assertions of Officer Cabal and the complainants who had no ill motive to testify falsely against her.<br><br>At any rate, the lack of criminal intent on the part of an accused - assuming <i>ex-gratia argumenti</i> that accused-appellant was indeed unaware of the illegal nature of the recruitment business of her co-accused - is hardly a defense in the prosecution for illegal recruitment. It must be emphasized that <i>Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale</i> penalized under <i>The Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995</i>, a special law, is <i>malum prohibitum</i> and not <i>malum in se</i>. The criminal intent of the accused is not necessary and the fact alone that the accused violated the law warrants her conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant next insists that she did not represent to complainants or to Officer Cabal that she has the capacity to send them for overseas employment. That when she asked Officer Cabal, then disguised as a job applicant, “if she was applying, the vacancy is for chambermaid in Brunei,” she was merely echoing some facts known to her but was not in any way giving Officer Cabal any false representation. We are not persuaded. Suffice it to say that an illegal recruiter need not expressly represent to the victim that she has the ability to send workers abroad. It is enough that she gives the <i>impression</i> of her ability to enlist workers for job placement abroad in order to induce them to tender payment of fees, as what accused-appellant had done to the complainants in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Finally, it is doctrinal that the trial court’s evaluation of the testimony of witnesses is accorded the highest respect, for the trial court has an untrammeled opportunity to observe directly the demeanor of a witness on the stand and, thus, to determine whether he or she is telling the truth. Such assessment is generally binding on this Court, except when the same has been reached arbitrarily; or when the trial court has overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which could have affected the result of the case.<br><br>Considering therefore the evidence extant on record, we fully agree with the trial court that accused-appellant, in conspiracy with the other accused in this case, engaged in a recruitment business which, as herein discussed, was illegal and in large scale. Section 7 of RA 8042 prescribes the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of not less than P500,000.00 nor more than P1,000,000.00 in cases where the illegal recruitment constitutes an offense involving economic sabotage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, the alarming incidents of such nefarious crime rationalizes the imposition of severe penalties under the axiom that extreme situations require extreme remedies.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the assailed <i>Partial Decision</i> of the trial court dated 18 August 1998 convicting accused-appellant Lourdes Gamboa alias <i>Des</i> or <i>Lourdes Gamboa y Golfe of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale</i>, sentencing her to life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00, and ordering her to restitute the sums of money collected from the complainants in this case in the total amount of P179,970.00, is <b>AFFIRMED</b>.
