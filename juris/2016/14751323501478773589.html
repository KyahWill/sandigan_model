The respondents even manifested their strict compliance with these rules, including those in the UN-FAO Guidelines on Good Practice for Aerial Application of Pesticides (Rome 2001). We should note that the Rome 2001 guidelines require the pesticide applicators to observe the standards provided therein to ensure the health and safety of plantation workers. As such, there cannot be any imbalance between the right to health of the residents vis-a-vis the workers even if a ban will be imposed against aerial spraying and the consequent adoption of other modes of pesticide treatment.<br><br>Furthermore, the constitutional right to health and maintaining environmental integrity are privileges that do not only advance the interests of a group of individuals.

Petitioners-appellants claim that it was physically impossible for them to shift to "truck-mounted boom spraying" within three (3) months before the aerial spraying ban is actually enforced. They cited the testimony of Dr. Maria Emilia Rita G. Fabregar, Ph.D, PBGEA Chairperson, to the effect that since banana plantations in Davao City were configured for aerial spraying, the same lack the road network to make "truck-mounted boom spraying" possible. According to Dr. Fabregar, it was impossible to construct such road networks in a span of three (3) months. Engr. Magno P. Porticos, Jr., confirmed that the shift demands the construction of three hundred sixty (360) linear kilometers of road which cannot be completed in three (3) months.<br><br>In their separate testimonies, Dr. Fabregar and Engr. Porticos explained that a shift to "truck-mounted boom spraying" requires the following steps which may be completed in three (3) years:<br><blockquote>1. six (6) months for planning the reconfiguration of banana plantations to ensure effective truck-mounted boom spraying for the adequate protections of the plantations from the Black Sigatoka fungus and other diseases, while maximizing land use;<br><br>2. two (2) months to secure government permits for infrastructure works to be undertaken thereon;<br><br>3. clearing banana plants and dismantling or reconstructing fixed infrastructures, such as roads, drains, cable ways, and irrigation facilities, which phase may be completed in eighteen (18) months;<br><br>4. importation and purchase of trucks mounted with boom spraying, nurse trucks and protective gears.

To compel petitioners-appellants to abandon aerial spraying in favor of "manual or backpack spraying" or "sprinkler spraying" within 3 months puts petitioners-appellants in a vicious dilemma between protecting its investments and the health of its workers, on the one hand, and the threat of prosecution if they refuse to comply with the imposition. We even find the 3-months transition period insufficient, not only in acquiring and gearing-up the plantation workers of safety appurtenances, but more importantly in reviewing safety procedures for "manual or backpack spraying" and in training such workers for the purpose. Additionally, the engineering works for a sprinkler system in vast hectares of banana plantations could not possibly be completed within such period, considering that safety and efficiency factors need to be considered in its structural re-designing.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Respondent-appellee argues that the Ordinance merely banned an agricultural practice and did not actually prohibit the operation of banana plantations; hence, it is not oppressive. While We agree that the measure did not impose a closure of a lawful enterprise, the proviso in Section 5, however, compels petitioners-appellants to abandon aerial spraying without affording them enough time to convert and adopt other spraying practices. This would preclude petitioners-appellants from being able to fertilize their plantations with essential vitamins and minerals substances, aside from applying thereon the needed fungicides or pesticides to control, if not eliminate the threat of, plant diseases. Such an apparent eventuality would prejudice the operation of the plantations, and the economic repercussions thereof would just be akin to shutting down the venture.<br><br>This Court, therefore, finds Section 5 of Ordinance No. 0309-07 an invalid provision because the compulsion thereunder to abandon aerial spraying within an impracticable period of "three (3) months after the effectivity of this Ordinance" is "unreasonable, oppressive and impossible to comply with."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br></blockquote>The required civil works for the conversion to truck-mounted boom spraying alone will consume considerable time and financial resources given the topography and geographical features of the plantations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> As such, the conversion could not be completed within the short timeframe of three months. Requiring the respondents and other affected individuals to comply with the consequences of the ban within the three-month period under pain of penalty like fine, imprisonment and even cancellation of business permits would definitely be oppressive as to constitute abuse of police power.<br><br>The respondents posit that the requirement of maintaining a buffer zone under Section 6 of the ordinance violates due process for being confiscatory; and that the imposition unduly deprives all agricultural landowners within Davao City of the beneficial use of their property that amounts to taking without just compensation.<br><br>The position of the respondents is untenable.<br><br>In <i>City of Manila v. Laguio, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> we have thoroughly explained that taking only becomes confiscatory if it substantially divests the owner of the beneficial use of its property, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>An ordinance which permanently restricts the use of property that it cannot be used for any reasonable purpose goes beyond regulation and must be recognized as a taking of the property without just compensation. It is intrusive and violative of the private property rights of individuals.<br><br>The Constitution expressly provides in Article III, Section 9, that "private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation." The provision is the most important protection of property rights in the Constitution. This is a restriction on the general power of the government to take property. The constitutional provision is about ensuring that the government does not confiscate the property of some to give it to others. In part too, it is about loss spreading. If the government takes away a person's property to benefit society, then society should pay. The principal purpose of the guarantee is "to bar the Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.<br><br>There are two different types of taking that can be identified. A "possessory" taking occurs when the government confiscates or physically occupies property. A "regulatory" taking occurs when the government's regulation leaves no reasonable economically viable use of the property.<br><br>In the landmark case of <i>Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon</i>, it was held that a taking also could be found if government regulation of the use of property went "too far." When regulation reaches a certain magnitude, in most if not in all cases there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to support the act. While property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.<br><br>No formula or rule can be devised to answer the questions of what is too far and when regulation becomes a taking. In <i>Mahon</i>, Justice Holmes recognized that it was "a question of degree and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions." On many other occasions as well, the U.S. Supreme Court has said that the issue of when regulation constitutes a taking is a matter of considering the facts in each case. The Court asks whether justice and fairness require that the economic loss caused by public action must be compensated by the government and thus borne by the public as a whole, or whether the loss should remain concentrated on those few persons subject to the public action.<br><br>What is crucial in judicial consideration of regulatory takings is that government regulation is a taking if it leaves no reasonable economically viable use of property in a manner that interferes with reasonable expectations for use. A regulation that permanently denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land is, from the owner's point of view, equivalent to a "taking" unless principles of nuisance or property law that existed when the owner acquired the land make the use prohibitable. When the owner of real property has been called upon to sacrifice all economically beneficial uses in the name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economically idle, he has suffered a taking.<br><br>A regulation which denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land will require compensation under the takings clause. Where a regulation places limitations on land that fall short of eliminating all economically beneficial use, a taking nonetheless may have occurred, depending on a complex of factors including the regulation's economic effect on the landowner, the extent to which the regulation interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations and the character of government action. These inquiries are informed by the purpose of the takings clause which is to prevent the government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.<br><br>A restriction on use of property may also constitute a "taking" if not reasonably necessary to the effectuation of a substantial public purpose or if it has an unduly harsh impact on the distinct investment-backed expectations of the owner. (bold emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The establishment of the buffer zone is required for the purpose of minimizing the effects of aerial spraying within and near the plantations. Although Section 3(e) of the ordinance requires the planting of diversified trees within the identified buffer zone, the requirement cannot be construed and deemed as confiscatory requiring payment of just compensation. A landowner may only be entitled to compensation if the taking amounts to a permanent denial of all economically beneficial or productive uses of the land. The respondents cannot be said to be permanently and completely deprived of their landholdings because they can still cultivate or make other productive uses of the areas to be identified as the buffer zones.<br><br><center><b>III<br>Ordinance No. 0309-07 violates the Equal Protection Clause</b><br></center><br>A serious challenge being posed against Ordinance No. 0309-07 rests on its supposed collision with the Equal Protection Clause.

It requires public bodies and institutions to treat similarly situated individuals in a similar manner. The guaranty equal protection secures every person within the State's jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination, whether occasioned by the express terms of a statue or by its improper execution through the State's duly constituted authorities.

The respondents agree with the CA, however, and add that the ordinance does not rest on a valid distinction because it has lacked scientific basis and has ignored the classifications of pesticides observed by the FPA.<br><br>We partly agree with both parties.<br><br>In our view, the petitioners correctly argue that the rational basis approach appropriately applies herein. Under the rational basis test, we shall: (1) discern the reasonable relationship between the means and the purpose of the ordinance; and (2) examine whether the means or the prohibition against aerial spraying is based on a substantial or reasonable distinction. A reasonable classification includes all persons or things similarly situated with respect to the purpose of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup><br><br>Applying the test, the established classification under Ordinance No. 0309-07 is to be viewed in relation to the group of individuals similarly situated with respect to the avowed purpose. This gives rise to two classes, namely: (1) the classification under Ordinance No. 0309-07 (<i>legislative classification</i>); and (2) the classification based on purpose (<i>elimination of the mischief</i>). The legislative classification found in Section 4 of the ordinance refers to "all agricultural entities" within Davao City. Meanwhile, the classification based on the purpose of the ordinance cannot be easily discerned because the ordinance does not make any express or implied reference to it. We have to search the voluminous records of this case to divine the <i>animus</i> behind the action of the Sangguniang Panglungsod in prohibiting aerial spraying as an agricultural activity. The effort has led us to the following proposed resolution of the Sangguniang Panglungsod,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><center>RESOLUTION NO. ____<br>Series of 2007<br><br>A RESOLUTION TO ENACT AN ORDINANCE BANNING AERIAL SPRAYING AS AN AGRICULTURAL PRACTICE IN ALL AGRICULTURAL ENTITIES IN DAVAO CITY<br></center><br>WHEREAS, the City of Davao, with fertile lands and ideal climactic condition, hosts various large farms planted with different crops;<br><br>WHEREAS, these farms, lay adjacent to other agricultural businesses and that residential areas abuts these farm boundaries;<br><br>WHEREAS, aerial spraying as a mode of applying chemical substances such as fungicides and pesticides is being used by investors/companies over large agricultural plantations in Davao City;<br><br>WHEREAS, the Davao City watersheds and ground water sources, located within and adjacent to Mount Apo may be affected by the aerial spraying of chemical substances on the agricultural farms and plantations therein;<br><br>WHEREAS, the effects of aerial spraying are found to be detrimental to the health of the residents of Davao City most especially the inhabitants nearby agricultural plantations practicing aerials spraying;<br><br>WHEREAS, the unstable wind direction during the conduct of aerial spray application of these chemical substances pose health hazards to people, animals, other crops and ground water sources;<br><br>WHEREAS, in order to achieve sustainable development, politics must be based on the Precautionary Principle.

Given the vastness of the reach of aerial spraying, the said form of dispensation falls into the category of a public nuisance. Public nuisance is defined by the New Civil Code as one which affects a community or neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, although the extent of the annoyance, danger or damage upon individuals may be unequal.<br><br>WHEREAS, the General Welfare Clause of the Local Government Code empowers Local Government Units to enact ordinances that provide for the health and safety, promote the comfort and convenience of the City and the inhabitants thereof.<br><br><b>NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED</b>, that for the health, safety and peace of mind of all the inhabitants of Davao City, let an ordinance be enacted banning aerial spraying as an agricultural practice in all agricultural entities in Davao City.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>The proposed resolution identified aerial spraying of pesticides as a nuisance because of the unstable wind direction during the aerial application, which (1) could potentially contaminate the Davao City watersheds and ground water sources; (2) was detrimental to the health of Davao City residents, most especially those living in the nearby plantations; and (3) posed a hazard to animals and other crops. Plainly, the mischief that the prohibition sought to address was the fungicide drift resulting from the aerial application; hence, the classification based on the intent of the proposed ordinance covered all agricultural entities conducting aerial spraying of fungicides that caused drift.<br><br>The assailed ordinance thus becomes riddled with several distinction issues.<br><br>A brief discussion on the occurrence of the drift that the ordinance seeks to address is necessary.<br><br>Pesticide treatment is based on the use of different methods of application and equipment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> the choice of which methods depend largely on the objective of distributing the correct dose to a defined target with the minimum of wastage due to "drift."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> The term "drift" refers to the movement of airborne spray droplets, vapors, or dust particles away from the target area during pesticide application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> Inevitably, any method of application causes drift, which may either be primary or secondary. As fittingly described by scholars:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup><br><blockquote><i>Primary</i> drift is the off-site movement of spray droplets at, or very close to, the time of application. For example, a field application using a boom in a gusty wind situation could easily lead to a primary drift. <i>Primary</i> spray drift is <i>not</i> product specific, and the active ingredients <i>do not differ</i> in their potential to drift. However, the type of formulation, surfactant, or other adjuvant may affect spray drift potential.<br><br><i>Secondary</i> drift is associated with pesticide vapor. Pesticide vapor drift is the movement of the gas that forms when an active ingredient evaporates from plants, soil, or other surfaces. And while vapor drift is an important issue, it only pertains to certain volatile products. Vapor drift and other forms of <i>secondary</i> drift <i>are</i> product specific. Water-based sprays will volatize more quickly than oil-based sprays. However, oil-based sprays can drift farther, especially above 95°F, because they are lighter.<br></blockquote>Understandably, aerial drift occurs using any method of application, be it through airplanes, ground sprayers, airblast sprayers or irrigation systems.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> Several factors contribute to the occurrence of drift depending on the method of application, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1"><tbody><tr><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>AERIAL</strong></div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>AIRBLAST</strong></div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>GROUND</strong></div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>CHEMIGATION</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Droplet size</div></td><td><div align="left">Crop canopy</div></td><td><div align="left">Droplet size</div></td><td><div align="left">Application height</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Application height</div></td><td><div align="left">Droplet size</div></td><td><div align="left">Boom height</div></td><td><div align="left">Wind speed</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Wind speed</div></td><td><div align="left">Wind speed</div></td><td><div align="left">Wind speed</div></td><td><div align="left"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Swath adjustment</div></td><td><div align="left"></div><br></td><td><div align="left"></div><br></td><td><div align="left"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Canopy</div></td><td><div align="left"></div><br></td><td><div align="left"></div><br></td><td><div align="left"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Boom length</div></td><td><div align="left"></div><br></td><td><div align="left"></div><br></td><td><div align="left"></div><br></td></tr><tr><td><div align="left">Tank mix physical properties</div></td><td><div align="left"></div><br></td><td><div align="left"></div><br></td><td><div align="left"></div><br></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Source: F.M. Fishel and J.A. Ferrell, "<i>Managing Pesticide Drift</i>," available at <a href="http://http://edis.ifas.edu/pi232"><u>http://edis.ifas.edu/pi232</u></a>. citing Pesticide Notes, MSU Extension.<br><br>The four most common pesticide treatment methods adopted in Davao City are aerial, truck-mounted boom, truck-mounted mechanical, and manual spraying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> However, Ordinance No. 0309-07 imposes the prohibition only against aerial spraying.<br><br>Davao City justifies the prohibition against aerial spraying by insisting that the occurrence of drift causes inconvenience and harm to the residents and degrades the environment. Given this justification, does the ordinance satisfy the requirement that the classification must rest on substantial distinction?<br><br>We answer in the negative.<br><br>The occurrence of pesticide drift is not limited to aerial spraying but results from the conduct of any mode of pesticide application. Even manual spraying or truck-mounted boom spraying produces drift that may bring about the same inconvenience, discomfort and alleged health risks to the community and to the environment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> A ban against aerial spraying does not weed out the harm that the ordinance seeks to achieve.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> In the process, the ordinance suffers from being "underinclusive" because the classification does not include all individuals tainted with the same mischief that the law seeks to eliminate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> A classification that is drastically underinclusive with respect to the purpose or end appears as an irrational means to the legislative end because it poorly serves the intended purpose of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup><br><br>The claim that aerial spraying produces more aerial drift cannot likewise be sustained in view of the petitioners' failure to substantiate the same. The respondents have refuted this claim, and have maintained that on the contrary, manual spraying produces more drift than aerial treatment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> As such, the decision of prohibiting only aerial spraying is tainted with arbitrariness.<br><br>Aside from its being underinclusive, the assailed ordinance also tends to be "overinclusive" because its .impending implementation will affect groups that have no relation to the accomplishment of the legislative purpose. Its implementation will unnecessarily impose a burden on a wider range of individuals than those included in the intended class based on the purpose of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup><br><br>It can be noted that the imposition of the ban is too broad because the ordinance applies irrespective of the substance to be aerially applied and irrespective of the agricultural activity to be conducted. The respondents admit that they aerially treat their plantations not only with pesticides but also vitamins and other substances. The imposition of the ban against aerial spraying of substances other than fungicides and regardless of the agricultural activity being performed becomes unreasonable inasmuch as it patently bears no relation to the purported inconvenience, discomfort, health risk and environmental danger which the ordinance, seeks to address. The burden now will become more onerous to various entities including the respondents and even others with no connection whatsoever to the intended purpose of the ordinance.<br><br>In this respect, the CA correctly observed:<br><blockquote>Ordinance No. 0309-07 defines "aerial spraying" as the "application of substances through the use of aircraft of any form which dispenses the substances in the air." Inevitably, the ban imposed therein encompasses aerial application of practically all substances, not only pesticides or fungicides but including water and all forms of chemicals, regardless of its elements, composition, or degree of safety.<br><br>Going along with respondent-appellee's ratiocination that the prohibition in the Ordinance refers to aerial spraying as a method of spraying pesticides or fungicides, there appears to be a need to single out pesticides or fungicides in imposing such a ban because there is a striking distinction between such chemicals and other substances (including water), particularly with respect to its safety implications to the public welfare and ecology.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>We are, therefore, convinced that the total ban on aerial spraying runs afoul with the equal protection clause because it does not classify which substances are prohibited from being applied aerially even as reasonable distinctions should be made in terms of the hazards, safety or beneficial effects of liquid substances to the public health, livelihood and the environment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup><br></blockquote>We clarify that the CA did not thereby apply the strict scrutiny approach but only evaluated the classification established by the ordinance in relation to the purpose. This is the essence of the rational basis approach.<br><br>The petitioners should be made aware that the rational basis scrutiny is not based on a simple means-purpose correlation; nor does the rational basis scrutiny automatically result in a presumption of validity of the ordinance or deference to the wisdom of the local legislature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> To reiterate, aside from ascertaining that the means and purpose of the ordinance are reasonably related, the classification should be based on a substantial distinction.<br><br>However, we do not subscribe to the respondents' position that there must be a distinction based on the level of concentration or the classification imposed by the FPA on pesticides. This strenuous requirement cannot be expected from a local government unit that should only be concerned with general policies in local administration and should not be restricted by technical concerns that are best left to agencies vested with the appropriate special competencies. The disregard of the pesticide classification is not an equal protection issue but is more relevant in another aspect of delegated police power that we consider to be more appropriate in a later discussion.<br><br>The overinclusiveness of Ordinance No. 0309-07 may also be traced to its Section 6 by virtue of its requirement for the maintenance of the 30- meter buffer zone. This requirement applies regardless of the area of the agricultural landholding, geographical location, topography, crops grown and other distinguishing characteristics that ideally should bear a reasonable relation to the evil sought to be avoided. As earlier discussed, only large banana plantations could rely on aerial technology because of the financial capital required therefor.<br><br>The establishment and maintenance of the buffer zone will become more burdensome to the small agricultural landholders because: (1) they have to reserve the 30-meter belt surrounding their property; (2) that will have to be identified through GPS; (3) the metes and bounds of the buffer zone will have to be plotted in a survey plan for submission to the local government unit; and (4) will be limited as to the crops that may be cultivated therein based on the mandate that the zone shall be devoted to "diversified trees" taller than what are being grown therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> The arbitrariness of Section 6 all the more becomes evident when the land is presently devoted to the cultivation of root crops and vegetables, and trees or plants slightly taller than the root crops and vegetables are then to be planted. It is seriously to be doubted whether such circumstance will prevent the occurrence of the drift to the nearby residential areas.<br><br>Section 6 also subjects to the 30-meter buffer zone requirement agricultural entities engaging in organic farming, and' do not contribute to the occurrence of pesticide drift. The classification indisputably becomes arbitrary and whimsical.<br><br>A substantially overinclusive or underinclusive classification tends to undercut the governmental claim that the classification serves legitimate political ends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> Where overinclusiveness is the problem, the vice is that the law has a greater discriminatory or burdensome effect than necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> In this light, we strike down Section 5 and Section 6 of Ordinance No. 0309-07 for carrying an invidious classification, and for thereby violating the Equal Protection Clause.<br><br>The discriminatory nature of the ordinance can be seen from its policy as stated in its Section 2, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 2. POLICY OF THE CITY. It shall be the policy of the City of Davao to eliminate the method of aerial spraying as an agricultural practice in all agricultural activities by all entities within Davao City.<br></blockquote>Evidently, the ordinance discriminates against large farmholdings that are the only ideal venues for the investment of machineries and equipment capable of aerial spraying. It effectively denies the affected individuals the technology aimed at efficient and cost-effective operations and cultivation not only of banana but of other crops as well. The prohibition against aerial spraying will seriously hamper the operations of the banana plantations that depend on aerial technology to arrest the spread of the Black Sigatoka disease and other menaces that threaten their production and harvest. As earlier shown, the effect of the ban will not be limited to Davao City in view of the significant contribution of banana export trading to the country's economy.<br><br>The discriminatory character of the ordinance makes it oppressive and unreasonable in light of the existence and availability of more permissible and practical alternatives that will not overburden the respondents and those dependent on their operations as well as those who stand to be affected by the ordinance. In the view of Regional Director Roger C. Chio of DA Regional Field Unit XI, the alleged harm caused by aerial spraying may be addressed by following the GAP that the DA has been promoting among plantation operators. He explained his view thusly:<br><blockquote>The allegation that aerial spraying is hazardous to animal and human being remains an allegation and assumptions until otherwise scientifically proven by concerned authorities and agencies. This issue can be addressed by following Good Agricultural Practices, which DA is promoting among fruit and vegetable growers/plantations. Any method of agri-chemical application whether aerial or non-aerial if not properly done in accordance with established procedures and code of good agricultural practices and if the chemical applicators and or handlers lack of necessary competency, certainly it could be hazardous. For the assurance that commercial applicators/aerial applicators possessed the competency and responsibility of handling agri-chemical, such applicators are required under Article III, Paragraph 2 of FPA Rules and Regulation No. 1 to secure license from FPA.<br><br>Furthermore users and applicators of agri-chemicals are also guided by Section 6 Paragraph 2 and 3 under column of Pesticides and Other agricultural Chemicals of PD 11445 which stated: "FPA shall establish and enforce tolerance levels and good agricultural practices in raw agricultural commodities; to restrict or ban the use of any chemical or the formulation of certain pesticides in specific areas or during certain period upon evidence that the pesticide is eminent [sic] hazards has caused, or is causing widespread serious damage to crops, fish, livestock or to public health and environment."<br><br>Besides the aforecited policy, rules and regulation enforced by DA, there are other laws and regulations protecting and preserving the environment. If the implementation and monitoring of all these laws and regulation are closely coordinated with concerned LGUs, Gas and NGAs and other private sectors, perhaps we can maintain a sound and health environment x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Indeed, based on the Summary Report on the Assessment and Factfinding Activities on the Issue of Aerial Spraying in Banana Plantations</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> submitted by the fact-finding team organized by Davao City, only three out of the 13 barangays consulted by the fact-finding team opposed the conduct of aerial spraying; and of the three barangays, aerial spraying was conducted only in Barangay Subasta. In fact, the fact-finding team found that the residents in those barangays were generally in favor of the operations of the banana plantations, and did not oppose the conduct of aerial spraying.<br><br><center><b>IV<br>The Precautionary Principle still requires scientific basis</b><br></center><br>The petitioners finally plead that the Court should look at the merits of the ordinance based on the precautionary principle. They argue that under the precautionary principle, the City of Davao is justified in enacting Ordinance No. 0309-07 in order to prevent harm to the environment and human health despite the lack of scientific certainty.<br><br>The petitioners' plea and argument cannot be sustained.<br><br>The principle of precaution originated as a social planning principle in Germany. In the 1980s, the Federal Republic of Germany used the <i>Vorsogeprinzip</i> ("foresight principle") to justify the implementation of vigorous policies to tackle acid rain, global warming and pollution of the North Sea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> It has since emerged from a need to protect humans and the environment from increasingly unpredictable, uncertain, and unquantifiable but possibly catastrophic risks such as those associated with Genetically Modified Organisms and climate change,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> among others. The oft-cited Principle 15 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (1992 Rio Agenda), first embodied this principle, as follows:<br><blockquote>Principle 15<br><br>In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.<br></blockquote>In this jurisdiction, the principle of precaution appearing in the <i>Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases</i> (A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC) involves matters of evidence in cases where there is lack of full scientific certainty in establishing a causal link between human activity and environmental effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> In such an event, the courts may construe a set of facts as warranting either judicial action or inaction with the goal of preserving and protecting the environment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup><br><br>It is notable, therefore, that the precautionary principle shall only be relevant if there is concurrence of three elements, namely: <i>uncertainty</i>, threat of environmental damage and serious or irreversible harm. In situations where the threat is relatively certain, or that the causal link between an action and environmental damage can be established, or the probability of occurrence can be calculated, only preventive, not precautionary measures, may be taken. Neither will the precautionary principle apply if there is no indication of a threat of environmental harm; or if the threatened harm is trivial or easily reversible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup><br><br>We cannot see the presence of all the elements. To begin with, there has been no scientific study. Although the precautionary principle allows lack of full scientific certainty in establishing a connection between the serious or irreversible harm and the human activity, its application is still premised on empirical studies. Scientific analysis is still a necessary basis for effective policy choices under the precautionary principle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup><br><br>Precaution is a risk management principle invoked after scientific inquiry takes place. This scientific stage is often considered synonympus with risk assessment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> As such, resort to the principle shall not be based on anxiety or emotion, but from a rational decision rule, based in ethics.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup> As much as possible, a complete and objective scientific evaluation of the risk to the environment or health should be conducted and made available to decision-makers for them to choose the most appropriate course of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> Furthermore, the positive and negative effects of an activity is also important in the application of the principle. The potential harm resulting from certain activities should always be judged in view of the potential benefits they offer, while the positive and negative effects of potential precautionary measures should be considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup><br><br>The only study conducted to validate the effects of aerial spraying appears to be the <i>Summary Report on the Assessment and Fact-Finding Activities on the Issue of Aerial Spraying in Banana Plantations</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> Yet, the fact-finding team that generated the report was not a scientific study that could justify the resort to the precautionary principle. In fact, the Sangguniang Bayan ignored the findings and conclusions of the fact-finding team that recommended only a regulation, not a ban, against aerial spraying. The recommendation was in line with the advocacy of judicious handling and application of chemical pesticides by the DOH-Center for Health Development in the Davao Region in view of the scarcity of scientific studies to support the ban against aerial spraying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup><br><br>We should not apply the precautionary approach in sustaining the ban against aerial spraying if little or nothing is known of the exact or potential dangers that aerial spraying may bring to the health of the residents within and near the plantations and to the integrity and balance of the environment. It is dangerous to quickly presume that the effects of aerial spraying would be adverse even in the absence of evidence. Accordingly, for lack of scientific data supporting a ban on aerial spraying, Ordinance No. 0309-07 should be struck down for being unreasonable.<br><br><center><b>V<br>Ordinance No. 0309-07 is an ultra vires act</b><br></center><br>The Court further holds that in addition to its unconstitutionality for carrying an unwarranted classification that contravenes the Equal Protection Clause, Ordinance No. 0309-07 suffers from another legal infirmity.<br><br>The petitioners represent that Ordinance No. 0309-07 is a valid exercise of legislative and police powers by the Sangguniang Bayan of Davao City pursuant to Section 458 in relation to Section 16 both of the <i>Local Government Code</i>. The respondents counter that Davao City thereby disregarded the regulations implemented by the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA), including its identification and classification of safe pesticides and other agricultural chemicals.<br><br>We uphold the respondents.<br><br>An ordinance enjoys the presumption of validity on the basis that:<br><blockquote>The action of the elected representatives of the people cannot be lightly set aside. The councilors must, in the very nature of things, be familiar with the necessities of their particular municipality and with all the facts and circumstances which surround the subject, and necessities of their particular municipality and with all the facts and circumstances which surround the subject, and necessitate action. The local legislative body, by enacting the ordinance, has in effect given notice that the regulations are essential to the well-being of the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup><br></blockquote>Section 5(c) of the <i>Local Government Code</i> accords a liberal interpretation to its general welfare provisions. The policy of liberal construction is consistent with the spirit of local autonomy that endows local government units with sufficient power and discretion to accelerate their economic development and uplift the quality of life for their constituents.<br><br>Verily, the Court has championed the cause of public welfare on several occasions. In so doing, it has accorded liberality to the general welfare provisions of the <i>Local Government Code</i> by upholding the validity of local ordinances enacted for the common good. For instance, in <i>Social Justice Society (SJS) v. Atienza, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> the Court validated a zoning ordinance that reclassified areas covered by a large oil depot from industrial to commercial in order to ensure the life, health and property of the inhabitants residing within the periphery of the oil depot. Another instance is <i>Gancayco v. City Government of Quezon City</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> where the Court declared as valid a city ordinance ordering the construction of arcades that would ensure the health and safety of the city and its inhabitants, improvement of their morals, peace, good order, comfort and convenience, as well as the promotion of their prosperity. Even in its early years, the Court already extended liberality towards the exercise by the local government units; of their legislative powers in order to promote the general welfare of their communities. This was exemplified in <i>United States v. Salaveria</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> wherein gambling was characterized as "an act beyond the pale of good morals" that the local legislative council could validly suppress to protect the well-being of its constituents; and in <i>United States v. Abendan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> whereby the right of the then Municipality of Cebu to enact an ordinance relating to sanitation and public health was upheld.<br><br>The power to legislate under the General Welfare Clause is not meant to be an invincible authority. In fact, <i>Salaveria</i> and <i>Abendan</i> emphasized the reasonableness and consistency of the exercise by the local government units with the laws or policies of the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup> More importantly, because the police power of the local government units flows from the express delegation of the power by Congress, its exercise is to be construed <i>in strictissimi juris</i>. Any doubt or ambiguity arising out of the terms used in granting the power should be construed against the local legislative units.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup> Judicial scrutiny comes into play whenever the exercise of police power affects life, liberty or property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> The presumption of validity and the policy of liberality are not restraints on the power of judicial review in the face of questions about whether an ordinance conforms with the Constitution, the laws or public policy, or if it is unreasonable, oppressive, partial, discriminating or in derogation of a common right. The ordinance must pass the test of constitutionality and the test of consistency with the prevailing laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup><br><br>Although the <i>Local Government Code</i> vests the municipal corporations with sufficient power to govern themselves and manage their affairs and activities, they definitely have no right to enact ordinances dissonant with the State's laws and policy. The <i>Local Government Code</i> has been fashioned to delineate the specific parameters and limitations to guide each local government unit in exercising its delegated powers with the view of making the local government unit a fully functioning subdivision of the State within the constitutional and statutory restraints.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup> The <i>Local Government Code</i> is not intended to vest in the local government unit the blanket authority to legislate upon any subject that it finds proper to legislate upon in the guise of serving the common good.<br><br>The function of pesticides control, regulation and development is within the jurisdiction of the FPA under Presidential Decree No. 1144.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> The FPA was established in recognition of the need for a technically oriented government entity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> that will protect the public from the risks inherent in the use of pesticides.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> To perform its mandate, it was given under Section 6 of Presidential Decree No. 1144 the following powers and functions with respect to pesticides and other agricultural chemicals, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Section 6.

This responsibility includes not only the identification of safe and unsafe pesticides, but also the prescription of the safe modes of application in keeping with the standard of good agricultural practices.<br><br>On the other hand, the enumerated devolved functions to the local government units do not include the regulation and control of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> The non-inclusion should preclude the Sangguniang Bayan of Davao City from enacting Ordinance No. 0309-07, for otherwise it would be arrogating unto itself the authority to prohibit the aerial application of pesticides in derogation of the authority expressly vested in the FPA by Presidential Decree No. 1144.<br><br>In enacting Ordinance No. 0309-07 without the inherent and explicit authority to do so, the City of Davao performed an <i>ultra vires</i> act. As a local government unit, the City of Davao could act only as an agent of Congress, and its every act should always conform to and reflect the will of its principal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup> As clarified in Batangas <i>CATV, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup><br><blockquote>[W]here the state legislature has made provision for the regulation of conduct, it has manifested its intention that the subject matter shall be fully covered by the statute, and that a municipality, under its general powers, cannot regulate the same conduct. In <i>Keller vs. State</i>, it was held that: "<i>Where there is no express power in the charter of a municipality authorizing it to adopt ordinances regulating certain matters which are specifically covered by a general statute, a municipal ordinance, insofar as it attempts to regulate the subject which is completely covered by a general statute of the legislature, may be rendered invalid. x x x Where the subject is of statewide concern, and the legislature has appropriated the field and declared the rule, its declaration is binding throughout the State</i>." A reason advanced for this view is that such ordinances are in excess of the powers granted to the municipal corporation.<br><br>Since E.O. No. 205, a general law, mandates that the regulation of CATV operations shall be exercised by the NTC, an LGU cannot enact an ordinance or approve a resolution in violation of the said law.<br><br>It is a fundamental principle that municipal ordinances are inferior in status and subordinate to the laws of the state. An ordinance in conflict with a state law of general character and statewide application is universally held to be invalid. The principle is frequently expressed in the declaration that municipal authorities, under a general grant of power, cannot adopt ordinances which infringe the spirit of a state law or repugnant to the general policy of the state. In every power to pass ordinances given to a municipality, there is an implied restriction that the ordinances shall be consistent with the general law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>For sure, every local government unit only derives its legislative authority from Congress. In no instance can the local government unit rise above its source of authority. As such, its ordinance cannot run against or contravene existing laws, precisely because its authority is only by virtue of the valid delegation from Congress. As emphasized in <i>City of Manila v. Laguio, Jr.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup><br><blockquote>The requirement that the enactment must not violate existing law gives stress to the precept that local government units are able to legislate only by virtue of their derivative legislative power, a delegation of legislative power from the national legislature. The delegate cannot be superior to the principal or exercise powers higher than those of the latter.<br><br>This relationship between the national legislature and the local government units has not been enfeebled by the new provisions in the Constitution strengthening the policy of local autonomy. The national legislature is still the principal of the local government units, which cannot defy its will or modify or violate it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup><br></blockquote>Moreover, Ordinance No. 0309-07 proposes to prohibit an activity already covered by the jurisdiction of the FPA, which has issued its own regulations under its Memorandum Circular No. 02, Series of 2009, entitled <i>Good Agricultural Practices for Aerial Spraying of Fungicide in Banana Plantations</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup> While Ordinance No. 0309-07 prohibits aerial spraying in banana plantations within the City of Davao, Memorandum Circular No. 02 seeks to regulate the conduct of aerial spraying in banana plantations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> pursuant to Section 6, Presidential Decree No. 1144, and in conformity with the standard of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).

Ordinance No. 0309-07, Series of 2007 passed by Davao City is too broad in, that it prohibits aerial spraying in agriculture regardless of the substance and the method of aerial spraying involved. This Court's Decision should be read in this narrow sense.<br><br>I add the following points to clarify the reasons for my vote.<br><br>First, nothing in the disposition of this case should be construed as an absolute prohibition for the banning of aerial spraying of certain chemicals. Even if the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod</i> properly appreciated the harm caused by the spraying of chemicals that addressed the problem of the Black Sigatoka, the resulting local legislation was too broad. Justification for one case does not necessarily always provide justification for another case.<br><br>Second, it is clear that passing a sufficiently narrow ordinance banning aerial spraying of a pesticide may be done by a local government unit. This can be justified by Section 16<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Local Government Code. The present code and the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> provide sufficient basis for that kind of autonomy.<br><br>Localized harm that affect specific residents and that may be unique to a certain municipality or city should not await action from the national government. Local government units are not so inutile as to be unable to sufficiently protect its citizens. Davao City can act. It does not need Malacañang or the Congress to do what it already can.<br><br>I differ from the ponencia with respect to its interpretation of Presidential Decree No. 1144<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> creating the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority. In my view, nothing in the Decree's grant of powers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> prohibits local government units from regulating the mode of delivery of certain allowed chemicals should there be clear harm caused to the residents of a municipality or city. Certifying that a pesticide can be used is different from preventing the harm it can do when applied in a certain way. Davao City did not intend to prohibit the pesticide, but merely the method of its application.<br><br>Third, the precautionary principle embedded both in Article II, Section 16<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and Article III, Section 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of the Constitution applies in this case.<br><br>There was science, but it was uncertain.<br><br>The precautionary principle should also be qualified by transience as science-progressive and must be cost-effective. Environmental measures must "ensure . . . benefits at the lowest possible cost."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>However, I agree that the precautionary principle does not make sense if there is absolutely no proof of causation.<br><br>Fourth, I do not see the application of the equal protection clause. The discrimination against large plantation owners enjoying huge economies of scale is, at this point, speculative.<br><br>Lastly, nothing in this Decision should, in my view, be construed as a negation of the findings of fact of the trial court. This is especially with regard to the testimony of the persons affected by the aerial spray.<br><br>The broad construction of the prohibition in the Ordinance should not be viewed as erasing the experience of the residents of Davao City. In other words, government still needs to address their problems with the most urgent dispatch.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> LOC.
