				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A writ of execution lies against the pension benefits of a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, which is the subject of a deed of assignment drawn by him granting support to his wife and five (5) children.

The "right to life" always takes precedence over "property rights." The "right to support/life" is also a substantive right which always takes precedence over technicalities/procedural rules. It being so, technical rules must yield to substantive justice. Besides, this Court's Decision dated February 27, 2007 has long acquired finality, and as such, is ripe for enforcement/execution.<br><br>THE FOREGOING CONSIDERED, the instant Motion is hereby DENIED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>The AFP PGMC moved for reconsideration of the order denying the Motion to Quash,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> but the Motion was also denied by the trial court in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated August 6, 2008.<br><br>A Notice of Garnishment was issued by the trial court on July 15, 2008 and was received by the AFP PGMC on September 9, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The AFP PGMC filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals granted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition and partially nullified the trial court's Decision insofar as it directed the automatic deduction of support from the pension benefits of Colonel Otamias.<br><br>The Court of Appeals discussed that Section 31<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of Presidential Decree No. 1638, otherwise known as the AFP Military Personnel Retirement and Separation Decree of 1979, "provides for the exemption of the monthly pension of retired military personnel from execution and attachment[,]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> while Rule 39, Section 13 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 13. <i>Property exempt from execution</i>.

The phrase also "serves as a timeline designed to separate the debts incurred by the retired officer after his retirement from those which he incurred prior thereto."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Further, the accountabilities referred to in Section 31 of Presidential Decree No. 1638 refer to debts or loans, not to support.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>The issues for resolution are:<br><br>First, whether the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the AFP Finance Center cannot be directed to automatically deduct the amount of support needed by the legitimate family of Colonel Otamias; and<br><br>Second, whether Colonel Otamias' pension benefits can be executed upon for the financial support of his legitimate family.<br><br>The Petition is granted.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Article 6 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote><b>Article 6.</b> Rights may be waived, unless the waiver is contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs, or prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law.<br></blockquote>The concept of waiver has been defined by this Court as:<br><blockquote>a voluntary and intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known existing legal right, advantage, benefit, claim or privilege, which except for such waiver the party would have enjoyed; the voluntary abandonment or surrender, by a capable person, of a right known by him to exist, with the intent that such right shall be surrendered and such person forever deprived of its benefit; or such conduct as warrants an inference of the relinquishment of such right; or the intentional doing of an act inconsistent with claiming it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br></blockquote>In determining whether a statutory right can be waived, this Court is guided by the following pronouncement:<br><blockquote>[T]he doctrine of waiver extends to rights and privileges of any character, and, since the word 'waiver' covers every conceivable right, it is the general rule that a person may waive any matter which affects his property, and any alienable right or privilege of which he is the owner or which belongs to him or to which he is legally entitled, whether secured by contract, conferred with statute, or guaranteed by constitution, <b>provided such rights and privileges rest in the individual, are intended for his sole benefit, do not infringe on the rights of others, and further provided the waiver of the right or privilege is not forbidden by law, and does not contravene public policy;</b> and the principle is recognized that everyone has a right to waive, and agree to waive, the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity, if it can be dispensed with and relinquished without infringing on any public right, and without detriment to the community at large[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>When Colonel Otamias executed the Deed of Assignment, he effectively waived his right to claim that his retirement benefits are exempt from execution. The right to receive retirement benefits belongs to Colonel Otamias. His decision to waive a portion of his retirement benefits does not infringe on the right of third persons, but even protects the right of his family to receive support.<br><br>In addition, the Deed of Assignment should be considered as the law between the parties, and its provisions should be respected in the absence of allegations that Colonel Otamias was coerced or defrauded in executing it. The general rule is that a contract is the law between parties and parties are free to stipulate terms and conditions that are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The Deed of Assignment executed by Colonel Otamias was not contrary to law; it was in accordance with the provisions on support in the Family Code. Hence, there was no reason for the AFP PGMC not to recognize its validity.<br><br>Further, this Court notes that the AFP PGMC granted the request for support of the wives of other retired military personnel in a similar situation as that of petitioner in this case. Attached to the Petition are the affidavits of the wives of retired members of the military, who have received a portion of their husbands' pensions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>One affidavit stated:<br><blockquote><ol start="4"><li>That when I consulted and appeared before the Office of PGMC, I was instructed to submit a Special Power of Authority from my husband so they can release part of his pension to me;<br><br></li><li>That my husband signed the Special Power of Attorney at the PGMC ceding 50% of his pension to me; the SPA form was given to us by the PGMC and the same was signed by my husband at the PGMC; . . .<br></li></ol>. . . .<br><ol start="7"><li>That the amount was deposited directly to my account by the PGMC- Finance Center AFP out of the pension of my husband;<br><br></li><li>That only the Special Power of Attorney was required by the PGMC in order for them to segregate my share of my husband's pension and deposit the same to my account[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>The other affidavit stated:<br><blockquote><ol start="8"><li>That my husband signed the Special Power of Attorney at the PGMC ceding 50% of his pension to me; the SPA form was given to us by the PGMC and the same was signed by my husband at the PGMC[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>In addition, the AFP PGMC's website informs the public of the following procedure:<br><blockquote><b>Tanong:</b> My husband-retiree cut-off my allotment. How can I have it restored?<br><b>Sagot:</b> Pension benefits are separate properties of the retiree and can not [sic] be subject of a Court [sic] Order for execution nor can they be assigned to any third party (Sec. 31, PD 1638, as amended). However, a valid Special Power of Attorney (SPA) by the retiree himself empowering the AFP Finance Center to deduct certain amount from his lumpsum [sic] or pension pay as the case maybe, as a rule, is a valid waiver of rights which can be effectively implemented by the AFP F[inance] C[enter].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br></blockquote>Clearly, the AFP PGMC allows deductions from a retiree's pension for as long as the retiree executes a Special Power of Attorney authorizing the AFP PGMC to deduct a certain amount for the benefit of the retiree's beneficiary.<br><br>It is curious why Colonel Otamias was allowed to execute a Deed of Assignment by the administering officer when, in the first place, the AFP PGMC's recognized procedure was to execute a Special Power of Attorney, which would have been the easier remedy for Colonel Otamias' family.<br><br>Instead, Colonel Otamias' family was forced to incur litigation expenses just to be able to receive the financial support that Colonel Otamias was willing to give to Edna, et al.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Section 31 of Presidential Decree No. 1638 provides:<br><blockquote><b>Section 31.</b> The benefits authorized under this Decree, except as provided herein, shall not be subject to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or any tax whatsoever; neither shall they be assigned, ceded, or conveyed to any third person: Provided, That if a retired or separated officer or enlisted man who is entitled to any benefit under this Decree has unsettled money and/or property accountabilities incurred while in the active service, not more than fifty per centum of the pension gratuity or other payment due such officer or enlisted man or his survivors under this Decree may be withheld and be applied to settle such accountabilities.<br></blockquote>Under Section 31, Colonel Otamias' retirement benefits are exempt from execution. Retirement benefits are exempt from execution so as to ensure that the retiree has enough funds to support himself and his family.<br><br>On the other hand, the right to receive support is provided under the Family Code. Article 194 of the Family Code defines support as follows:<br><blockquote><b>Art. 194.</b> Support comprises everything indispensable for sustenance, dwelling, clothing, medical attendance, education and transportation, in keeping with the financial capacity of the family.<br><br>The education of the person entitled to be supported referred to in the preceding paragraph shall include his schooling or training for some profession, trade or vocation, even beyond the age of majority. Transportation shall include expenses in going to and from school, or to and from place of work.<br></blockquote>The provisions of the Family Code also state who are obliged to give support, thus:<br><blockquote><b>Art. 195.</b> Subject to the provisions of the succeeding articles, the following are obliged to support each other to the whole extent set forth in the preceding article:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) The spouses;<br><br>(2) Legitimate ascendants and descendants;<br><br>(3) Parents and their legitimate children and the legitimate and illegitimate children of the latter;<br><br>(4) Parents and their illegitimate children and the legitimate and illegitimate children of the latter; and<br><br>(5) Legitimate brothers and sisters, whether of the full or half- blood.<br></div><br><b>Art. 196.</b> Brothers and sisters not legitimately related, whether of the full or half-blood, are likewise bound to support each other to the full extent set forth in Article 194 except only when the need for support of the brother or sister, being of age, is due to a cause imputable to the claimant's fault or negligence.<br><br><b>Art. 197.</b> For the support of legitimate ascendants; descendants, whether legitimate or illegitimate; and brothers and sisters, whether legitimately or illegitimately related, only the separate property of the person obliged to give support shall be answerable provided that in case the obligor has no separate property, the absolute community or the conjugal partnership, if financially capable, shall advance the support, which shall be deducted from the share of the spouses obliged upon the liquidation of the absolute community or of the conjugal partnership[.]<br></blockquote>The provisions of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court that are applicable to this case are in apparent conflict with each other. Section 4 provides that judgments in actions for support are immediately executory. On the other hand, Section 13(1) provides that the right to receive pension from government is exempt from execution, thus:<br><blockquote><center><b>RULE 39</b><br><br>EXECUTION, SATISFACTION, AND EFFECT OF JUDGMENTS<br></center><br>. . . .<br><br>SEC. 4. <i>Judgments not stayed by appeal. â Judgments in actions</i> for injunction, receivership, accounting and support, and such other judgments as are now or may hereafter be declared to be immediately executory, <i>shall be enforceable after their rendition and shall not, be stayed by an appeal taken therefrom, unless otherwise ordered by the trial court</i>. On appeal therefrom, the appellate court in its discretion may make an order suspending, modifying, restoring or granting the injunction, receivership, accounting, or award of support.<br><br>The stay of execution shall be upon such terms as to bond or otherwise as may be considered proper for the security or protection of the rights of the adverse party.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>SEC. 13. <i>Property exempt from execution</i>. â Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the following property, and no other, shall be exempt from execution:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(1) <i>The right to receive</i> legal support, or money or property obtained as such support, or any <i>pension or gratuity from the Government</i>;<br><br>. . . .<br><br>But no article or species of property mentioned in this section shall be exempt from execution issued upon a judgment recovered for its price or upon a judgment of foreclosure of a mortgage thereon. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Based on the Family Code, Colonel Otamias is obliged to give support to his family, petitioners in this case. However, he retired in 2003, and his sole source of income is his pension.

Hence, the Armed Forces of the Philippines is not bound by the trial court's ruling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>The Armed Forces of the Philippines also cited <i>Pacific Products</i>, where this Court ruled that:<br><blockquote>A rule, which has never been seriously questioned, is that money in the hands of public officers, although it may be due government employees, is not liable to the creditors of these employees in the process of garnishment. One reason is, that the State, by virtue of its sovereignty may not be sued in its own courts except by express authorization by the Legislature, and to subject its officers to garnishment would be to permit indirectly what is prohibited directly. Another reason is that moneys sought to be garnished, as long as they remain in the hands of the disbursing officer of the Government, belong to the latter, although the defendant in garnishment may be entitled to a specific portion thereof. And still another reason which covers both of the foregoing is that every consideration of public policy forbids it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>This Court in <i>Republic v. Yahon</i> denied the Petition and discussed that because Republic Act No. 9262 is the later enactment, its provisions should prevail,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>We hold that Section 8(g) of R.A. No. 9262, being a later enactment, should be construed as laying down an exception to the general rule above stated that retirement benefits are exempt from execution. The law itself declares that the court shall order the withholding of a percentage of the income or salary of the respondent by the employer, which shall be automatically remitted directly to the woman "[<i>n</i>]<i>otwithstanding other laws to the contrary</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>IV</b><br></div><br>The 1987 Constitution gives much importance to the family as the basic unit of society, such that Article XV<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> is devoted to it.<br><br>The passage of the Family Code further implemented Article XV of the Constitution. This Court has recognized the importance of granting support to minor children, provided that the filiation of the child is proven. In this case, the filiation of Jeffren M. Otamias and Jemwel M.

An appeal was filed, but it was dismissed for having been filed out of time. This Court relaxed the rules of procedure and held that "[i]f the order of dismissal with prejudice of the petition for support were to stand, the petitioners would be deprived of their right to present and nature support."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>In <i>Gan v.

Gan (Gan) questioned the trial court's decision requiring him to give support and claimed that that he was not the father of the minor seeking support. He also argued that he was not given his day in court. This Court held that Gan's arguments were meant to delay the execution of the judgment, and that in any case, Gan himself filed a Motion for Leave to Deposit in Court Support Pendente Lite:<br><blockquote>In all cases involving a child, his interest and welfare are always the paramount concerns. There may be instances where, in view of the poverty of the child, it would be a travesty of justice to refuse him support until the decision of the trial court attains finality while time continues to slip away. An excerpt from the early case of <i>De Leon v. Soriano</i> is relevant, thus:<br><blockquote>The money and property adjudged for support and education should and must be given presently and without delay because if it had to wait the final judgment, the children may in the meantime have suffered because of lack of food or have missed and lost years in school because of lack of funds. One cannot delay the payment of such funds for support and education for the reason that if paid long afterwards, however much the accumulated amount, its payment cannot cure the evil and repair the damage caused. The children with such belated payment for support and education cannot act as gluttons and eat voraciously and unwisely, afterwards, to make up for the years of hunger and starvation. Neither may they enrol in several classes and schools and take up numerous subjects all at once to make up for the years they missed in school, due to non-payment of the funds when needed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>V</b><br></div><br>The non-inclusion of the AFP PGMC or the AFP Finance Center in the action for support was proper, considering that both the AFP PGMC and the AFP Finance Center are not the persons obliged to give support to Edna, et al.
