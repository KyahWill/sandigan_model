				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Motion for Reconsideration before us seeks to reverse the Decision of this Court in <i>Saguisag et. al., v. Executive Secretary</i> dated 12 January 2016.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The petitions in <i>Sasguisag, et. al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> had questioned the constitutionality of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America (U.S.). There, this Court ruled that the petitions be dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On 3 February 2016, petitioners in the Decision filed the instant Motion, asking for a reconsideration of the Decision in <i>Saguisag, et. al</i>., questioning the ruling of the Court on both procedural and substantive grounds, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, petitioners respectfully pray that the Honorable Court RECONSIDER, REVERSE, AND SET - ASIDE its Decision dated January 12, 2016, and issue a new Decision GRANTING the instant consolidated petitions by declaring the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) entered into by the respondents for the Philippine government, with the United States of America, UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND INVALID and to permanently enjoin its implementation.<br><br>Other forms of relief just and equitable under the premises are likewise prayed for.<br></blockquote>At the outset, petitioners questioned the procedural findings of the Court despite acknowledging the fact that the Court had given them standing to sue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Therefore this issue is now irrelevant and academic, and deserves no reconsideration.<br><br>As for the substantive grounds, petitioners claim this Court erred when it ruled that EDCA was not a treaty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> In connection to this, petitioners move that EDCA must be in the form of a treaty in order to comply with the constitutional restriction under Section 25, Article XVIII of the 1987 Constitution on foreign military bases, troops, and facilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Additionally, they reiterate their arguments on the issues of telecommunications, taxation, and nuclear weapons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>We deny the Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>Petitioners do not present new arguments to buttress their claims of error on the part of this Court. They have rehashed their prior arguments and made them responsive to the structure of the Decision in <i>Saguisag</i>, yet the points being made are the same.<br><br>However, certain claims made by petitioners must be addressed. <br><br><b><i>On <i>verba legis</i> interpretation</i></b><br><br>Petitioners assert that this Court contradicted itself when it interpreted the word "allowed in" to refer to the initial entry of foreign bases, troops, and facilities, based on the fact that the plain meaning of the provision in question referred to prohibiting the return of foreign bases, troops, and facilities except under a treaty concurred in by the Senate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>This argument fails to consider the function and application of the <i>verba legis</i> rule.<br><br>Firstly, <i>verba legis</i> is a mode of construing the provisions of law as they stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> This takes into account the language of the law, which is in English, and therefore includes reference to the meaning of the words based on the actual use of the word in the language.<br><br>Secondly, by interpreting "allowed in" as referring to an initial entry, the Court has simply applied the plain meaning of the words in the particular provision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Necessarily, once entry has been established by a subsisting treaty, latter instances of entry need not be embodied by a separate treaty. After all, the Constitution did not state that foreign military bases, troops, and facilities shall not subsist or exist in the Philippines.<br><br>Petitioners' own interpretation and application of the <i>verba legis</i> rule will in fact result in an absurdity, which legal construction strictly abhors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> If this Court accept the essence of their argument that every instance of entry by foreign bases, troops, and facilities must be set out in detail in a new treaty, then the resulting bureaucratic impossibility of negotiating a treaty for the entry of a head of State's or military officer's security detail, meetings of foreign military officials in the country, and indeed military exercises such as <i>Balikatan</i> will occupy much of, if not all of the official working time by various government agencies. This is precisely the reason why any valid mode of interpretation must take into account how the law is exercised and its goals effected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> <i>Ut res magis valeat quam pereat</i>.<br><br>The Constitution cannot be viewed solely as a list of prohibitions and limitations on governmental power, but rather as an instrument providing the process of structuring government in order that it may effectively serve the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> It is not simply a set of rules, but an entire legal framework for Philippine society.<br><br>In this particular case, we find that EDCA did not go beyond the framework. The entry of US troops has long been authorized under a valid and subsisting treaty, which is the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Reading the VFA along with the longstanding Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> led this Court to the conclusion that an executive agreement such as the EDCA was well within the bounds of the obligations imposed by both treaties.<br><br><b><i>On strict construction of an exception</i></b><br><br>This Court agrees with petitioners' cited jurisprudence that exceptions are strictly construed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> However, their patent misunderstanding of the Decision and the confusion this creates behooves this Court to address this argument.<br><br>To be clear, the Court did not add an exception to Section 25 Article XVIII. The general rule is that foreign bases, troops, and facilities are not allowed in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The exception to this is authority granted to the foreign state in the form of a treaty duly concurred in by the Philippine Senate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>It is in the operation of this exception that the Court exercised its power of review. The lengthy legal analysis resulted in a proper categorization of EDCA: an executive agreement authorized by treaty. This Court undeniably considered the arguments asserting that EDCA was, in fact, a treaty and not an executive agreement, but these arguments fell flat before the stronger legal position that EDCA merely implemented the VFA and MDT. As we stated in the Decision:<br><blockquote>xxx [I]t must already be clarified that the terms and details used by an implementing agreement need not be found in the mother treaty. They must be sourced from the authority derived from the treaty, but are not necessarily expressed word-for-word in the mother treaty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Hence, the argument that the Court added an exception to the law is erroneous and potentially misleading. The parties, both petitioners and respondents must therefore read the Decision carefully in order to fully comply with its disposition.<br><br><b><i>On EDCA as a treaty</i></b><br><br>The principal reason for the Motion for Reconsideration is evidently petitioners' disagreement with the Decision that EDCA implements the VFA and MDT. They reiterate their arguments that EDCA's provisions fall outside the allegedly limited scope of the VFA and MDT because it provides a wider arrangement than the VFA for military bases, troops, and facilities, and it allows the establishment of U.S. military bases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Specifically, petitioners cite the terms of the VFA referring to "joint exercises,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> such that arrangements involving the individual States-parties such as exclusive use of prepositioned materiel are not covered by the VFA. More emphatically, they state that prepositioning itself as an activity is not allowed under the VFA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Evidently, petitioners left out of their quote the portion of the Decision which cited the Senate report on the VFA. The full quote reads as follows:<br><blockquote>Siazon clarified that it is not the VFA by itself that determines what activities will be conducted between the armed forces of the U.S. and the Philippines. The VFA regulates and provides the legal framework for the presence, conduct and legal status of U.S. personnel while they are in the country for <b>visits, joint exercises and other related activities</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Quite clearly, the VFA contemplated activities beyond joint exercises, which this Court had already recognized and alluded to in <i>Lim v. Executive Secretary</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> even though the Court in that case was faced with a challenge to the Terms of Reference of a specific type of joint exercise, the <i>Balikatan Exercise</i>.<br><br>One source petitioners used to make claims on the limitation of the VFA to joint exercises is the alleged Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Primer on the VFA, which they claim states that:<br><blockquote>Furthermore, the VFA does not involve access arrangements for United States armed forces or the pre-positioning in the country of U.S. armaments and war materials. The agreement is about personnel and not equipment or supplies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>Unfortunately, the uniform resource locator link cited by petitioners is inaccessible. However, even if we grant its veracity, the text of the VFA itself belies such a claim. Article I of the VFA states that "[a]s used in this Agreement, "United States personnel" means United States military and civilian personnel temporarily in the Philippines in connection with activities approved by the Philippine Government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> These "activities" were, as stated in <i>Lim</i>, left to further implementing agreements. It is true that Article VII on Importation did not indicate pre-positioned materiel, since it referred to "United States Government equipment, materials, supplies, and other property imported into or acquired in the Philippines by or on behalf of the United States armed forces in connection with activities to which this agreement applies[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, neither did the text of the VFA indicate "joint exercises" as the only activity, or even as one of those activities authorized by the treaty. In fact, the Court had previously noted that<br><blockquote>[n]ot much help can be had therefrom [VFA], unfortunately, since the terminology employed is itself the source of the problem. The VFA permits United States personnel to engage, on an impermanent basis, in "activities," the exact meaning of which was left undefined. The expression is ambiguous, permitting a wide scope of undertakings subject only to the approval of the Philippine government. The sole encumbrance placed on its definition is couched in the negative, in that United States personnel must "abstain from any activity inconsistent with the spirit of this agreement, and in particular, from any political activity." All other activities, in other words, are fair game.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>Moreover, even if the DFA Primer was accurate, properly cited, and offered as evidence, it is quite clear that the DFA's opinion on the VFA is not legally binding nor conclusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It is the exclusive duty of the Court to interpret with finality what the VFA can or cannot allow according to its provisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In addition to this, petitioners detail their objections to EDCA in a similar way to their original petition, claiming that the VFA and MDT did not allow EDCA to contain the following provisions:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. Agreed Locations<br><br>2. Rotational presence of personnel<br><br>3. U.S. contractors<br><br>4. Activities of U.S. contractors<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></div><br>We ruled in <i>Saguisag, et. al.</i> that the EDCA is not a treaty despite the presence of these provisions. The very nature of EDCA, its provisions and subject matter, indubitably categorize it as an executive agreement - a class of agreement that is not covered by the Article XVIII Section 25 restriction - in painstaking detail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> To partially quote the Decision:<br><blockquote>Executive agreements may dispense with the requirement of Senate concurrence because of the legal mandate with which they are concluded. As culled from the afore-quoted deliberations of the Constitutional Commission, past Supreme Court Decisions, and works of noted scholars, executive agreements merely involve arrangements on the implementation of <i>existing</i> policies, rules, laws, or agreements. They are concluded (1) to adjust the details of a treaty; (2) pursuant to or upon confirmation by an act of the Legislature; or (3) in the exercise of the President's independent powers under the Constitution. The <i>raison d'etre</i> of executive agreements hinges on <i>prior</i> constitutional or legislative authorizations.<br><br>The special nature of an executive agreement is not just a domestic variation in international agreements. International practice has accepted the use of various forms and designations of international agreements, ranging from the traditional notion of a treaty - which connotes a formal, solemn instrument - to engagements concluded in modern, simplified forms that no longer necessitate ratification. An international agreement may take different forms: treaty, act, protocol, agreement, <i>concordat, compromis d'arbitrage</i>, convention, covenant, declaration, exchange of notes, statute, pact, charter, agreed minute, memorandum of agreement, <i>modus vivendi</i>, or some other form. Consequently, under international law, the distinction between a treaty and an international agreement or even an executive agreement is irrelevant for purposes of determining international rights and obligations.<br><br>However, this principle does not mean that the domestic law distinguishing <i>treaties, international agreements</i>, and <i>executive agreements</i> is relegated to a mere variation in form, or that the constitutional requirement of Senate concurrence is demoted to an optional constitutional directive. There remain two very important features that distinguish <i>treaties</i> from <i>executive agreements</i> and translate them into terms of art in the domestic setting.<br><br><i>First</i>, <b>executive agreements must remain traceable to an express or implied authorization under the Constitution, statutes, or treaties</b>. The absence of these precedents puts the validity and effectivity of executive agreements under serious question for the main function of the Executive is to enforce the Constitution and the laws enacted by the Legislature, not to defeat or interfere in the performance of these rules. In turn, executive agreements cannot create new international obligations that are not expressly allowed or reasonably implied in the law they purport to implement.<br><br><i>Second</i>, treaties are, by their very nature, considered superior to executive agreements. Treaties are products of the acts of the Executive and the Senate unlike executive agreements, which are solely executive actions. Because of legislative participation through the Senate, a treaty is regarded as being on the same level as a statute. If there is an irreconcilable conflict, a later law or treaty takes precedence over one that is prior. An executive agreement is treated differently. Executive agreements that are inconsistent with either a law or a treaty are considered ineffective. Both types of international agreement are nevertheless subject to the supremacy of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Subsequently, the Decision goes to great lengths to illustrate the source of EDCA's validity, in that as an executive agreement it fell within the parameters of the VFA and MDT, and seamlessly merged with the whole web of Philippine law. We need not restate the arguments here. It suffices to state that this Court remains unconvinced that EDCA deserves treaty status under the law.<br><br><b><i>On EDCA as basing agreement</i></b><br><br>Petitioners claim that the Decision did not consider the similarity of EDCA to the previous Military Bases Agreement (MBA) as grounds to declare it unconstitutional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Firstly, the Court has discussed this issue in length and there is no need to rehash the analysis leading towards the conclusion that EDCA is different from the MBA or any basing agreement for that matter.<br><br>Secondly, the new issues raised by petitioners are not weighty enough to overturn the legal distinction between EDCA and the MBA.<br><br>In disagreeing with the Court in respect of the MBA's jurisdictional provisions, petitioners cite an exchange of notes categorized as an "amendment" to the MBA, as if to say it operated as a new treaty and should be read into the MBA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>This misleadingly equates an exchange of notes with an amendatory treaty. Diplomatic exchanges of notes are not treaties but rather formal communication tools on routine agreements, akin to private law contracts, for the executive branch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> This cannot truly amend or change the terms of the treaty,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> but merely serve as private contracts between the executive branches of government. They cannot <i>ipso facto</i> amend treaty obligations between States, but may be treaty-authorized or treaty-implementing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Hence, it is correct to state that the MBA as the treaty did not give the Philippines jurisdiction over the bases because its provisions on U.S. jurisdiction were explicit. What the exchange of notes did provide was effectively a contractual waiver of the jurisdictional rights granted to the U.S. under the MBA, but did not amend the treaty itself.<br><br>Petitioners reassert that EDCA provisions on operational control, access to Agreed Locations, various rights and authorities granted to the US "ensures, establishes, and replicates what MBA had provided."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> However, as thoroughly and individually discussed in <i>Saguisag, et. al.</i>, the significant differences taken as a whole result in a very different instrument, such that EDCA has not re-introduced the military bases so contemplated under Article XVIII Section 25 of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><b><i>On policy matters</i></b><br><br>Petitioners have littered their motion with alleged facts on U.S. practices, ineffective provisions, or even absent provisions to bolster their position that EDCA is invalid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In this way, petitioners essentially ask this Court to replace the prerogative of the political branches and rescind the EDCA because it not a good deal for the Philippines. Unfortunately, the Court's only concern is the legality of EDCA and not its wisdom or folly. Their remedy clearly belongs to the executive or legislative branches of government.<br><br><center><b>EPILOGUE</b><br></center><br>While this Motion for Reconsideration was pending resolution, the United Nations Permanent Court of Arbitration tribunal constituted under the Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in <i>Republic of the Philippines v. People's Republic of China</i> released its monumental decision on the afternoon of 12 July 2016.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The findings and declarations in this decision contextualizes the security requirements of the Philippines, as they indicate an alarming degree of international law violations committed against the Philippines' sovereign rights over its exclusive economic zone (EEZ).<br><br>Firstly, the tribunal found China's claimed nine-dash line, which included sovereign claims over most of the West Philippine, invalid under the UNCLOS for exceeding the limits of China's maritime zones granted under the convention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Secondly, the tribunal found that the maritime features within the West Philippine Sea/South China Sea that China had been using as basis to claim sovereign rights within the Philippines' EEZ were not entitled to independent maritime zones.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Thirdly, the tribunal found that the actions of China within the EEZ of the Philippines, namely; forcing a Philippine vessel to cease-and-desist from survey operations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the promulgation of a fishing moratorium in 2012,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the failure to exercise due diligence in preventing Chinese fishing vessels from fishing in the Philippines' EEZ without complying with Philippine regulations,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the failure to prevent Chinese fishing vessels from harvesting endangered species,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the prevention of Filipino fishermen from fishing in traditional fishing grounds in Scarborough Shoal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and the island-building operations in various reefs, all violate its obligations to respect the rights of the Philippines over its EEZ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Fourthly, the tribunal rejected Chinese claims of sovereignty over features within the Philippine's EEZ,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and found that its construction of installations and structures, and later on the creation of an artificial island, violated its international obligations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Fifthly, the tribunal found that the behaviour of Chinese law enforcement vessels breached safe navigation provisions of the UNCLOS in respect of near-collision instances within Scarborough Shoal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Finally, the tribunal found that since the arbitration was initiated in 2013, China has aggravated the dispute by building a large artificial island on a low-tide elevation located in the EEZ of the Philippines aggravated the Parties' dispute concerning the protection and preservation of the marine environment at Mischief Reef by inflicting permanent, irreparable harm to the coral reef habitat of that feature, extended the dispute concerning the protection and preservation of the marine environment by commencing large-scale island-building and construction works at Cuarteron Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, Gaven Reef (Norths Johnson Reef, Hughes Reef, and Subi Reef, aggravated the dispute concerning the status of maritime features in the Spratly Islands and their capacity to generate entitlements to maritime zones by permanently destroying evidence of the natural condition of Mischief Reef, Cuarteron Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, Gaven Reef (North), Johnson Reef, Hughes Reef, and Subi Reef.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Taken as a whole, the arbitral tribunal has painted a harrowing picture of a major world power unlawfully imposing its might against the Philippines, There are clear indications that these violations of the Philippines' sovereign rights over its EEZ are continuing. The Philippine state is constitutionally-bound to defend its sovereignty, and must thus prepare militarily.<br><br>No less than the 1987 Constitution demands that the "State shall protect the nation's marine wealth in its archipelagic waters, territorial sea, and exclusive economic zone, and reserve its use and enjoyment exclusively to Filipino citizens."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>No less than the 1987 Constitution states that the principal role of the military under the President as commander-in-chief shall be as protector of the people and the State to secure the sovereignty of the State and the integrity of the national territory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>To recall, the Philippines and the U.S. entered into the MDT in 1951<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> with two things in mind, first, it allowed for mutual assistance in maintaining and developing their individual and collective capacities to resist an armed attack;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> and second, it provided for their mutual self-defense in the event of an armed attack against the territory of either party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The treaty was premised on their recognition that an armed attack on either of them would equally be a threat to the security of the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The EDCA embodies this very purpose. It puts into greater effect a treaty entered into more than 50 years ago in order to safeguard the sovereignty of the Philippines, and cement the military friendship of the U.S. and Philippines that has thrived for decades through multiple presidents and multiple treaties. While it is a fact that our country is now independent, and that the 1987 Constitution requires Senate consent for foreign military bases, troops, and facilities, the EDCA as envisioned by the executive and as formulated falls within the legal regime of the MDT and the VFA.<br><br>In the context of recent developments, the President is bound to defend the EEZ of the Philippines and ensure its vast maritime wealth for the exclusive enjoyment of Filipinos. In this light, he is obligated to equip himself with all resources within his power to command. With the MDT and VFA as a blueprint and guide, EDCA strengthens the Armed Forces of the Philippines and through them, the President's ability to respond to any potential military crisis with sufficient haste and greater strength.<br><br>The Republic of Indonesia is strengthening its military presence and defences in the South China Sea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Vietnam has lent its voice in support of the settlement of disputes by peaceful means<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> but still strongly asserts its sovereignty over the Paracel islands against China.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The international community has given its voice in support of the tribunal's decision in the UNCLOS arbitration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Despite all this, China has rejected the ruling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Its ships have continued to drive off Filipino fishermen from areas within the Philippines' EEZ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Its military officials have promised to continue its artificial island-building in the contested areas despite the ruling against these activities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>In this light, the Philippines must continue to ensure its ability to prevent any military aggression that violates its sovereign rights. Whether the threat is internal or external is a matter for the proper authorities to decide. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte has declared, in his inaugural speech, that the threats pervading society are many: corruption, crime, drugs, and the breakdown of law and order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> He has stated that the Republic of the Philippines will honor treaties and international obligations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> He has also openly supported EDCA's continuation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Thus, we find no reason for EDCA to be declared unconstitutional. It fully conforms to the Philippines' legal regime through the MDT and VFA.

The implementation of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) without Senate concurrence will be in contravention of the clear and unequivocal mandatory provision of Section 25, Article XVIII of the Constitution.<br><br>Senate Resolution No. 105 dated November 10, 2015, stating the strong sense of the Senate that "[t]he RP-US Treaty requires Senate concurrence in order to be valid and effective," is in accord with the aforesaid constitutional provision.<br><br>The majority opinion penned by the Honorable Chief Justice Maria Lourdes P. A. Sereno makes mention of the recent favorable ruling of the United Nations Permanent Court of Arbitration concerning the respective territorial claims of the Philippines and the People's Republic of China over portions of the West Philippine Sea. Thus, the majority stresses that the President of the Philippines need to equip himself with all resources within his power to command in order to defend our preferent rights over our exclusive economic zone. Chief Justice Sereno argues that there is no reason to declare the EDCA unconstitutional given that it "strengthens the Armed Forces of the Philippines and through them, the President's ability to respond to any potential military crisis with sufficient haste and greater strength." The above assertions are, however, irrelevant in determining the issue of the constitutionality of treating the EDCA as a binding international agreement without Senate concurrence.<br><br>The wisdom and political reasons behind the EDCA are not in issue in this case, but rather the non-observance of the mandatory processes dictated by the Constitution regarding the allowance of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities in the Philippines. Section 25, Article XVIII of the Constitution dictates that agreements such as the EDCA must be submitted to the Senate for its concurrence and, if Congress so requires, to the Filipino people for ratification via a national referendum. These constitutionally ordained processes would save from constitutional infirmity the presence of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities in the Philippines.<br><br>Section 25, Article XVIII of the Constitution reads:<br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE XVIII <br>TRANSITORY PROVISIONS<br></center><br>SEC. 25. After the expiration in 1991 of the Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America concerning Military Bases, foreign military bases, troops, or facilities shall not be allowed in the Philippines except under a treaty duly concurred in by the Senate and, when the Congress so requires, ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the people in a national referendum held for that purpose, and recognized as a treaty by the other contracting State.<br></blockquote>As held in <i>BAYAN</i> (<i>Bagong Alyansang Makabayan</i>) <i>v. Zamora</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Section 25, Article XVIII covers three different situations: the presence within the Philippines of (a) <b>foreign military bases</b>, or (b) <b>foreign military troops</b>, or (c) <b>foreign military facilities</b>, such that a treaty that involves any of these three, standing alone, falls within the coverage of the said provision. The deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission bear out this interpretation, to wit:<br><blockquote>MR. MAAMBONG. I just want to address a question or two to Commissioner Bernas.<br><br>This formulation speaks of three things: foreign military bases, troops or facilities. My first question is: <i>If the country does enter into such kind of a treaty, must it cover the three-bases, troops or facilities or could the treaty entered into cover only one or two?</i><br><br>FR. BERNAS. <i>Definitely, it can cover only one. Whether it covers only one or it covers three, the requirement will be the same.</i><br><br>MR. MAAMBONG. <i>In other words, the Philippine government can enter into a treaty covering not bases but merely troops?</i><br><br>FR. BERNAS. <i>Yes.</i><br><br>MR. MAAMBONG. I cannot find any reason why the, government can enter into a treaty covering only troops.<br><br>FR. BERNAS. Why not? Probably if we stretch our imagination a little bit more, we will find some. We just want to cover everything.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (Citation omitted.)<br></blockquote>On March 14, 1947, the Philippines and the United States entered into a <b>Military Bases Agreement</b> (MBA) which granted to the United States government the right to <i>retain</i> the use of the bases listed in the Annexes of said agreement. The term of the MBA was set to expire in 1991 in accordance with the Ramos-Rusk Agreement.<br><br>Subsequently, on August 30, 1951, the Philippines and the United States entered into the <b>Mutual Defense Treaty</b> (MDT) in order to actualize their desire "to declare publicly and formally their sense of unity and their common determination to <b>defend themselves against external armed attack</b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and "further to strengthen their present efforts to collective defense for the preservation of peace and security pending the development of a more comprehensive system of regional security in the Pacific area."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> It is noteworthy that the MDT provides as follows:<br><blockquote>Article IV. Each Party recognizes that an armed attack in the Pacific Area on either of the Parties would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common dangers <b>in accordance with its constitutional process</b>.<br></blockquote>In 1986, in view of the impending expiration of the MBA in 1991, the members of the Constitutional Commission deliberated on the issue of the continued presence of foreign military bases in the country in this wise:<br><blockquote>FR. BERNAS. My question is: Is it the position of the committee that the presence of foreign military bases in the country under any circumstances is a derogation of national sovereignty?<br><br>MR. AZCUNA, It is difficult to imagine a situation based on existing facts where it would not. However, in the abstract, it is possible that it would not be that much of a derogation. I have in mind, Madam President, the argument that has been presented. Is that the reason why there are U.S. bases in England, in Spain and in Turkey? And it is not being claimed that their sovereignty is being derogated. Our situation is different from theirs because we did not lease or rent these bases to the U.S. The U.S. retained them from us as a colonial power.<br><br>FR. BERNAS. So, the second sentence, Madam President, has specific reference to what obtains now.<br><br>MR. AZCUNA. Yes. It is really determined by the present situation.<br><br>FR. BERNAS. Does the first sentence tolerate a situation radically different from what obtains now? In other words, if we understand sovereignty as auto-limitation, as a people's power to give up certain goods in order to obtain something which may be more valuable, would it be possible under this first sentence for the nation to negotiate some kind of a treaty agreement that would not derogate against sovereignty?<br><br>MR. AZCUNA. Yes. For example, Madam President, if it is negotiated on a basis of true sovereign equality, such as a mutual ASEAN defense agreement wherein an ASEAN force is created and this ASEAN force is a foreign military force and may have a basis in the member ASEAN countries, this kind of a situation, I think, would not derogate from sovereignty.<br><br>MR, NOLLEDO. Madam President, may I be permitted to make a comment on that beautiful question. I think there will be <b>no derogation of sovereignty if the existence of the military bases as stated by Commissioner Azcuna is on the basis of a treaty</b> which was not only ratified by the appropriate body, like the Congress, but also by the people.<br><br>I would like also to refer to the situation in Turkey where the Turkish government has control over the bases in Turkey, where the jurisdiction of Turkey is not impaired in anyway, and Turkey retains the right to terminate the treaty under circumstances determined by the host government. I think under such circumstances, the existence of the military bases may not be considered a derogation of sovereignty, Madam President.<br><br>FR. BERNAS. Let me be concrete, Madam President, in our circumstances. <b>Suppose they were to have this situation where our government were to negotiate a treaty with the United States, and then the two executive departments in the ordinary course of negotiation come to an agreement. As our Constitution is taking shape now, if this is to be a treaty at all, it will have to be submitted to our Senate for its ratification. Suppose, therefore, that what was agreed upon between the United States and the executive department of the Philippines is submitted and ratified by the Senate, then it is further submitted to the people for its ratification and subsequently, we ask the United States: "Complete the process by accepting it as a treaty through ratification by your Senate as the United States Constitution requires," would such an arrangement be in derogation of sovereignty?</b><br><br>MR.

The EDCA must be submitted to the Senate for concurrence; otherwise, the same is rendered ineffective.<br><br>In <i>BAYAN v. Zamora</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Court rejected the argument that Section 25, Article XVIII does not apply to mere transient agreements such as the VFA, holding that:<br><blockquote>[I]t is specious to argue that Section 25, Article XVIII is inapplicable to mere transient agreements for the reason that there is no permanent placing of structure for the establishment of a military base. On this score, <b>the Constitution makes no distinction between "transient" and "permanent." Certainly, we find nothing in Section 25, Article XVIII that requires <i>foreign troops or facilities</i> to be stationed or placed permanently in the Philippines</b>. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>The VFA, which allows only the <b>temporary visits</b> of the United States forces in the Philippines as it was extensively pointed out by the respondents in the above-cited <i>BAYAN</i> case, was considered by the Court to require Senate concurrence, notwithstanding its avowed purpose of implementing the MDT. With more reason, therefore, that the practically <b>permanent stay</b> of United States bases, troops and facilities in the Philippines for the duration of the EDCA requires the same Senate concurrence.<br><br>The Court discussed in <i>BAYAN</i> that:<br><blockquote>Section 25, Article XVIII disallows foreign military bases, troops, or facilities in the country, unless the following conditions are sufficiently met, viz.: (a) it must be under a <i>treaty</i>; (b) the treaty must be <i>duly concurred in by the Senate</i> and, when so required by Congress, ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the people in a national referendum; and (c) <i>recognized as a treaty</i> by the other contracting state.<br><br>There is no dispute as to the presence of the first two requisites in the case of the VFA. The concurrence handed by the Senate through Resolution No. 18 is in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, whether under the general requirement in Section 21, Article VII, or the specific mandate mentioned in Section 25, Article XVIII, the provision in the latter article requiring ratification by a majority of the votes cast in a national referendum being unnecessary since Congress has not required it.<br><br>As to the matter of voting, <i>Section 21, Article VII</i> particularly requires that a treaty or international agreement, to be valid and effective, must be <i>concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the members of the Senate</i>. On the other hand, <i>Section 25, Article XVIII</i> simply provides that the treaty be "<i>duly concurred in by the Senate</i>."<br><br>Applying the foregoing constitutional provisions, a two-thirds vote of all the members of the Senate is clearly required so that the concurrence contemplated by law may be validly obtained and deemed present. While it is true that Section 25, Article XVIII requires, among other things, that the treaty — the VFA, in the instant case — be "duly concurred in by the Senate," it is very true however that said provision must be related and viewed in light of the clear mandate embodied in Section 21, Article VII, which in more specific terms, requires that the concurrence of a treaty, or international agreement, be made by a two-thirds vote of all the members of the Senate. Indeed, Section 25, Article XVIII must not be treated in isolation to Section 21, Article, VII.<br><br>As noted, the "concurrence requirement" under Section 25, Article XVIII must be construed in relation to the provisions of Section 21, Article VII. In a more particular language, the concurrence of the Senate contemplated under Section 25, Article XVIII means that at least two-thirds of all the members of the Senate favorably vote to concur with the treaty — the VFA in the instant case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>The <i>ponencia</i>, however, still insists that the EDCA is an executive agreement that merely implements the MDT and the VFA such that it was well within the bounds of the obligations imposed by the said treaties. Hence, the EDCA need not comply with the requirements under Section 25, Article XVIII.<br><br>I reiterate my disagreement to this position. The EDCA goes far beyond the terms of the MDT and the VFA.<br><br>The EDCA is an entirely new agreement as it creates new obligations on the part of the Philippines and confers unprecedented rights and concessions in favor of the United States.<br><br>With respect to the MDT, said treaty did not contain any provision regarding the presence in Philippine territory - whether permanent or temporary - of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities. There is nothing in the MDT that makes any reference or cites any connection to the basing agreement which was then already expressly covered by a prior treaty, the MBA.<br><br>Thus, the presence of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities provided under the EDCA cannot be traced to the MDT.<br><br>Moreover, Article IV of the MDT states that the individual parties to the treaty "recognizes that an armed attack in the Pacific Area on either of the Parties would be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that <b>it would act to meet the common dangers in accordance with its constitutional process</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Therefore, the MDT expressly recognizes the need for each party to comply with their respective constitutional processes in carrying out their obligations under the MDT.<br><br>If the MDT were to be implemented through the EDCA as the <i>ponencia</i> suggests, Philippines must adhere to the mandate of Section 25, Article XVIII.<br><br>In relation to the VFA, the EDCA transcends in scope and substance the provisions of the said treaty.

The more onerous obligations of the Philippines and the far-reaching privileges accorded the United States under the EDCA cannot be justified as nor deemed to be mere implementing arrangements of the VFA.<br><br>The settled rule is that the plain, clear and unambiguous language of the Constitution should be construed as such and should not be given a construction that changes its meaning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> As held in <i>Chavez v.

The agreement should be made through a treaty rather than an executive agreement because it <b><i>embodies new arrangements and new resulting obligations that are not present in the existing treaties</i></b>. In its present form, the agreement is invalid and cannot thus be effective.<br><br>I arrived at this conclusion after considering Article VII, Section 21 and Article XVIII, Section 25 of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br><b><u>Article VII, Section 21</u></b> renders any international agreement invalid and ineffective in the Philippines unless it has been concurred in by the Senate. <b><u>Article XVII, Section 25</u></b>, on the other hand, specifies that agreements allowing the entry of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities into the Philippines shall be in the form of a treaty and, thus, obligatorily be submitted to the Senate for concurrence.<br><br>I submit these considerations and conclusions to the Court with no intent to object to the entry of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities in the Philippines if such entry would truly reflect the will of the Filipino people expressed through the Senate of the Philippines.<br><br>At this point in time when Philippine territorial sovereignty is being violated, we cannot simply turn our backs on foreign assistance, such as that of the EDCA, that is made available to the country. But because of the implications of the EDCA for the Filipino people (<b><i><u>as it may unnecessarily expose them to the dangers inherent in living in a country that serves as an implementing location of the U.S. Pivot to Asia strategy, as discussed below</u></i></b>), the people - even if only through the Senate - should properly be informed and should give their consent. This is what our Constitution provides in allowing foreign bases or their equivalent into the country, and this Court - with its sworn duty as guardian of the Constitution - should protect both the Constitution and its safeguards, as well as the people in their right to be informed and to be consulted.<br><br>To be very clear, this Dissent relates solely to the Executive and this Court's acts of disregarding the clear terms prescribed and the process required by the Constitution. Why the Court so acted despite the clear terms of the cited constitutional provisions, only the majority of this Court can fully explain. The undeniable reality, though, is that the <i>ponencia</i> justified its conclusions by inordinately widening the scope of the presidential foreign affairs powers and misapplying the constitutional provisions mentioned above. Whichever way the matter is viewed, the result is the same - a clear violation of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>I find it particularly timely to stress the constitutional violations at this point when talks of constitutional amendments again resound in the air; it would be useless to go through an amendatory exercise if we do not accord full respect to the Constitution anyway, or if our obedience to the Constitution depends on political considerations and reasons extraneous to the Constitution.<br><br>I stress, too, that as Members of the Highest Court of the land, we owe utmost fidelity to our country's fundamental law, and have the duty to ensure its proper enforcement. The President, similarly burdened with the same duty, must owe the Constitution the same fidelity. The oaths we respectively took impose this obligation upon all of us. We must thus act on the present motions for reconsideration by re-examining the challenged ruling and by giving a more focused analysis on the issues based on what the Constitution truly requires.<br><br>It is well to recognize that part of the Court's compliance with its constitutional duty is to accord due deference to the President's authority and prerogatives in foreign affairs; that we should do so, fully aware that the President's discretion (or for that matter, the discretion exercised by all officials) in a constitutional and republican government is - by constitutional design - purposely limited. This case, in particular, presents a situation where foreign affairs powers that essentially belong to the President are shared with the Senate of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>All these form part of my original position that the President's use of an Executive Agreement as the medium to implement the EDCA does not comply with Article XVII, Section 21 and Article XVIII, Section 25, of the 1987 Constitution. As a consequence, the Executive Agreement that was signed cannot be "valid and effective" for being contrary to the Constitution; it continues to be so unless the EDCA is submitted to and concurred in by the Senate.<br><br>This position, in my view, will not pose any danger at all to the country under the present circumstances of international tension and on­going diplomatic interactions as <b><i>my objection solely relates to the process</i></b>. It is within the power of this Court to suspend the effectiveness of the ruling recommended by this Dissent, to allow the Executive and the Senate time to comply with the required constitutional process. After the EDCA's submission to the Senate within the time frame recommended by this Dissent and thereafter the Senate's concurrence, the EDCA can then be fully implemented as a treaty.<br><br><b><i>A. The Present Motions for Reconsideration</i></b><br><br>The present Motions for Reconsideration ask the Court to reconsider its previous ruling in <i>Saguisag v. Executive Secretary</i> (dated January 12, 2016) that recognized the EDCA, as written and signed, to be a validly entered Executive Agreement, thereby bypassing the need for the Senate concurrence that the Constitution requires.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> dismisses these motions, noting that they failed to present arguments sufficient to justify the reversal of the Court's previous Decision. In so ruling, the <i>ponencia</i> relies on the premise that the President may enter into an executive agreement allowing the entry of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities if:<br><br><b><i>(1)</i></b> it is not the instrument that allows the <i>initial</i> presence of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>or</i><br><br><b><i>(2)</i></b> it merely <i>implements</i> existing laws or treaties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The EDCA, according to the <i>ponencia</i>, merely implements the country's existing treaties with the U.S., specifically the 1998 Visiting Forces Agreement (<i>VFA</i>) and the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (<i>MDT</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>With due respect, these positions present an overly simplistic interpretation of Article XVIII, Section 25 of the Constitution.

As with any constitutional provision, it must be read, interpreted, and applied in harmony with the rest of the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> in order not to negate the effectiveness of other provisions and of the key constitutional principles that underlie the Constitution. The affected underlying principles are the separation of powers and the check and balance principles.<br><br>These nuances, when applied to the present case, lead me to conclude that the EDCA should have been entered into as a treaty that requires Senate concurrence. This deficiency, as I will discuss further, is not irremediable under the terms of this Dissent,<br><br><center><b>II.</b><br></center><br><b>Article VII, Section 21 of the Constitution requires that agreements containing <u>new obligations</u> be in the form of a treaty concurred in by the Senate; this rule should apply to new obligations under Article XVIII, Section 25 on the entry of foreign military bases, troops or facilities.</b><br><br><b>A. (a) The <i>Ponencia</i> and <i>Verba Legis</i></b><br><br>The <span style="font-style: italic;">ponencia</span>, in dismissing the petitioners' motions for reconsideration, refuses to accord merit to the petitioners' position that a <i>verba legis</i> approach to Article XVIII, Section 25 requires that <b><i>every entry</i></b> of foreign military troops, bases, or facilities should be covered by a treaty.<br><br>To the <i>ponencia</i>, the <i>verba legis</i> principle only requires that an international agreement be in the form of a treaty only for the <b><i>initial entry</i></b> of foreign military bases, troops and facilities. This, to the <i>ponencia</i>, is the appropriate application of <i>verba legis</i>, as the petitioners' application of the <i>verba legis</i> principle would lead to absurdity.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> further posits that requiring a treaty for every entry of foreign military troops could lead to the bureaucratic impossibility of negotiating a treaty for every entry of a Head of State's security detail of military officers, for meeting with foreign military officials in the country, and indeed for military exercises such as the <i>Balikatan</i>; all these would occupy much of the official working time of various government agencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>To support this interpretation, the <i>ponencia</i> also notes that Article XVIII, Section 25 of the 1987 Constitution does not prohibit foreign military bases, troops, or facilities, but merely restricts their entry to the country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br><b>(b) My View of <i>Verba Legis</i></b><br><br>In contrast with these expressed positions, I hold the view that under the principles of constitutional construction, <i>verba legis</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the use of ordinary meaning or literal interpretation of the language of a provision)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> is only proper and called for when the statute is clear and unequivocal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> not when there are latent ambiguities or obscurity in the provision to be applied.<br><br>The Court (through former Chief Justice Enrique Fernando) demonstrated the application of this rule in <i>J.M. Tuason &amp; Co., Inc. v. Land Tenure Administration</i> when it said: "We look to the language of the document itself in our search for its meaning. <i>We do not of course stop there, but that is where we begin</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Justice Fernando then pointed out that constitutional construction may be reduced to a minimum and the provision should be given its ordinary meaning when the "<i>language employed is not swathed in obscurity</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>A plain reading of Section 25, Article XVIII reveals that, on its face, it is far from complete, thus giving rise to the present "coverage" and other directly related issues. In the context of the case before us, it does not expressly state that it should only be at the initial entry (as the <i>ponencia</i> posits) or upon every entry (as the petitioners claim). Section 25 provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 25. After the expiration in 1991 of the Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America concerning Military Bases, <b><i>foreign military bases, troops, or facilities shall <u>not be allowed</u> in the Philippines <u>except under a treaty</u> duly concurred in by the Senate and, when the Congress so requires, ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the people</i></b> in a national referendum held for that purpose, and recognized as a treaty by the other contracting State.<br></blockquote>Note that under these wordings a latent ambiguity exists on what the word "<i>allow</i>" in the phrase "<i>shall not be allowed</i>," covers: does it refer only to the first entry thus permitting all subsequent entries, or is a treaty required for every entry. Also, is the "purpose" of allowing entry relevant in determining the scope of the entries allowed under a treaty? In the context of the present case, the unavoidable question is - is a treaty called for in order to allow entry?<br><br>The provision, to be sure, contains no express and specific statement or standard about these details and leaves the fleshing out to interpretation and construction. The <i>ponencia</i>, with its <i>verba legis</i> approach, of course, simply states that treaties - <i>i.e.</i>, the 1951 Mutual Defense and the 1998 Visiting Forces Agreement - are in place and, from there, proceeds to conclude that all entries shall be allowed after the first entry under these treaties. In this way, the <i>ponencia</i> gave Article XVIII, Section 25 a simplistic application that misses the provision's wordings and intent.<br><br>What the <i>ponencia</i> has not taken into account at all, is the deeper consideration that <b><i><u>Section 25 was enacted to strike a balance between preserving the country's territorial sovereisnty and recognizing the need for foreign military cooperation</u></i></b>. This balance was crafted in response to the country's history and experience with foreign military bases, and its perceived threat to full independence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Indeed, the country's past experiences with foreign military presence had not been free from pain, but our constitutional framers recognized that there could be instances when foreign military presence would be necessary and thus gave the Constitution a measure of flexibility through Section 25.<br><br>To be sure, the requirement that <i>every entry</i> of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities in the Philippines be covered by a treaty does not and cannot achieve this balance. This requirement would unduly clog up government in its foreign and military affairs, and impede (or even block the possibility of) foreign military alliances, perhaps to the point of extreme difficulty in maintaining these ties if they materialize at all. In sum, the process would simply be too paralyzing for the government, and could not have been the interpretation intended by the framers of the Constitution when they drafted Section 25.<br><br>At the same time, Article XVIII Section 25 cannot be construed as a blanket authority to allow foreign military presence in the Philippines after the government agrees to its initial entry. Interpreting Article XVIII, Section 25 in this manner would <b><i>expand Section 25 to areas beyond its intended borders</i></b> and thereby unduly restrict the constitutionally mandated participation of the Senate in deciding the terms and degree of foreign military presence in the country. This blanket authority would lay open the country and its sovereignty to excessive foreign intrusion without the active consent of the people.<br><br><b>To fully capture and apply the balance envisioned when Article XVIII, Section 25 was drafted, we must look at its interaction with key provisions of the Constitution involving the conduct of international agreements, as well as with the principles of separation of powers and check and balance that underlie our Constitution. These principles are the measures that the Constitution institutionalizes in order to ensure that a balanced and very deliberate governmental approach is taken in protecting the country's sovereignty from foreign intrusion.</b><br><br>I submit, based on these premises, that the <i>ponencia</i>'s conclusions disregard at least three vital and important concepts in the country's tripartite system of government under the Constitution:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;<i>first</i>, that the President's foremost duty is to preserve and defend the Constitution;<br><br><i>second</i>, that the President in the exercise of his powers cannot disregard the separation of powers and check and balance principles that underlie our system of government under the Constitution; and<br><br><i>third</i>, that the totality of governmental powers involved in entering international agreements, although predominantly executive in character because the President leads the process, still involves shared functions among the three branches of government.<br></div><br><b><i>B. The President's role in defending and preserving the Constitution</i></b><br><br>The supremacy of the Constitution means that in the performance of his duties, the President should always be guided and kept in check by the safeguards crafted by the framers of the Constitution and ratified by the people.<br><br>Thus, while due deference and leeway should be given when the President exercises his powers as the commander in chief of the country's armed forces<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and as the chief architect of its international affairs,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> this deference should never be used to allow him to countermand what the Constitution provides, as the President is himself a creature of the Constitution and his first and foremost task is to preserve and defend it.<br><br>No less than the oath of office required of the President before he assumes office (under Article VII, Section 5 of the Constitution) requires him to "<i>faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as President (or Vice-President or Acting President) of the Philippines, preserve and defend its Constitution, execute its laws xxx</i>."<br><br>Notably, the President shares this duty with all government employees and officials, including members of the judiciary. Article IX-B, Section 4 requires all public officers and employees to "<i>take an oath or affirmation to uphold and defend this Constitution</i>."<br><br>Taken together, these oath requirements are reminders of the duty of all persons working for the government - regardless of the branch to which they belong - to actively maintain their fealty to the present Constitution. <b><i>For members of the judiciary, this duty requires that they faithfully apply what the Constitution provides, even if they do not fully agree with these terms, with their established interpretation, and with their application to actual situations.</i></b><br><br><b><i>C. The President's foreign affairs power in the wider operational context of our government's tripartite system</i></b><br><br><b>a. The foreign affairs power in its wider context</b><br><br>While the President is undeniably the chief architect of foreign policy and is the country's chief representative in international affairs,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> this wide grant of power <b><i>operates under the wider context</i></b> of the shared functions of the three branches of government in the conduct of international relations.<br><br>I discern this legal reality in the phrasing and placement of Section 21, Article VII of the Constitution, which is the general provision governing the entry into a treaty:<br><blockquote>SECTION 21. No treaty or international agreement shall be valid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the Members of the Senate.<br></blockquote>The inclusion of Section 21 under the Article on the Executive Department is significant as this Article defines the powers of the President. Section 21 signifies the <b><i>recognition</i></b> of the President's foreign affairs power (among them, the negotiation and ratification of international agreements) as well as the limitation of this power.<br><br>The limitation can be found in the check-and-balance measure from the Senate that Section 21 provides, which requires <b><i>prior</i></b> Senate concurrence in the treaties and international agreements that the President enters into, before they become valid and effective. The required Senate concurrence is a check on the Executive's treaty-making prerogative, in the same manner that the Executive's veto on laws passed by Congress is a check on the latter's legislative powers.<br><br>To be sure, not every step by the Executive in the international sphere requires prior Senate concurrence under our Constitution which itself expressly recognizes that the President, in the conduct of international affairs, may enter into executive agreements that are not subject to Senate concurrence.<br><br>Article VIII, Section 4(2) of the Constitution separately refers to <i>treaties</i> <b>and</b> to <i>international or executive agreements</i>, thus expressly recognizing these two mediums of international relations. The constitutional recognition of these mediums and their distinctions are likewise expressed in jurisprudence, history, and the underlying structure of our government as discussed below. These are not idle distinctions because of their potentially deep impact on the operation of our government, in relation particularly to its three great branches that, although separate and distinct from one another, also interact in constitutionally defined areas.<br><br>In considering the two mediums that the Constitution recognizes in relation to the President's foreign affairs powers, the deeper question to contend with centers on the interface among the three great branches of government when they act and interact with one another: <b>who decides when to treat an international agreement as a treaty or as an executive agreement; and what are the parameters for arriving at this decision</b>.<br><br>The President's power over foreign relations under the Constitution generally gives him the prerogative to decide whether an international agreement should be considered a treaty or an executive agreement. He is also the chief architect of foreign policy and is the country's representative with respect to international affairs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> He is vested with the authority to preside over the nation's foreign relations, particularly in dealing with foreign states and governments, extending or withholding recognition, maintaining diplomatic relations, and entering into treaties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the realm of treaty making, the President has the sole authority to negotiate with other States.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>His authority over foreign relations, however, is not unlimited. For one, in deciding whether an international agreement shall be in the form of a treaty or an executive agreement, placing the entire discretion in the President potentially renders Section 21 a nullity or, at the very least, waters down the Constitution's concurrence requirement.<br><br>Of course, in a situation where there are <i>no discoverable standards</i> that definitively guide the President's determination, the demand for prompt action on foreign affairs matters could arguably and incontestably lead to the treatment of international agreements as executive agreements. This result is not remote given that the alternative is the sharing of power with a 24-member Senate and with the uncertainty and intractability that this sharing entails. The situation, however, would be otherwise if applicable standards are <i>in place</i> or <i>can be discerned</i>.<br><br>In the Philippines' constitutional situation, while the Constitution does not specifically direct when an international agreement should be in the form of a treaty or an executive agreement, <b><i>standards can be discerned</i></b> by tracing the <b><i>authority</i></b> through which these agreements were arrived at and made effective, and by considering the <b><i>impact</i></b> of these agreements on the Philippine legal system.<br><br>As I have earlier explained, Section 21, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution governs the process by which a treaty is ratified and made valid and effective in the Philippines. The treaty-making process involves a shared function between the Executive and the Senate: the President negotiates and ratifies, but the Senate must concur for the treaty to be valid and effective.<br><br>From this general perspective and the general terms of Section 21, the President's act of entering into executive agreements may be considered an <b><i>exception to the treaty-making process</i></b>: the President may enter into <b><i>executive agreements</i></b> which are international agreements that, until now, have been defined as international agreements "similar to treaties except they do not require legislative concurrence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> They have also been described to have "abundant precedent in history" and may either be <b><i>concluded based on a "<u>specific consressional authorization</u>" or "<u>in conformity with policies declared in acts of Congress with respect to the general subject matter</u>."</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Closely examined, the exceptional character of an executive agreement in relation to a treaty, its definition, and the general description shown above, cannot but lead to the conclusion that entry into an executive agreement does not purely involve the exercise of foreign affairs powers although the entry occurs in a foreign relations environment. While the President also deals with another State in a foreign affairs setting when negotiating and entering into an executive agreement, invalidity does not result even if no Senate intervention takes place, apparently because the <i>President exercises a power that is solely and constitutionally his</i>. This presidential power, based on the listing of powers under the Constitution, can only be the authority and duty to execute the laws and ensure their implementation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Under this close inspection and consideration of the sharing of power under Section 21, what stands out clearly is that the President can negotiate and ratify <b>as executive agreements</b> only those that he can competently execute and implement on his own, <i>i.e.</i>, <b><i>those that have prior legislative authorization, or those that have already undergone the treaty-making process under Article VII, Section 21 of the 1987 Constitution</i></b>. From the perspective of Section 21, treaty making is different and cannot be solely the President's as this power, by constitutional mandate, is one that he must share with the Senate.<br><br>Viewed and explained in this manner, executive agreements are clearly part of the President's duty to execute the laws faithfully. These agreements trace their validity from existing laws or treaties duly authorized by the legislative branch of government; they implement laws and treaties.<br><br>In contrast, treaties - as international agreements that need concurrence from the Senate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> - <i>do not originate solely from the President's duty as the executor of the country's laws, but from the shared function between the President and the Senate that the Constitution mandated under Article VII, Section 21 of the 1987 Constitution</i>.<br><br>Between the two, a treaty exists on a higher plane as it carries the authority of the President and the Senate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Treaties, which have the impact of statutory law in the Philippines, can amend or prevail over prior statutory enactments. Executive agreements - which exist at the level of implementing rules and regulations or administrative orders in the domestic sphere - have no such effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> They cannot contravene or amend statutory enactments and treaties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>This difference in impact is based on their origins: since a treaty has the approval of both the President and the Senate, it has the same impact as a statute. In contrast, since an executive agreement springs from the President's power to execute laws, it cannot amend or violate existing treaties, and must be in accord with and made pursuant to laws and treaties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><b><i>Accordingly, the <u>intended effect</u> of an international agreement determines its form.<br><br>When an international agreement merely implements an existing agreement or law, it is properly in the form of an executive agreement. In contrast, when an international agreement involves the introduction of a new subject matter or the amendment of existing treaties or laws, then it should properly be in the form of a treaty.</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Still another way of looking at the matter is <b><i>from the prism of the shared function</i></b> that Section 21 directly implies. In other words, based on the constitutional design reflected in Section 21, action on international agreements is always a <i>shared function</i> among the three branches of government.<br><br><b><i><u>Treaties</u></i></b> that the President enters into should have the required Senate concurrence for its validity and effectivity. Even the President's <b><i><u>executive agreements</u></i></b> that are within the President's authority to enter into without Senate concurrence, effectively reflect a shared function as they implement laws passed by Congress or treaties that the Senate has previously concurred in. The <b><i><u>judicial branch</u></i></b> of government, on the other hand, passively participates in international agreements through the exercise of judicial power; courts have the duty to ensure that the Executive and the Legislature stay within their spheres of competence, and that the constitutional standards and limitations set by the Const itution are not violated.<br><br><b>Under these norms, an executive agreement that creates new obligations or amends existing ones should properly be classified and entered into as a treaty. When implemented as an executive agreement that does not have the benefit of the treaty-making process and its Senate concurrence, such executive agreement is invalid and ineffective, and can judicially be so declared through judicial review.</b><br><br><b><i>D. Article XVIII, Section 25 reinforces Article VII, Section 21.</i></b><br><br>That the entry of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities into the country is specifically covered by its own provision (<i>i.e.</i>, Section 25, Article XVIII of the Constitution) does not change the dynamics that come into play in reading, interpreting, and implementing Section 25 and Section 21. In fact, these constitutional provisions actually reinforce one another.<br><br>Article XVIII, Section 25 of the 1987 Constitution does not specifically contradict the President's authority to conduct foreign affairs; neither does it limit the Senate's check-and-balance prerogative to concur in treaties under Section 21. <b><i>Article XVIII, Section 25, too, is not an exception to Article VII, Section 21, but must be read under the terms of this latter provision.</i></b><br><br>Viewed in this manner, the standard for determining the form of an international agreement for the entry of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities in the Philippines should be the same standard used to determine whether <b><i>any</i></b> international agreement should be in the form of an executive agreement or a treaty.<br><br><b><i>To reiterate this standard in the context of Article XVIII, Section 25: when an international agreement involves new obligations or amendments to existing obligations on foreign military bases, troops or facilities in the Philippine territory, the agreement should be in the form of a treaty that requires Senate concurrence; if, on the other hand, the agreement merely implements an existing treaty or law, then the subsequent entry of foreign military troops, bases, or facilities may be in the form of an executive agreement.</i></b><br><br>Note, at this point, that <b><i>Congress cannot legislate the entry of foreign military troops, bases, or facilities into the country as Section 25, Article XVIII of the Constitution specifically requires that this action be made through the shared action of the President and the Senate</i></b>. Consistent with the delineation of authority on the entry of military bases, troops or facilities, the President can only enter into an executive agreement allowing such entry to implement treaties on foreign military presence that are already in place.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i>'s insistence on confining Section 25 to the initial entry of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities contradicts and disrupts the check-and-balance harmony that Section 21 fosters. If we were to follow its argument that Section 25 is confined only to the initial entry, then subsequent <b><i>changes or amendments</i></b> to these agreements would no longer require a treaty, and would tilt the balance in favor of the President, contrary to the dictates of Section 21, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br><b><i>Under the present circumstances, the affirmation oj the ponencia's ruling effectively means that the President alone - by executive agreement - can determine the entry of foreign military presence, checked only by a Court already bound to the ponencia, as initial entry has been made under the general terms of the Mutual Defense Treaty and the Visiting Forces Agreements.</i></b><br><br><b><i>To carry the resulting consequence further, troops and facilities allowed via the EDCA through an Executive Agreement, would now be allowed simply because there had been earlier entries although their entries had effectively made the Philippines a forward base for American military operations. All these would be established at the sole will of one person, the President of the Philippines, abetted by this Court, and without the benefit of the collective wisdom of the Filipino people expressed through the Senate.</i></b><br><br>It is not for me, nor for this Court, to argue about the <b><i><u>wisdom of this resulting arrangement</u></i></b>, but this Court must stand up and assert its duties and prerogatives when the arrangements violate the <u><b><i>terms of the Constitution</i></b></u>.<br><br>Based on the relationship between Article VII, Section 21 and Article XVIII, Section 25 discussed in this dissenting opinion; on the principles of separation of powers and check and balance that underlie the Constitution; and on the duty of all officials to uphold and defend the Constitution, I submit that the <i>ponencia</i> and its "initial entry approach" incorrectly answers the following material issues:<br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> Does the EDCA introduce foreign military bases, troops, or facilities into the Philippines that call for the application of Article XVIII, Section 25?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Do the obligations found in the EDCA impose new obligations or amend existing ones regarding the presence of military bases, troops, or facilities in the Philippines?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">On the basis of the responses to (1) and (2), can the EDCA be recognized as valid and effective without need for Senate concurrence?</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br><b><u>To restate mv position</u>: since the EDCA introduces foreign military bases, troops, or facilities in the Philippines within the contemplation of Article XVIII, Section 25 of the 1987 Constitution, and since these are undertaken as obligations different from those found under currently existing treaties with the U.S., then the EDCA, as an executive agreement, is invalid and ineffective.

Note in this regard that <i>if the EDCA had not envisioned the stay of U.S. Forces and equipment in the Agreed Locations for a period longer than that envisioned in the VFA</i>, it would not have added obligations regarding the storage of their equipment and materiel.<br><br>All these show that the EDCA embodies <b><i><u>arrangements of a more permanent nature</u></i></b> than the arrangements under the VFA; there was <b><i>a marked qualitative and quantitative change in the Philippines-U.S. military arrangements from the VFA to the EDCA</i></b>.

This enhancement, while <i>generally consistent</i> with the intents of the 1951 MDT and the 1998 VFA, creates <b><i>new arrangements and new obligations</i></b> that bring EDCA fully within the coverage of Article XVIII, Section 25 of the Constitution.<br><br>Note that the 1951 MDT merely embodied a <b><i>defense agreement</i></b>, focused as it is on defenses against armed external attacks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> <b><i>It made no provision for bases, troops, or facilities.</i></b> The entry of U.S. military bases and troops had been embodied in different, separate agreements, specifically, through the Military Bases Agreement (<i>MBA</i>) which expired in 1992, and through the current 1998 VFA.<br><br>With the lapse of the 1947 MBA, the MDT, on its own, does not have any provision allowing the entry of US military bases or facilities in the Philippines. The 1987 Constitution precisely foresaw the expiration of the 1947 MBA, and required that any subsequent extension of the presence of U.S. military bases, troops or facilities in the Philippines should be the subject of another treaty that would require Senate concurrence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Given the EDCA's introduction of U.S. military facilities that fall within the definition of "bases" (as discussed below) and the lack of any existing treaty allowing the entry of facilities of this type, the EDCA arguably now stands as an agreement taking the place of the 1947 MBA and should thus undergo the treaty-concurrence process that the 1987 Constitution requires. It cannot merely derive its validity and effectiveness from the 1951 MDT and 1998 VFA as an implementing instrument of these earlier agreements.<br><br><center><b>IV.<br><br>EDCA allows the entry of U.S. bases and facilities in the Philippines.</b><br></center><br>Neither can I agree with the <i>ponencia</i>'s continued denial of the EDCA's character as a basing agreement.

That the EDCA allows these arrangements for an initial period often (10) years, to <i>continue automatically unless terminated</i>, is a concrete indicator that it pertains to the presence on Philippine soil of foreign military bases, troops, and facilities on a more or less permanent basis.<br><br>Our understanding of the provision's coverage should also be adjusted to take into account contemporary developments such as the <b><u>U.S.'s Pivot to Asia</u></b> strategy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> which calls for U.S. presence in Asia in terms of the forward deployment of U.S. military forces. The EDCA fulfills this U.S. strategy as its Agreed Locations are the forward deployment sites where U.S. military forces are to be deployed, ready with manpower, arms, and resources for battle. In this sense, the EDCA does not merely involve training or temporary sojourns, but more or less permanent sites that the U.S. can use as needed <b><i>for its own military purposes</i></b>.<br><br>Even under the U.S. redefinitions of a military base, the EDCA would still involve the entry of military bases in the Philippines. It should be noted that the obligations under the EDCA correspond to the contemporary reclassification of a military base, <i>i.e.</i>, the Main Operating Base (<i>MOB</i>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Forward Operating Site (<i>FOS</i>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and Cooperative Security Location (<i>CSL</i>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> all footnoted below.<br><br>Essentially, the reconfiguration of what constitutes a U.S. base corresponds to the U.S.'s strategic objective of providing multiple avenues of access for contingency operations. Through access agreements (such as the EDCA), the U.S. maintains overseas military presence without the added costs and complications of establishing permanent bases. This is the U.S. "presence" that the <i>Pivot to Asia</i> speaks of. <b>With the Philippines as an implementing location of this "pivot" strategy, the country and its people would necessarily be exposed to all the dangers to which the U.S. would be exposed, even to the threats and dangers extraneous to Philippine interests.

Following the plain language of the law, the presence of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities in the Philippines is only constitutionally permissible if it is sanctioned by a treaty duly concurred in by Senate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>For context, the Agreement between the RP and the US (Parties) concerning Military Bases contained in this constitutional provision pertains to the Military Bases Agreement of 1947<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (MBA), whereby the US was accorded the following rights: (<i>a</i>) power, authority, and control over military establishments;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (<i>b</i>) use, operation, and defense of its bases, as well as the areas adjacent thereto in order to access the same;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> (<i>c</i>) use of certain land, coastal areas, and the air for military maneuvers, staging areas, and other military exercises, free of charge;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and (<i>d</i>) entry of US base personnel, their families, and other technical personnel of other nationalities into the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The Parties agreed that the MBA would be effective for a period of ninety-nine (99) years,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> or until the year 2046. Throughout the years, a number of piecemeal amendments were made thereto, particularly: (<i>a</i>) the shortening of its term to a total of forty-one (41) years, or until 1991, pursuant to the Ramos-Rusk Agreement;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (<i>b</i>) the return of 17 US military bases to the Philippines, in accordance with the Bohlen-Serrano Memorandum of Agreement;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (<i>c</i>) the recognition of Philippine sovereignty over the Clark and Subic Bases through the Romulo-Murphy Exchange of Notes of 1979;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and (<i>d</i>) the placing of the concept of operational use of military bases by the US Government within the context of Philippine sovereignty, including the need for prior consultation with the Philippine Government on the former's use of the bases, pursuant to the Romualdez-Armacost Agreement of 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Apparently, these amendments were reflective of the Philippines' intention to gradually restrict US control over the bases. The growing recalcitrance on US control was the catalyst for the adoption of Section 25, Article XVIII of the 1987 Philippine Constitution which, as above-cited, stringently demands, as a first requisite, a treaty duly concurred in by Senate, if we were to allow once more the presence of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities in the country.<br><br><center><b>II.</b><br></center><br>With the expiration of the MBA, no treaty subsists which would legitimize the presence of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities in the Philippines, at least, to the extent provided for in the EDCA. The closest subsisting legal anchorage for US military presence in the Philippines would be the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America (the Mutual Defense Treaty or the MDT), signed on August 30, 1951, and the Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the United States of America Regarding the Treatment of United States Armed Forces Visiting the Philippines (Visiting Forces Agreement or the VFA), signed on February 10, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> However, the obligations of the RP Government to the US Government under the MDT and VFA are clearly limited in scope as compared to the EDCA. As will be later elaborated upon, the EDCA institutionalizes the functional equivalent of military bases in the Philippines through its introduction of the concept of "Agreed Locations." Due to sheer variance of purpose, context, and parameters, this arrangement cannot find its legal bearings from the MDT or the VFA.<br><br>For its part, the MDT only embodies the Parties' general commitment to "maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist [an] armed attack."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Under the MDT, the Parties "[d]eclare publicly and formally their sense of unity and determination to defend themselves against [an] <b><u>external armed attack</u></b>," and recognize their desire "to strengthen their present efforts to collective defense for the preservation of peace and security pending the development of a more comprehensive system of regional security in the Pacific area."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Notably, the MDT was aligned with the situation at that time: it was a collaborative response of the RP and US Governments to the burgeoning threats brought about by the period of communist expansion in Asia following World War II and the Korean War.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, as pointed out by my esteemed colleague, Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen (Justice Leonen), the MDT's main aim is to provide support against state enemies effectively and efficiently.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In this regard, no way should the MDT be construed as a blanket license to legitimize subsequent agreements that further military objectives beyond this purpose. The MDT was in effect (and still remains in effect<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>) at the time the 1987 Constitution was adopted. Hence, it would be rather absurd for Section 25, Article XVIII of the 1987 Philippine Constitution to require a treaty duly concurred in by Senate anew if the presence of foreign military bases, troops, or facilities was already validated by the MDT.<br><br>This finding is more forceful in the case of the VFA. The VFA merely provides a mechanism for regulating the circumstances and conditions under which US forces may visit the Philippines for <b><u>bilateral military exercises</u></b>. In simple terms, these exercises pertain to joint training. As signified in the Terms of Reference of the "Balikatan 02-1," "[t]he Exercise is a mutual counter-terrorism advising, assisting[,] and training Exercise"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and that it "shall involve the conduct of mutual military assisting, advising[,] and training of [Republic of the Philippines (RP)] and US Forces with the primary objective of enhancing operational capabilities of both forces to combat terrorism."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In this respect, the VFA governs the entry and exit of US personnel in the country<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and establishes the manner of disposing criminal cases against any of its members, who commits an offense in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The VFA also establishes a procedure for resolving differences that may arise between the two sides with regard to the provisions of the agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><center><b>III.</b><br></center><br>Although the EDCA states that it seeks to deepen defense cooperation between the Parties, and maintain and develop individual and collective capacity to resist armed attacks in furtherance of Article II of the MDT, and within the context of the VFA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> it provides material obligations and activities not covered by the said treaties and, thus, partake of the nature of a treaty itself. As above-intimated, the principal modification ushered in by the EDCA which thus demand that it be entered into as a treaty revolve around what it terms "Agreed Locations." As defined in the EDCA:<br><blockquote><center><b>Article II <br>DEFINITIONS</b><br></center><br>xxxx<br><br>4. <b>"Agreed Locations" means <u>facilities and areas that are provided by the Government of the Philippines</u> through the [Armed Forces of the Philippines] and that United States forces, United States contractors, and others as mutually agreed, <u>shall have the right to access and use</u> pursuant to this Agreement.</b> Such Agreed Locations may be listed in an annex to be appended in this Agreement, and <u><b>may be further described in implementing arrangements</b></u>. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>While the EDCA mentions in one of its preambular paragraphs that the "Parties share an understanding for the [US] not to establish a permanent military presence or base in the territory in the Philippines,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> a conscientious examination of its provisions governing the rights to access and use granted to US forces and contractors, including their vehicles, vessels, and aircrafts, shows that an "Agreed Location" under the auspices of the EDCA is, in reality, <b><u>the functional equivalent of a military base</u></b>. The concept of a "military base" was instructively discussed by my respected colleague Associate Justice Arturo D. Brion (Justice Brion) in his own dissent on the main:<br><blockquote>There exists no rigid definition of a military base. However, it is a term used in the field of military operations and thus has a <i>generally accepted connotation</i>. The U.S. Department of Defense (<i>DoD</i>) Dictionary of Military and Associated terms defines a base as <u style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">"<i>an area or locality containing installations which provide logistic or other support</i></u><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">"</span><u style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><i>; home airfield; or home carrier</i></u>.<br><br>Under our laws, we find the definition of a military base in Presidential Decree No. 1227 [Section 2] which states that a military base is "any military, air, naval, coast guard reservation, base, fort, camp, arsenal, yard, station, or installation in the Philippines. <u><b>A military base connotes the presence, in a relatively permanent degree, of troops and facilities in a particular area.</b></u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>No matter how the agreement attempts to mask it, the "Agreed Locations" under the EDCA fit the bill of a military base as above-attributed. At its core, "Agreed Locations" constitute areas of Philippine territory provided for by the RP to the US for the use of the latter's forces and contractors in their various military endeavors. In particular, the EDCA authorizes US forces and contractors, including their vehicles, vessels, and aircrafts, to conduct <b><u>any</u></b> of the following military activities: "<b><u>training, transit, support and related activities, refueling of aircraft, bunkering of vessels, temporary maintenance of vehicles, vessels, and aircraft; temporary accommodation of personnel; communications; prepositioning of equipment, supplies, and materiel; deploying forces and materiel; and such other activities as the Parties may agree</u></b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Noticeably, the enumeration does not mention that an activity must be interrelated to another. Thus, for instance, prepositioning of equipment, supplies, and materiel may be independently conducted by US forces even if there is no training exercise with Philippine troops involved. US forces may also deploy forces or its already prepositioned equipment from within our territory, regardless of our interest in said activity.<br><br>Central to the pursuit of these activities is the grant to the US Government of <b><u>operational control</u></b>. Under the EDCA, "operational control" has been defined as "[t]he authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The Philippines, however, was not completely removed of any role: unfortunately, it was only relegated to the role of consultant. The EDCA provides that "[US] forces shall consult on issues regarding construction, alterations, and improvements based on the Parties' shared intent that the technical requirements and construction standards of any such projects undertaken by or on behalf of [US] forces should be consistent with the requirements and standards of both Parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> There is a gaping hole though in the EDCA anent the binding force of any consultation conducted, much more, the consequence of any failure to seek prior consultation with the Philippine Government.<br><br>Further, while the EDCA provides that the Philippines shall retain ownership and title to the "Agreed Locations,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the same effectively translates to the Philippines holding only a nominal title to said locations, as the concept of "operational control" allows the US to ultimately exercise beneficial ownership over the same. These privileges over the "Agreed Locations" also do not come with a fee since "the Parties agree that the Philippines shall make the Agreed Locations available to the [US] forces without rental or similar costs," save for the necessary operational expenses which, of course, should be shouldered by the US Government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In this relation, it must be highlighted that the EDCA shall subsist for a period of <b><u>at least (10) years</u></b>, which is, in fact, even subject to automatic renewal unless terminated in advance (one year prior notice) by a party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Thus, the arrangement established is undeniably, one of a "relatively permanent degree."<br><br>Finally, it is telling to note that "[i]mplementing arrangements may address additional details concerning the presence of [US] forces at Agreed Locations and the functional relations between [US] forces and the [Armed Forces of the Philippines] with respect to Agreed Locations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> To this, one of the petitioners astutely questions: "[i]f the EDCA is the alleged implementing agreement of the VFA [or the MDT], then why does [it] also need implementing arrangements to carry out its provisions?"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>To reify the point that the "Agreed Locations" under the EDCA is the functional equivalent of a military base, reproduced below is a tabular comparison<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> provided by one of the petitioners juxtaposing the provisions of the MBA and the EDCA.

Therefore, even if it is assumed that the "Agreed Locations" cannot be classified as a military base in view of the ten (10)-year term<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> of the EDCA which would supposedly strip it of the character of permanency, its concept of "Agreed Locations" and the allowable activities therein correspond to the definition of <b>facilities</b> in accordance with the US Department of Defense's (DoD) report to the US Congress regarding the renewed US Global Position, entitled "Strengthening U.S. Global Defense Posture."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Specifically, the DoD defined the US global posture in the context of a cross-section of five elements, <i>i.e.</i>, relationships, activities, facilities, legal arrangements, and global sourcing and surge.

MOBs serve as the anchor points for throughput, training, engagement, and US commitment to NATO. MOBs have: robust infrastructure; strategic access; established Command and Control; Forward Operating Sites and Cooperative Security Location support capability; and enduring family support facilities. These are already in existence.<br><br></li><li>A Forward Operating Site (FOS) is an expandable host-nation "warm site" with a limited U.S. military support presence and possibly prepositioned equipment. It can host rotational forces and be a focus for bilateral and regional training. These sites will be tailored to meet anticipated requirements and can be used for an extended time period. Backup support by a MOB may be required.<br><br></li><li>A Cooperative Security Location (CSL) is a host-nation facility with little or no permanent U.S. presence. CSLs will require periodic service, contractor and/or host nation support. CSLs provide contingency access and are a focal point for security cooperation activities. They may contain propositioned equipment. CSLs are: rapidly scalable and located for tactical use, expandable to become a FOS, forward and expeditionary. They will have no family support system.<br></li></ol>(See &lt;<a href="http://http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/intro.htm">http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/intro.htm</a>&gt; [last visited June 2, 2016].

In so doing, I am honored to join Associate Justices Teresita J. Leonardo-de Castro, Arturo D. Brion, and Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe. I briefly recall the points that I previously made.<br><br>I do not agree that the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) is a binding executive agreement that escapes scrutiny under Article XVIII, Section 25<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Constitution. It is not merely an implementation of the 1998 Visiting Forces Agreement.<br><br>EDCA substantially amends and modifies the Visiting Forces Agreement. When the Visiting Forces Agreement was ratified, the Senate and the public did not consider whether their actions would later on allow the presence of foreign military bases in any part of this country. It is pure legal sophistry to say that the "Agreed Locations" in EDCA are not foreign military bases. These "Agreed Locations" are foreign military bases of the United States.<br><br>To now say that it was so would be to imply that the Senate at that time was engaged in a grand deceit, Nothing in the Visiting Forces Agreement hints at permanent bases under any kind of control of a foreign power, pre-positioning of men and material to be used for internal or external operations other than training purposes, and the acceptance of the presence of "contractors," which may consist of private armed groups or "mercenaries" chosen by the United States to be stationed in our country.<br><br>Our Constitution has introduced elaborate safeguards before any foreign military base—no matter how it is called—will be again allowed within our territory. Article XVIII, Section 25 requires that this undergo a conscious, deliberate, and publicly transparent process with the Senate. The same provision requires that the stationing of foreign troops in foreign bases or "Agreed Locations" must be through a treaty—not merely through an implementing executive agreement. Although the President is free to negotiate such an agreement, the basic law contemplates that the results of the negotiation should be the subject of public discussion.<br><br>The presence of foreign military bases is of such consequence that the Constitution itself also provides the possibility of an alternative mechanism for its allowance. Hence, Article XVIII, Section 25 also provides for the possibility of approval through a national referendum, should that be the preference of Congress.<br><br>EDCA was negotiated in the strictest confidentiality, and its contents were made known to the public only when it was signed by the Secretary of National Defense and ratified by the President. It does not take much to see how obviously it deviates from the constitutional mandate.<br><br>The presence of foreign military bases in our country, especially that of the United States, has grave repercussions on our independence and on our governance. If there is any historical lesson that we must learn from the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, it is that our national interest can easily be co-opted and made subservient to the interests of the United States. Rather than an independent and sovereign state, our country can easily be reduced to a Base Nation: a platform from which to project the military strength of the United States for its own defense.<br><br>I am fully aware of the political dynamics occasioned by the intrusions of another foreign interest in the West Philippine Sea. However, the recent arbitral award issued by the international arbitral panel created under the auspices of the United Nations Law of the Sea has elevated our stature in the field of international law. It provides material for our diplomacy on the basis of respect for the rule of law.<br><br>We cannot afford to weaken our position by showing the world that we cannot even follow the clear and legible provisions of our own Constitution.<br><br>Neither can we be driven by what we conceive as the necessities of national security or foreign policy. That is not our mandate. It is not our place to predict what the Senate will do or doubt that it will not be able to appreciate the same complexities and concerns on national security and foreign policy, which have animated some of our discussions. Certainly, there can be more creative solutions that augur better with our sense of independence, sovereignty, and dignity than abject surrender to this planet's superpowers.<br><br>With the majority's position on the nature of the EDCA, we effectively rendered the Senate constitutionally impotent. We have smuggled foreign military bases into our country. We have succumbed to views that assume our vulnerability and our surrender to the hegemonic expediency of the United States.<br><br>This is not what the Constitution requires. Our basic law imagines more for us as a People.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>PARTIALLY GRANT</b> the Petitions and to <b>DECLARE</b> the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States of America as a formal and official memorial of the results of the negotiations concerning the allowance of United States military bases, troops, or facilities in the Philippines, which is <b>NOT EFFECTIVE</b> until it complies with the requisites of Article XVIII, Section 25 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, namely: (1) that the agreement must be in the form of a treaty; (2) that the treaty must be duly concurred in by the Philippine Senate and, when so required by Congress, ratified by a majority of votes cast by the People in a national referendum; and (3) that the agreement is either (a) recognized as a treaty, or (b) accepted or acknowledged as a treaty by the United States before it becomes valid, binding, and effective.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> J.
