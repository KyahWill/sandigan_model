The distinctions between Rule 65 and Rule 45 petitions have long been settled. A Rule 65 petition is an original action, independent of the action from which the assailed ruling arose. A Rule 45 petition, on the other hand, is a mode of appeal. As such, it is a continuation of the case subject of the appeal. In <i>Sy v. Commission on Settlement of Land Problems:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[T]he remedy of certiorari under Rule 65 is not a component of the appeal process. It is an original and independent action that is not a part of the trial which resulted in the rendition of the judgment complained of. In contrast, the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction refers to a process which is but a continuation of the original suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></blockquote><br><br>As it is a mere continuation, a Rule 45 petition (apart from being limited to questions of law) cannot go beyond the issues that were subject of the original action giving rise to it. This is consistent with the basic precept that:<br><br><blockquote>As a rule, no question will be entertained on appeal unless it has been raised in the court below. Points of law, theories, issues and arguments not brought to the attention of the lower court need not be, and ordinarily will not be, considered by a reviewing court, as they cannot be raised for the first time at that late stage. Basic considerations of due process impel this rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Rule 45 petitions engendered by prior Rule 65 petitions for certiorari and/or prohibition are, therefore, bound by the same basic issue at the crux of the prior Rule 65 petition, that is, "issues of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion." <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> When Rule 45 petitions are brought before this Court, they remain tethered to the "sole office"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> of the original action to which they owe their existence: "the correction of errors of jurisdiction including the commission of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>When petitioners sought relief from the Court of Appeals, what they sought to remedy was the Regional Trial Court's issuance of its November 21, 2006 and April 11, 2007 Orders. These were interlocutory orders pertaining to a temporary relief extended to respondent, that is, a writ of preliminary injunction. These orders were not judgments that completely disposed of Civil Case No. 06-899. They were not the Regional Trial Court's final ruling on Civil Case No. 06-899. By the time petitioners sought redress from the Court of Appeals (and even at the time of the filing of their appeal before this Court), the Regional Trial Court had not yet even ruled on the merits of Civil Case No. 06-899.<br><br>The question before the Court of Appeals was, therefore, limited to the matter of whether the Regional Trial Court's issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction was tainted with grave abuse of discretion. On appeal from the original action brought before the Court of Appeals, it is this same, singular issue that confronts us.<br><br>This Court cannot, at this juncture, entertain petitioners' prayer that the Regional Trial Court be ordered to dismiss Civil Case No. 06-899. Ruling on the complete cessation of a civil action on grounds other than those permitted by Rule 16<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (on motions to dismiss filed before the filing of an answer and before the conduct of trial; on grounds such as supervening events that render a pending action moot, unlitigable; or on grounds that render relief impracticable or impossible) compels an examination of the merits of a case. The case must then be litigated—through trial, reception of evidence, and examination of witnesses. This entire process will be frustrated were this Court to rule on Civil Case No. 06-899's dismissal on the basis only of allegations made in reference to provisional relief extended before trial even started.<br><br>In ruling on the propriety of the Regional Trial Court's issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, both the Court of Appeals and this Court are to be guided by the established standard on what constitutes grave abuse of discretion:<br><br><blockquote>By grave abuse of discretion is meant capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. Mere abuse of discretion is not enough. It must be grave abuse of discretion as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The sole question, then, is whether the Regional Trial Court, in issuing a writ of preliminary injunction in favor of respondent, acted in a manner that was practically bereft of or violative of legally acceptable standards.<br><br>We turn to the basic principles governing the Issuance of writs of preliminary injunction.<br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br><br>A writ of preliminary injunction is issued in order to:<br><br><blockquote>[P]revent threatened or continuous irremediable injury to some of the parties <i>before their claims can be thoroughly studied and adjudicated. </i>Its sole aim is to preserve the status quo until the merits of the case can be heard fully[.] Thus, it will be issued only upon a showing of a clear and unmistakable right that is violated. Moreover, an urgent necessity for its issuance must be shown by the applicant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Rule 58, Section 3 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure identifies the instances when a writ of preliminary injunction may be issued:<br><blockquote><br>Section 3. Grounds for issuance of preliminary injunction. — A preliminary injunction may be granted when it is established:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">(a)</div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">That the applicant is entitled to the relief demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the act or acts complained of, or in requiring the performance of an act or acts either for a limited period or perpetually;</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(b)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">That the commission, continuance or non-performance of the act or acts complained of during the litigation would probably work injustice to the applicant; or</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(c)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">That a party, court, agency or a person is doing, threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done some act or acts probably in violation of the rights of the applicant respecting the subject of the action or proceeding, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.</div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote></blockquote><br><br>As <i>Marquez v. Sanchez</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> summarized, "the requisites of preliminary injunction whether mandatory or prohibitory are the following":<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">(1)</div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">the applicant must have a clear and unmistakable right, that is a right <i>in esse;</i></div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(2)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">there is a material and substantial invasion of such right;</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(3) </div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">there is an urgent need for the writ to prevent irreparable injury to the applicant; and</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(4)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">no other ordinary, speedy, and adequate remedy exists to prevent the infliction of irreparable injury.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><br>In satisfying these requisites, parties applying for a writ of preliminary injunction need not set out their claims by complete and conclusive evidence. Prima facie evidence suffices:<br><br><blockquote>It is crystal clear that at the hearing for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, <i>mere prima facie evidence is needed </i>to establish the applicant's rights or interests in the subject matter of the main action. It is not required that the applicant should conclusively show that there was a violation of his rights as this issue will still be fully litigated in the main case. Thus, an applicant for a writ is required <i>only to show that he has an ostensible right to the final relief prayed for </i>in his complaint.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup>&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br><i>Spouses Nisce v. Equitable PCI Bank</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> discussed the requisites, vis-a-vis the proof required, for issuing a writ of preliminary injunction:<br><br><blockquote>The plaintiff praying for a writ of preliminary injunction must further establish that he or she has a present and unmistakable right to be protected; that the facts against which injunction is directed violate such right; and there is a special and paramount necessity for the writ to prevent serious damages. In the absence of proof of a legal right and the injury sustained by the plaintiff, an order for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction will be nullified. Thus, where the plaintiff's right is doubtful or disputed, a preliminary injunction is not proper. The possibility of irreparable damage without proof of an actual existing right is not a ground for a preliminary injunction.<br><br>However, to establish the essential requisites for a preliminary injunction, the evidence to be submitted by the plaintiff need not be conclusive and complete. The plaintiffs are only required to show that they have an ostensible right to the final relief prayed for in their complaint. A writ of preliminary injunction is generally based solely on initial or incomplete evidence. Such evidence need only be a sampling intended merely to give the court an evidence of justification for a preliminary injunction pending the decision on the merits of the case, and is not conclusive of the principal action which has yet to be decided.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Clearly, a writ of preliminary injunction is an ancillary and interlocutory order issued as a result of an impartial determination of the context of both parties. It entails a procedure for the judge to assess whether the reliefs prayed for by the complainant will be rendered moot simply as a result of the parties' having to go through the full requirements of a case being fully heard on its merits. Although a trial court judge is given a latitude of discretion, he or she cannot grant a writ of injunction if there is no clear legal right materially and substantially breached from a prima facie evaluation of the evidence of the complainant. Even if this is present, the trial court must satisfy itself that the injury to be suffered is irreparable.<br><br><center><b>III</b></center><br><br>Respondent satisfied the standards for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. The Regional Trial Court acted in keeping with these standards and did not gravely abuse its discretion in extending temporary relief to respondent.<br><br><center><b>III.A</b></center><br><br>Petitioners have conceded that respondent entered into a lease agreement enabling the latter to use MERALCO's lampposts to display advertising banners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Respondent obtained permits from the local government units of Makati, Pasay, and Quezon City so that it could put up banners and signages on lampposts and pedestrian overpasses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>There was no allegation nor contrary proof "[t]hat the ordinary course of business has been followed."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Respondent must have obtained the customary permits and clearances (e.g., Mayor's and business permits as well as registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with the Bureau of Internal Revenue) necessary to make itself a going concern.<br><br>Respondent's lease agreement with MERALCO Financing Services&nbsp; Corporation and its having secured permits from local government units, for the specific purpose of putting up advertising banners and signages, gave it the right to put up such banners and signages. Respondent had in its favor a property right, of which it cannot be deprived without due process. This is respondent's right <i>in esse, </i>that is, an actual right. It is not merely a right <i>in posse, </i>or a potential right.<br><br><center><b>III.B</b></center><br><br>Petitioners counter that respondent had no right to put up banners and signages. They point out that on September 2, 2004, the Metro Manila Council passed MMDA Regulation No. 04-004, "[p]rescribing guidelines on the installation and display of billboards and advertising signs along major and secondary thoroughfares, avenues, streets, roads, parks and open spaces within Metro Manila and providing penalties for violation thereof."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Section 13 of this Regulation identified the officers responsible for issuing clearances for the installation of "billboards/signages and advertising signs," as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Section 13.

A more thorough examination of prevailing laws, ordinances, and pertinent regulations may later on establish that the use of lampposts and pedestrian overpasses as platforms for visual advertisements advancing private commercial interests contradict the public character of certain spaces.

Whether the permits suffice by themselves, or whether respondent's alleged non-compliance with MMDA Regulation No. 04-004 is fatal to its cause, are matters better resolved by a process more painstaking than the summary hearings conducted purely for the purpose of extending provisional remedy.<br><br>The phrase "outside the commerce of men"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> is not an incantation that can be invoked to instantly establish the accuracy of petitioners' claims. 'Public spaces' are not a monolithic, homogenous mass that is impervious to private activity.

Even when these considerations are invoked, they do not peremptorily and invariably set aside private property rights. When acting in view of these considerations, state organs must still do so with restraint and act only to the extent reasonably necessary. Whether state organs actually did so is something that can only be adjudged when the competing claims of the State and of private entities are conscientiously and deliberately appraised.<br><br>Even by petitioners' own allegation, the expiration of respondent's lease agreement with MERALCO Financing Services Corporation did not happen until after November 21, 2006, when the Regional Trial Court issued the contentious writ of preliminary injunction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> It was a subsequent fact, which could have only been proven later during trial, and which was still inefficacious when respondent pleaded for provisional relief.<br><br>Petitioners' own arguments demonstrate the need for litigation—a thorough study and adjudication—of the parties' competing claims. When the Regional Trial Court extended provisional relief on November 21, 2006, it did not yet have the benefit of exhaustive litigation. That it acted without such benefit is not something for which it can be faulted. It did not gravely abuse its discretion then, because it did not <i><b>yet</b> </i>need to engage in full litigation.<br><br><center><b>III.C</b></center><br><br>Turning to the other requisites for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, we find that respondent adequately averred and showed a material and substantial invasion of its ostensible right, for which the writ or preliminary injunction was necessary lest that invasion persist and it be made to suffer irreparable injury.<br><br>As respondent pointed out, the filing of its Complaint was precipitated by the removal of no less than 250 of its lamppost banners and frames, as well as 12 of its pedestrian overpass banners, 17 pedestrian overpass frames, and 36 halogen lamps.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> All these were done in the span of less than two (2) weeks.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Petitioners do not dispute this. Moreover, nowhere does it appear that petitioners intended to restrict themselves to these 250 lamppost banners and frames, 12 pedestrian overpass banners, 17 pedestrian overpass frames, and 36 halogen lamps. On the contrary, their incessant attempts at having the Regional Trial Court's writ of preliminary injunction lifted—first, on reconsideration at the Regional Trial Court itself; next, on certiorari and prohibition, and later, on reconsideration at the Court of Appeals; then, on appeal before this Court; and still later, on their June 15, 2010 Motion before this Court—are indicative of their sheer resolve to dismantle more. Respondent was left with no justifiable recourse but to seek relief from our courts.<br><br>Petitioners' admitted and pronounced course of action directly obstructed respondent's ability to avail itself of its rights under its lease agreement and the permits it secured from local government units. What petitioners sought to restrict was the very essence of respondent's activity as a business engaged in advertising via banners and signages. As the Regional Trial Court explained in its April 11, 2007 Order:<br><br><blockquote>It bears stressing that the lifeblood of a business rests on effective advertising strategies. One of which is the posting of billboards and signages at strategic places. The manner of posting may be regulated by the government but must comply with certain requirements, and should not result in taking of property without due process or in wanton disregard of existing laws. It stands to reason that [petitioners] are not vested with blanket authority to confiscate billboards without warning and in violation of existing laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></blockquote><br><br><div align="center"><b>IV</b><br></div><br>Administrative Order No. 160's mere existence, absent a showing of compliance with its instructions, gives no solace to petitioners. Administrative Order No. 160 expressed the Chief Executive's general directive for the abatement of billboards that pose a hazard to the general welfare. In doing so, it did not give petitioner Department of Public Works and Highways unbridled authority to dismantle all billboards and signages. Administrative Order No. 160 prescribed a well-defined process for the carrying out of petitioner Department of Public Works and Highways' functions. Before any such abatement and dismantling—as permitted by paragraph 1.3—paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 of Administrative Order No. 160 require the Department of Public Works and Highways to: first, conduct field inspections; second, make evaluations and assessments; third, issue certifications as to those billboards found to be hazardous and violative of existing standards; and fourth, furnish copies of these certifications to concerned local government units.<br><br>Six (6) days after it was issued, Administrative Order No. 160 was supplemented by Administrative Order No. 160-A.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> This subsequent issuance recognized that hazardous billboards are public nuisances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Thus, in its Section 4, it prescribed remedies consistent with Article 699 of the Civil Code:<br><br><blockquote>(a) A prosecution under the Revised Penal Code or any local ordinance; or<br>(b) A civil action; or<br>(c) Abatement, without judicial proceedings, if the local Building Official determines that this is the best remedy under the circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In its October 31, 2006 Order, which issued an initial 20-day temporary restraining order in favor of respondent, the Regional Trial Court emphasized that despite the opportunity extended to petitioners (in the October 25 and 30, 2006 summary hearings) to present evidence of their compliance with paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 of Administrative Order No. 160, with Section 4 of Administrative Order No. 160-A, or with Article 699 of the Civil Code, petitioners failed to show any such evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> From all indications, petitioners proceeded to dismantle respondent's banners and signages without having first completed formal or systematic field inspections, as well as evaluations and assessments, and without having first issued written certifications and furnished local government units with copies of these certifications. In the 12-day span between petitioner Department of Public Works and Highways' October 6, 2006 announcement that it would start dismantling billboards, and respondent's October 18, 2006 Complaint, petitioners managed to dismantle a considerable number of respondent's banners and signages while apparently ignoring the same regulations from which they drew their authority:<br><br><blockquote>So far, no evidence has been presented by the [petitioners] to the satisfaction of this Court that they had strictly observed the procedure laid down by Administrative Order No. 160 and prescribed by law for the abatement of billboards and signboards found to have been a public nuisance before carrying their tasks of dismantling the banners and other temporary signages belonging to [respondent].<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In its November 21, 2006 Order, the Regional Trial Court reiterated that petitioners had yet to adduce proof of their prior compliance with paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 of Administrative Order No. 160, with Section 4 of Administrative Order No. 160-A, or with Article 699 of the Civil Code. This, even after the conduct of another hearing on November 8, 2006:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The Court finds that the continuous removal and destruction of [respondent's] billboards without due notice and without following the procedure provided under the law.

The district health officer if required to determine whether or not abatement, without judicial proceedings, is the best remedy against a public nuisance. Any private person may abate a public nuisance which is specially injurious to him by removing or if necessary, by destroying the thing which constitutes the same, without committing a breach of the peace, or doing unnecessary injury. But it is necessary: (1) That demand be first made upon the owner or possessor of the property to abate the nuisance; (2) That such demand has been rejected; (3) That the abatement be approved by the district health officer and executed with the assistance of the local police[; and] (4) That the value of the destruction does not exceed three thousand pesos.<br><br>However, as found by the Court in the Order granting the temporary restraining order, no evidence was presented by [petitioners] to prove that they had strictly observed the procedure laid down by Administrative Order No. 160 or the provisions of the New Civil Code on abatement of public nuisance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In its April 11, 2007 Order, the Regional Trial Court again emphasized the utter lack of such proof from petitioners:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The Court maintains [that] there is no justifiable reason to dissolve the issued preliminary injunction. The fact remains that [petitioners] disregarded the minimum requirements of due process under Administrative Order [No.] 160 when they dismantled [respondent's] banners duly licensed by the local government concerned and covered by a legitimate agreement with MERALCO. No proof was shown by [petitioners] that they had complied with the requirements of [Administrative Order No.] 160 particularly as to the evaluation and certification process prior to the dismantling, or to the creation of a task force, or at least a finding that said banners or [respondent] are nuisances or hazardous. Worse, they jumped right into abatement, skipping initial investigatory stages and the all-important feature that id due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The Court of Appeals' assailed December 3, 2007 Resolution drew attention to petitioners' failure to show proof of such compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Even now, in their Petition for Review on Certiorari before us, petitioners make no reference whatsoever to satisfying Administrative Order No. 160's, 160-A's, and the Civil Code's procedural requisites.<br><br>Even if it were to be assumed that Administrative Order No. 160's and 160-A's procedural requirements completely and impeccably satisfy the standards of due process, it remains that petitioners have not shown that they complied with these administrative mechanisms.

It would have been easy for them to simply state that they have complied with the same instrument from which they are drawing their authority. Petitioners' utter inability to even make any such allegation, let alone to offer proof of compliance with Administrative Order No. 160's and 160-A's due process safeguards is detrimental to their cause.<br><br><center><b>V</b></center><br><br>Petitioners' final bid at securing this Court's favor is through a reference to Republic Act No. 8975.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Section 3 of Republic Act No. 8975 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 3.
