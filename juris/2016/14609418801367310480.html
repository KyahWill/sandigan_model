This is resorted to when the issues raised by a party is fundamental and the ambient circumstances indicate extreme urgency. The right of voters to verify whether vote-counting machines properly recorded their vote is not only a statutory right; it is one that enables their individual participation in governance as sovereign. Among all government bodies, the Commission on Elections is the entity that should appreciate how important it is to respond to cases filed by the public to enable these rights. It perplexes this court that the Commission on Elections failed to immediately transmit relevant documents to the Office of the Solicitor General to allow them to respond within the time granted.<br><br>The Office of the Clerk of Court En Banc noted that both the Commission on Elections and the Office of the Solicitor General were already furnished with a copy of the Petition when this court ordered them to file a comment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Due to the urgency to resolve this case, this court denied the Commission on Elections' Motion. This court cannot fail to act on an urgent matter simply because of the non-compliance of the Commission on Elections and the Office of the Solicitor General with its orders. This court cannot accept the lackadaisical attitude of the Commission on Elections and its counsel in addressing this case.

Under Part III of the Resolution, it merely stated:<br><blockquote>SEC. 40. Manner of voting. - <br><br>a.

As reported, the meeting of the Commission on Elections En Banc to pass this Resolution was on March 3, 2016, three (3) days after they were required to file a comment before this court.<br><br>Nonetheless, the inaction of the Commission on Elections in utilizing the VVPAT feature of the vote-counting machines fails to fulfill the duty required under Republic Act No. 8436, as amended.<br><br>Article XI(C), Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution empowered the Commission of Elections to "[e]nforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election." One of the laws that the Commission on Elections must implement is Republic Act No. 8436, as amended by Republic Act No. 9369, which requires the automated election system to have the capability of providing a voter-verified paper audit trail.<br><br>Based on the technical specifications during the bidding, the current vote-counting machines should meet the minimum system capability of generating a VVPAT. However, the Commission on Elections' act of rendering inoperative this feature runs contrary to why the law required this feature in the first place. Under Republic Act No. 8436, as amended, it is considered a policy of the state that the votes reflect the genuine will of the People.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> The full text of the declaration of policy behind the law authorizing the use of an automated election system states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Declaration of Policy</i>. — It is the policy of the State to ensure free, orderly, honest, peaceful, credible and informed elections, plebiscites, referenda, recall and other similar electoral exercises by improving on the election process and adopting systems, which shall involve the use of an automated election system that will ensure the secrecy and sanctity of the ballot and all election, consolidation and transmission documents in order that the process shall be transparent and credible and that the results shall be fast, accurate and reflective of the genuine will of the people.<br><br>The State recognizes the mandate and authority of the Commission to prescribe the adoption and use of the most suitable technology of demonstrated capability taking into account the situation prevailing in the area and the funds available for the purpose.<br></blockquote>By setting the minimum system capabilities of our automated election system, the law intends to achieve the purposes set out in this declaration. A mechanism that allows the voter to verify his or her choice of candidates will ensure a free, orderly, honest, peaceful, credible, and informed election. The voter is not left to wonder if the machine correctly appreciated his or her ballot. The voter must know that his or her sovereign will, with respect to the national and local leadership, was properly recorded by the vote-counting machines.<br><br>The minimum functional capabilities enumerated under Section 6 of Republic Act 8436, as amended, are mandatory. These functions constitute the most basic safeguards to ensure the transparency, credibility, fairness and accuracy of the upcoming elections.<br><br>The law is clear. A "voter verified paper audit trail" requires the following: (a) individual voters can verify whether the machines have been able to count their votes; and (b) that the verification at minimum should be paper based.<br><br>There appears to be no room for further interpretation of a "voter verified paper audit trail." The paper audit trail cannot be considered the physical ballot, because there may be instances where the machine may translate the ballot differently, or the voter inadvertently spoils his or her ballot.<br><br>In <i>Maliksi v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> the losing mayoralty candidate questioned the result of the elections. Upon inspection of the physical ballots, several votes were invalidated due to the presence of double-shading. However, when the digital printouts of the ballots were checked, the questioned ballots only had single shade. The physical ballots were tampered to invalidate several votes.<br><br>The situation in <i>Maliksi</i> could have been avoided if the Commission on Elections utilized the paper audit trail feature of the voting machines. The VVPAT ensures that the candidates selected by the voter in his or her ballot are the candidates voted upon and recorded by the vote-counting machine. The voter himself or herself verifies the accuracy of the vote. In instances of Random Manual Audit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and election protests, the VVPAT becomes the best source of raw data for votes.<br><br>The required system capabilities under Republic Act No. 8436, as amended, are the <b><i>minimum</i></b> safeguards provided by law. Compliance with the minimum system capabilities entails costs on the state and its taxpayers. If minimum system capabilities are met but not utilized, these will be a waste of resources and an affront to the citizens who paid for these capabilities.<br><br>It is true that the Commission on Elections is given ample discretion to administer the elections, but certainly, its constitutional duty is to "enforce the law." The Commission is not given the constitutional competence to amend or modify the law it is sworn to uphold. Section 6(e), (f), and (n) of Republic Act No. 8436, as amended, is law. Should there be policy objections to it, the remedy is to have Congress amend it.<br><br>The Commission on Elections cannot opt to breach the requirements of the law to assuage its fears regarding the VVPAT. Vote-buying can be averted by placing proper procedures. The Commission on Elections has the power to choose the appropriate procedure in order to enforce the VVPAT requirement under the law, and balance it with the constitutional mandate to secure the secrecy and sanctity of the ballot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>We see no reason why voters should be denied the opportunity to read the voter's receipt after casting his or her ballot. There is no legal prohibition for the Commission on Elections to require that after the voter reads and verifies the receipt, he or she is to leave it in a separate box, not take it out of the precinct. Definitely, the availability of all the voters' receipts will make random manual audits more accurate.<br><br>The credibility of the results of any election depends, to a large extent, on the confidence of each voter that his or her individual choices have actually been counted. It is in that local precinct after the voter casts his or her ballot that this confidence starts. It is there where it will be possible for the voter to believe that his or her participation as sovereign truly counts.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Mandamus is <b>GRANTED</b>. The Commission on Elections is <b>ORDERED</b> to enable the vote verification feature of the vote-counting machines, which prints the voter's choices without prejudice to the issuance of guidelines to regulate the release and disposal of the issued receipts in order to ensure a clean, honest, and orderly elections such as, but not limited to, ensuring that after voter verification, receipts should be deposited in a separate ballot box and not taken out of the precinct.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sereno, C.
