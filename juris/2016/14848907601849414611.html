While the petitioner did attach to its motion for reconsideration an alleged written approval of the BIR Commissioner,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[30]</sup></font> it was merely a photocopy which was hardly readable.

This letter was attached to the Information along with other documents pertinent to the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> However, this was not deemed as compliance with Section 220, as the letter was not from the BIR Commissioner himself.<br><br>After the dismissal decreed by the CTA Special First Division, the petitioner, through a motion for reconsideration, presented an alleged copy of the written approval<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated July 2006 signed by then BIR Commissioner Jose Mario C. Buñag. Yet, as the CTA <i>en banc </i>found, the contents of the photocopied letter were faded and almost imperceptible.<br><br>The prerequisite approval of the BIR Commissioner in the filing of a civil or criminal action is provided under Section 220 of the 1997 NIRC, which states that:<br><br><blockquote><b>Sec. 220.</b><i> Form and Mode of Proceeding in Actions Arising under this Code. - </i> Civil and criminal actions and proceedings instituted in behalf of the Government under the authority of this Code or other law enforced by the Bureau of Internal Revenue shall be brought in the name of the Government of the Philippines and shall be conducted by legal officers of the Bureau of Internal Revenue but <b>no civil or criminal action for the recovery of taxes or the enforcement of any fine, penalty or forfeiture under this Code shall be filed in court without the approval of the Commissioner. </b>(Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br><br>The required approval of the Commissioner provided under Section 220 of the 1997 NIRC aside, Section 7 thereof allows the delegation of powers of the Commissioner to any subordinate official with the rank equivalent to a division chief or higher, save for the instances specified thereunder, <i>viz:</i><br><br><blockquote><b>Section</b> 7. <i>Authority of the Commissioner to Delegate Power. - </i>The Commissioner may delegate the powers vested in him under the pertinent provisions of this Code to any or such subordinate officials with the <b>rank equivalent to a division chief or higher,</b> subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be imposed under rules and regulations to be promulgated by the Secretary of Finance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner: <i>Provided, however, </i><b>That the following powers of the Commissioner shall <u>not</u> be delegated:</b><br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">(a)</div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">The power to recommend the promulgation of rules and regulations by the Secretary of Finance; </div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(b)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The power to issue rulings of first impression or to reverse, revoke or modify any existing ruling of the Bureau; </div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(c)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The power to compromise or abate, under Sec. 204 (A) and (B) of this Code, any tax liability: <i>Provided, however, </i>That assessments issued by the regional offices involving basic deficiency taxes of Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000[.00]) or less, and minor criminal violations, as may be determined by rules and regulations to be promulgated by the Secretary of [F]inance, upon recommendation of the Commissioner, discovered by regional and district officials, may be compromised by a regional evaluation board which shall be composed of the Regional Director as Chairman, the Assistant Regional Director, the heads of the Legal, Assessment and Collection Divisions and the Revenue District Officer having jurisdiction over the taxpayer, as members; and </div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(d)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The power to assign or reassign internal revenue officers to establishments where articles subject to excise tax are produced or kept.

Hizon,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the Court upheld the validity of a complaint for collection of tax deficiency which was signed by the Chief of the Legal Division of BIR Region 4 and verified by the RD of Pampanga. Citing Section 7 of the 1997 NIRC, the Court ratiocinated that "[n]one of the exceptions relates to the Commissioner's power to approve the filing of tax collection cases."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>The Court made a similar pronouncement in <i>Oceanic Wireless Network, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> where the authority of the Chief of the BIR Accounts Receivable and Billing Division to issue a demand letter was questioned. The Court ruled that "[t]he general rule is that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may delegate any power vested upon him by law to Division Chiefs or to officials of higher rank. He cannot, however, delegate the four powers granted to him under the [NIRC] enumerated in Section 7."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The act of issuance of the demand letter by the Chief of the Accounts Receivable and Billing Division did not fall under any of the exceptions that have been specified as non-delegable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In the same manner, the approval of filing of a criminal action is not one of the non-delegable functions of the Commissioner. As previously stated, the petitioner had earlier submitted a written recommendation from the RD to file the instant case against Valeriano. Therefore, the recommendation of the RD to file the instant case constitutes as compliance with the requirement under Section 220 of the 1997 NIRC.<br><br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the petitioner is cautioned to take the initiative of periodically checking on the progress of its cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> to avoid a similar instance where its counsel's negligence or failure to comply with court orders would result to delay or worse, constitute as bar in the prosecution of criminal tax cases.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is hereby <b>GRANTED.</b> The Decision dated November 18, 2011 of the Court of Tax Appeals <i>en banc </i>in CTA EB Criminal Case No. 010, as well as the Resolutions dated November 23, 2009 and June 1, 2010 of the Court of Tax Appeals Special First Division in CTA Case No. 0-145, are <b>REVERSED and SET ASIDE.</b> The case is <b>REMANDED</b> to the Court of Tax Appeals for further proceedings.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Peralta, Del Castillo,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> and <i>Perez, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><div align="center"><br></div><br><div align="right"><u><b>November 28, 2016</b></u><br></div><div align="center"><b>N O T I C E&nbsp; O F&nbsp; J U D G M E N T</b><br></div><br>Sirs / Mesdames:<br><br>Please take notice that on <b><u>October 12, 2016</u></b> a Decision, copy attached hereto, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on November 28, 2016 at 1:51 p.m.<br><br><div align="right">Very truly yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><b>(SGD.)
