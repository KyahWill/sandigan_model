The petitioner argues that:<br><br><blockquote><center>I<br></center><br>THE PNB'S TRANSACTIONS UNDER INTERBANK CALL LOANS ARE CONSIDERED LOAN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PNB AND THE OTHER BANKS, HENCE, THEY ARE SUBJECT TO DOCUMENTARY STAMP TAXES (DST) UNDER SECTION 180 OF THE NATIONAL INFERNAL REVENUE CODE (NIRC) OF 1977, AS AMENDED BY REPUBLIC ACT (R.A.) NO. 7660 OF 1994. <br><br><center>II<br></center><br>THE FURTHER AMENDMENTS OF SECTION 180 OF THE 1977 NIRC (AS AMENDED BY R.A. NO. 7660 OF 1994) BY R.A. NO. 8424 OF 1998 AND R.A. NO. 9243 OF 2004 CONFIRM THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF INTERBANK CALL LOANS AS LOAN AGREEMENTS AND/OR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, HENCE, THEY ARE SUBJECT TO DST. &nbsp;<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>THERE IS NO LAW OR PROVISION IN THE 1977 NIRC, AS AMENDED BY R.A. NO. 7660 OF 1994, THAT SPECIFICALLY AND EXPRESSLY EXEMPTS PNB'S INTERBANK CALL LOANS FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR 1997 FROM THE PAYMENT OF DST.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center><b> Ruling</b></center><br>The appeal lacks merit.<br><br>The petitioner claims that while interbank call loans were not considered as deposit substitute debt instruments, PNB's interbank call loans, which had a maturity of more than five days, were included in the concept of loan agreements; hence, the interbank call loans were subject to DST.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The petitioner's claim cannot be upheld.<br><br>Firstly, the maturity of PNB's interbank call loans was irrelevant in determining its DST liability for taxable year 1997, relation to which the applicable law was the <i>National Internal Revenue Code of 1977 </i>(1977 NIRC), as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1959<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[16]</sup></font> and Republic Act No. 7660.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The five-day maturity of interbank call loans came to be introduced only by Section 22(y)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> of the <i>National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 </i> (1997 NIRC), to wit:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>(y) The term '<i>deposit substitutes' </i>shall mean an alternative from of obtaining funds from the public (the term <i>'public</i><i><i>'</i> </i>means borrowing from twenty (20) or more individual or corporate lenders at any one time) other than deposits, through the issuance, endorsement, or acceptance of debt instruments for the borrowers own account, for the purpose of relending or purchasing of receivables and other obligations, or financing their own needs or the needs of their agent or dealer. These instruments may include, but need not be limited to bankers' acceptances, promissory notes, repurchase agreements, including reverse repurchase agreements entered into by and between the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and any authorized agent bank, certificates of assignment or participation and similar instruments with recourse: Provided, however, <b>That debt </b><b> instruments issued for interbank call loans with maturity of not more than five (5) days to cover deficiency in reserves against deposit liabilities, including those between or among banks and quasi-banks, shall not be considered as deposit substitute debt instruments. </b> (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>The provisions of the 1997 NIRC cannot be given retrospective effect to the prejudice of PNB. This is because tax laws are prospective in application, unless their retroactive application is expressly provided.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Secondly, PNB's interbank call loans are not taxable under Section 180 of the 1977 NIRC, as amended by R.A. No. 7660, which states:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 180. <i>Stamp tax on all loan agreements, promissory notes, bills </i><i> of exchange, drafts, instruments and securities issued by the government </i><i> or any of its instrumentalities, certificates of deposit bearing interest and others not payable on sight or demand. </i> - On all <b>loan agreements </b>signed abroad wherein the object of the contract is located or used in the Philippines; <b>bills of exchange </b>(between points within the Philippines), <b> drafts, instruments and securities issued by the Government or any of its instrumentalities </b> or <b>certificates of deposits drawing interest, </b>or <b> orders for the payment of any sum of money otherwise than at sight or on demand, </b> or on all <b>promissory notes, whether negotiable or non-</b><b>negotiable, except bank notes issued for circulation, and on each renewal of any such note, </b> there shall be collected a documentary stamp tax of Thirty centavos (P0.30) on each two hundred pesos, or fractional part thereof, of the face value of any such agreement, bill of exchange, draft, certificate of deposit, or note: Provided, That only one documentary stamp tax shall be imposed on either loan agreement, or promissory notes issued to secure such loan, whichever will yield a higher tax: Provided, however, That loan agreements or promissory notes the aggregate of which does not exceed Two hundred fifty thousand pesos (P250,000) executed by an individual for his purchase on installment for his personal use or that of his family and not for business, resale, barter or hire of a house, lot, motor vehicle, appliance or furniture shall be exempt from the payment of the documentary stamp tax provided under this section." (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)</blockquote><br>The petitioner insists that PNB's interbank call loans fell under the definition of a <i>loan agreement </i>found in Section 3(b) of Revenue Regulations No. 9-94, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>(b) 'Loan agreement' refers to a contract in writing where one of the parties delivers to another money or other consumable thing, upon the condition that the same amount of the same kind and quality shall be paid. The term shall include credit facilities, which may be evidenced by credit memo, advice or drawings.<br><br>The terms "Loan Agreement" under Section 180 and "Mortgage" under Section 195, both of the Tax Code, as amended, generally refer to distinct and separate instruments. A loan agreement shall be taxed under Section 180, while a deed of mortgage shall be taxed under Section 195.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>The insistence is bereft of merit.<br><br>An interbank call loan refers to the cost of borrowings from other resident banks and non-bank financial institutions with quasi-banking authority that is payable on call or demand.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It is transacted primarily to correct a bank's reserve requirements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Under the Manual of Regulation for Banks (MORB) issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), interbank borrowings,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> which include interbank call loans, shall be evidenced by deposit substitute instruments containing the minimum features prescribed under Section X235.3 of the MORB, except those that are settled through the banks' respective demand deposit accounts with the BSP via Philpass.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Simply put, an interbank call loan is considered as a deposit substitute transaction by a bank performing quasi-banking functions to cover reserve deficiencies. It does not fall under the definition of a loan agreement. Even if it does, the DST liability under Section 180, <i>supra, </i>will only attach if the loan agreement was signed abroad but the object of the contract is located or used in the Philippines, which was not the case in regard to PNB's interbank call loans.<br><br>We note, however, that for taxation purposes interbank call loans are not considered as deposit substitutes by express provision of Section 20(y) of the 1977 NIRC, as amended by P.D. No. 1959, <i>viz.:</i><br><br><blockquote>Sec. 1. A new subsection (y) is inserted in Sec. 2 of the National Internal Revenue Code to read as follows:<br><br><b> </b>x x x x<br><br>(y) 'Deposit substitutes' shall mean an alternative form of obtaining funds from the public, other than deposit, through the issuance, endorsement, or acceptance of debt instruments for the borrower's own account, for the purpose of relending or purchasing of receivables and other obligations, or financing their own needs or the needs of their agent or dealer. These instruments may include but need not be limited to banker's acceptances, promissory notes, repurchase agreements, certificates of assignment or participation and similar instruments with recourse as may be authorized by the Central Bank of the Philippines, for banks and non-bank financial intermediaries or by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines for commercial, industrial, finance companies and other non-financial companies: <b>Provided, however, that only debt instruments issued for inter-bank call loans to cover deficiency in reserves against deposit </b><b> liabilities including those between or among banks and quasi-banks shall not be considered as deposit substitute debt instruments. </b> (Bold emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>The foregoing notwithstanding, it can readily be discerned from Section 180, <i>supra, </i>that the DST of P0.30 on each P200.00, or fractional part thereof, shall only be imposed on the face value of: (1) loan agreements; (2) bills of exchange; (3) drafts; (4) instruments and securities issued by the Government or any of its instrumentalities; (5) certificates of deposits drawing interest; (6) orders for the payment of any sum of money otherwise than at sight or on demand; and (7) promissory notes, whether negotiable or non-negotiable, except bank notes issued for circulation, and on each renewal of any such note. Interbank call loans, although not considered as deposit substitutes, are not expressly included among the taxable instruments listed in Section 180; hence, they may not be held as taxable. As the Court has pointedly pronounced in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Fortune Tobacco Corporation:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><blockquote>xxx The rule in the interpretation of tax laws is that a statute will not be construed as imposing a tax unless it does so clearly, expressly, and unambiguously. A tax cannot be imposed without clear and express words for that purpose. Accordingly, the general rule of requiring adherence to the letter in construing statutes applies with peculiar strictness to tax laws and the provisions of a taxing act are not to be extended by implication. In answering the question of who is subject to tax statutes, it is basic that in case of doubt, such statutes are to be construed most strongly against the government and in favor of the subjects or citizens because burdens are not to be imposed nor presumed to be imposed beyond what statutes expressly and clearly import. As burdens, taxes should not be unduly exacted nor assumed beyond the plain meaning of the tax laws.</blockquote><br>In fine, the cancellation of Assessment No. 97-000064 was in order.<br><br><b> WHEREFORE, </b> the <b>Court DENIES </b>the petition for review on <i> certiorari; </i> and <b>AFFIRMS </b>the decision promulgated on September 21, 2010 in C.T.A.
