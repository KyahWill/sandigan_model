				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Parties who have validly executed a contract and have availed themselves of its benefits may not, to escape their contractual obligations, invoke irregularities in its execution to seek its invalidation.<br><br>This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the Court of Appeals' October 26, 2011 Decision and its March 8, 2012 Resolution. The Court of Appeals affirmed the Regional Trial Court's December 19, 2008 Decision upholding the validity of the mortgage contract executed by petitioner Florante Vitug (Vitug) and respondent Evangeline A. Abuda (Abuda).<br><br>On March 17, 1997, Abuda loaned P250,000.00 to Vitug and his wife, Narcisa Vitug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> As security for the loan, Vitug mortgaged to Abuda his property in Tondo Foreshore along R-10, Block A-50-3, Del Pan to Kagitingan Streets, Tondo, Manila.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The property was then subject of a conditional Contract to Sell between the National Housing Authority and Vitug.

This was formally offered in evidence before the Regional Trial Court as Exhibit "E."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The National Housing Authority even accepted respondent's personal checks to settle petitioner's mortgage obligations to the National Housing Authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The National Housing Authority would have already foreclosed petitioner's property if not for the loan that respondent extended to petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Petitioner counters that the Permit to Mortgage cited by respondent was only valid for 90 days and was subject to the conditions that respondent failed to fulfill. These conditions are:<br><br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp; The Mortgage Contract must provide that:<br><blockquote>"In the event of foreclosure, the NHA shall be notified of the date, time and place of the auction sale so that it can participate in the foreclosure sale of the property."</blockquote>(2)&nbsp; The mortgage contract must be submitted to NHA for verification and final approval[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Thus, according to petitioner, there was neither written consent nor approval by the National Housing Authority of the mortgage contracts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner further contends that the alleged lack of NHA consent on the mortgage (and, being a family home, his property's exemption from execution) was raised in his Answer to respondent's complaint for foreclosure filed before the Regional Trial Court, thus:<br><br><blockquote>20.&nbsp; Similarly, defendant has constituted their family home over said mortgage property and should that property be sold, defendant and his family will be left with no place to reside with [sic] within Metro Manila, hence, for humanitarian reason[s], the defendant prayed that he be given ample time within which to settle his obligation with the plaintiff;<br><br>21. Lastly, the Memorandum of Encumbrances contained at the back of defendant's title prohibits her from&nbsp; selling,&nbsp; encumbering, mortgaging, leasing, sub-leasing or in any manner altering or disposing the lot or right thereon, in whole or in part within the period often (10) years from the time of issuance of said title without first obtaining the consent of the NHA. As reflected in the title, the same was issued on 25 June 1997 hence, the mortgage executed even prior to the issuance of said title should be declared void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center>I<br></center><br>Due process<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dictates that arguments not raised in the trial court may not be considered by the reviewing court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Petitioner may raise in his Petition the issues of lack of the National Housing Authority's consent to the mortgage and his property's alleged exemption from execution.<br><br>The records show that petitioner mentioned these issues as early as in his Answer to respondent's Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and Pre-trial Brief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The trial court acknowledged these issues, but found that his defenses based on these grounds could not be given credence:<br><br><blockquote>The defendant further stated that he is willing to pay the obligation is unconscionable. Further, the said property constituted their family home. The defendant claimed that Memorandum of Encumbrance prohibits her from selling, encumbering, mortgaging, leasing, subleasing or in any manner altering or disposing the lot or right thereon in whole or in part within ten (10) years from the time of issuance of the said title without obtaining the consent of the NHA.<br><br>. . . The court opines that the defendant has failed to raise a legitimate and lawful ground in order to bar the herein plaintiff from asserting its lawful right under the law.<br><br>The contention of the defendant that the subject mortgaged property is their family home is irrelevant as the debt secured by mortgages on the premises before or after the constitution of the family home does not exempt the same from execution (<i>Rule 106 of the Rules of Court</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></blockquote><br>Whether these arguments seasonably raised are valid is, however, a different matter.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>All the elements of a valid mortgage contract were present. For a mortgage contract to be valid, the absolute owner of a property must have free disposal of the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> That property must be used to secure the fulfillment of an obligation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Article 2085 of the Civil Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 2085. The following requisites are essential to contracts of pledge and mortgage:<br><br>(1) That they be constituted to secure the fulfillment of a principal obligation;<br><br>(2) That the pledgor or mortgagor be the absolute owner of the thing pledged or mortgaged;<br><br>(3) That&nbsp; the&nbsp; persons&nbsp; constituting&nbsp; the&nbsp; pledge&nbsp; or mortgage have the free disposal of their property, and in the absence thereof, that they be legally authorized for the purpose.<br><br>. . . .<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner, who held under his name a transfer certificate of title to the property, mortgaged the property to respondent to secure the payment of his loan of P600,000.00.<br><br>Petitioner claims that he only borrowed P250,000.00 and that he was only made to sign another mortgage contract whose terms he did not agree to.<br><br>These claims were already found by the trial court and the Court of Appeals to be unsupported by evidence. Petitioner's consent to the mortgage contract dated November 17, 1997 was not vitiated. He voluntarily signed it in the presence of a notary public, his wife, and other witnesses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Further, the amount of P600,000.00 under the November 17, 1997 mortgage contract represented the initial loan of P250,000.00 and the subsequent loan amounts, which were found to have been actually released to petitioner. The November 17, 1997 mortgage contract reflected the changes in the parties' obligations after they executed the March 17, 1997 mortgage contract.<br><br>This court is not a trier of facts. As a general rule, findings of fact of the lower court and of the Court of Appeals are not reviewable and are binding upon this court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> unless the circumstances of the case are shown to be covered by the exceptions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Petitioner failed to show any ground for this court to review the trial court's and the Court of Appeals' finding that petitioner mortgaged his property in consideration of a loan amounting to P600,000.00.<br><br>Petitioner's undisputed title to and ownership of the property is sufficient to give him free disposal of it. As owner of the property, he has the right to enjoy all attributes of ownership including <i>jus disponendi</i> or the right to&nbsp; encumber,&nbsp; alienate,&nbsp; or dispose&nbsp; his&nbsp; property&nbsp; "without&nbsp; other limitations than those established by law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's claim that he lacks free disposal of the property stems from the existence of the restrictions imposed on his title by the National Housing Authority. These restrictions were annotated on his title, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Entry No. 4519/V-013/T-234246 -RESTRICTION-that the Vendee shall not sell, encumber, mortgage, lease, sub-let or in any manner, alter or dispose the lot or right therein at any time, in whole or in part without obtaining the written consent of the Vendor. Other restrictions set forth in Doc. No. 287; Page No. 59; Book No. 250; SERIES of 1997 of Notary Public for Quezon City, Liberty S. Perez.<br><br>Date of instrument - June 24, 1997<br>Date of inscription- June 25, 1997- 11:39 a.m.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The National Housing Authority's restrictions were provisions in a contract it executed with petitioner. This contract bound petitioner to certain conditions before transferring or encumbering the property. Specifically, when the National Housing Authority sold the property to petitioner, petitioner became obligated not to sell, encumber, mortgage, lease, sublease, alter, or dispose the property without the National Housing Authority's consent.<br><br>These restrictions do not divest petitioner of his ownership rights. They are mere burdens or limitations on petitioner's <i>jus disponendi.</i> Thus, petitioner may dispose or encumber his property. However, the disposition or encumbrance of his property is subject to the limitations and to the rights that may accrue to the National Housing Authority. When annotated to the title, these restrictions serve as notice to the whole world that the National Housing Authority has claims over the property, which it may enforce against others.<br><br>Contracts entered into in violation of restrictions on a property owner's rights do not always have the effect of making them void <i>ab initio.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> This has been clarified as early as 1956 in <i>Municipality of Camiling v. Lopez</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The Municipality of Camiling sought to collect from Diego Z. Lopez payments for the lease of "certain fisheries." As. a defense, Diego Z. Lopez invoked the alleged nullity of the lease contract he entered into with the Municipality of Camiling.<br><br>Citing<i> Municipality of Hagonoy v. Evangelista,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> the trial court ruled that the lease contract between the Municipality of Camiling and Diego Z. Lopez was void since it "was not approved by the provincial governor in violation of section 2196 of the Revised Administrative Code."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> This court reversed the trial court's Decision and noted the incorrect interpretation in <i>Municipality of Hagonoy</i> of the term "nulos" under Article 4 of the then Civil Code: "<i>Son nulos los actos ejecutados contra lo dispuesto en la ley, salvo los casos en que la naisma ley or dene su validez.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In <i>Municipality of Camiling</i>, this court explained that void acts declared in Article 4 of the Old Civil Code<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[63]</sup></font> refer to those made in violation of the law. Not all those acts are void from the beginning. Void acts may be "those that are <i>ipso facto</i> void and those which are merely voidable."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>The lease contract executed by the Municipality of Camiling and Diego Z. Lopez was not treated as <i>ipso facto</i> void. Section 2196 of the Administrative Code required the provincial governor's approval before the municipal council entered into contracts. However, the same provision did not prohibit the municipal council from entering into contracts involving the properties of the municipality.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[65]</sup></font> The municipal council's exercise of power to enter into these contracts might have been limited, but its power was recognized. This court found that aside from the lack of approval, the contract had no badge of illegality that would make it <i>ipso facto</i> void. The execution of the contract was not tainted with violation of public order, morality, or public policy. The contract could have been ratified. Hence, this court said that it was "merely voidable at the option of the party who in law is granted the right to invoke its invalidity."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>The same doctrine was repeated in <i>Sarmiento v. Salud</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> which involved a property in Kamuning, Quezon City. The property was sold by Philippine Homesite and Housing Corp. to Spouses Francisco and Marcelina Sarmiento. The transfer certificate of title that covered the property contained an annotation stating that the property was sold on the condition that it could not be resold within 25 years from contract date. Sale could be made within the period only to People's Homesite and Housing Corporation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Spouses Sarmiento later mortgaged the property to Jorge Salud. Because Spouses Sarmiento failed to redeem the property, the sheriff auctioned and sold the property to Jorge Salud, who was issued a certificate of sale.<br><br>Spouses Sarmiento sought to prevent the foreclosure of the property by filing an action for annulment of the foreclosure proceedings, sale, and certificate of sale on the ground that the prohibition against sale of the property within 25 years was violated.<br><br>This court did not declare the contract void for violating the condition that the property could not be resold within 25 years. Instead, it recognized People's Homesite and Housing Corporation's right to cause the annulment of the contract. Since the condition was made in favor of People's Homesite and Housing Corporation, it was the Corporation, not Spouses Sarmiento, who had a cause of action for annulment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> In effect, this court considered the contract between Spouses Sarmiento and Jorge Salud as merely voidable at the option of People's Homesite and Housing Corporation.<br><br>Thus, contracts that contain provisions in favor of one party may be void ab initio or voidable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Contracts that lack consideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> those that are against public order or public policy,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and those that are attended by illegality<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> or immorality<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> are void <i>ab initio</i>.<br><br>Contracts that only subject a property owner's property rights to conditions or limitations but otherwise contain all the elements of a valid contract are merely voidable by the person in whose favor the conditions or limitations are made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>The mortgage contract entered into by petitioner and respondent contains all the elements of a valid contract of mortgage. The trial court and the Court of Appeals found no irregularity in its execution. There was no showing that it was attended by fraud, illegality, immorality, force or intimidation, and lack of consideration.<br><br>At most, therefore, the restrictions made the contract entered into by the parties voidable<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> by the person in whose favor they were made—in this case, by the National Housing Authority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Petitioner has no actionable right or cause of action based on those restrictions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>Having the right to assail the validity of the mortgage contract based on violation of the restrictions, the National Housing Authority may seek the annulment of the mortgage contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Without any action from the National Housing Authority, rights and obligations, including the right to foreclose the property in case of non-payment of the secured loan, are still enforceable between the parties that executed the mortgage contract.<br><br>The voidable nature of contracts entered into in violation of restrictions or conditions necessarily implies that the person in whose favor the restrictions were made has two (2) options. It may either: (1) waive<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[80]</sup></font> its rights accruing from such restrictions, in which case, the duly executed subsequent contract remains valid; or (2) assail the subsequent contract based on the breach of restrictions imposed in its favor.<br><br>In Sarmiento, this court recognized that the right to waive follows from the right to invoke any violation of conditions under the contract. Only the person who has the right to invoke this violation has the cause of action for annulment of contract. The validity or invalidity of the contract on the ground of the violation is dependent on whether that person will invoke this right. Hence, there was effectively a waiver on the part of People's Homesite and Housing Corporation when it did not assail the validity of the mortgage in that case:<br><br><blockquote>It follows that on the assumption that the mortgage to appellee Salud and the foreclosure sale violated the condition in the Sarmiento contract, only the PHHC was entitled to invoke the condition aforementioned, and not the Sarmientos. The validity or invalidity of the sheriffs foreclosure sale to appellant Salud thus depended exclusively on the PHHC; the latter could attack the sale as violative of its right of exclusive reacquisition; but it (PHHC) also could waive the condition and treat the sale as good, in which event, the sale can not be assailed [for] breach of the condition aforestated. Since it does not appear anywhere in the record that the PHHC treated the mortgage and foreclosure sale as an infringement of the condition, the validity of the mortgage, with all its consequences, including its foreclosure and sale thereat, can not be an issue between the parties to the present case. In the last analysis, the appellant, as purchaser at the foreclosure sale, should be regarded as the owner of the lot, subject only to the right of PHHC to have his acquisition of the land set aside if it so desires.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></blockquote><br>There is no showing that the National Housing Authority assailed the validity of the mortgage contract on the ground of violation of restrictions on petitioner's title. The validity of the mortgage contract based on the restrictions is not an issue between the parties. Petitioner has no cause of action against respondent based on those restrictions. The mortgage contract remains binding upon petitioner and respondent.<br><br>In any case, there was at least substantial compliance with the consent requirement given the National Housing Authority's issuance of a Permit to Mortgage. The Permit reads:<br><br><blockquote><div align="right">25 November 1997<br></div><br>MR.

The November 17, 1997 mortgage contract had references to the above conditions imposed by the National Housing Authority, thus:<br><br><blockquote>It is the essence of this Contract, that if and should the Mortgagor fails to comply and pay the principal obligations hereon within the period of the Contract, <i>the Mortgage shall be foreclosed according to law and in which case the NHA shall be duly notified of the matter.</i><br><br><i>That this mortgage contract shall be submitted to the NHA for verifixation [sic] and final approval in accordance with NHA permit to mortgage the property.</i><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[83] </sup></font>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Assuming there was non-compliance with the conditions set forth in the Permit, petitioner cannot blame respondent.

It assumes that parties are on equal footing during bargaining and that neither of the parties has a relatively greater bargaining power to command a higher or lower interest rate. It assumes that the parties are equally in control of the interest rate and equally have options to accept or deny the other party's proposals.

There are imperfections in the loan market. One party may have more bargaining power than the other. A borrower may be in need of funds more than a lender is in need of lending them.

This court noted circumstances that differentiated that case from <i>Medel</i> and found that the borrower in <i>Toledo</i> was not in dire need of money when she obtained a loan; this implied that the interest rates were agreed upon by the parties on equal footing. This court also found that it was the borrower in <i>Toledo </i>who was guilty of inequitable acts:<br><br><blockquote>Noteworthy is the fact that in <i>Medel,</i> the defendant-spouses were never able to pay their indebtedness from the very beginning and when their obligations ballooned into a staggering sum, the creditors filed a collection case against them. <i>In this case, there was no urgency of the need for money on the part of Jocelyn, the debtor, which compelled her to enter into said loan transactions. She used the money from the loans to make advance payments for prospective clients of educational plans offered by her employer. In this way, her sales production would increase, thereby entitling her to 50% rebate on her sales. This is the reason why she did not mind the 6% to 7% monthly interest.</i> Notably too, a business transaction of this nature between Jocelyn and Marilou continued for more than five years. Jocelyn religiously paid the agreed amount of interest until she ordered for stop payment on some of the checks issued to Marilou. <i>The checks were in fact sufficiently funded when she ordered the stop payment and then filed a case questioning the imposition of a 6% to 7% interest rate for being allegedly iniquitous or unconscionable and, hence, contrary to morals.</i><br><br><i>It was clearly shown that before Jocelyn availed of said loans, she knew fully well that the same carried with it an interest rate of 6% to 7% per month, yet she did not complain. In fact, when she availed of said loans, an advance interest of 6% to 7% was already deducted from the loan amount, yet she never uttered a word of protest.</i><br><br><i>After years of benefiting from the proceeds of the loans bearing an interest rate of 6% to 7% per month and paying for the same</i>, Jocelyn cannot now go to court to have the said interest rate annulled on the ground that it is excessive, iniquitous, unconscionable, exorbitant, and absolutely revolting to the conscience of man. "This is so because among the maxims of equity are (1) he who seeks equity must do equity, and (2) he who comes into equity must come with clean hands. The latter is a frequently stated maxim which is also expressed in the principle that he who has done inequity shall not have equity. It signifies that a litigant may be denied relief by a court of equity on the ground that his conduct has been inequitable, unfair and dishonest, or fraudulent, or deceitful as to the controversy in issue."<br><br><i>We are convinced that Jocelyn did not come to court for equitable relief with equity or with clean hands. It is patently clear from the above summary of the facts that the conduct of Jocelyn can by no means be characterized as nobly fair, just, and reasonable.</i> This Court likewise notes certain acts of Jocelyn before filing the case with the RTC. <i>In September 1998, she requested Marilou not to deposit her checks as she can cover the checks only the following month. On the next month, Jocelyn again requested for another extension of one month. It turned out that she was only sweet-talking Marilou into believing that she had no money at that time. But as testified by Serapio Romarate, an employee of the Bank of Commerce where Jocelyn is one of their clients, there was an available balance of P276,203.03 in the latter's account and yet she ordered for the stop payments of the seven checks which can actually be covered by the available funds in said account.</i> She then caught Marilou by surprise when she surreptitiously filed a case for declaration of nullity of the document and for damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> (Emphases supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Under the circumstances of this case, we find no reason to uphold the stipulated interest rates of 5% to 10% per month on petitioner's loan. Petitioner obtained the loan out of extreme necessity. As pointed out by respondent, the property would have been earlier foreclosed by the National Housing Authority if not for the loan. Moreover, it would be unjust to impose a heavier burden upon petitioner, who would already be losing his and his family's home. Respondent would not be unjustly deprived if the interest rate is reduced. After all, respondent still has the right to foreclose the property. Thus, we affirm the Court of Appeals Decision to reduce the interest rate to 1% per month or 12% per annum.<br><br>However, we modify the rates in accordance with the guidelines set forth in <i>Nacar v.
