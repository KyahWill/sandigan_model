				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In a verified Complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed on January 23, 2003, complainant Jutta Krursel, a German national, charges respondent Atty. Lorenza A. Abion with forgery, swindling, and falsification of a public document. She asks that respondent be disbarred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Complainant alleges that she engaged the services of respondent to assist her in filing a case against Robinsons Savings Bank - Ermita Branch land its officers, in relation to the bank's illegal withholding/blocking of her account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In March 2002, respondent filed, on complainant's behalf, a complaint against Robinsons Savings Bank and its officers before the Monetary Board I of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas for "Conducting Business in an Unsafe and Unsound Manner in violation of Republic Act No. 8791[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Without complainant's knowledge, respondent withdrew the complaint with prejudice through a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> dated April 15, 2002 addressed to I the Monetary Board. Complainant claims that respondent forged her signature and that of a certain William Randeli Coleman (Coleman) in the letter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> She adds that she never authorized nor acceded to respondent's withdrawal of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Complainant was further surprised to discover two (2) Special Powers of Attorney dated March 7, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and March 24, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which appear to have her and Coleman's signature as principals.

The Order was purportedly signed by Atty. Virginia; R. Soriano, "Division Clerk of the First Division of the Supreme Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Complainant sought the advice of Atty. Abelardo L. Aportadera, Jr., who, in turn, wrote to Atty. Virginia Ancheta-Soriano (Atty. Soriano) on July 30, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> inquiring about the supposed Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Atty. Soriano replied<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> denying the signature as hers. She stated that the Order did not even follow this Court's format, and that, on the contrary, the case had been dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Finally, complainant alleges that in April 2002, while she was sick and in the hospital, respondent asked for complainant's German passportj to secure its renewal from the German Embassy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> For this service, respondent asked for the total amount of P440,000.00 to cover the following expenses:<br><blockquote>May 20, 2002 - Php 40,000.00 - For Processing of Travel Papers <br>May 27, 2002 - Php 50,000.00 - For Additional Fee for the Travel Papers<br>June 3, 2002 - <u>Php 350.000,00</u> - For the release of Travel Papers <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as required by Atty.

However, these were returned unserved with the notations "Unclaimed," "Party Moved Out," "Moved Out," and "Party in Manila."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> This Court requested the assistance of the National Bureau of Investigation, but respondent could still not be found.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated October 10, 2011, this Court referred the case to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for investigation, report, and recommendation.<br><br>On March 14, 2012, the Commission on Bar Discipline of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines directed both parties to appear for mandatory conference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> However, copies of the Notice of Mandatory Conference were returned unserved as both parties were stated to have "moved out."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Hence, in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated April 24, 2012, the Commission on Bar Discipline deemed the case submitted for resolution on the basis of the Complaint (with attachments) filed before this Court.<br><br>In his Report and Recommendation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated July 6, 2013, Investigating Commissioner Peter Irving C. Corvera recommended that respondent be disbarred for fabricating and forging Special Powers of Attorney and an order from this Court, coupled with her exaction of money from complainant without receipt or accounting despite demands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> These acts are in culpable violation of Canon 1; Rule 1.01; Canon 16, Rule 16.01; and Canon 17 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated October 10, 2014, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines Board of Governors adopted and approved the findings and recommendations of the Investigating Commissioner. Respondent did hot file a motion for reconsideration or any other subsequent pleading.<br><br>On October 13, 2015, the Board of Governors transmitted its Resolution to this Court for final action under Rule 139-B of the Rulesj of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The issue for resolution is whether respondent should be disbarred for committing forgery, falsification, and swindling.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>At the outset, we cannot ignore this Court's several attempts to serve a copy of the February 24, 2003 Resolution (requiring respondent to file a comment on the Complaint for disbarment) on respondent at her address ion record and at the different addresses provided by complainant and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, only to be returned unserved. On June 1, 2011, this Court requested the assistance of the National Bureau of Investigation to locate respondent, but to no avail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> All these circumstances reveal that either respondent was disinterested in contesting the charges against her or she was deliberately eluding the service of this Court's Resolutions to evade the consequences of her actions.<br><br>Respondent's willful behavior has effectively hindered this Court's process service and unduly prolonged this case. This evasive attitude is unbecoming of a lawyer, an officer of the court who swore to "obey the laws as well as the legal orders of the duly constituted authorities."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In <i>Stemmerick v. Mas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> this Court held that proper notice of the disbarment proceedings was given to the respondent lawyer who abandoned his law office after committing the embezzlement against his client. Thus:<br><blockquote>Respondent should not be allowed to benefit from his disappearing act. He can neither defeat this Court's jurisdiction over him as a member of the bar nor evade administrative liability by the mere ruse of concealing his whereabouts. Thus, service of the complaint and other orders and processes on respondent's office was sufficient notice to him.<br><br>Indeed, since he himself rendered the service of notice on him impossible, the notice requirement cannot apply to him and he is thus considered to have waived it. The law does not require that the impossible be done. <i>Nemo tenetur ad impossibile</i>. The law obliges no one to perform an impossibility. Laws and rules must be interpreted in a way that they are in accordance with logic, common sense, reason and practicality.<br><br>In this connection, lawyers must update their records with the IBP by informing the IBP National Office or their respective chapters of any change in office or residential address and other contact details. In case such change is not duly updated, service of notice on the office or residential address appearing in the records of the IBP National Office shall constitute sufficient notice to a lawyer for purposes of administrative proceedings against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Here, respondent's apparent disregard of the judicial process cannot be tolerated. Under the circumstances, respondent is deemed to have waived her right to present her evidence for she cannot use her disappearance as a shield against any liability she may have incurred.<br><br>Respondent's evasive attitude is tantamount to "a willful disobedience of any lawful order of a superior court,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> which alone is a ground for disbarment or suspension.<br><br>We proceed to address the charges raised in the Complaint.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Complainant claims that respondent forged her and Coleman's signatures in two (2) documents: <i>first</i>, in the Special Powers of Attorney dated March 7, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and March 24, 2002;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and <i>second</i>, in respondents April 15, 2002 letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> withdrawing her complaint against Robinsons Savings Bank before the Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.<br><br>A comparison of the signature of complainant Jutta Krursel in her Complaint and Verification and Certification, on one hand, and her contested signature in the Special Power of Attorney dated March 7, 2002, on the other, visibly shows significant differences in the stroke, form, and general appearance of the two (2) signatures. The inevitable conclusion is that the two (2) signatures were not penned by one person. Similarly, complainant's contested signature under the Conforme portion in the April 15, 2002 letter of respondent clearly appears to have been forged.<br><br>Nonetheless, with respect to complainant's forged signature in Special Power of Attorney, we find no other evidence pointing to respondent as the author of the forgery. Jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> creates a presumption that a person who was in possession of, or made use of, or benefitted from ithe forged or falsified documents is the forger. However, in this case, the facts are insufficient for us to presume that respondent forged complainant's signature.<br><br>Although the Special Power of Attorney may have been executed in respondent's favor—as it authorized her to represent, receive, and sign papers, checks, remittances, accounts, and receivables on behalf! of complainant—her appointment as attorney-in-fact was only in relation to complainant's "legal and extra[-]legal efforts to retrieve and unblock [complainant's] peso and dollar savings accounts with Robinsons Savings Bank, Ermita."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The authority given was only in furtherance of complainant's employment of respondent's legal services. There was no allegation or proof that respondent benefitted from or used the falsified document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Moreover, complainant had possession of the Special Power of Attorney, a icopy of which was attached to her Complaint. In all likelihood, the Special Power of Attorney may not only have been known to complainant; she may have conformed to its preparation all along.<br><br>However, the same conclusion cannot be made with regard to compiainant's forged signature in the April 15, 2002 letter. In the Verification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> attached to the letter, respondent declared under oath that she jcaused the preparation of the letter of withdrawal of the complaint with prejudice. She declared under oath that <i>she also caused the conforme of her clients after informing them of the facts, both as counsel and attorney-in-fact</i>.<br><br>Thus, respondent committed serious acts of deceit in: (1) withdrawing the complaint with prejudice, without the knowledge and consent of complainant; and (2) forging complainant's signature or causing her signature to be forged in the April 15, 2002 letter, thus making it appear that complainant conformed to the withdrawal of the complaint.<br><br>In <i>Sebastian v. Calis</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><blockquote>Deception and other fraudulent acts by a lawyer are disgraceful and dishonorable. They reveal moral flaws in a lawyer. They are unacceptable practices. A lawyer's relationship with others should be characterized by the highest degree of good faith, fairness and candor. This is the essence of the lawyer's oath. The lawyer's oath is not mere facile words, drift and hollow, but a sacred trust that must be upheld and keep inviolable. The nature of the office of an attorney requires that he should be a person of good moral character. This requisite is not only a condition precedent to admission to the practice of law, its continued possession is also essential for remaining in the practice of law. We have sternly warned that any gross misconduct of a lawyer, whether in his professional or private capacity, puts his moral character in serious doubt as a member of the Bar, and renders him unfit to continue in the practice of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Respondent's deception constitutes a gross violation of professional ethics and a breach of her fiduciary duty to her client, subjecting her to disciplinary action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>Furthermore, we agree with the Committee on Bar Discipline's fmding that complainant has sufficiently proven her allegations regarding the falsified order.<br><br>The appearance of the purported May 10, 2002 Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> in G.R. No. 152946 is markedly different from the orders and resolutions of this Court. Indeed, it was later confirmed through the letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> issued by Atty. Soriano, Clerk of Court of the First Division, that there was no such order issued, that the signature there was not hers, and that the format did not follow this Court's format.<br><br>Complainant avers that she paid substantial amounts of money to respondent in relation to the filing of the complaint for injunction in G.R. No. 152946, though respondent did not issue any receipt or accounting despite her demands. Instead, respondent allegedly furnished complainant with the fabricated May 10, 2002 Order purportedly ruling in her favor. Complainant later found out that no such order existed. The case was already dismissed.<br><br>Respondent's acts amount to deceit, malpractice, or gross misconduct in office as an attorney.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> She violated her oath to "do no falsehood"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> and to "conduct [her] self as a lawyer . . . with all good fidelity as well to the courts as to; [her] clients."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> She also violated the following provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility:<br><blockquote>Rule 1.01 - A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>CANON 7. A LAWYER SHALL AT ALL TIMES UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY AND DIGNITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE INTEGRATED BAR.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Rule 7.03 — A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor should he, whether in public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal profession.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>CANON 15. A LAWYER SHALL OBSERVE CANDOR, FAIRNESS AND LOYALTY IN ALL HIS DEALINGS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH HIS CLIENT.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>CANON 17. A LAWYER OWES FIDELITY TO THE CAUSE OF HIS CLIENT AND HE SHALL BE MINDFUL OF THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN HIM.<br><br>CANON 18. A LAWYER SHALL SERVE HIS CLIENT WITH COMPETENCE AND DILIGENCE.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Rule 18.04 - A lawyer shall keep his elient informed of the status of his case and shall respond within a reasonable time to the client's request for information.<br></blockquote>Respondent's transgressions are grave and serious. She abused her legal knowledge and training. She took undue advantage of the trust reposed on her by her client. Her misconduct exhibits a brazen disregard of her duties as a lawyer. The advocate for justice became the perpetrator of injustice.<br><br>Aside from defrauding her client, respondent recklessly put Arty. Soriano's career in jeopardy by fabricating an order, thus making a mockery of the judicial system. That a lawyer is not merely a professional but also an officer of the court cannot be overemphasized. She owes the courts of justice and its judicial officers utmost respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Her conduct degrades the administration of justice and weakens the people faith in the judicial system. She inexorably besmirched the entire legal profession.<br><br>In <i>Embido v. Pe, Jr.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Salvador Pe, Jr. was found guilty of violating Canon 7, Rule 7.03 and was meted the penalty of disbarment for falsifying a court decision "in a non-existent court proceeding."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Thus:<br><blockquote>Gross immorality, conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, or fraudulent transactions can justify a lawyer's disbarment or suspension from the practice of law. Specifically, the deliberate falsification of the court decision by the respondent was an act that reflected a high degree of moral turpitude on his part. Worse, the act made a mockery of the administration of justice in this country, given the purpose of the falsification, which was to mislead a foreign tribunal on the personal status of a person. He thereby became unworthy of continuing as a member of the Bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Respondent's unethical and unscrupulous conduct proves her unworthy of the public's trust and confidence. She shamelessly transgressed all the things she swore to uphold, which makes her unfit to continue as a member of the bar. Hence, we find no hesitation in removing respondent from the Roll of Attorneys.<br><br>However, we find a dearth of evidence to support complainant's claim as to the amounts demanded and received by respondent, that is: (1) a total of P330,000.00 in relation to G.R. No. 152946; and (2) a total of P440,000.00 for the renewal of complainant's passport. The demand letter dated June 24, 2002, attached to the Complaint as Annex E, is not competent proof of the actual amounts paid to and received by respondent. The demand letter does not contain the date when the addressee received the letter; this produces doubt as to whether the demand letter was actually sent/delivered to respondent.<br><br>In administrative cases, it is the complainant who has the burden to prove, by substantial evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> the allegations in the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court finds respondent Arty.
