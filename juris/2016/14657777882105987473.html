(WPI shares) that are owned and registered in the name of petitioner The Wellex Group, Inc. (Wellex).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In resolving the prayer of Wellex for the issuance of injunctive relief, this Court is constrained to examine the merits of the Petition and at once notes' that this case is essentially intertwined with G.R. 187951,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> a landmark case, wherein this Court declared, among others, that the WPI shares are included among those assets of Investment Management Agreement with Account No. 101-78056-1, under the name of <i>Jose Velarde</i>, (IMA Account) formerly managed by respondent BDO Unibank, Inc., previously Equitable PCI Bank, Inc. (BDO). The said account was duly forfeited in favor of the State by virtue of the Resolution dated 24 September 2008 of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. 26558, the case for plunder against former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada.<br><br>The material facts of this case, as culled from the records,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> are as follows:<br><br>On 4 February 2000, Wellex obtained a loan in the principal amount of P500,000,000.00 from the IMA Account with BDO. As security for the loan, Wellex mortgaged the WPI shares.<br><br>By the time the loan obligation matured on 29 January 2001, Wellex was not able to settle the same; however, BDO, as investment manager of the IMA Account did not institute any foreclosure proceeding against the WPI shares.<br><br>Thereafter, BDO, through a Letter dated 14 March 2001, informed Wellex that it shall cease to manage the IMA Account effective 2 May 2001. In the same letter, BDO informed Wellex tha't on 29 January 2000, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued a Notice of Constructive Distraint against the IMA Account, which effectively froze all goods, chattels or personal property owned by Jose Velarde, including the WPI shares, which BDO could consequently neither remove nor dispose of without the express authority of the BIR.<br><br>Subsequently, Wellex alleged that considering that BDO had relinquished its authority to act as the investment manager of the IMA Account, and that Wellex had supposedly settled its loan obligation in full <i>directly</i> with Jose Velarde, BDO, as the principal of the IMA Account, should return the WPI shares to Wellex. BDO, however, did not.<br><br>In the meantime, on 12 September 2007, the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. 26558 found former President Estrada guilty of the crime of plunder. The conviction ultimately carried with it the penalty of forfeiture,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> wherein all ill-gotten wealth amassed by former President Estrada, including the IMA Account and the assets therein, were forfeited in favor of the State.<br><br>Former President Estrada was, thereafter, pardoned by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on 25 October 2007; nonetheless, the said forfeiture remained in force.<br><br>Consequently, the Sandiganbayan, in the same case, issued a Resolution dated 24 September 2008 directing the Sheriff of the Sandiganbayan to cause the forfeiture of, among others, the IMA Account, including the WPI shares in favor of the State.<br><br>Wellex sought to intervene in Criminal Case No. 26558 and moved for the reconsideration of the above-mentioned Resolution dated 24 September 2008. Wellex argued that the WPI shares should be excluded from the forfeiture order. However, the Sandiganbayan, in a Resolution dated 02 April 2009, denied the said reconsideration sought by Wellex.<br><br>By virtue of the foregoing resolutions, respondent Sheriff Edgardo A. Urieta (Urieta) of the Sandiganbayan issued to BDO a Notice to Deliver dated 20 April 2009. BDO delivered to Urieta, among others, the WPI shares, which shares Urieta subsequently scheduled<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> for sale at a public auction on 15 May 2009.<br><br>As mentioned above, Wellex filed G.R. No 187951 to question the inclusion of the WPI shares among the forfeited assets; however, this Court affirmed the inclusion of the WPI shares as part of the assets covered by the forfeiture order.<br><br>Subsequently, Wellex filed Civil Case No. 09-399 with the trial court for the recovery of the possession of the WPI shares. In essence, Wellex claims that it is the owner of the WPI Shares, that it fully paid its loan obligation and that it is entitled to the return thereof. Wellex prayed that the trial court issue a temporary restraining order and a writ of preliminary injunction against the Sandiganbayan to enjoin them from selling the WPI shares at a public auction. Wellex alleged that it instituted the case as a third (3rd) party claimant because the Sandiganbayan failed to observe the requirements under Section 16, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and that Wellex was left with no recourse but to file an action with a competent court to recover ownership of the WPI shares by virtue of the extinguishment of the obligation through payment.<br><br>With the filing of the foregoing case, Urieta and the Sandiganbayan Security and Sheriff Services agreed to maintain <i>status quo</i> and to defer the public auction of the WPI shares until the resolution of the case.<br><br>Thereafter, Urieta and the Sandiganbayan Security and Sheriff Services, as well as BDO, filed their respective motions to dismiss in Civil Case No. 09-399, which motions were granted by the trial court in its Order dated 9 January 2012. The aforestated order of the trial court directed the dismissal of Civil Case No. 09-399 on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction based on the principle of hierarchy of courts, and failure to state a cause of action.<br><br>Wellex moved for the reconsideration of the above-mentioned order dated 9 January 2012, which was, however, denied by the trial court in its Resolution dated 15 January 2014.<br><br>Hence, Wellex comes to this Court <i>via</i> the instant Petition, on pure questions of law.<br><br>Wellex contends that the trial court erred in its ruling dismissing Civil Case No. 09-399 because it can take cognizance of the same by determining the existence of legal and formal requirements for executing on a security, particularly on the WPI shares. Thus, Wellex seeks that this Court set aside the dismissal order and direct the resumption of proceedings.<br><br>We clarify.<br><br>Before delving into the merits of the Petition, this Court recognizes the crucial need to emphasize that as per the Decision in G.R. 187951, this Court had already declared with absolute finality that the WPl shares were and should rightfully be included among the forfeited assets in favor of the State. Therefore, this matter is beyond cavil. This Court aptly and succinctly ruled "[i]t is beyond doubt that IMA Trust Account No. 101-78056-1 and its assets were traceable to the account adjudged as ill-gotten. As such, the trust account and its assets were indeed within the scope of the forfeiture Order issued by the Sandiganbayan in the plunder case"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> against former President Estrada.<br><br>However, this Court is cognizant of the fact that the issues in this case are, while novel, unambiguous: whether the Sandiganbayan may proceed to sell outright, at public auction, the forfeited WPI shares; and whether the trial court may take cognizance of Civil Case No. 09-399.<br><br>To resolve these issues, there is a need to first establish the nature of the WPI shares.<br><br>In its final and executory Decision in G.R. No. 187951, this Court had already ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>There is no dispute that the subject shares of stock were mortgaged by petitioner Wellex as security for its loan. These shares being the subject of a contract that was accessory to the Wellex loan and being an asset of the forfeited IMA Trust Account, the said shares necessarily follow the fate of the trust account and are forfeited as well. <u>However, the forfeiture . of the said trust account, tofiether with all its assets and receivables, does not affect the validity of the loan transaction between BDO the creditor and Wellex the debtor. The loan continues to be valid despite the forfeiture by the government of the IMA Trust Account and is considered as an asset.</u><br><br>Consequently, the forfeiture had the effect of subrogating the state to the rights of the trust account as creditor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Thus, this Court reiterates that the WPI shares assume the character of a security for a valid and existing loan obligation, which is included in the. IMA Account. Stated in simpler terms, one (1) of the assets in the IMA Account is a receivable secured by a chattel mortgage, more particularly the valid and existing loan obligation between BDO and petitioner, secured by the WPI shares.<br><br>Consequently, considering that the loan obligation of petitioner is valid and existing, it necessarily follows that BDO, the creditor, or its successor-in-interest, cannot be allowed to unilaterally sell the chattel securing the loan and apply the proceeds thereof as payment, full or partial, to the said loan. This would constitute a clear case of <i>pactum commissorium,</i> which is expressly prohibited by Article 2088<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[11]</sup></font> of the Civil Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In line with our holding in<i> The Wellex Group, Inc. v. Sandigfinbayan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> that "the forfeiture had the effect x x x as creditor," the state has stepped into the shoes of the BDO. As this Court has consistently ruled, "[sjubrogation is the substitution of one person by another with reference to a lawful claim or right, so that he who is substituted succeeds to the rights of the other in relation to a debt or claim, including its remedies or securities, x x x It contemplates full substitution such that it places the party subrogated in the shoes of the creditor, and he may use all means that the creditor could employ to enforce payment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Given that the subrogee merely steps into the shoes of the creditor, he acquires no right greater than those of the latter.<br><br>Considering that the WPI shares serves as security to an acknowledged valid and existing loan obligation, the subrogee, in this case the State, is obliged to avail of the very same remedies available to the original creditor to collect the loan obligation, which is to first demand from the original debtor to pay the same, and if not paid despite demand, institute either foreclosure proceedings, or the appropriate action for collection before the proper forum. In either case, the debtor will be afforded the opportunity to pay the obligation, or to assert any claim or defense, which the debtor may have against the original creditor. This is the essence of constitutional right to due process. In this case, the action of public respondent in offering for sale, at public auction, the WPI shares would unavoidably trample upon a constitutionally enshrined right.<br><br>This Court is well aware that the Sandiganbayan had earlier asserted in Criminal Case No. 26558 that as regards the BDO loan, Wellex is considered a delinquent debtor. However, the pronouncement cannot be an excuse to omit the steps needed to be taken regarding the mortgaged WPI shares. It is a fact that Wellex was not impleaded as a party to the said case, ergo, the effect of the pronouncement cannot be extended to it. It is axiomatic that no man shall be affected by any proceeding to which he is a stranger, and strangers to a case are not bound by any judgment rendered by the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Thus, only those who have had their day in court are considered the real parties in interest in an action, and it is they who are bound by the judgment therein and by writs of execution issued pursuant thereto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Even more important, this Court notes that the subject matter of controversy brought forth by Wellex is purely civil in nature. This involves the third (3<sup>rd</sup>) party claim of Wellex against the WPI shares <i>vis-a-vis </i>the loan obligation <i>per se</i>, which should be properly lodged before and heard by the regular trial courts. To the mind of this Court, it is clear that the same does not pertain to the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. Jurisdiction, which is the authority to hear and the right to act in a case, is conferred by the Constitution and by law. Although the Sandiganbayan, a constitutionally-mandated court, is a regular court, it has, nevertheless, only a special or limited jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>While this Court has time and again affirmed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> that the Sandiganbayan has jurisdiction over the civil aspect of criminal cases, as conferred to it by law, the case before the trial court does not involve the civil aspect of Criminal Case No. 26558. The same has nothing to do with the ownership of the IMA Account and/or any of its financial assets, which, as stated above, has been adjudged forfeited in favor of the State. In contrast, the said case is an ordinary civil case entailing the propriety of the actions of a creditor in proceeding against the security for its loan, which necessitates the application of the provisions of the Civil Code, therefore falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Courts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Given that the cause of action of Wellex in Civil Case No. 09-399 partakes of a valid third (3rd) party claim sanctioned by the Rules of Court, affording Wellex the opportunity to assert its claim or defense against its creditor, presently the State, the latter should likewise avail of this avenue to affirm its own claims, as creditor, against the loan and/or mortgage securing the said loan, paving the way to the realization of any of the fruits of plunder. Thus, this Court deems it proper to remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings, where all the civil issues may properly be ventilated.<br><br>At this point, this Court commends the trial court for acting cautiously and exercising prudence in applying the principle of hierarchy of courts when it issued its Order dated 9 January 2012 and Resolution dated 15 January 2014. As a consequence of the rulings rendered in this case, that is, that the State, acting through the Sandiganbayan, may not sell the WPI shares outright without first complying with the requirements set by law, the prayer of petitioner for injunctive relief against the Sandiganbayan is now rendered moot and academic. And as previously stated, given the fact that the State has validly substituted BDO as the creditor of Wellex, the cause of action of Wellex against BDO is, likewise, rendered moot and academic.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, <b>JUDGMENT</b> is hereby rendered <b>GRANTING</b> the instant Petition and <b>SETTING ASIDE</b> the Order dated 9 January 2012 and Resolution dated 15 January 2014 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City, Branch 132 in Civil Case No. 09-399.

[The Wellex Group, Inc.] learned that the principal of the IMA Account is Mr. Jaime Dichaves. To avoid being defaulted in its loan obligations, [The Wellex Group, Inc.] dealt directly with the principal and eventually settled its loan obligations.<br><br>13. Having settled its loan obligations, [The Wellex Group, Inc.] made demands upon defendant [Banco de Oro] to return the subject stock certificates, but the latter unjustifiably failed to comply with plaintiff s just and valid demands. The last of such demands was evidenced by the demand letter made by [The Wellex Group, Inc.'s] counsel to [Banco de Oro] dated 05 November 2008. . . .<br><br>14. Instead, on 22 April 2009, without the authority and consent of [The Wellex Group, Inc.], defendant [Banco de Oro] delivered to and defendant Sheriff Urieta took possession and control of the subject stock certificates and shares of stocks. Worse, likewise without the authority and consent of [The Wellex Group, Inc.], defendant Sheriff Urieta is now poised to sell the subject shares of stocks at public auction on 15 May 2009 at 10 o'clock in the morning... .<br><br>15. On the face of the Sheriffs Report and the Notice of Sale, the seizure and intended sale of the subject shares of stocks are anchored on the Amended Writ of Execution dated 19 February 2008 (hereinafter the "Amended Writ") and the Resolution dated 02 April 2009 (hereinafter the "subject Resolution") issued in Criminal Case No. 26558. But the same is misleading.<br><blockquote>15.1 The Amended Writ merely gave authority to defendant Sheriff Urieta to issue a notice of levy on the subject shares of stocks, not to take possession and control much less to sell the same at public auction. . . .<br><br>15.2 Assuming <i>ex gratia argument</i> that the Amended Writ authorized defendant Sheriff Urieta to take possession and control of the subject stock certificates and shares of stock, the same is patently null and void and, hence, of no effect because:<br><blockquote>15.2.1 The Sandiganbayan Decision dated 12 September 2007, which the Amended Writ was supposed to implement, never authorized anyone to take possession and control of the subject shares of stock much less to sell the same. Hence, the Amended Writ varied the terms of the 12 September 2007 Sandiganbayan Decision....<br><br>15.2.2 Notably, it was issued in Criminal Case No. 26558 <b>despite the absence of plaintiff who is an indispensable party with respect to the subject shares of stocks.</b> Hence, it was issued in violation of plaintiff s right to due process.</blockquote>15.3 The subject Resolution merely authorized the issuance of another Notice to Deliver to defendant BDO for the delivery to the Sandiganbayan of the amount of PhP 189,700,000.00, inclusive of interest and income earned, covered by the IMA Account. <b>It did not authorize Sheriff Urieta to take control and possession of the subject shares of stocks, much less to sell the same at public auction</b>. . . .<br><br>15.4 The subject shares of stocks have never been foreclosed and, as such, the ownership thereof still pertains to plaintiff. In other words, the subject shares of stocks do not form part of the IMA Account and may not be validly levied upon.<br><br>15.5 In fact, the Chattel Mortgage on the subject shares of stocks has already been nullified as a result of the settlement of [The Wellex Group, Inc.'s] loan obligations. Hence, there is absolutely no basis to claim that the subject shares of stocks are part of the IMA Account that may properly be subject of execution.</blockquote><br>16. Moreover, defendant Sheriff Urieta has also failed to comply with the legal requirements for the sale of the subject shares of stocks at public auction. As such, any sale of the same is a nullity.<br><br>17. Defendant [Banco de Oro] acted in bad faith and in breach of its obligations in delivering the subject stock certificates to defendant Sheriff Urieta, since the subject shares of stocks are registered in the name of [The Wellex Group, Inc.], coupled with the fact that [The Wellex Group, Inc.] was never declared in default and the subject stock certificates have never been foreclosed. In the event that the subject shares of stock may no longer be recovered by [The Wellex Group, Inc.], defendant [Banco de Oro] should be held liable to [The Wellex Group, Inc.] for the value of the subject shares of stocks.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[82]</sup></font> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>The application for temporary restraining order was heard on May 12, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> During the hearing, Sheriff Urieta agreed to postpone the public sale scheduled on May 15, 2009 until the trial court resolved whether or not to grant the provisional remedies prayed for by the Wellex Group, Inc.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> <br><br>On May 18, 2009, Banco de Oro filed a Motion to Dismiss/Opposition to the Application for a Writ of Preliminary Injunction<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> based on four (4) grounds.

To conceal the true nature of a property as unlawfully acquired, a public officer may have transferred to third persons the title to the property. The transferees—whether they are dummies, nominees, agents, subordinates, business associates, or innocent purchasers for value—may challenge the inclusion of their properties under their title and argue that the properties legitimately belong to them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> <br><br>Petitioner argues that its Complaint for recovery of possession of the Waterfront shares is in the nature of a third-party claim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> Also known as <i>terceria</i>, a third-party claim is the remedy available to persons other than the judgment obligor who claim title to or the right to possess the property levied.<br><br>Under Rule 39, Section 16 of the Rules of Court, a third-party claim must be filed <i><b>before the court issuing the writ of execution.</b></i> The reason is that a court, once it acquires jurisdiction, retains this jurisdiction until it enforces and executes its decision. Consistent with the doctrine of adherence of jurisdiction, Rule 39, Section 16 provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 16.</b> <i>Proceedings where property claimed by third person.—</i> If the property levied on is claimed by any person other than the judgment obligor or his agent, and such person makes an affidavit of his title thereto or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds of such right or title, and serves the same upon the officer making the levy and a copy thereof upon the judgment obligee, the officer shall not be bound to keep the property, unless such judgment obligee, on demand of the officer, files a bond approved by the court to indemnify the third-party claimant in a sum not less than the value of the property levied on. In case of disagreement as to such value, the same shall be determined <i><b>by the court issuing the writ of execution.</b></i> No claim for damages for the taking or keeping of the property may be enforced against the bond unless the action therefor is filed within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the filing of the bond.<br><br>The officer shall not be liable for damages for the taking or keeping of the property, to any third-party claimant if such bond is filed. Nothing herein contained shall prevent such claimant or any third person from vindicating his claim to the property in a separate action, or prevent the judgment obligee from claiming damages in the same or a separate action against a third-party claimant who filed a frivolous or plainly spurious claim.<br><br>When the writ of execution is issued in favor of the Republic of the Philippines, or any officer duly representing it, the filing of such bond shall not be required, and in case the sheriff or levying officer is sued for damages as a result of the levy, he shall be represented by the Solicitor General and if held liable therefor, the actual damages adjudged by the court shall be paid by the National Treasurer out of such funds as may be appropriated for the purpose. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Proceeding from these premises, any third-party claim involving property forfeited <i><b>pursuant to a plunder decision</b></i> must be filed before the Sandiganbayan, this despite the fact that third-party claim involves issues of ownership or possession—matters that are considered civil in nature.<br><br>Aware that third-party claims involving forfeited properties may involve questions of ownership or possession, the legislature nevertheless vested in the Sandiganbayan jurisdiction over prosecutions for plunder,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[148]</sup></font> the penalty for which includes the forfeiture of all the assets of the accused which are found to be ill-gotten.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> "This is line with the purpose behind the creation of the Sandiganbayan as an anti-graft court—to address the urgent problem of dishonesty in public service."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> This is precisely why the Sandiganbayan is a court of special jurisdiction: it is primarily a criminal court, but with jurisdiction over certain civil proceedings.<br><br>Hence, the argument that a third-party claim is civil in nature and may not be taken cognizance of by the Sandiganbayan is incorrect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> Those who claim ownership or possession of properties forfeited by virtue of a plunder decision must intervene in the proceedings before the Sandiganbayan.

In computing the Investment portfolio of the IMA Account, the value of the collaterals SHOULD NOT have been included as they are mere securities to the loan obligation. To compute the value of the PhP500 Million PN together with the value of the collaterals would be tantamount to doubling the amount of the loan obligation. That being the case, how should the WPI and WIN shares be treated?<br><br></li><li>Assuming without conceding that the aforesaid shares are subject of forfeiture pursuant to the 02 April 2009 Resolution, just the same the State may not directly go against the things mortgaged such as in the present case. It is well settled that if the debtor fails to comply with an obligation, the creditor is merely entitled to move for the sale of the thing mortgaged with the formalities required by law in order to collect the amount of his claim from the proceeds and the prohibition against pactum commissorium forbids creditors to automatically appropriate the pledged or mortgaged properties. In which case, how would the State proceed with the shares of WPI and WIN?<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</li></ol></li></ol></blockquote><br>Petitioner made the same contention in its Complaint for recovery of possession before the Regional Trial Court of Makati:<br><br><blockquote>15.4.
