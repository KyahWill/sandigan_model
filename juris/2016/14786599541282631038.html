That RESPONDENT, ATTY. JUSTO J.

That in spite of the pendency of the "PETITION FOR annulment of OCT NOS. 32360, 32361, 32362, and 33476 and DAMAGES" proceedings, which is pending before the Regional Trial Court Branch 45, Bais City, respondent, ATTY. JUSTO J.

JUSTO J. PARAS was fully aware that the subject real properties WERE NOT OWNED BY HIM, and he DID NOT HAVE ANY ACTUAL PHYSICAL POSSESSION of the subject real properties;<br><br>5. That the <u><b>AUTHORIZATION issued to EDNA MIJARES by respondent, is a GROSS MISREPRESENTATION, and this had caused innocent barrio folks of Barangay Matobato, Bindoy, Negros Oriental to pay P500.00 to Edna Mijares, in view of the false promise that they will be included as DAR beneficiaries, even if they were not tenants or residing in the subject property;</b></u><br>....<br><br><b>7.

That under ... [the] Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law . . . the implementation of the law under C[omprehensive] A[graria]n R[eform] P[rogram] on private properties is under two (2) modes, namely:<br><br>1) Compulsory Acquisition by DAR (Sec. 16, CARL), or 2) Voluntary Offer of Sale (VOS, under Sees. 19 &amp; 20, RA 6657). Under Mode 1, DAR on its own initiative listing and documentation compulsorily covers usually big real properties owned by a single landowner in a given community thru service of its "NOTICE OF COVERAGE". The other Mode 2 covers properties offered for sale under VOS by landowner. The pursuit of whichever mode of acquisition is left to the discretion of DAR unless offer is made.<br><br>Respondent's CARP coverage is thru the COMPULSORY MODE. This is evidenced by ... a "NOTICE OF COVERAGE" of DAR- sent by DAR to Respondent informing him of the extent of coverage of compulsory acquisition by DAR with listing (initial) of his real properties covered. In fact Respondent had been informed that following or subsequent "NOTICE OF COVERAGE" shall include or involve properties not covered by titles or under tax declarations only, real properties which respondent owned in Bindoy as well as in the neighboring municipalities of Ayungon and Mabinay, all in the province of Negros Oriental.<br><br>It being a compulsory coverage process initiated, pursued and documented primarily by DAR, the listing of all real properties titled, covered only by tax declarations or possessed by Respondent are all the workings of DAR.

Respondent has been deplorably lacking in the candor required of him as a member of the Bar and an officer of the court in his acts of <i>applying for the issuance of a free patent over the properties in issue despite his knowledge that the same had already been sold by his mother to complainant's sister</i>.&nbsp; This fact, respondent even admitted in the comment that he filed before this Court when he alleged that the said properties were public land under the Forestal Zone "when the mother of the respondent ceded to Aurora Yap some portions of entire occupancy of the Parases."

Although deceit and misrepresentation are present in both <i>Yap-Paras</i> and in this case, the surrounding circumstances are different. In <i>Yap-Paras</i>, deceit and misrepresentation were used to apply for the issuance of a free patent. On the other hand, in this case, they were used for a voluntary offer of land for Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program coverage. The application for the issuance of a free patent and the voluntary offer of property for Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program coverage are distinct from one another and are not prerequisites of each other. His offense in the previous case is separate and distinct from this case, for which he is sanctioned anew.<br><br>Respondent has already been sanctioned three (3) times. The dispositive portion of Paras, which was dated October 17, 2000, reads:<br><br><blockquote>In the light of the foregoing, <i>respondent is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for SIX (6) MONTHS on the charge of falsifying his wife's signature in bank documents and other related loan instruments; and for ONE (1) YEAR from the practice of law on the charges of immorality and abandonment of his own family</i>, the penalties to be served simultaneously.
