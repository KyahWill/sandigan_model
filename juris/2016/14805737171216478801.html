Section 234 of the Local Government Code exempts all real property owned by cooperatives without distinction. Nothing in the law suggests that the real property tax exemption only applies when the property is used by the cooperative itself. Similarly, the instance that the real property is leased to either an individual or corporation is not a ground for withdrawal of tax exemption.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In arguing the first issue, petitioner hinges its claim on a misplaced reliance in Mactan, which refers to the revocation of tax exemption due to the effectivity of the Local Government Code. However, Mactan does not refer to the tax exemption extended to cooperatives. The portion that petitioner cited specifically mentions that the exemption granted to cooperatives has not been withdrawn by the effectivity of the Local Government Code:<br><br><blockquote>[S]ection 232 must be deemed to qualify Section 133.<br><br>Thus, reading together Sections 133, 232, and 234 of the L[ocal] G[overnment] C[ode], we conclude that as a general rule, as laid down in Section 133, the taxing powers of local government units cannot extend to the levy of,<i> inter alia,</i> "taxes, fees and charges of any kind on the National Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and local government units"; however, pursuant to Section 232, provinces, cities, and municipalities in the Metropolitan Manila Area may impose the real property tax except on,<i> inter alia</i>, "real property owned by the Republic of the Philippines or any of its political subdivisions except when the beneficial use thereof has been granted, for consideration or otherwise, to a taxable person," as provided in item (a) of the first paragraph of Section 234.<br><br>As to tax exemptions or incentives granted to or presently enjoyed by natural or juridical persons, including government-owned and controlled corporations, Section 193 of the L[ocal] G[overnment] C[ode] prescribes the general rule, <i>viz</i>., they are <i>withdrawn</i> upon the effectivity of the L[ocal] G[overnment] C[ode], <i>except</i> those granted to local water districts, cooperatives duly registered under R.A. No. 6938, non-stock and non-profit hospitals and educational institutions, and unless otherwise provided in the L[ocal] Gfovernment] C[ode]. The latter proviso could refer to Section 234 which enumerates the properties exempt from real property tax. But the last paragraph of Section 234 further qualifies the retention of the exemption insofar as real property taxes are concerned by limiting the retention only to those enumerated therein; all others not included in the enumeration lost the privilege upon the effectivity of the L[ocal] G[overnment] C[ode]. <i>Moreover, even as to real property owned by the Republic of the Philippines or any of its political subdivisions covered by item (a) of the first paragraph of Section 234, the exemption is withdrawn if the beneficial use of such property has been granted to a taxable person for consideration or otherwise.</i><br><br>Since the last paragraph of Section 234 unequivocally withdrew, upon the effectivity of the L[ocal] G[overnment] C[ode], exemptions from payment of real property taxes granted to natural or juridical persons, including government-owned or controlled corporations, except as provided in the said section, and the petitioner is, undoubtedly, a government-owned corporation, <i>it necessarily follows that its exemption from such tax granted it in Section 14 of its Charter, R.A. No. 6958, has been withdrawn. Any claim to the contrary can only be justified if the petitioner can seek refuge under any of the exceptions provided in Section 234, but not under Section 133, as it now asserts, since, as shown above, the said section is qualified by Sections 232 and 234.</i><br><br>In short, the petitioner can no longer invoke the general rule in Section 133 that the taxing powers of the local government units cannot extend to the levy of:<br><br><blockquote>(o) taxes, fees or charges of any kind on the National Government, its agencies or instrumentalities, and local government units.</blockquote><br>It must show that the parcels of land in question, which are real property, are any one of those enumerated in Section 234, either by virtue of ownership, character, or use of the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The roads that respondent constructed within the leased area should not be assessed with real property taxes. <i>Bislig Bay</i> finds application here.

But as to whether the same is taxable under the aforequoted provision of the Assessment Law, this question has already been answered in the negaitive by this Court. In the case of Bislig Bay Lumber Co., Inc. vs. Provincial Government of Surigao, where a similar issue was raised. . ..<br>. . . .<br><br>. . .<i> What is emphasized in the Bislig case is that the improvement is exempt from taxation because it is an integral part of the public land on which it is constructed and the improvement is the property of the government by right of accession. Under Section 3(a) of the Assessment Law, all properties owned by the government, without any distinction, are exempt from taxation</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>The roads that respondent constructed became permanent improvements on the land owned by the NGPI-NGEI by right of accession under the Civil Code, thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>Article 440</b>. The ownership of property gives the right by accession to everything which is produced thereby, or which is <i>incorporated or attached thereto, either naturally or artificially.</i><br>. . . . <br><b>Article 445</b>.

As provided under Article 440 and 445 of the Civil Code, the land is owned by the cooperatives at the time respondent built the roads. Hence, whatever is incorporated in the land, either naturally or artificially, belongs to the NGPI-NGEI as the landowner.<br><br>Although the roads were primarily built for respondent's benefit, the roads were also being used by the members of NGPI and the public.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Furthermore, the roads inured to the benefit of NGPI-NGEI as owners of the land not only by right of accession but through the express provision in the lease agreement:<br><br><blockquote>On March 7, 1990 NGPI Multi-Purpose Cooperative, Inc., as Lessor, and NDC-Guthrie Plantations, Inc., as Lessee, entered into a "Lease Agreement" . . . covering the agricultural lands transferred by NDC to the DAR, which lands the DAR ultimately distributed undivided to qualified workers-beneficiaries. . . .<br>. . . .<br><br>Clause No. 6.3 of the same lease agreement provides that "All taxes due on the improvements on the Leased Property except those improvements on the Area that the LESSOR shall have utilized under Clause 1.2 hereof, shall be for the account of the LESSEE."<br><br>Clause No. 9.4 of the same lease agreement provides that ". . . <i>All fixed and permanent improvements, such as roads and palm trees introduced on the Leased Property, shall automatically accrue to the LESSOR upon termination of this Lease Agreement without need of reimbursement</i>."<br><br>All the above-cited stipulations in the lease agreement between NGPI Multi-Purpose Cooperative and NDC-Guthrie Plantations, Inc. <i>were reconfirmed and reaffirmed in the Addendum to Lease Agreement entered into by and between NGPI Multi-Purpose Cooperative and Filipinas Palmoil Plantations, Inc. on January 30, 1998.</i> . . .

It asserts that although there may be a difference between the meaning of "machinery" under the Local Government Code arid that of immovable property under Article 415(5) of the Civil Code, "the controlling interpretation of Section 199(o) of [the Local Government Code] is the interpretation of Article 415(5) of the Civil Code."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>In <i>Manila Electric Company v. City Assessor</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> a similar issue of which definition of "machinery" prevails to warrant the assessment of real property tax on it was raised.<br><br>Manila Electric Company (MERALCO) insisted on harmonizing the provisions of the Civil Code and the Local Government Code and asserted that "machinery" contemplated under Section 199(o) of the Local Government must still be within the contemplation of immovable property under Article 415 of the Civil Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> However, this Court ruled that harmonizing such laws "would necessarily mean imposing additional requirements for classifying machinery as real property for real property tax purposes not provided for, or even in direct conflict with, the provisions of the Local Government Code."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Thus:<br><br><blockquote>While the Local Government Code still does not provide for a specific definition of "real property," Sections 199(o) and 232 of the said Code, respectively, gives an extensive definition of what constitutes "machinery" and unequivocally subjects such machinery to real property tax. The Court reiterates that the machinery subject to real property tax under the Local Government Code "may or may not be attached, permanently or temporarily to the real property"; and the physical facilities for production, installations, and appurtenant service facilities, those which are mobile, self-powered or self-propelled, or are not permanently attached must (a) be actually, directly, and exclusively used to meet the needs of the particular industry, business, or activity; and (b) by their very nature and purpose, be designed for, or necessary for manufacturing, mining, logging, commercial, industrial, or agricultural purposes.<br>. . . .<br><br>Article 415, paragraph (5) of the Civil Code considers as immovables or real properties "[m]achinery, receptacles, instruments or implements intended by the owner of the tenement for an industry or works which may be carried on in a building or on a piece of land, and which tend directly to meet the needs of the said industry or works." The Civil Code, however, does not define "machinery."<br><br>The properties under Article 415, paragraph (5) of the Civil Code are immovables by destination, or "those which are essentially movables, but by the purpose for which they have been placed in an immovable, partake of the nature of the latter because of the added utility derived therefrom." These properties, including<i> machinery, become immobilized if the following requisites concur: (a) they are placed in the tenement by the owner of such tenement; (b) they are destined for use in the industry or work in the tenement; and (c) they tend to directly meet the needs of said industry or works.</i> The first two requisites are not found anywhere in the Local Government Code.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[92]</sup></font> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Section 199(o) of the Local Government prevails over Article 415(5) of the Civil Code. In Manila Electric Company:<br><br><blockquote><i>As between the Civil Code, a general law governing property and property relations, and the Local Government Code, a special law granting local government units the power to impose real property tax, then the latter shall prevail. As the Court pronounced in Disomangcop v. The Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways Simeon A. Datumanong</i>:<br><blockquote>It is a finely-imbedded principle in statutory construction that a special provision or law prevails over a general one. <i>Lex specialis derogant generali</i>. As this Court expressed in the case of <i>Leveriza v. Intermediate Appellate Court,</i> "another basic principle of statutory construction mandates that <i>general legislation must give way to special legislation on the same subject, and generally be so interpreted as to embrace only cases in which the special provisions are not applicable, that specific statute prevails over a general statute and that where two statutes are of equal theoretical application to a particular case, the one designed therefor specially should prevail</i>."</blockquote><br>The Court also very clearly explicated in <i>Vinzons-Chato v. Fortune Tobacco Corporation</i> that:<br><br><blockquote>A general law and a special law on the same subject are statutes in <i>pari materia </i>and should, accordingly, <i>be read together and harmonized, if possible, with a view to giving effect to both. The rule is that where there are two acts, one of which is special and particular and the other general which, if standing alone, would include the same matter and thus conflict with the special act, the special law must prevail since it evinces the legislative intent more clearly than that of a general statute and must not be taken as intended to affect the more particular and specific provisions of the earlier act, unless it is absolutely necessary so to construe it in order to give its words any meaning at all.</i><br><br>The circumstance that the special law is passed before or after the general act does not change the principle. Where the special law is later, it will be regarded as an exception to, or a qualification of, the prior general act; and where the general act is later, the special statute will be construed as remaining an exception to its terms, unless repealed expressly or by necessary implication.</blockquote>Furthermore, in <i>Caltex (Philippines), Inc. v. Central Board of Assessment Appeals</i>, the Court acknowledged that "[i]t is a familiar phenomenon to see things classed as real property for purposes of taxation which on general principle might be considered personal property[.]"<br><br><i>Therefore, for determining whether machinery is real property subject to real property tax, the definition and requirements under the Local Government Code are controlling</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Respondent is engaged in palm oil plantation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Thus, it harvests fruits from palm trees for oil conversion through its milling plant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> By the nature of respondent's business, transportation is indispensable for its operations.<br><br>Under the definition provided in Section 199(o) of the Local Government Code, the road equipment and the mini haulers are classified as machinery, thus:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 199.<i> Definition of Terms</i>. — When used in this Title, the terra:<br>. . . .<br><br><blockquote>(o) "Machinery" . . . includes the<i><b> physical facilities for production</b></i>, the installations and appurtenant service facilities, <b><i>those which are mobile</i></b>, self-powered or self-propelled, and those not permanently attached to the real property <i><b>which are actually, directly, and exclusively used to meet the needs of the particular industry, business or activity </b></i>and which by their very nature and purpose are designed for, or necessary to its manufacturing, mining, logging, commercial, industrial or agricultural purposes [.] (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote><br>Petitioner is correct in claiming that the phrase pertaining to physical facilities for production is comprehensive enough to include the road equipment and mini haulers as actually, directly, and exclusively used by respondent to meet the needs of its operations in palm oil production.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Moreover, "mini-haulers are farm tractors pulling attached trailers used in the hauling of seedlings during planting season and in transferring fresh palm fruits from the farm [or] field to the processing plant within the plantation area."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> The indispensability of the road equipment and mini haulers in transportation makes it actually, directly, and exclusively used in the operation of respondent's business.<br><br>In its Comment, respondent claims that the equipment is no longer vital to its operation because it is currently employing equipment outside the company to do the task.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> However, respondent never raised this contention before the lower courts.
