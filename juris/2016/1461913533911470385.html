Thus, its basis for liability must be subjected to strict scrutiny.<br><br>Even assuming that we grant the plea of liberality, the Petition will still be denied.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Initially, petitioner was not liable for the Union's claims for labor standard benefits. Its acquisition of Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's assets was not for the purpose of continuing its business. It was to conserve the assets in order to prepare it for privatization.<br><br>When Philippine National Bank ceded its rights and interests over Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's loan to petitioner in 1987, it merely transferred its rights and interests over Bicolandia's <i>outstanding loan obligations</i>. The transfer was not for the purpose of continuing Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's business. Thus, petitioner never became the substitute employer of Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's employees. It would not have been liable for any money claim arising from an employer-employee relationship.<br><br>Section 24 of Proclamation No. 50 states:<br><blockquote><i>The transfer of any asset of government directly to the national government as mandated herein shall be for the purpose of disposition, liquidation and/or privatization only, any import in the covering deed of assignment to the contrary notwithstanding.</i> Such transfer, therefore, shall not operate to revert such assets automatically to the general fund or the national patrimony, and shall not require specific enabling legislation to authorize their subsequent disposition, but shall remain as duly appropriated public properties earmarked for assignment, transfer or conveyance under the signature of the Minister of Finance or his duly authorized representative, who is hereby authorized for this purpose, to any disposition entity approved by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of this Proclamation. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This Court explained in <i>Republic v. National Labor Relations Commission, et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> that the Asset Privatization Trust is usually joined as a party respondent due to its role as the conservator of assets of the corporation undergoing privatization:<br><blockquote>A matter that must not be overlooked is the fact that the inclusion of APT as a respondent in the monetary claims against [Pantranco North Express, Inc.] is merely the consequence of its being a conservator of assets, a role that APT normally plays in, or the relationship that ordinarily it maintains with, corporations identified for and while under privatization. The liability of APT under this particular arrangement, nothing else having been shown, should be co-extensive with the amount of assets taken over from the privatized firm.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote>Pursuant to its mandate under Proclamation No. 50, petitioner provisionally took possession of assets and properties only for the purpose of privatization or disposition. Its interest over Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation was not the latter's continued business operations.<br><br>The issue of petitioner's role in the money claims of Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's employees was already settled in <i>Barayoga v. Asset Privatization Trust</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>In <i>Barayoga</i>, BISUDECO-PHILSUCOR Corfarm Workers Union alleged that when Philippine Sugar Corporation took over Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's operations in 1988, it retained the Corporation's existing employees until the start of the season sometime in May 1991. At the start of the 1991 season, Philippine Sugar Corporation failed to recall some of the union's members back to work. For this reason, it filed a Complaint on July 23, 1991 for unfair labor practice, illegal dismissal, illegal deduction, and underpayment of wages and other labor standard benefits against Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation, Asset Privatization Trust, and Philippine Sugar Corporation. Of the three respondents, only Asset Privatization Trust was held liable by the Labor Arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission for the union members' money claims.<br><br>The Court of Appeals reversed the Labor Arbiter's and the National Labor Relations Commission's rulings and held that Asset Privatization Trust did not become the employer of Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's employees. The terminated employees appealed to this Court, arguing that their claims against Asset Privatization Trust were recognized under the law.<br><br>This Court, however, denied their Petition and held that the Asset Privatization Trust could not be held liable for any money claims arising from an employer-employee relationship. Asset Privatization Trust, being a mere transferee of Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's assets for the purpose of conservation, never became the union's employer. Hence, it could not be liable for their money claims:<br><blockquote><i>The duties and liabilities of BISUDECO, including its monetary liabilities to its employees, were not all automatically assumed by APT as purchaser of the foreclosed properties at the auction sale. Any assumption of liability must be specifically and categorically agreed upon</i>. In <i>Sundowner Development Corp. v. Drilon</i>, the Court ruled that, unless expressly assumed, labor contracts like collective bargaining agreements are not enforceable against the transferee of an enterprise. Labor contracts are in personam and thus binding only between the parties.<br><br><i>No succession of employment rights and obligations can be said to have taken place between the two. Between the employees of BISUDECO and APT, there is no privity of contract that would make the latter a substitute employer that should be burdened with the obligations of the corporation</i>. To rule otherwise would result in unduly imposing upon APT an unwarranted assumption of accounts not contemplated in Proclamation No. 50 or in the Deed of Transfer between the national government and PNB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>For petitioner to be liable for private respondents' money claims arising from an employer-employee relationship, it must specifically and categorically agree to be liable for these claims.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>While petitioner per se is not liable for private respondents' money claims arising from an employer-employee relationship, it voluntarily obliged itself to pay Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's terminated employees separation benefits in the event of the Corporation's privatization.<br><br>In <i>Barayoga</i>, the aggrieved union members were those who were not recalled back to work by Philippine Sugar Corporation during the start of the season in May 1991. The union members in this case were those who were recalled back to work in May 1991 but were eventually served with a Notice of Termination on September 1, 1992.<br><br>The timeline of events in this case mirror that of <i>Barayoga</i>. In <i>Barayoga</i>, Asset Privatization Trust's Board of Trustees issued the Resolution dated September 23, 1992 authorizing the payment of separation pay and other benefits to Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's employees in the event of its privatization:<br><blockquote>In the present case, petitioner-unions members who were not recalled to work by Philsucor in May 1991 seek to hold APT liable for their monetary claims and allegedly illegal dismissal. <i>Significantly, prior to the actual sale of BISUDECO assets to BAPCI on October 30, 1992, the APT board of trustees had approved a Resolution on September 23, 1992. The Resolution authorized the payment of separation benefits to the employees of the corporation in the event of its privatization</i>. Not included in the Resolution, though, were petitioner-unions members who had not been recalled to work in May 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>This Resolution was not made part of the records of this case. However, it is not disputed that the union members here were Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's employees at the time the Corporation was sold to Bicol Agro-Industrial Producers Cooperative, Incorporated-Peñafrancia Sugar Mill. The Labor Arbiter also found that:<br><blockquote>With respect to complainants['] claim for labor standard benefits, records show that they were paid separation pay including 13<sup>th</sup> month pay for the year 1992 as well as conversion of their accrued vacation and sick leave (pp. 698 to 763, rollo) except that some complainants refused to collect their checks representing said benefits whereas the payments due complainants Domulot, de Luna, Falcon, Aguilar, Gomez, Ramos, Arao, de Jesus, Abonite, Bomanlag, and Parro were released by APT to this Arbitration Branch (p. 764), rollo) in compliance with the Alias Writ of Execution issued by then Executive Labor Arbiter Vito C. Bose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br></blockquote>Under Section 27 of Proclamation No. 50, the employer-employee relationship is severed upon the sale or disposition of assets of a company undergoing privatization. This, however, is without prejudice to "benefits incident to their employment or attaching to termination under applicable employment contracts, collective bargaining agreements, and applicable legislation":<br><blockquote>SECTION 27. AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONS. Upon the sale or other disposition of the ownership and/or controlling interest of the government in a corporation held by the Trust, or all or substantially all of the assets of such corporation, the employer-employee relations between the government and the officers and other personnel of such corporations shall terminate by operation of law. None of such officers or employees shall retain any vested right to future employment in the privatized or disposed corporation, and the new owners or controlling interest holders thereof shall have full and absolute discretion to retain or dismiss said officers and employees and to hire the replacement or replacements of any one or all of them as the pleasure and confidence of such owners or controlling interest holders may dictate.<br><br><i>Nothing in this section, however, be construed to deprive said officers and employees of their vested entitlements in accrued or due compensation and other benefits incident to their employment or attaching to termination under applicable employment contracts, collective bargaining agreements, and applicable legislation</i>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>When petitioner's Board of Trustees issued the Resolution dated September 23, 1992, it acknowledged its contractual obligation to be liable for benefits arising from an employer-employee relationship even though, as a mere conservator of assets, it was not supposed to be liable. Under Article III, Section 12(6) of Proclamation No. 50,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Asset Privatization Trust had the power to release claims or settle liabilities, as in this case. When it issued its Resolution dated September 23, 1992, petitioner voluntarily bound itself to be liable for separation benefits to Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's terminated employees.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>Petitioner proposes that even if it is found liable for separation benefits, it cannot be made to pay since Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's closure was due to serious business losses.<br><br>An employer may terminate employment to prevent business losses. Article 298<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> of the Labor Code allows the termination of employees provided that the employer pays the affected employees separation pay of one month or at least one-half month for every month of pay, whichever is higher. The provision states:<br><blockquote><b>Art. 298. Closure of establishment and reduction of personnel.</b> The employer may also terminate the employment of any employee due to the installation of labor-saving devices, redundancy, retrenchment to prevent losses or the closing or cessation of operation of the establishment or undertaking unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this Title, by serving a written notice on the workers and the Ministry of Labor and Employment at least one (1) month before the intended date thereof. In case of termination due to the installation of labor-saving devices or redundancy, the worker affected thereby shall be entitled to a separation pay equivalent to at least his one (1) month pay or to at least one (1) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. In case of retrenchment to prevent losses and in cases of closures or cessation of operations of establishment or undertaking not due to serious business losses or financial reverses, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher. A fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered one (1) whole year.<br></blockquote>The employer is exempted from having to pay separation pay if the closure was due to serious business losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> A business suffers from serious business losses when it has operated at a loss for such a period of time that its financial standing is unlikely to improve in the future.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation incurred heavy loans from Philippine National Bank in the 1980s to cover its losses. The Corporation's losses were substantial. When Philippine National Bank transferred its interests over the Corporation's loans to petitioner, it effectively transferred all of the Corporation's assets. Petitioner eventually sold these assets and properties to a private company, pursuant to its mandate to dispose of government's non-performing assets.<br><br>Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's financial standing when petitioner took over as its conservator clearly showed that it was suffering from serious business losses and would have been exempted from paying its terminated employees their separation pay. This exemption, however, only applies to <i>employers</i>. It does not apply to petitioner.<br><br>Even assuming that petitioner became NACUSIP/BISUDECO's substitute employer, the exemption would still not apply if the employer voluntarily assumes the obligation to pay terminated employees, regardless of the employer's financial situation. In <i>Benson Industries Employees Union-ALU-TUCP v. Benson Industries, Inc.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><blockquote>To reiterate, an employer which closes shop due to serious business losses is exempt from paying separation benefits under Article 297 of the Labor Code for the reason that the said provision explicitly requires the same only when the closure is not due to serious business losses; conversely, the obligation is maintained when the employer's closure is not due to serious business losses. For a similar exemption to obtain against a contract, such as a CBA, the tenor of the parties' agreement ought to be similar to the law's tenor. <i>When the parties, however, agree to deviate therefrom, and unqualifiedly covenant the payment of separation benefits irrespective of the employer's financial position, then the obligatory force of that contract prevails and its terms should be carried out to its full effect</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup>(Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner's Board of Trustees issued the Resolution dated September 23, 1992 authorizing the payment of separation benefits to Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's terminated employees in the event of the Corporation's privatization.

It cannot now claim that it was exempted from paying such benefits due to serious business losses.<br><br><center><b>V</b><br></center><br>Private respondents' claim to their separation benefits has not yet prescribed under Article 291 of the Labor Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Article 291 provides:<br><blockquote><b>Art. 291.

Since the case was appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission, the prescriptive period to claim these benefits began to run only after the Commission's Decision had become final and executory. The refusal to pay these benefits after the Commission's Decision had become final and executory would be "the act constituting a violation of the worker's right to the benefits being claimed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Under Rule VII, Section 14<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> of the New Rules of Procedure of the National Labor Relations Commission,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> decisions of the Commission become final and executory 10 days after the receipt of the notice of decision, order, or resolution. The three-year prescriptive period, therefore, begins from private respondents' receipt of the National Labor Relations Commission Resolution dated June 21, 2002 denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>Since the Complaint, which included the claim for labor benefits, was filed on April 24, 1996, private respondents' claims did not prescribe.<br><br>Further, the Labor Arbiter did not err in ordering the release of separation benefits to private respondents despite their initial refusal to receive them. The Constitution guarantees workers full protection of their rights, including that of "economic security and parity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Article II, Section 18 and Article XIII, Section 3 state:<br><blockquote><center>Article II <br>State Policies<br></center><br>SECTION 18.

Thus, the separation benefits granted to Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation's terminated employees as of September 30, 1992 must be enjoyed by all, including private respondents.<br><br>This case is unique, however, in that though private respondents' separation benefits were already released by petitioner, they refused to collect their checks "on account of their protested dismissal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Their refusal to receive their checks was premised on their Complaint that petitioner's sale of Bicolandia Sugar Development Corporation violated their Collective Bargaining Agreement and was a method of union busting. It was not because of negligence or malice. It was because of their honest belief that their rights as laborers were violated and the grant of separation benefits would not be enough compensation for it. While private respondents' allegations have not been properly substantiated, it would be unjust to deprive them of their rightful claim to their separation benefits.<br><br>Moreover, private respondents' co-complainants<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> were able to collect their checks for their separation benefits during the pendency of the Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> without having to go through the Commission on Audit.<br><br>Under Section 26 of the State Auditing Code, the Commission on Audit has jurisdiction over the settlement of debts and claims "of any sort" against government:<br><blockquote>Section 26. General jurisdiction. <i>The authority and powers of the Commission shall extend to and comprehend all matters relating to auditing procedures, systems and controls, the keeping of the general accounts of the Government</i>, the preservation of vouchers pertaining thereto for a period of ten years, the examination and inspection of the books, records, and papers relating to those accounts; and the audit and settlement of the accounts of all persons respecting funds or property received or held by them in an accountable capacity, <i>as well as the examination, audit, and settlement of all debts and claims of any sort due from or owing to the Government or any of its subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities.</i> The said jurisdiction extends to all government-owned or controlled corporations, including their subsidiaries, and other selfgoverning [sic] boards, commissions, or agencies of the Government, and as herein prescribed, including non-governmental entities subsidized by the government, those funded by donation through the government, those required to pay levies or government share, and those for which the government has put up a counterpart fund or those partly funded by the government. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The purpose of requiring a separate process with the Commission on Audit for money claims against government is under the principle that public funds may only be released upon proper appropriation and disbursement:<br><blockquote>Section 4. Fundamental principles. Financial transactions and operations of any government agency shall be governed by the fundamental principles set forth hereunder, to wit:<br><br>(1) No money shall be paid out of any public treasury or depository except in pursuance of an appropriation law or other specific statutory authority.<br><br>(2) Government funds or property shall be spent or used solely for public purposes.<br><br>(3) Trust funds shall be available and may be spent only for the specific purpose for which the trust was created or the funds received.<br><br>(4) Fiscal responsibility shall, to the greatest extent, be shared by all those exercising authority over the financial affairs, transactions, and operations of the government agency.<br><br>(5) Disbursements or disposition of government funds or property shall invariably bear the approval of the proper officials.<br><br>(6) Claims against government funds shall be supported with complete documentation.<br><br>(7) All laws and regulations applicable to financial transactions shall be faithfully adhered to.<br><br>(8) Generally accepted principles and practices of accounting as well as of sound management and fiscal administration shall be observed, provided that they do not contravene existing laws and regulations.<br></blockquote>Money claims against government include money judgments by courts, which must be brought before the Commission on Audit before it can be satisfied. Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 10-2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> states the rationale for requiring claimants to file their money judgments before the Commission on Audit:<br><blockquote><center>Republic of the Philippines<br>Supreme Court<br>Manila<br></center><br>ADMINISTRATIVE CIRCULAR NO. 10-2000<br>TO : All Judges of Lower Courts<br>SUBJECT : Exercise of Utmost Caution, Prudence and Judiciousness in the Issuance of Writs of Execution to Satisfy Money Judgments Against Government Agencies and Local Government Units<br><br>In order to prevent possible circumvention of the rules and procedures of the Commission on Audit, judges are hereby enjoined to observe utmost caution, prudence and judiciousness in the issuance of writs of execution to satisfy money judgments against government agencies and local government units.<br><br>Judges should bear in mind that in <i>Commissioner of Public Highways v. San Diego</i> (31 SCRA 617, 625 [1970]), this Court explicitly stated:<br><br><i>The universal rule that where the State gives its consent to be sued by private parties either by general or special law, it may limit claimant's action 'only up to the completion of proceedings anterior to the stage of execution' and that the power of the Courts ends when the judgment is rendered, since government funds and properties may not be seized under writs of execution or garnishment to satisfy such judgments, is based on obvious considerations of public policy. Disbursements of public funds must be covered by the corresponding appropriation as required by law. The functions and public services rendered by the State cannot be allowed to be paralyzed or disrupted by the diversion of public funds from their legitimate and specific objects, as appropriated by law.</i><br><br>Moreover, it is settled jurisprudence that upon determination of State liability, the prosecution, enforcement or satisfaction thereof must still be pursued in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down in P.D. No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines (<i>Department of Agriculture v. NLRC</i>, 227 SCRA 693, 701-02 [1993] citing <i>Republic vs. Villasor</i>, 54 SCRA 84 [1973]). All money claims against the Government must first be filed with the Commission on Audit which must act upon it within sixty days. Rejection of the claim will authorize the claimant to elevate the matter to the Supreme Court on certiorari and in effect sue the State thereby (P.D. 1445, Sections 49-50). . . .

Morales</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> while entitlement to claims for rice allowance, meal allowance, medical/dental/optical allowance, children's allowance, and longevity pay under Republic Act No. 6758 may be adjudicated by the trial court, a separate action must be filed before the Commission on Audit for the satisfaction of the judgment award.<br><br>Similarly, in <i>Lockheed Detective and Watchman Agency v. University of the Philippines</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> this Court reimbursed to the University of the Philippines its funds that were garnished upon orders of the National Labor Relations Commission for the satisfaction of a judgment award. The reimbursement was on the ground that the money claim must first be filed before the Commission on Audit.<br><br>The situation in this case, however, is different from these previous cases.

This would account for why private respondents' co-complainants were able to claim their checks without need of filing a separate claim before the Commission on Audit.<br><br>In this instance, private respondents' separation benefits may be released to them without filing a separate money claim before the Commission on Audit.
