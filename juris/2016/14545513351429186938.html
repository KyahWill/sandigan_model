The penalty imposed on petitioner by the trial court is material in determining the mode of appeal to this court. A petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 must be differentiated from appeals under Rule 124, Section 13<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> involving cases where the lower court imposed on the accused the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> life imprisonment, or, previously, death.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>In <i>Mercado v.

A question of fact exists when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts or when the query invites calibration of the whole evidence considering mainly the credibility of the witnesses, the existence and relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances as well as their relation to each other and to the whole, and the probability of the situation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Concomitantly, factual findings of the lower courts as affirmed by the Court of Appeals are binding on this court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>In contrast, an appeal in a criminal case "throws the whole case open for review[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> The underlying principle is that errors in an appealed judgment, even if not specifically assigned, may be corrected <i>motu propio</i> by the court if the consideration of these errors is necessary to arrive at a just resolution of the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Nevertheless, "the right to appeal is neither a natural right nor a part of due process, it being merely a statutory privilege which may be exercised only in the manner provided for by law[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br><center>II<br></center><br>Petitioner argues that the firearms found in his bag were not his. Thus, he could not be liable for possessing the contraband. Key to the resolution of this case is whether petitioner possessed firearms without the necessary authorization from the Commission on Elections. Petitioner was charged under special laws: Republic Act No. 8294 and Commission on Elections Resolution No. 7764, in relation to Section 261 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881.<br><br>The law applicable is Section 2(a) of Commission on Elections Resolution No. 7764, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 2.

Given the circumstances obtaining here, we find the search conducted by the airport authorities reasonable and, therefore, not violative of his constitutional rights. Hence, when the search of the box of <i>piaya</i> revealed several marijuana fruiting tops, appellant is deemed to have been caught in <i>flagrante delicto</i>, justifying his arrest even without a warrant under Section 5(a), Rule 113 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.

With increased concern over airplane hijacking and terrorism has come increased security at the nation's airports. Passengers attempting to board an aircraft routinely pass through metal detectors; their carry-on baggage as well as checked luggage are routinely subjected to x-ray scans.<i> Should these procedures suggest the presence of suspicious objects, physical searches are conducted to determine what the objects are.</i> There is little question that such searches are reasonable, given their minimal intrusiveness, the gravity of the safety interests involved, and the reduced privacy expectations associated with airline travel.<i> Indeed, travelers are often notified through airport public address systems, signs and notices in their airline tickets that they are subject to search and, if any prohibited materials or substances are found, such would be subject to seizure. These announcements place passengers on notice that ordinary constitutional protections against warrantless searches and seizures do not apply to routine airport procedures.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>This rationale was reiterated more recently in <i>Sales v.

At this point, petitioner already submitted himself and his belongings to inspection by placing his bag in the x-ray scanning machine.<br><br>The presentation of petitioner's bag for x-ray scanning was voluntary. Petitioner had the choice of whether to present the bag or not. He had the option not to travel if he did not want his bag scanned or inspected. X-ray machine scanning and actual inspection upon showing of probable cause that a crime is being or has been committed are part of reasonable security regulations to safeguard the passengers passing through ports or terminals. Probable cause is:<br><br><blockquote>reasonable ground of suspicion supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to induce a cautious man to believe that the person accused is guilty of the offense charged. It refers to the existence of such facts and circumstances that can lead a reasonably discreet and prudent man to believe that an offense has been committed, and that the items, articles or objects sought in connection with said offense or subject to seizure and destruction by law are in the place to be searched.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup></blockquote><br>It is not too burdensome to be considered as an affront to an ordinary person's right to travel if weighed against the safety of all passengers and the security in the port facility.<br><br>As one philosopher said, the balance between authority and an individual's liberty may be confined within the harm that the individual may cause others. John Stuart Mill's "harm principle" provides:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to someone else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup></blockquote><br>Any perceived curtailment of liberty due to the presentation of person and effects for port security measures is a permissible intrusion to privacy when measured against the possible harm to society caused by lawless persons.<br><br><center>V<br></center><br>A third point of intrusion to petitioner's right to privacy occurred during petitioner's submission to port security measures.

The facts show that PNP installed the checkpoint at about five o'clock in the afternoon of 13 January 1992. The search was made soon thereafter, or thirty minutes later. It was not shown that news of impending checkpoints without necessarily giving their locations, and the reason for the same have been announced in the media to forewarn the citizens. Nor did the informal checkpoint that afternoon carry signs informing the public of the purpose of its operation. <i>As a result, motorists passing that place did not have any inkling whatsoever about the reason behind the instant exercise. With the authorities in control to stop and search passing vehicles, the motorists did not have any choice but to submit to the PNP's scrutiny. Otherwise, any attempt to turnabout albeit innocent would raise suspicion and provide probable cause for the police to arrest the motorist and to conduct an extensive search of his vehicle.</i><br><br>In the case of petitioner, only his driver was at the car at that time it was stopped for inspection. As conceded by COMELEC, driver Arellano did not know the purpose of the checkpoint. In the face of fourteen (14) armed policemen conducting the operation, driver Arellano being alone and a mere employee of petitioner could not have marshalled the strength and the courage to protest against the extensive search conducted in the vehicle. In such scenario, the "implied acquiescence," if there was any, could not be more than a mere passive conformity on Arellano's part to the search, and "consent" given under intimidating or coercive circumstances is no consent within the purview of the constitutional guaranty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>We also cannot subscribe to petitioner's argument that there was no . valid consent to the search because his consent was premised on his belief that there were no prohibited items in his bag.

Here, the facts reveal that the search was part of routine port security measures. The search was not conducted by persons authorized under customs law. It was also not motivated by the provisions of the Tariff and Customs Code or other customs laws. Although customs searches usually occur within ports or terminals, it is important that the search must be for the enforcement of customs laws.<br><br><center>VII</center><br>In violations of the Gun Ban, the accused must be "in possession of a firearm . . . outside of his residence within the period of the election gun ban imposed by the COMELEC <i>sans</i> authority[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup><br><br>In <i>Abenes v.

The firearms were found inside petitioner's bag. Petitioner did not present any valid authorization to carry the firearms outside his residence during the period designated by the Commission on Elections. He was carrying the firearms in the Cebu Domestic Port, which was a public place.<br><br>However, petitioner raised the following circumstances in his defense: (1) that he was a frequent traveler and was, thus, knowledgeable about the security measures at the terminal; (2) that he left his bag with a porter for a certain amount of time; and (3) that he voluntarily put his bag on the x-ray machine for voluntary inspection. All these circumstances were left uncontested by the prosecution.<br><br>This court is now asked to determine whether these circumstances are sufficient to raise reasonable doubt on petitioner's guilt.<br><br>When petitioner claimed that someone planted the illegal firearms in his bag, the burden of evidence to prove this allegation shifted to him. The shift in the burden of evidence does not equate to the reversal of the presumption of innocence. In <i>People v. Villanueva,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> this court discussed the difference between burden of proof and burden of evidence, and when the burden of evidence shifts to the accused:<br><br><blockquote>Indeed, in criminal cases, the prosecution bears the onus to prove beyond reasonable doubt not only the commission of the crime but likewise to establish, with the same quantum of proof, the identity of the person or persons responsible therefor. <i>This burden of proof does not shift to the defense but remains in the prosecution throughout the trial. However, when the prosecution has succeeded in discharging the burden of proof</i> by presenting evidence sufficient to convince the court of the truth of the allegations in the information or has established a prima facie case against the accused, <i>the burden of evidence shifts to the accused making it incumbent upon him to adduce evidence in order to meet and nullify, if not to overthrow, that prima facie case.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><br>Petitioner failed to negate the prosecution's evidence that he had <i>animus possidendi</i> or the intent to possess the illegal firearms. In <i>People v. De Gracia</i>, this court elucidated on the concept of animus <i>possidendi</i> and the importance of the intent to commit an act prohibited by law as differentiated from criminal intent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup> The accused was charged with the qualified offense of illegal possession of firearms in furtherance of rebellion under Presidential Decree No. 1866 resulting from the <i>coup d'etat</i> staged in 1989 by the Reform Armed Forces Movement - Soldiers of the Filipino People.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> This court held that the actions of the accused established his intent to possess the illegal firearms:<br><br><blockquote>When the crime is punished by a special law, as a rule, intent to commit the crime is not necessary. It is sufficient that the offender has the intent to perpetrate the act prohibited by the special law. I<i>ntent to commit the crime and intent to perpetrate the act must be distinguished. A person may not have consciously intended to commit a crime; but he did intend to commit an act, and that act is, by the very nature of things, the crime itself. In the first (intent to commit the crime), there must be criminal intent; in the second (intent to perpetrate the act) it is enough that the prohibited act is done freely and consciously.</i><br><br>In the present case, a distinction should be made between criminal intent and intent to possess. <i>While mere possession, without criminal intent, is sufficient to convict a person for illegal possession of a firearm, it must still be shown that there was animus possidendi or an intent to possess on the part of the accused. </i>Such intent to possess is, however, without regard to any other criminal or felonious intent which the accused may have harbored in possessing the firearm. Criminal intent here refers to the intention of the accused to commit an offense with the use of an unlicensed firearm. This is not important in convicting a person under Presidential Decree No. 1866. <i>Hence, in order that one may be found guilty of a violation of the decree, it is sufficient that the accused had no authority or license to possess a firearm, and that he intended to possess the same, even if such possession was made in good faith and without criminal intent.<br><br>Concomitantly, a temporary, incidental, casual, or harmless possession or control of a firearm cannot be considered a violation of a statute prohibiting the possession of this kind of weapon, such as Presidential Decree No. 1866. Thus, although there is physical or constructive possession, for as long as the animus possidendi is absent, there is no offense committed.</i><br><br>Coming now to the case before us, there is no doubt in our minds that appellant De Gracia is indeed guilty of having intentionally possessed several firearms, explosives and ammunition without the requisite license or authority therefor. Prosecution witness Sgt. Oscar Abenia categorically testified that he was the first one to enter the Eurocar Sales Office when the military operatives raided the same, and he saw De Gracia standing in the room and holding the several explosives marked in evidence as Exhibits D to D-4. At first, appellant denied any knowledge about the explosives. Then, he alternatively contended that his act of guarding the explosives for and in behalf of Col. Matillano does not constitute illegal possession thereof because there was no intent on his part to possess the same, since he was merely employed as an errand boy of Col. Matillano. His pretension of impersonal or indifferent material possession does not and cannot inspire credence.<br><br><i>Animus possidendi is a state of mind which may be determined on a case to case basis, taking into consideration the prior and coetaneous acts of the accused and the surrounding circumstances. What exists in the realm of thought is often disclosed in the range of action.</i> It is not controverted that appellant De Gracia is a former soldier, having served with the Philippine Constabulary prior to his separation from the service for going on absence without leave (AWOL). We do not hesitate, therefore, to believe and conclude that he is familiar with and knowledgeable about the dynamites, "molotov" bombs, and various kinds of ammunition which were confiscated by the military from his possession. As a former soldier, it would be absurd for him not to know anything about the dangerous uses and power of these weapons. A fortiori, he cannot feign ignorance on the import of having in his possession such a large quantity of explosives and ammunition. Furthermore, the place where the explosives were found is not a military camp or office, nor one where such items can ordinarily but lawfully be stored, as in a gun store, an arsenal or armory. Even an ordinarily prudent man would be put on guard and be suspicious if he finds articles of this nature in a place intended to carry out the business of selling cars and which has nothing to do at all, directly or indirectly, with the trade of firearms and ammunition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>The disquisition in <i>De Gracia</i> on the distinction between criminal intent and intent to possess, which is relevant to convictions for illegal possession of firearms, was reiterated in <i>Del Rosario v.

We cannot accept that an average reasonable person aware of travel security measures would leave his belongings with a stranger for a relatively long period of time. Also, records show that petitioner had only (1) bag. There was no evidence to show that a robust young man like petitioner would have been need of the porter’s services. The defense did not identify nor present this porter with whom petitioner left his bag.<br><br><center>VIII<br></center><br>The trial court was correct when it dismissed Criminal Case No. CBU-80084 for violation of Republic Act no. 8294, otherwise known as illegal possession of firearms.

Puno, En Banc], this court explained the doctrine of fruit of the poisonous tree as adopted in this jurisdiction: "We have not only constitutionalized the Miranda warnings in our jurisdiction. We have also adopted the libertarian exclusionary rule known as the 'fruit of the poisonous tree,' a phrase minted by Mr. Justice Felix Frankfurter in the celebrated case of <i>Nardone v. United States</i>. According to this rule, once the primary source (the 'tree') is shown to have been unlawfully obtained, any secondary or derivative evidence (the 'fruit') derived from it is also inadmissible. Stated otherwise, illegally seized evidence is obtained as a direct result of the illegal act, whereas the 'fruit of the poisonous tree' is the indirect result of the same illegal act. The 'fruit of the poisonous tree' is at least once removed from the illegally seized evidence, but it is equally inadmissible. The rule is based on the principle that evidence illegally obtained by the State should not be used to gain other evidence because the originally illegally obtained evidence taints all evidence subsequently obtained. We applied this exclusionary rule in the recent case of People vs. Salanga, et al., a ponencia of Mr. Justice Regalado. Salanga was the appellant in the rape and killing of a 15-year old barrio lass. He was, however, illegally arrested. Soldiers took him into custody. They gave him a body search which yielded a lady's underwear. The underwear was later identified as that of the victim. We acquitted Salanga. Among other reasons, we ruled that 'the underwear allegedly taken from the appellant is inadmissible in evidence, being a so-called fruit of the poisonous tree.'"<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> See Pres.
