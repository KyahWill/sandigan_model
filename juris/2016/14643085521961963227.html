				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The plaintiff may first prove the employer's ownership of the vehicle involved in a mishap by presenting the vehicle's registration in evidence. Thereafter, a disputable presumption that the requirements for an employer's liability under Article 2180<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Civil Code have been satisfied will arise. The burden of evidence then shifts to the defendant to show that no liability under Article 2180 has ensued.

She is a real party in interest.<br><br>Rule 3, Section 2 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure defines a real party in interest:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 3. Parties to Civil Actions<br></center><br>. . . .<br><br>SECTION 2. Parties in Interest. — A real party in interest is the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit.

In default of parents or a judicially appointed guardian, the following persons shall exercise substitute parental authority over the child in the order indicated:<br><br>(1) The surviving grandparent, as provided in Art. 214;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>(2) The oldest brother or sister, over twenty-one years of age, unless unfit or disqualified; and<br><br>(3) <i>The child's actual custodian, over twenty-one years of age, unless unfit or disqualified</i>.<br><br>Whenever the appointment or a judicial guardian over the property of the child becomes necessary, the same order of preference shall be observed. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Article 233 of the Family Code provides for the extent of authority of persons exercising substitute parental authority, that is, the same as those of actual parents:<br><blockquote>Art. 233. The person exercising substitute parental authority shall have the <i>same</i> authority over the person of the child as the parents. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Both of Reyes' parents are already deceased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Reyes' paternal grandparents are also both deceased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The whereabouts of Reyes' maternal grandparents are unknown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> There is also no record that Reyes has brothers or sisters. It was under these circumstances that respondent took custody of Reyes when she was a child, assumed the role of Reyes' parents, and thus, exercised substitute parental authority over her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> As Reyes' custodian, respondent exercised the full extent of the statutorily recognized rights and duties of a parent. Consistent with Article 220<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> of the Family Code, respondent supported Reyes' education<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> and provided for her personal needs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> To echo respondent's words in her Complaint, she treated Reyes as if she were her own daughter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Respondent's right to proceed against petitioner, therefore, is based on two grounds.<br><br>First, respondent suffered actual personal loss. With her affinity for Reyes, it stands to reason that when Reyes died, respondent suffered the same anguish that a natural parent would have felt upon the loss of one's child. It is for this injury—as authentic and personal as that of a natural parent—that respondent seeks to be indemnified.<br><br>Second, respondent is capacitated to do what Reyes' actual parents would have been capacitated to do.<br><br>In <i>Metro Manila Transit Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> <i>Tapdasan, Jr. v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and <i>Aguilar, Sr. v. Commercial Savings Bank</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> this court allowed natural parents of victims to recover damages for the death of their children. Inasmuch as persons exercising substitute parental authority have the full range of competencies of a child's actual parents, nothing prevents persons exercising substitute parental authority from similarly possessing the right to be indemnified for their ward's death.<br><br>We note that Reyes was already 18 years old when she died. Having reached the age of majority, she was already emancipated upon her death. While parental authority is terminated upon emancipation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> respondent continued to support and care for Reyes even after she turned 18.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Except for the legal technicality of Reyes' emancipation, her relationship with respondent remained the same. The anguish and damage caused to respondent by Reyes' death was no different because of Reyes' emancipation.<br><br>In any case, the termination of respondent's parental authority is not an insurmountable legal bar that precludes the filing of her Complaint. In interpreting Article 1902<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> of the old Civil Code, which is substantially similar to the first sentence of Article 2176<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> of the Civil Code, this court in <i>The Receiver For North Negros Sugar Company, Inc. v. Ybañez, et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> ruled that brothers and sisters may recover damages, except moral damages, for the death of their sibling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> This court declared that Article 1902 of the old Civil Code (now Article 2176) is broad enough to accommodate even plaintiffs who are not relatives of the deceased, thus:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><blockquote>This Court said: "Article 1902 of the Civil Code declares that any person who by an act or omission, characterized by fault or negligence, causes damage to another shall be liable for the damage done ... a person is liable for damage done to another by any culpable act; and by any culpable act is meant any act which is blameworthy when judged by accepted legal standards. The idea thus expressed is undoubtedly broad enough to include any rational conception of liability for the tortious acts likely to be developed in any society." The word "damage" in said article, comprehending as it does all that are embraced in its meaning, includes any and all damages that a human being may suffer in any and all the manifestations of his life: physical or material, moral or psychological, mental or spiritual, financial, economic, social, political, and religious.<br><br>It is particularly noticeable that Article 1902 stresses the passive subject of the obligation to pay damages caused by his fault or negligence. <i>The article does not limit or specify the active subjects, much less the relation that must exist between the victim of the culpa aquiliana and the person who may recover damages, thus warranting the inference that, in principle, anybody who suffers any damage from culpa aquiliana, <b>whether a relative or not of the victim</b>, may recover damages from the person responsible therefor</i>[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>II</b><br></div><br>Respondent's Complaint is anchored on an employer's liability for quasi-delict provided in Article 2180, in relation to Article 2176 of the Civil Code. Articles 2176 and 2180 read:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 2176. Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage done. Such fault or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is called a quasi-delict and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter.<br><br>. . . . .<br><br>ARTICLE 2180. The obligation imposed by article 2176 is demandable not only for one's own acts or omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one is responsible.<br><br>The father and, in case of his death or incapacity, the mother, are responsible for the damages caused by the minor children who live in their company.<br><br>Guardians are liable for damages caused by the minors or incapacitated persons who are under their authority and live in their company.<br><br>The owners and managers of an establishment or enterprise are likewise responsible for damages caused by their employees in the service of the branches in which the latter are employed or on the occasion of their functions.<br><br><i>Employers shall be liable for the damages caused by their employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their assigned tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business or industry.</i><br><br>The State is responsible in like manner when it acts through a special agent; but not when the damage has been caused by the official to whom the task done properly pertains, in which case what is provided in article 2176 shall be applicable.<br><br>Lastly, teachers or heads of establishments of arts and trades shall be liable for damages caused by their pupils and students or apprentices, so long as they remain in their custody.<br><br>The responsibility treated of in this article shall cease when the persons herein mentioned prove that they observed all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Contrary to petitioner's position, it was not fatal to respondent's cause that she herself did not adduce proof that Bautista acted within the scope of his authority. It was sufficient that Abejar proved that petitioner was the registered owner of the van that hit Reyes.<br><br>The resolution of this case must consider two (2) rules. First, Article 2180's specification that "[e]mployers shall be liable for the damages caused by their employees . . . <i>acting within the scope of their assigned tasks</i>[.]" Second, the operation of the registered-owner rule that registered owners are liable for death or injuries caused by the operation of their vehicles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>These rules appear to be in conflict when it comes to cases in which the employer is also the registered owner of a vehicle. Article 2180 requires proof of two things: first, an employment relationship between the driver and the owner; and second, that the driver acted within the scope of his or her assigned tasks. On the other hand, applying the registered-owner rule only requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendant-employer is the registered owner of the vehicle.<br><br>The registered-owner rule was articulated as early as 1957 in <i>Erezo, et al. v. Jepte</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> where this court explained that the registration of motor vehicles, as required by Section 5(a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> of Republic Act No. 4136, the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, was necessary "not to make said registration the operative act by which ownership in vehicles is transferred, . . . but to permit the use and operation of the vehicle upon any public highway[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Its "main aim . . . is to identify the owner so that if any accident happens, or that any damage or injury is caused by the vehicle on the public highways, responsibility therefor can be fixed on a definite individual, the registered owner."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br><i>Erezo</i> notwithstanding, <i>Castilex Industrial Corporation v. Vasquez, Jr.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> relied on Article 2180 of the Civil Code even though the employer was also the registered owner of the vehicle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The registered-owner rule was not mentioned.<br><br>In <i>Castilex</i>, Benjamin Abad (Abad) was a manager of Castilex Industrial Corporation (Castilex). Castilex was also the registered owner of a Toyota Hi-Lux pick-up truck. While Abad was driving the pick-up truck, it collided with a motorcycle driven by Romeo Vasquez (Vasquez). Vasquez died a few days after. Vasquez's parents filed a case for damages against Abad and Castilex.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Castilex denied liability, arguing that Abad was acting in his private capacity at the time of the accident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>This court absolved Castilex of liability, reasoning that <i>it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove that the negligent employee was acting within the scope of his assigned tasks</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Vasquez's parents failed to prove this.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> This court outlined the process necessary for an employer to be held liable for the acts of its employees and applied the process to the case:<br><blockquote>Under the fifth paragraph of Article 2180, whether or not engaged in any business or industry, an employer is liable for the torts committed by employees within the scope of his assigned tasks. But it is necessary to establish the employer-employee relationship; <i>once this is done, the plaintiff must show, to hold the employer liable, that the employee was acting within the scope of his assigned task when the tort complained of was committed</i>. It is only then that the employer may find it necessary to interpose the defense of due diligence in the selection and supervision of the employee.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Since <i>there is paucity of evidence that ABAD was acting within the scope of the functions entrusted to him</i>, petitioner CASTILEX had no duty to show that it exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in providing ABAD with a service vehicle. Thus, justice and equity require that petitioner be relieved of vicarious liability for the consequences of the negligence of ABAD in driving its vehicle. (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Aguilar, Sr. v. Commercial Savings Bank</i> recognized the seeming conflict between Article 2180 and the registered-owner rule and applied the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>In <i>Aguilar, Sr.</i>, a Mitsubishi Lancer, registered in the name of Commercial Savings Bank and driven by the bank's assistant vice-president Ferdinand Borja, hit Conrado Aguilar, Jr. The impact killed Conrado Aguilar, Jr. His father, Conrado Aguilar, Sr. filed a case for damages against Ferdinand Borja and Commercial Savings Bank. The Regional Trial Court found Commercial Savings Bank solidarity liable with Ferdinand Borja.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>However, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial court's Decision and dismissed the complaint against the bank. <i>The Court of Appeals reasoned that Article 2180 requires the plaintiff to prove that at the time of the accident, the employee was acting within the scope of his or her assigned tasks</i>. The Court of Appeals found no evidence that Ferdinand Borja was acting as the bank's assistant vice-president at the time of the accident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals' ruling was reversed by this court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> <i>Aguilar, Sr.</i> reiterated the following pronouncements made in Erezo in ruling that the bank, <i>as the registered owner of the vehicle</i>, was primarily liable to the plaintiff:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><blockquote>The main aim of motor vehicle registration is to identify the owner so that if any accident happens, or that any damage or injury is caused by the vehicle on the public highways, responsibility therefor can be fixed on a definite individual, the registered owner....<br><br>....<br><br>A victim of recklessness on the public highways is usually without means to discover or identify the person actually causing the injury or damage. He has no means other than by a recourse to the registration in the Motor Vehicles Office to determine who is the owner. The protection that the law aims to extend to him would become illusory were the registered owner given the opportunity to escape liability by disproving his ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, Aguilar, Sr. concluded:<br><blockquote>In our view, respondent bank, as the registered owner of the vehicle, is primarily liable for Aguilar, Jr.'s death. <i>The Court of Appeals erred when it concluded that the bank was not liable simply because (a) petitioner did not prove that Borja was acting as the bank's vice president at the time of the accident</i>; and (b) Borja had, according to respondent bank, already bought the car at the time of the mishap. <i>For as long as the respondent bank remained the registered owner of the car involved in the vehicular accident, it could not escape primary liability for the death of petitioner's son</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Preference for the registered-owner rule became more pronounced in <i>Del Carmen, Jr. v. Bacoy</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><blockquote>Without disputing the factual finding of the [Court of Appeals] that Allan was still his employee at the time of the accident, a finding which we see no reason to disturb, Oscar Jr. contends that <i>Allan drove the jeep in his private capacity and thus, an employer's vicarious liability for the employee's fault under Article 2180 of the Civil Code cannot apply to him</i>.<br><br>The contention is no longer novel. In <i>Aguilar Sr. v. Commercial Savings Bank</i>, the car of therein respondent bank caused the death of Conrado Aguilar, Jr. while being driven by its assistant vice president. <i>Despite Article 2180, we still held the bank liable for damages for the accident as <b>said provision should defer to the settled doctrine concerning accidents involving registered motor vehicles</b>, i.e.</i>, that the registered owner of any vehicle, even if not used for public service, would primarily be responsible to the public or to third persons for injuries caused the latter while the vehicle was being driven on the highways or streets. We have already ratiocinated that:<br><blockquote>The main aim of motor vehicle registration is to identify the owner so that if any accident happens, or that any damage or injury is caused by the vehicle on the public highways, responsibility therefor can be fixed on a definite individual, the registered owner. Instances are numerous where vehicles running on public highways caused accidents or injuries to pedestrians or other vehicles without positive identification of the owner or drivers, or with very scant means of identification. It is to forestall these circumstances, so inconvenient or prejudicial to the public, that the motor vehicle registration is primarily ordained, in the interest of the determination of persons responsible for damages or injuries caused on public highways.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote></blockquote><i>Filcar Transport Services v. Espinas</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> stated that the registered owner of a vehicle can no longer use the defenses found in Article 2180:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><blockquote>Neither can Filcar use the defenses available under Article 2180 of the Civil Code - that the employee acts beyond the scope of his assigned task or that it exercised the due diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage - because the motor vehicle registration law, to a certain extent, modified Article 2180 of the Civil Code by making these defenses unavailable to the registered owner of the motor vehicle. Thus, for as long as Filcar is the registered owner of the car involved in the vehicular accident, it could not escape primary liability for the damages caused to Espinas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Mendoza v. Spouses Gomez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> reiterated this doctrine.<br><br><i>However, Aguilar, Sr., Del Carmen, Filcar</i>, and <i>Mendoza</i> should not be taken to mean that Article 2180 of the Civil Code should be completely discarded in cases where the registered-owner rule finds application.<br><br>As acknowledged in <i>Filcar</i>, there is no categorical statutory pronouncement in the Land Transportation and Traffic Code stipulating the liability of a registered owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> The source of a registered owner's liability is not a distinct statutory provision, but remains to be Articles 2176 and 2180 of the Civil Code:<br><blockquote>While Republic Act No. 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code does not contain any provision on the liability of registered owners in case of motor vehicle mishaps, Article 2176, in relation with Article 2180, of the Civil Code imposes an obligation upon Filcar, as registered owner, to answer for the damages caused to Espinas' car.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, it is imperative to apply the registered-owner rule in a manner that harmonizes it with Articles 2176 and 2180 of the Civil Code. Rules must be construed in a manner that will harmonize them with other rules so as to form a uniform and consistent system of jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> In light of this, the words used in <i>Del Carmen</i> are particularly notable. There, this court stated that Article 2180 "should defer to"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> the registered-owner rule. It never stated that Article 2180 should be totally abandoned.<br><br>Therefore, the appropriate approach is that in cases where both the registered-owner rule and Article 2180 apply, the plaintiff must first establish that the employer is the registered owner of the vehicle in question. Once the plaintiff successfully proves ownership, there arises a disputable presumption that the requirements of Article 2180 have been proven. As a consequence, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to show that no liability under Article 2180 has arisen.<br><br>This disputable presumption, insofar as the registered owner of the vehicle in relation to the actual driver is concerned, recognizes that between the owner and the victim, it is the former that should carry the costs of moving forward with the evidence. The victim is, in many cases, a hapless pedestrian or motorist with hardly any means to uncover the employment relationship of the owner and the driver, or any act that the owner may have done in relation to that employment.<br><br>The registration of the vehicle, on the other hand, is accessible to the public.<br><br>Here, respondent presented a copy of the Certificate of Registration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> of the van that hit Reyes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> The Certificate attests to petitioner's ownership of the van. Petitioner itself did not dispute its ownership of the van. Consistent with the rule we have just stated, a presumption that the requirements of Article 2180 have been satisfied arises. It is now up to petitioner to establish that it incurred no liability under Article 2180. This it can do by presenting proof of any of the following: first, that it had no employment relationship with Bautista; second, that Bautista acted outside the scope of his assigned tasks; or third, that it exercised the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of Bautista.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>On the first, petitioner admitted that Bautista was its employee at the time of the accident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br>On the second, petitioner was unable to prove that Bautista was not acting within the scope of his assigned tasks at the time of the accident. When asked by the court why Bautista was at the place of the accident when it occurred, Sally Bellido, petitioner's accountant and supervisor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> testified that she did not "have the personal capacity to answer [the question]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> and that she had no knowledge to answer it:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">COURT </div></td><td width="2%"><div align="center">: </div></td><td width="92%"><div align="justify">Madam Witness, do you know the reason why your driver, Jimmy Bautista, at around 10:00 o' clock in the morning of July 13, 2000 was in the vicinity of Barangay Marcelo Green, United Parañaque Subdivision 4?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">WITNESS </div></td><td><div align="center">:</div></td><td> <div align="justify">I don't have the personal capacity to answer that, Sir.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q </div></td><td><div align="center">: </div></td><td><div align="justify">So you don't have any knowledge why he was there?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A</div></td><td> <div align="center">:</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Yes, Sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Sally Bellido's testimony does not affect the presumption that Article 2180's requirements have been satisfied. Mere disavowals are not proof that suffice to overturn a presumption. To this end, evidence must be adduced.

Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> emphasized that to establish diligence in the supervision of employees, the issuance of company policies must be coupled with proof of compliance:<br><blockquote><i>Due diligence in the supervision of employees, on the other hand, includes the formulation of suitable rules and regulations for the guidance of employees and the issuance of proper instructions intended for the protection of the public</i> and persons with whom the employer has relations through his or its employees and the imposition of necessary disciplinary measures upon employees in case of breach or as may be warranted to ensure the performance of acts indispensable to the business of and beneficial to their employer. To this, we add that <i>actual implementation</i> and monitoring of <i>consistent compliance</i> with said rules should be the constant concern of the employer, acting through dependable supervisors who should regularly report on their supervisory functions.<br><br>In order that the defense of due diligence in the selection and supervision of employees may be deemed sufficient and plausible, <b><i>it is not enough to emptily invoke the existence of said company guidelines and policies on hiring and supervision</i></b>. As the negligence of the employee gives rise to the presumption of negligence on the part of the employer, the latter has the burden of proving that it has been diligent not only in the selection of employees but also in the actual supervision of their work. <i>The mere allegation of the existence of hiring procedures and supervisory policies, without anything more, is decidedly not sufficient to overcome presumption</i>.<br><br>We emphatically reiterate our holding, as a warning to all employers, that "(t)he mere formulation of various company policies on safety <b><i>without showing that they were being complied with</i></b> is not sufficient to exempt petitioner from liability arising from negligence of its employees. It is incumbent upon petitioner to show that in recruiting and employing the erring driver the recruitment procedures and company policies on efficiency and safety were followed." Paying lip-service to these injunctions or merely going through the motions of compliance therewith will warrant stern sanctions from the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>For failing to overturn the presumption that the requirements of Article 2180 have been satisfied, petitioner must be held liable.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>Petitioner's argument that it should be excused from liability because Bautista was already dropped as a party is equally unmeritorious. The liability imposed on the registered owner is direct and primary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> It does not depend on the inclusion of the negligent driver in the action. Agreeing to petitioner's assertion would render impotent the rationale of the motor registration law in fixing liability on a definite person.<br><br>Bautista, the driver, was not an indispensable party under Rule 3, Section 7<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. Rather, he was a necessary party under Rule 3, Section 8.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> Instead of insisting that Bautista—who was nothing more than a necessary party—should not have been dropped as a defendant, or that petitioner, along with Bautista, should have been dropped, petitioner (as a co-defendant insisting that the action must proceed with Bautista as party) could have opted to file a cross-claim against Bautista as its remedy.<br><br>The 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure spell out the rules on joinder of indispensable and necessary parties. These are intended to afford "a complete determination of all possible issues, not only between the parties themselves but also as regards to other persons who may be affected by the judgment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup><br><br>However, while an exhaustive resolution of disputes is desired in every case, the distinction between indispensable parties and necessary parties delineates a court's capacity to render effective judgment. As defined by Rule 3, Section 7, indispensable parties are "[p]arties in interest without whom no final determination can be had of an action[.]" Thus, their non-inclusion is debilitating: "the presence of indispensable parties is a condition for the exercise of juridical power and when an indispensable party is not before the court, the action should be dismissed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><br>In contrast, a necessary party's presence is not imperative, and his or her absence is not debilitating. Nevertheless, it is preferred that they be included in order that relief may be complete.<br><br>The concept of indispensable parties, as against parties whose inclusion only allows complete relief, was explained in <i>Arcelona v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br><blockquote>An indispensable party is a party who has such an interest in the controversy or subject matter that a final adjudication cannot be made, in his absence, without injuring or affecting that interest, a party who has not only an interest in the subject matter of the controversy, but also has an interest of such nature that a final decree cannot be made without affecting his interest or leaving the controversy in such a condition that its final determination may be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience. It has also been considered that an indispensable party is a person in whose absence there cannot be a determination between the parties already before the court which is effective, complete, or equitable. Further, an indispensable party is one who must be included in an action before it may properly go forward.<br><br>A person is not an indispensable party, however, if his interest in the controversy or subject matter is separable from the interest of the other parties, so that it will not necessarily be directly or injuriously affected by a decree which does complete justice between them. Also, a person is not an indispensable party if his presence would merely permit complete relief between him and those already parties to the action, or if he has no interest in the subject matter of the action. It is not a sufficient reason to declare a person to be an indispensable party that his presence will avoid multiple litigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner's interest and liability is distinct from that of its driver. Regardless of petitioner's employer-employee relationship with Bautista, liability attaches to petitioner on account of its being the registered owner of a vehicle that figures in a mishap. This alone suffices. A determination of its liability as owner can proceed independently of a consideration of how Bautista conducted himself as a driver. While certainly it is desirable that a determination of Bautista's liability be made alongside that of the owner of the van he was driving, his non-inclusion in these proceedings does not absolutely hamper a judicious resolution of respondent's plea for relief.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>The Court of Appeals committed no reversible error when it awarded actual damages to respondent.

(<i>Caravan</i>) is vicariously liable for damages as Jimmy Bautista (<i>Bautista</i>)'s employer.<br><br>I write this Opinion (1) to express my reservation on the reasoning employed in resolving the first issue, and (2) to reflect my view on the interplay between Articles 2176 and 2180 of the Civil Code and the registered owner rule.<br><br>In resolving the first issue, the <i>ponencia</i> reasoned out that Abejar is a real party in interest because she exercised substitute parental authority over the victim, Jesmariane Reyes (<i>Reyes</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Having acted as a parent to Reyes, Abejar suffered actual and personal loss due to her death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Furthermore, Abejar was capacitated to do what Reyes' actual parents would have been capacitated to do.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> In a number of cases, the Court allowed natural parents to recover damages for the death of their children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>I disagree with the <i>ponencia</i>'s reasoning. In my view, Abejar is a <b>real party in interest</b>, not because she exercised substitute parental authority over Reyes, but because she has an interest in claiming actual and exemplary damages from Caravan.<br><br>Parental authority has no bearing on one's status as a real party in interest in a <i>quasi-delict</i> case. Parental authority refers to the rights and obligations which parents have over their children's person and property until their majority age.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> This authority is granted to parents to facilitate the performance of their duties to their children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> If a child has no parents, grandparents, or siblings, the child's actual custodian shall exercise substitute parental authority over him or her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Moreover, the child's emancipation terminates parental authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, real party in interest refers to the person who is entitled to the avails of the suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> He or she stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The interest involved must be personal and not based on another person's rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The fact that Abejar exercised substitute parental authority over Reyes does not translate to Abejar's legal interest to recover damages for Reyes' death. Furthermore, Abejar's parental authority over Reyes ceased when the latter turned eighteen. Thus, at the time of her death, Reyes was no longer under Abejar's parental authority.<br><br>Nevertheless, I agree that Abejar is a real party in interest, because she incurred actual damages when she paid for Reyes' funeral expenses. Courts may also impose exemplary damages, in addition to compensatory damages, if the defendant acted with gross negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In the present case, Bautista's act of leaving Reyes rather than bringing her to a hospital amounts to gross negligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Thus, Abejar may recover these damages from Caravan.<br><br><i>On the second point</i>, I discuss the registered owner rule in relation to Articles 2180 and 2176 of the Civil Code. To stress, I agree that Caravan is directly and primarily liable for damages as Bautista's employer and as the van's registered owner.<br><br>As early as 1957, this Court held in <i>Erezo v. Jepte</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> that a vehicle's <b>registered owner is primarily responsible</b> for the damage caused to another person. The Revised Motor Vehicle Law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> requires vehicles to be registered before they may be used in any public highway. The Court stressed that the main <b>purpose of the registration is to identify the owner</b> so that if any accident happens or damage is caused on the public highways, responsibility can be fixed on a definite individual - the registered owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In <i>Filcar Transport Services v. Espinas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the Court had the opportunity to discuss the interplay between Articles 2176 and 2180 of the Civil Code and the registered owner rule. The Court ruled that the registered owner of a vehicle is deemed the employer of the vehicle's driver.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Thus, the vehicle's registered owner is vicariously liable for the driver's negligent acts pursuant to Articles 2176 and Article 2180 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The vicarious liability remains with the registered owner even when the vehicle had been sold to another person before the accident but the registration has not yet been transferred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The Court emphasized in <i>R. Transport Corporation v. Yu</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> that the employer's liability for the negligent acts of its subordinate is direct and primary.<br><br>Based on the foregoing, I concur with the <i>ponencia</i>'s results.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Reyes' parents and paternal grandparents are dead.
