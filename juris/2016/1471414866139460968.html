Demetrio L. Hilbero was gunned down near his home in Calamba City, Laguna.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The Philippine National Police (PNP) in Calamba City conducted an investigation on the incident. Among the findings were that the shooting was committed by two motorcycle-riding perpetrators and that it was a case of mistaken identity, since other members of the Hilbero family have been found to have conflicts with groups capable of carrying out the killing. The PNP also reported that on 26 December 2007, Atty. Allan S. Hilbero, the victim's son, prepared his Sinumpaang Salaysay claiming that the shooting was committed by Sandy Pamplona, petitioner and two others. The PNP's Criminal Investigation and Detection Group in Cabuyao, Laguna recommended the filing of a criminal case for Murder against petitioner, Sandy Pamplona, Lorenzo Pamplona, and Primo Lopez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In an undated Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> respondent Atty.

Mendoza issued Order No. 08-04<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> designating Assistant Regional State Prosecutor Dominador A. Leyros to investigate I.S. No. 1428-07, <i>Atty.

After the preliminary investigation, on 6 May 2008, the Office of the Regional State Prosecutor, Region IV issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> finding probable cause for the filing of an Information for Murder against Lorenzo Pamplona and Primo Lopez. The charges against petitioner and Sandy Pamplona were dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Atty. Allan S. Hilbero appealed the resolution to the Department of Justice (DOJ), while Lorenzo Pamplona and Primo Lopez also filed their separate petition for review.

Hilbero filed a motion for reconsideration. In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated 30 September 2009, then Secretary of Justice Agnes VST Devanadera (Sec. Devanadera) ordered the prosecution of all four accused, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the motion for reconsideration is hereby GRANTED.

Accordingly, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br><center><b>Special Civil Action Under Rule 65</b><br></center><br>In <i>certiorari</i> proceedings under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the Court's inquiry is limited to determining whether or not the public officer acted without or in excess of his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>As the Court has previously explained:<br><blockquote>A tribunal, board or officer acts without jurisdiction if it/he does not have the legal power to determine the case. There is excess of jurisdiction where, being clothed with the power to determine the case, the tribunal, board or officer oversteps its/his authority as determined by law.

However, we highlight the exceptional nature of that determination."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The Court has always adhered to the general rule upholding the "non­interference by the courts in the exercise by the office of the prosecutor or the Ombudsman of its plenary investigative and prosecutorial powers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The Court "will not ordinarily interfere with the Ombudsman's exercise of his investigatory and prosecutory powers without good and compelling reasons to indicate otherwise."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>This is a recognition of the "initiative and independence inherent in the said Office" which, "beholden to no one, acts as the champion of the people and the preserver of the integrity of the public service."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Thus, for the Court to exercise its powers, petitioner must "demonstrate clearly that the Office of the Ombudsman committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><center><b>Plenary Powers of the Ombudsman</b><br></center><br>The Office of the Ombudsman is "empowered to determine whether there exists reasonable ground to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof and, thereafter, to file the corresponding information with the appropriate courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In its role as "protector of the people," the Office of the Ombudsman has the power and duty "to act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner against public officials" and "to investigate any act or omission of any public official when such act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper, or inefficient."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman provide:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><blockquote><center>Rule II <br>PROCEDURE IN CRIMINAL CASES<br></center><br>Section 1.

Likewise, it has the authority to determine if a preliminary investigation is necessary in the case.<br><br>The Office of the Ombudsman is empowered to determine if there exists probable cause or "whether there exists a reasonable ground to believe that a crime has been committed, and that the accused is probably guilty thereof and, thereafter, to file the corresponding information with the appropriate courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> This determination is done by means of a preliminary investigation. However, "a preliminary investigation is by no means mandatory."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Ombudsman "has full discretion to determine whether a criminal case should be filed, including whether a preliminary investigation is warranted."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Thus, it is still acting within its powers when it finds that preliminary investigation is unnecessary and that the complaint should be dismissed. The Court gives due deference to said decision and will not interfere with such exercise of power.<br><br>The Court emphasizes that the Ombudsman's duty is not only to prosecute but, more importantly, to <b>ensure that justice is served</b>. This means determining, at the earliest possible time, whether the process should continue or should be terminated. The duty includes using all the resources necessary to prosecute an offending public officer where it is warranted, as well as to refrain from placing any undue burden on the parties in the case, or government resources where the same is not.<br><br><center><b>Burden of Proof</b><br></center><br>On which party has the burden to prove allegations in a complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman, the Court has ruled:<br><blockquote>The basic rule is that mere allegation is not evidence and is not equivalent to proof. Charges based on mere suspicion and speculation likewise cannot be given credence. When the complainant relies on mere conjectures and suppositions, and fails to substantiate his allegations, the complaint must be dismissed for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner has the duty to prove by substantial evidence the allegations in his administrative complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The Court reiterates that "on the petitioner lies the burden of demonstrating, plainly and distinctly, all facts essential to establish his right to a writ of <i>certiorari</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> "The burden of proof to show grave abuse of discretion is on petitioner."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> As petitioner for the writ of <i>certiorari</i>, he must "discharge the burden of proving grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Office of the Ombudsman, in accordance with the definition and standards set by law and jurisprudence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's belief does not constitute proof. Neither is it enough to impel action on the part of the Office of the Ombudsman. His conviction that there exists sufficient basis to charge respondent prosecutors - no matter how strong - must be duly supported by evidence. The power to determine whether said allegations would suffice to support a finding of probable cause belongs to the proper authorities designated by law, which in this case, is the Office of the Ombudsman.<br><br>In sum, the Office of the Ombudsman did not act with grave abuse of discretion or in excess of its jurisdiction in issuing the assailed orders.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit.
