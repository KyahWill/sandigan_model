Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> this Court upheld the nullification of Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 7-85 issued by the Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue because it was not in harmony with, or was contrary to, the express provision of Section 230 of 1977 National Internal Revenue Code. Hence, the circular cannot be given weight for to do so would, in effect, amend the statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This Court emphasized:<br><blockquote>It bears repeating that Revenue memorandum-circulars are considered administrative rulings (in the sense of more specific and less general interpretations of tax laws) which are issued from time to time by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. It is widely accepted that the interpretation placed upon a statute by the executive officers, whose duty is to enforce it, is entitled to great respect by the courts. Nevertheless, such interpretation is not conclusive and will be ignored if judicially found to be erroneous. Thus, courts will not countenance administrative issuances that override, instead of remaining consistent and in harmony with, the law they seek to apply and implement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court of Appeals, et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> another case involving tax amnesty:<br><blockquote>The authority of the Minister of Finance (now the Secretary of Finance), in conjunction with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, to promulgate all needful rules and regulations for the effective enforcement of internal revenue laws cannot be controverted. Neither can it be disputed that such rules and regulations, as well as administrative opinions and rulings, ordinarily should deserve weight and respect by the courts. <i>Much more fundamental than either of the above, however, is that all such issuances must not override, but must remain consistent and in harmony with the law they seek to apply and implement. Administrative rules and regulations are intended to carry out, neither to supplant nor to modify, the law.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In that case, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue refused to cancel its assessment of deficiency income and business taxes against the taxpayer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The Commissioner argued that "Revenue Memorandum Order No. 4-87 . . . implementing Executive Order No. 41, had construed the amnesty coverage to include only assessments issued by the Bureau of Internal Revenue after the promulgation of the executive order on 22 August 1986 and not to assessments theretofore made."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> This Court rejected the Commissioner's claim and ruled that if "Executive Order No. 41 had not been intended to include 1981-1985 tax liabilities already assessed (administratively) prior to 22 August 1986, the law could have simply so provided in its exclusionary clauses."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Similarly, in <i>CS Garment, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> this Court struck down as exception "[i]ssues and cases which were ruled by any court (even without finality) in favor of the [Bureau of Internal Revenue] prior to amnesty availment of the taxpayer" under the Bureau's Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 19-2008, for going beyond the scope of the provisions of the 2007 Tax Amnesty Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>One of the exceptions provided under Section 8 of Republic Act No. 9480 is "[withholding agents with respect to their withholding tax<br><br>Withholding tax is merely a method of collecting income tax in advance. The perceived tax is collected at the source of income payment to ensure collection. "In the operation of the withholding tax system, the [income] payee is the taxpayer, the person on whom the tax is imposed, while the [income] pay or, a separate entity, acts no more than an agent of the government for the collection of the tax in order to ensure its payment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> "In other words, the withholding agent is merely a tax collector, not a taxpayer."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>In <i>Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> this Court ruled that "the liability of the withholding agent is independent from that of the taxpayer."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Further:<br><blockquote>The [withholding agent] cannot be made liable for the tax due because it is the [taxpayer] who earned the income subject to withholding tax. The withholding agent is liable only insofar as he failed to perform his duty to withhold the tax and remit the same to the government. The liability for the tax, however, remains with the taxpayer because the gain was realized and received by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>Parenthetically, withholding tax is different from indirect tax. In <i>Asia International Auctioneers, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><blockquote>Indirect taxes, like VAT and excise tax, are different from withholding taxes. To distinguish, in indirect taxes, the incidence of taxation falls on one person but the burden thereof can be shifted or passed on to another person, such as when the tax is imposed upon goods before reaching the consumer who ultimately pays for it. On the other hand, in case of withholding taxes, the incidence and burden of taxation fall on the same entity, the statutory taxpayer. The burden of taxation is not shifted to the withholding agent who merely collects, by withholding, the tax due from income payments to entities arising from certain transactions and remits the same to the government. Due to this difference, the deficiency VAT and excise tax cannot be "deemed" as withholding taxes merely because they constitute indirect taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>To be sustainable, therefore, the added exception "taxes passed-on and collected from customers for remittance to the [Bureau of Internal Revenue]" provided in Revenue Memorandum Circular Nos. 69-2007 and 19-2008 must be essentially equivalent to the withholding tax liabilities of a withholding agent. Thus, a taxpayer who is deemed to be a "withholding or collecting agent" of "the tax collected from [its] customer" is excluded from the coverage of the tax amnesty, with respect to its liability as a withholding or collecting agent.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Documentary stamp taxes on special savings accounts are direct liabilities of petitioner and not simply "[t]axes passed-on and collected from customers for remittance to the [Bureau of Internal Revenue]" as argued by respondent.<br><br>A documentary stamp tax is a tax on documents, instruments, loan agreements, and papers evidencing the acceptance, assignment, sale, or transfer of an obligation, right, or property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The tax is "levied on the exercise by persons of certain privileges conferred by law for the creation, revision, or termination of specific legal relationships through the execution of specific instruments."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The law taxes the document because of the transaction.<br><br>Under Section 173 of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code, the documentary stamp tax due is paid by the person "making, signing, issuing, accepting, or transferring" the instrument.<br><br>Revenue Regulations No. 9-2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> clarifies that all parties to a transaction, and not only the person making, signing, issuing, accepting, or transferring the document, are primarily liable for the documentary stamp tax. It provides:<br><blockquote><b>SEC. 2.
