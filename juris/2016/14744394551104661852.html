She also presented a certified machine copy of a document entitled "Divorce Certificate" issued by the Consul for the Ambassador of Japan in Manila that was authenticated by the Department of the Foreign Affairs, as well as a Certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> issued by the City Civil Registry Office in Manila that the original of said divorce certificate was filed and recorded in the said Office. In addition, photocopies of the Civil Code of Japan and their corresponding English translation, as well as two (2) books entitled "The Civil Code of Japan 2000"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and "The Civil Code of Japan 2009"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> were likewise submitted as proof of the existence of Japan's law on divorce.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated July 31, 2014, the RTC denied Doreen's petition, ruling that in an action for recognition of foreign divorce decree pursuant to Article 26 of the Family Code, the foreign divorce decree and" the national law of the alien recognizing his or her capacity to obtain a divorce must be proven in accordance with Sections 24<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> and 25<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of Rule 132 of the Revised Rules on Evidence. The RTC ruled that while the divorce documents presented by Doreen were successfully proven to be public or official records of Japan, she nonetheless fell short of proving the national law of her husband, particularly the existence of the law on divorce. The RTC observed that the "The Civil Code of Japan 2000" and "The Civil Code of Japan 2009," presented were not duly authenticated by the Philippine Consul in Japan as required by Sections 24 and 25 of the said Rules, adding too that the testimony of Doreen relative to the applicable provisions found therein and its effect on the matrimonial relations was insufficient since she was not presented as a qualified expert witness nor was shown to have, at the very least, a working knowledge of the laws of Japan, particularly those on family relations and divorce. It likewise did not consider the said books as learned treatises pursuant to Section 46,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Rule 130 of the Revised Rules on Evidence, since no expert witness on the subject matter was presented and considering further that Philippine courts cannot take judicial notice of foreign judgments and law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Doreen's motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> was denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated November 28, 2014; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The core issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the RTC erred in denying the petition for judicial recognition of foreign divorce.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>At the outset, it bears stressing that Philippine law does not provide for absolute divorce; hence, our courts cannot grant it. However, Article 26 of the Family Code - which addresses foreign marriages or mixed marriages involving a Filipino and a foreigner - allows a Filipino spouse to contract a subsequent marriage in case the divorce is validly obtained abroad by an alien spouse capacitating him or her to remarry. The provision reads:<br><blockquote>Art. 26. All marriages solemnized outside the Philippines in accordance with the laws in force in the country where they were solemnized, and valid there as such, shall also be valid in this country, except those prohibited under Articles 35(1), (4), (5) and (6), 36, 37 and 38.<br><br><b>Where a marriage between a Filipino citizen and a foreigner is validly celebrated and a divorce is thereafter <i>validly obtained abroad by the alien spouse</i> capacitating him or her to remarry, the Filipino spouse shall likewise have capacity to remarry under Philippine law.</b> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Under the above-highlighted paragraph, the law confers jurisdiction on Philippine courts to extend the effect of a foreign divorce decree to a Filipino spouse without undergoing trial to determine the validity of the dissolution of the marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In <i>Corpuz v. Sto. Tomas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Court had the occasion to rule that:<br><blockquote>The starting point in any recognition of a foreign divorce judgment is the acknowledgment that our courts do not take judicial notice of foreign judgments and laws. Justice Herrera explained that, as a rule, "no sovereign is bound to give effect within its dominion to a judgment rendered by a tribunal of another country." <u><b>This means that the foreign judgment and its authenticity must be proven as facts under our rules on evidence, together with the alien's applicable national law to show the effect of the judgment on the alien himself or herself.</b></u> The recognition may be made in an action instituted specifically for the purpose or in another action where a party invokes the foreign decree as an integral aspect of his claim or defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Thus, in <i>Garcia v. Recio</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> it was pointed out that in order for a divorce obtained abroad by the alien spouse to be recognized in our jurisdiction, it must be shown that the divorce decree is valid according to the national law of the foreigner. Both the divorce decree and the governing personal law of the alien spouse who obtained the divorce must be proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Since our courts do not take judicial notice of foreign laws and judgment, our law on evidence requires that both the divorce decree and the national law of the alien must be alleged and <b>proven like any other fact</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Considering that the validity of the divorce decree between Doreen and Michiyuki, as well as the existence of pertinent laws of Japan on the matter are essentially factual that calls for a re-evaluation of the evidence presented before the RTC, the issue raised in the instant appeal is obviously a question of fact that is beyond the ambit of a Rule 45 petition for review.<br><br>Well entrenched is the rule that this Court is not a trier of facts. The resolution of factual issues is the function of the lower courts, whose findings on these matters are received with respect and are in fact binding subject to certain exceptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In this regard, it is settled that appeals taken from judgments or final orders rendered by RTC in the exercise of its original jurisdiction raising questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and law should be brought to the Court of Appeals (CA) in accordance with Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, despite the procedural restrictions on Rule 45 appeals as above-adverted, the Court may refer the case to the CA under paragraph 2, Section 6 of Rule 56 of the Rules of Court, which provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 6. <i>Disposition of improper appeal</i>. - x x x<br><br>An appeal by <i>certiorari</i> taken to the Supreme Court from the Regional Trial Court submitting issues of fact may be referred to the Court of Appeals for decision or appropriate action. The determination of the Supreme Court on whether or not issues of fact are involved shall be final.<br></blockquote>This, notwithstanding the express provision under Section 5 (f) thereof that an appeal likewise "may" be dismissed when there is error in the choice or mode of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Since the said Rules denote discretion on the part of the Court to either dismiss the appeal or refer the case to the CA, the question of fact involved in the instant appeal and substantial ends of justice warrant that the case be referred to the CA for further appropriate proceedings. It bears to stress that procedural rules were intended to ensure proper administration of law and justice. The rules of procedure ought not to be applied in a very rigid, technical sense, for they are adopted to help secure, not override, substantial justice. A deviation from its rigid enforcement may thus be allowed to attain its prime objective, for after all, the dispensation of justice is the core reason for the existence of the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in the interest of orderly procedure and substantial justice, the case is hereby <b>REFERRED</b> to the Court of Appeals for appropriate action including the reception of evidence to <b>DETERMINE</b> and <b>RESOLVE</b> the pertinent factual issues in accordance with this Decision.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.
