				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A law enacted prior to the 1987 Constitution, like a presidential decree, is presumed to be valid and constitutional on the theory that it was carefully studied by the Legislative and Executive Departments prior to its enactment, and determined to be in accord with the Fundamental Law. However, the presumption of validity and constitutionality is overturned and the law should be struck down once it becomes inconsistent with the present Constitution and the later laws.<br><br><center><b>Antecedents</b><br></center><br>On May 25, 1973, President Ferdinand E. Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 198 (<i>Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973</i>). By virtue of P. D. No. 198, Cebu City formed the Metro Cebu Water District (MCWD) in 1974. Thereafter, the Cities of Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu and Talisay, and the Municipalities of Liloan, Compostela, Consolacion, and Cordova turned over their waterworks systems and services to the MCWD. Since then, the MCWD has distributed water and sold water services to said cities and municipalities. From 1974 to 2002, the Cebu City Mayor appointed all the members of the MCWD Board of Directors in accordance with Section 3 (b) of P. D. No. 198, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>Section 3.</b> <i>Definitions</i>. - As used in this Decree, the following words and terms shall have the meanings herein set forth, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context. The definition of a word or term applies to any of its variants.<br><br>(a) <i>Act</i>. This is the Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973.<br><br>(b) <i>Appointing authority</i>. The person empowered to appoint the members of the board of Directors of a local water district, depending upon the geographic coverage and population make-up of the particular district. <b>In the event that more than seventy-five percent of the total active water service connections of a local water district are within the boundary of any city or municipality, the appointing authority shall be the mayor of that city or municipality, as the case may be; otherwise, the appointing authority shall be the governor of the province within which the district is located.</b> If portions of more than one province are included within the boundary of the district, and the appointing authority is to be the governors then the power to appoint shall rotate between the governors involved with the initial appointments made by the governor in whose province the greatest number of service connections exists. (bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)<br></blockquote>In July 2002, Cebu Provincial Governor Pablo L. Garcia wrote to the MCWD to assert his authority and intention to appoint the members of the MCWD Board of Directors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> He stated in his letter that since 1996, the active water service connections in Cebu City had been below 75% of the total active water service connection of the MCWD; that no other city or municipality under the MCWD had reached the required percentage of 75%; and that, accordingly, he, as the Provincial Governor of Cebu, was the appointing authority for the members of the MCWD Board of Directors pursuant to Section 3 (b) of P. D. No. 198.<br><br>Later on, the MCWD commenced in the Regional Trial Court in Cebu City (RTC) its action for declaratory relief seeking to declare Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198 unconstitutional; or, should the provision be declared valid, it should be interpreted to mean that the authority to appoint the members of the MCWD Board of Directors belonged solely to the Cebu City Mayor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The RTC (Branch 7) dismissed the action for declaratory relief without any finding and declaration as to the proper appointing authority for the members of the MCWD Board of Directors should none of the cities and municipalities reach 75% of the total water service connections in the areas under the MCWD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In the meanwhile, the terms of two members of the MCWD Board of Directors ended, resulting in two vacancies. To avoid a vacuum and in the exigency of the service, Provincial Governor Gwendolyn F. Garcia and Cebu City Mayor Tomas R. Osmeña jointly appointed Atty. Adelino Sitoy and Leo Pacaña to fill the vacancies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> However, the position of Atty. Sitoy was deemed vacated upon his election as the Municipal Mayor of Cordova, Cebu in the 2007 elections.<br><br>Consequently, Governor Garcia commenced an action for declaratory relief to seek the interpretation of Section 3 (b) of P.D. No. 198 on the proper appointing authority for the members of the MCWD Board of Directors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>It appears that on February 7, 2008, the Cebu Provincial Legal Office, upon being informed that Mayor Osmeña would be appointing Joel Mari S. Yu to replace Atty. Sitoy as a member of the MCWD Board of Directors, formally advised in writing Cynthia A. Barrit, the MCWD Board Secretary, to defer the submission of the list of nominees to any appointing authority until the RTC rendered its final ruling on the issue of the proper appointing authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> On February 22, 2008, however, Mayor Osmeña appointed Yu as a member of the MCWD Board of Directors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Accordingly, on May 20, 2008, the RTC dismissed the action for declaratory relief on the ground that declaratory relief became improper once there was a breach or violation of the provision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On June 13, 2008, Governor Garcia filed a complaint to declare the nullity of the appointment of Yu as a member of the MCWD Board of Directors (docketed as Civil Case No. CEB-34459), alleging that the appointment by Mayor Osmeña was illegal; that under Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198, it was she as the Provincial Governor of Cebu who was vested with the authority to appoint members of the MCWD Board of Directors because the total active water service connections of Cebu City and of the other cities and municipalities were below 75% of the total water service connections in the area of the MCWD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> She impleaded Mayor Osmeña, the MCWD, and Yu as defendants.<br><br>In his answer, Mayor Osmeña contended that the authority to appoint the members of the MCWD Board of Directors solely belonged to him; that since the creation of the MCWD in 1974, it was the Cebu City Mayor who had been appointing the members of the MCWD Board of Directors; that the Province of Cebu had not invested or participated in the creation of the MCWD; and that Cebu City, being a highly urbanized city (HUC), was independent from the Province of Cebu under the provisions on local autonomy of the 1987 Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The RTC (Branch 18), to which the case was raffled, required the parties to submit their memorandum.<br><br>In their joint memorandum, Osmeña and Yu posited that the Province of Cebu did not participate in the organization of the MCWD; that the words and sentences of Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198 should not be read and understood or interpreted literally; and that the case should be dismissed because: (1) Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198 was unconstitutional for being arbitrary and unreasonable; (2) Governor Garcia had no authority to appoint any members of the MCWD Board of Directors; and (3) that the Mayor of the city or municipality having the majority of water connections within the area under the MCWD had the power to appoint the members of the MCWD Board of Directors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On November 16, 2010, the RTC rendered the assailed judgment declaring the appointment of Yu as illegal and void,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> holding as follows:<br><blockquote>The questioned provision, paragraph (b) of Section 3 of P.O. 198 is clear enough that it needs no interpretation. It expressly states in unequivocal terms the appointing authority in the water district's board of directors --- <i>if more than seventy-five percent of the total active water service connections of a local water district are within the boundary of any city or municipality, the appointing authority shall be the mayor of the city or municipality, as the case may be; otherwise, the appointing authority shall be the governor of the province within which the district is located</i>.<br><br>It has not been belied by defendants that the active water service connections of Cebu City in the Metropolitan Cebu Water District (MCWD), at 61.28%, have gone below the required 75% required by law for the city mayor to have the authority to appoint members of the board of directors of the water district. Lacking such percentage requisite, the appointing power is now vested with the governor of the Province of Cebu. While it may be true that the governor had not participated in organizing MCWD and neither did the Province of Cebu invest in establishing waterworks in the component local governments, the law, however, does not impose any condition or restriction in transferring the power to the governor to appoint members of the board of directors when the percentage falls below 75%. Thus, there is no doubt that when any of the water district's participating city or municipality could not obtain 75% of the active water service connections, the governor shall appoint the members of the board of directors of the water district, whether it is a participant or not, in its organization.<br><br>As to the constitutionality of the questioned provision, the Court finds that Sec. 3 of P.O. 198 does not violate the Constitution or the Local Government Code. Vesting the authority in the governor to appoint a member of the board of directors of a water district is not intruding into the affairs of the highly urbanized cities and component cities which comprise the district, and neither is it a threat to their autonomy. It does not interfere with their powers and functions and neither can it be considered an exercise of the provincial government's supervisory powers. At most, it is simply giving the authority to appoint the head of the government unit (the governor) where all the members of the water district are geographically located, and only when none of these cities and municipalities has the required 75% of the active water service connections. Nevertheless, the issue is not whether the governor took any part in organizing the water district or has contributed to its formation, but that by law, she has been made the appointing authority even if she has no participation or involvement in the cooperative effort of the members of the water district. This may not be the most expedient and appropriate solution, but still, it is not illegal. As to why this is so is a question only our lawmakers could answer.<br><br><i>All presumptions are indulged in favor of constitutionality, one who attacks a statute, alleging constitutionality must prove its invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt; that a law may work hardship does not render it unconstitutional, that if any reasonable basis may be conceived which supports the statute, it will be upheld and the challenger must negate all possible bases; that the courts are not concerned with the wisdom, justice, policy or expediency of a statute, and that a liberal interpretation of the constitution in favour of the constitutionality of legislation should be adopted.</i><br><br>Notably, among the admissions found in the Answer for defendants Yu and MCWD states: "<i>x x x with respect to the two (2) vacancies in the Board of MCWD and that joint appointment was made by the plaintiff and defendant Mayor Osmeña to Atty. Adelino Sitoy and Mr. Eligio Pacana</i>." The Court surmises from this statement that as early as the previous appointments (of Mr. Pacana and Atty. Sitoy) defendants have already recognized the appointing authority of the governor for members of the MCWD board of directors, considering Cebu City's failure to reach the 75% benchmark on active water service connections.<br><br>In sum, the Court has not been able to find any constitutional infirmity in the questioned provision (Sec. 3) of Presidential Decree No. 198. <i>The fundamental criterion is that all reasonable doubts should be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of a statute. Every law has in its favor the presumption of constitutionality. For a law to be nullified, there must be shown that there is a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution. The ground for nullity must be clear and beyond reasonable doubt.</i> Those who seek to declare the law, or parts thereof unconstitutional, must clearly establish the basis therefore. Otherwise, the arguments fall short.<br><br>Based on the grounds raised by defendants to challenge the constitutionality of Section 3 of P.D. 198, the Court finds that defendants have failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality of the law. As to whether the questioned section constitutes a wise legislation, considering the issues being raised by petitioners, is for Congress to determine.<br><br>WHEREFORE, Judgment is hereby rendered in favour of plaintiff and against defendants, finding the appointment of defendant Joel Mari S. Yu as member of the Metropolitan Cebu Water District (MCWD) as illegal, null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>Mayor Osmeña and Yu jointly moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> but the RTC denied their motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Hence, the petitioners have instituted this special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> contending that:<br><blockquote><b><center>I.<br><br></center>THE RESPONDENT COURT ABDICATED ITS CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY IN REFUSING TO DELVE ON THE ISSUE OF CONSTITUTIONALITY.<br><br><center>II.</center><br>THE JUDGMENT IS VOID ON ITS FACE BECAUSE OF CLEAR CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS APPARENT BY A MERE READING OF THE DECREE.<br><br><center>III.</center><br>THE JUDGMENT VIOLATES DUE PROCESS AND THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></div><br>The petition for <i>certiorari</i> is granted.<br><br><center><b>1.<br>Preliminary Matter:<br>Yu's expiration of term did not render case moot and academic</b><br></center><br>We note that respondent Yu's term as a member of the MCWD Board of Directors expired on December 31, 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> However, this fact does not justify the dismissal of the petition on the ground of its being rendered moot and academic. The case should still be decided, despite the intervening developments that could have rendered the case moot and academic, because public interest is involved, and because the issue is capable of repetition yet evading review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>For sure, the appointment by the proper official of the individuals to manage the system of water distribution and service for the consumers residing in the concerned cities and municipalities involves the interest of their populations and the general public affected by the services of the MCWD as a public utility. Moreover, the question on the proper appointing authority for the members of the MCWD Board of Directors should none of the cities and municipalities have at least 75% of the water consumers will not be definitively resolved with finality if we dismiss the petition on the ground of mootness. It is notable that the two cases for declaratory relief filed for the purpose of determining the proper appointing authority were dismissed without any definitive declaration or ultimate determination of the merits of the issue. The issue festers. Hence, the Court needs to decide it now, not later.<br><br><center><b>2.<br>First Issue:<br>RTC explained its holding of the assailed provision as valid and constitutional but it thereby erred nonetheless</b><br></center><br>The petitioners take the RTC to task for not explaining why it held Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198 to be not violative of the constitutional provision on local autonomy and HUCs, and why it only opined that the question of constitutionality of the provision should be left to Congress; that it did not determine whether the requisites for raising the constitutional issue had been met; that it did not discuss the reasons for holding that the issue about Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198 was a political question; that no political question was involved because what was being inquired into was not the wisdom of the provision but its validity; and that because it did not perform its constitutional duty of reviewing the provision, its judgment was void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The petitioners are mistaken on the first issue. The records show that the RTC, which indisputably had the power and the duty to determine and decide the issue of the constitutionality of Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> fully discharged its duty. In its assailed decision of November 16, 2010, the RTC ruled as follows:<br><blockquote>As to the constitutionality of the questioned provision, the Court finds that Sec. 3 of P.D. 198 does not violate the Constitution or the Local Government Code. Vesting the authority in the governor to appoint a member of the board of directors of a water district is not intruding into the affairs of the highly urbanized cities and component cities which comprise the district, and neither is it a threat to their autonomy. It does not interfere with their powers and functions and neither can it be considered an exercise of the provincial government's supervisory powers. At most, it is simply giving the authority to appoint the head of the government unit (the governor) where all the members of the water district are geographically located, and only when none of these cities and municipalities has the required 75% of the active water&nbsp; service connections.

Otherwise, the arguments fall short.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>Nonetheless, the petitioners rightly contend that the RTC improperly regarded the matter about Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198 as a political question; hence, not justiciable. It was not.<br><br>Political questions refer to "those questions which, under the Constitution, are to be decided by the people in their sovereign capacity; or in regard to which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the legislature or executive branch of the government."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> They are "neatly associated with the wisdom" of a particular act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The difference between the political and the justiciable questions has been noted in <i>Sanidad v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>x x x The implementing Presidential Decree Nos. 991, 1031, and 1033, which commonly purport to have the force and effect of legislation are assailed as invalid, <b>thus the issue of the validity of said Decrees is plainly a justiciable one, within the competence of this Court to pass upon</b>. Section 2 (2), Article X of the new Constitution provides: "All cases involving the constitutionality of a treaty, executive agreement, or law may shall be heard and decided by the Supreme Court en bane and no treaty, executive agreement, or law may be declared unconstitutional without the concurrence of at least ten Members...." The Supreme Court has the last word in the construction not only of treaties and statutes, but also of the Constitution itself. The amending, like all other powers organized in the Constitution, is in form a delegated and hence a limited power, so that the Supreme Court is vested with that authority to determine whether that power has been discharged within its limits. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The petitioners have averred the unconstitutionality or invalidity of Section3 (b) of P.D. No 198 based on the provision's arbitrariness in denying substantive due process and equal protection to the affected local government units (LGUs). Such issue, being justiciable, comes within the power of judicial review. As such, the RTC skirted its duty of judicial review by improperly relying on the political question doctrine. It should have instead adhered to the pronouncement in <i>Estrada v. Desierto</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>To a great degree, the 1987 Constitution has narrowed the reach of the political question doctrine when it expanded the power of judicial review of this court not only to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable but also to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of government. Heretofore, the judiciary has focused on the "thou shalt not's" of the Constitution directed against the exercise of its jurisdiction. With the new provision, however, courts are given a greater prerogative to determine what it can do to prevent grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of government. Clearly, the new provision did not just grant the Court power of doing nothing. x x x (Italics omitted)</blockquote><center><b>3. <br>Second Issue:<br>Section 3(b) of P.D. 198 is already superseded</b></center><br>The petitioners argue that the MCWD became a water district by the pooling of the water utilities belonging to several HUCs and municipalities; that the active water connections in the MCWD have been distributed as follows: Cebu City: 61.28%; Mandaue City: 16%; Lapulapu City: 6.8%; Talisay City and the Municipalities of Liloan, Consolacion, Compostela, and Cordova: 16.92%; that Section 3 (b) of P.D. No. 198 was unconstitutional on its face for being unreasonable and arbitrary because the determination of who would exercise the power to appoint the members of the MCWD Board of Directors was thereby made to depend on the shifting number of water users in the water district's component LGUs; that the provision on the authority of the Provincial Governor to appoint in cases where the water connections of any of the water district's cities or municipalities were below 75% was arbitrary for not distinguishing whether or not the province had contributed any waterworks to the water district; that the provision did not consider whether a city or municipality comprised the majority or more of the water consumers; that the provision was irrational as it gave the Provincial Governor the power to appoint regardless of whether the province had participated in the organization of the water district or not; that in a democracy, the principle that if power or authority was conferred through determination of numerical figures then the numerical superiority or the rule of the majority should apply; that the rule of the majority was being applied in electing government leaders as well as in choosing the leaders in the private sector; that the provision violated the rule of the majority; that at the time of the filing of this case, the majority of MCWD water service connections were in Cebu City (61.28%); and that the appointing power should necessarily remain in the City Mayor of Cebu City because the appointing power was based on the number of water service connections.<br><br>The petitioners asseverate that the provision or any part of P.D. No. 198 did not state any reason for departing from the rule of the majority; that the provision failed reasonableness as a standard of substantive due process; that the appointing authority should be the mayor of the city or municipality having the majority of the water connections; that if such majority could not be attained, there must be a power sharing scheme among those having the largest number of water connections conformably with the rule of the majority; that the temporary alternative was the Board&nbsp; of Directors themselves, who, under Section 10 of P.D. No. 198, could appoint upon failure of the appointing authority to do so; that the assailed provision was void on its face for violating the constitutional provision on local autonomy and independence of HUCs under Article X of the 1987 Constitution; that the provision unduly interfered with the internal affairs of Cebu City, and diminished the autonomy of the LGUs; that the provision undermined the independence of HUCs; that both the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel and the Office of the Solicitor General have opined that because Cebu City was an HUC, the City Mayor of Cebu City should retain the right to appoint the members of the MCWD Board of Directors; that the chief executive of the LGU having the majority of water consumers was in the best position to exercise the discretion of choosing the most competent persons who could best serve the constituents; that because the largest number of water consumers were in Cebu City, any intrusion on the City Mayor's power to appoint would violate its independence and autonomy; that the Province of Cebu could not exercise powers that affected the constituents of HUCs; that providing water to constituents was the sole responsibility of the concerned LGU; that the water utility of the LGU was a patrimonial property that was not for public use; that as such, the operation, ownership and management of the public utility should belong to the LGU; and that the operation of the water utilities involved the private rights of the LGUs that could not be amended or altered by a statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The Court opines that Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198 should be partially struck down for being repugnant to the local autonomy granted by the 1987 Constitution to LGUs, and for being inconsistent with R.A. No. 7160 (<i>1991 Local Government Code</i>) and related laws on local governments.<br><br>P.D.

(Emphasis supplied)<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>The enactment of P.D. No. 198 on May 25, 1973 was prior to the enactment on December 22, 1979 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 51 (<i>An Act Providing for the Elective or Appointive Positions in Various Local Governments and for Other Purposes</i>) and antedated as well the effectivity of the <i>1991 Local Government Code</i> on January 1, 1992. At the time of the enactment of P.D. No. 198, Cebu City was still a component city of Cebu Province. Section 3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> of B.P. Blg. 51 reclassified the cities of the Philippines based on well-defined criteria. Cebu City thus became an HUC, which immediately meant that its inhabitants were ineligible to vote for the officials of Cebu Province. In accordance with Section 12 of Article X of the 1987 Constitution, cities that are highly urbanized, as determined by law, and component cities whose charters prohibit their voters from voting for provincial elective officials, shall be <i>independent of the province</i>, but the voters of component cities within a province, whose charters contain no such prohibition, shall not be deprived of their right to vote for elective provincial officials. Later on, Cebu City, already an HUC, was further effectively rendered <i>independent from</i> Cebu Province pursuant to Section 29 of the <i>1991 Local Government Code, viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Section 29. <i>Provincial Relations with Component Cities and Municipalities</i>. - The province, through the governor, shall ensure that every component city and municipality within its territorial jurisdiction acts within the scope of its prescribed powers and functions. <b>Highly urbanized cities and independent component cities shall be independent of the province.</b> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Hence, all matters relating to its administration, powers and functions were exercised through its local executives led by the City Mayor, subject to the President's retained power of general supervision over provinces, HUCs, and independent component cities pursuant to and in accordance with Section 25<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> of the <i>1991 Local Government Code</i>, a law enacted for the purpose of strengthening the autonomy of the LGUs in accordance with the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>Article X of the 1987 Constitution guarantees and promotes the administrative and fiscal autonomy of the LGUs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The foregoing statutory enactments enunciate and implement the local autonomy provisions explicitly recognized under the 1987 Constitution. To conform with the guarantees of the Constitution in favor of the autonomy of the LGUs, therefore, it becomes the duty of the Court to declare and pronounce Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198 as already partially unconstitutional. We note that this pronouncement is also advocated by the National Government, as shown in the comment of the Solicitor General.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In <i>Navarro v. Ermita</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the Court has pointed out that the central policy considerations in the creation of local government units are economic viability, efficient administration, and capability to deliver basic services to their constituents. These considerations must be given importance as they ensure the success of local autonomy. It is accepted that the LGUs, more than the National Government itself, know the needs of their constituents, and cater to such needs based on the particular circumstances of their localities. Where a particular law or statute affecting the LGUs infringes on their autonomy, and on their rights and powers to efficiently and effectively address the needs of their constituents, we should lean in favor of their autonomy, their rights and their powers.<br><br>Water and its efficient supply are among the primary concerns of every LGU. Issues that tend to reduce or diminish the authority of the boards of directors to manage the water districts are imbued with public interest. Bearing this in mind, and recalling that the MCWD had been established from the erstwhile Osmeña Waterworks Systems (OWS) without any investment or contribution of funds and material from the Province of Cebu towards the creation and maintenance of OWS and the MCWD,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and considering that it had always been the City Mayor of the City of Cebu who appointed the members of the MCWD Board of Directors regardless of the percentage of the water subscribers, our pronouncement herein rests on firm ground.<br><br><center><b>4.<br>Third Issue:<br>Section 3(b) of P.D. 198 is unconstitutional for violating the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause</b><br></center><br>The petitioners assert that Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198, being unfair, violated substantive due process; that Governor Garcia could not determine the water needs of each of the LGUs within the MCWD; that the provision allowed inequality of treatment of the cities and municipalities in relation to the province, and thus violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution; that the provision unduly deprived Cebu City of the power to determine the membership in the MCWD Board of Directors despite Cebu City having the majority of the water service connections; that the Province of Cebu was given unreasonable and unwarranted benefit despite Cebu City being independent from the Province of Cebu; that Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198 did not distinguish whether the province contributed any resource to the water district or not; that under the provision, if two or more provinces contributed to the water district, they were not subject to the 75% requirement to avail of the power of appointment, indicating that the power to appoint devolved only in the provinces; that this violated the guarantee of equality of treatment in favor of the participating LGUs; that the provision created a privileged class (the provinces) without any justification in reason; and that "the classification is not germane to the purpose of the law and is not based on substantial distinctions that make real differences."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Substantive due process "requires that the law itself, not merely the procedures by which the law would be enforced, is fair, reasonable, and just."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> It demands the intrinsic validity of the law in interfering with the rights of the person to life, liberty or property. In short, to be determined is whether the law has a valid governmental objective, like the interest of the public as against that of a particular class.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the principle of equal protection enshrined in the Constitution does not require the territorial uniformity of laws. According to <i>Tiu v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the fundamental right of equal protection of the law is not absolute, but subject to reasonable classification. Classification, to be valid, must: (1) rest on substantial distinctions; (2) be germane to the purpose of the law; (3) not be limited to existing conditions only; and (4) apply equally to all members of the same class.<br><br>We opine that although Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198 provided for substantial distinction and was germane to the purpose of P.D. No. 198 when it was enacted in 1973, the intervening reclassification of the City of Cebu into an HUC and the subsequent enactment of the <i>1991 Local Government Code</i> rendered the continued application of Section 3(b) in disregard of the reclassification unreasonable and unfair. Clearly, the assailed provision no longer provided for substantial distinction because, firstly, it ignored that the MCWD was built without the participation of the provincial government; secondly, it failed to consider that the MCWD existed to serve the community that represents the needs of the majority of the active water service connections; and, thirdly, the main objective of the decree was to improve the water service while keeping up with the needs of the growing population.<br><br>The Whereas Clauses of P.D. No. 198 essentially state the <i>raison d'etre</i> of its enactment, to wit:<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, <b>existing domestic water utilities are not meeting the needs of the communities they serve</b>; water quality is unsatisfactory; pressure is inadequate; and reliability of service is poor; in fact, many persons receive no piped water service whatsoever;<br><br>WHEREAS, conditions of service continue to worsen for two apparent reasons, namely: (1) that key element of existing systems are deteriorating faster than they are being maintained or replaced, and (2) <b>that they are not being expanded at a rate sufficient to match population growth</b>; and<br><br>WHEREAS, <b>local water utilities should be locally-controlled and managed</b>, as well as have support on the national level in the area of technical advisory services and financing; (<b>bold</b> emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Verily, the decree was enacted to provide adequate, quality and reliable water and waste-water services to meet the needs of the local communities and their growing populations. The needs of the communities served were paramount. Hence, we deem it to be inconsistent with the true objectives of the decree to still leave to the provincial governor the appointing authority if the provincial governor had administrative supervision only over municipalities and component cities accounting for 16.92% of the active water service connection in the MCWD. In comparison, the City of Cebu had 61.28%<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of the active service water connections; Mandaue, another HUC, 16%; and Lapu Lapu City, another HUC, 6.8%. There is no denying that the MCWD has been primarily serving the needs of Cebu City. Although it is impermissible to inquire into why the decree set 75% as the marker for determining the proper appointing authority, the provision has meanwhile become unfair for ignoring the needs and circumstances of Cebu City as the LGU accounting for the majority of the active water service connections, and whose constituency stood to be the most affected by the decisions made by the MCWD's Board of Directors. Indeed, the classification has truly ceased to be germane or related to the main objective for the enactment of P.D. No. 198 in 1973.<br><br>Grave abuse of discretion means either that the judicial or quasi­ judicial power was exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, or that the respondent judge, tribunal or board evaded a positive duty, or virtually refused to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law, such as when such judge, tribunal or board exercising judicial or quasi-judicial powers acted in a capricious or whimsical manner as to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. Mere abuse of discretion is not enough to warrant the issuance of the writ. The abuse of discretion must be grave.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Under the foregoing circumstances, therefore, the RTC gravely abused its discretion in upholding Section 3(b) of P.D.

Brion. For brevity, I submit with due respect, the serious flaws in the conclusions reached by the majority opinion.<br><br><b>Firstly,</b> I disagree with the majority opinion that Section 3(b) of Presidential Decree No. 198 should be partially struck down for being repugnant to the local autonomy granted by the 1987 Constitution to local government units (LGUs), and for being inconsistent with Republic Act No. 7160 (1991 Local Government Code) and related laws on local government.<br><br>There is no impairment of the local autonomy provided by the 1987 Constitution and its implementing legislations for the following reasons:<br><br>The decision to form a local water district is lodged upon the legislative body of any city, municipality or province itself, which can do so by enacting a resolution to form or join a district. An LGU is free to decide to join or not a local water district based on its own assessment of whether or not it will redound to its benefit to be covered by Presidential Decree No. 198, which provides, among others, for a package of <b>powers, rights</b> and <b>obligations</b>. Specifically, the local water district is assured of support on the national level in the area of technical advisory services and financing (Fifth Preambulatory Clause of Presidential Decree No. 198), guarantee of exclusive franchise for domestic water service within the district (Section 46), and exemption from income taxes under Section 45 which provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 45. <i>Exemption from Taxes</i>. A district shall (1) be exempt from paying income taxes, and (2) shall be exempt from the payment of (a) all National Government, local government and municipal taxes and fees, including any franchise, filing, recordation, license or permit fees or taxes and fees, charges or costs involved in any court of administrative proceeding in which it may be a party and (b) all duties or imposts on imported machinery, equipment and materials required for its operations.<br></blockquote>Moreover, the LGU joining a local water district does not surrender any of its powers under the Constitution or the Local Government Code to another LGU vested with the power to appoint the members of the Board of the local water district since Presidential Decree No. 198 expressly provides that a district once formed shall <b>not be under the jurisdiction of any political subdivision</b>.<br><br>The local water district has a separate juridical personality which is independent of the LGUs. It is governed by its Board of Directors pursuant to Section 17 which reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 17. <i>Performance of District Powers</i>. - All powers, privileges, and duties of the district shall be exercised and performed by and through the board: <i>Provided, however,</i> That any executive, administrative or ministerial power shall be delegated and redelegated by the board to officers or agents designated for such purpose by the board.<br></blockquote>Hence, the power to appoint the members of the Board of Directors of the local water districts, which is vested upon the LGU determined in accordance with the formula or rule prescribed by Presidential Decree No. 198, does not impair the autonomy of the other LGUs included in the District.<br><br>If a province can join a local water district and be subjected to the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 198, there is no cogent reason why the change of status of a component city of a province, which would later on become a highly urbanized city, should affect its powers, rights and obligations under Presidential Decree No. 198.<br><br>A province which enjoys local autonomy may join a local water district and be subject to the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 198 pursuant to Section 6 of said Decree, which is quoted as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 6. <i>Formation of District</i>. - This Act is the source of authorization and power to form and maintain a district. Once formed, a district is subject to the provisions of this Act and not under the jurisdiction of any political subdivision. To form a district, the legislative body of any city, municipality or <u>province</u> shall enact a resolution containing the following:<br><br>(a) The name of the local water district, which shall include the name of the city, municipality, or province, or region thereof, served by said system, followed by the words "Water District."<br><br>(b) A description of the boundary of the district. In the case of a city or municipality, such boundary may include all lands within the city or municipality. A district may include one or more municipalities, cities or provinces, or portions thereof.<br><br>(c) A statement of intent to transfer any and all waterworks and/or sewerage facilities owned by such city, municipality or province to such district pursuant to a contract authorized by Section 31(b) of this Title.<br><br>(d) A statement identifying the purpose for which the district is formed, which shall include those purposes outlined in Section 5 above.<br><br>(e) The names of the initial directors of the district with the date of expiration of term of office for each.<br><br>(f) A statement that the district may only be dissolved on the grounds and under the conditions set forth in Section 44 of this Title.<br><br>(g) A statement acknowledging the powers, rights and obligations as set forth in Section 36 of this Title.<br><br>Nothing in the resolution of formation shall state or infer that the local legislative body has the power to dissolve, alter or affect the district beyond that specifically provided for in this Act.<br><br>If two or more cities, municipalities or provinces, or any combination thereof, desire to form a single district, a similar resolution shall be adopted in each city, municipality and province.<br></blockquote><b>Secondly,</b> the majority opinion indulged itself in constitutionally objectionable judicial legislation by effectively amending Section 3(b) of Presidential Decree No. 198, which provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 3. <i>Definitions</i>. - x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b) <i>Appointing authority</i>. - The person empowered to appoint the members of the board of Directors of a local water district, depending upon the geographic coverage and population make-up of the particular district. In the event that more than seventy-five percent of the total acting water service connections of a local water district are within the boundary of any city or municipality, the appointing authority shall be the mayor of that city or municipality, as the case may be; otherwise, the appointing authority shall be the governor of the province within which the district is located. If portions of more than one province are included within the boundary of the district, and the appointing authority is to be the governors then the power to appoint shall rotate between the governors involved with the initial appointments made by the governor in whose province the greatest number of service connections exists.<br></blockquote>The majority opinion criticized the 75% threshold prescribed by Section 3(b) of Presidential Decree No. 198 to vest an LGU with the power to appoint the members of the Board of Directors of the local water district, and in doing so, framed it within the supposed violation of the due process clause and equal protection of the laws.<br><br>We only need to underscore the legislative process that each LGU should go through to become a part of a local water district and to be subject to the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 198. It is a conscious and deliberate decision reached by an LGU through its legislative body or Sanggunian which should follow the procedure prescribed by law for the enactment of a resolution. It is for the said legislative body to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages, if any, of joining a local water district. Furthermore, for this Court to say that there was a denial of substantive due process of law and equal protection of the law, it must first closely scrutinize not only one provision of Presidential Decree No. 198 but all of its other provisions, particularly those pertaining to the power, rights and obligations of the component LGUs of the local water district. This the majority opinion failed to do.

The provincial governor has no power to appoint members of Metropolitan Cebu Water District's (MCWD) board.<br><br>This case involves the validity and proper interpretation of Section 3(b) of Presidential Decree No. 198 or the Provincial Water Utilities Act of 1973. Metropolitan Cebu Water District, having been created in 1974 by virtue of this Decree, was subject to its provisions including that in dispute:<br><blockquote>Section 3. <i>Definitions</i>. - As used in this Decree, the following words and terms shall have the meanings herein set forth, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context.

In the event that more than seventy-five percent of the total active water service connections of a local water district are within the boundary of any city or municipality, the appointing authority shall be the mayor of that city or municipality, as the case may be; otherwise, the appointing authority shall be the governor of the province within which the district is located. If portions of more than one province are included within the boundary of the district, and the appointing authority is to be the governors then the power to appoint shall rotate between the governors involved with the initial appointments made by the governor in whose province the greatest number of service connections exists.<br></div></blockquote>The controversy started when in 2002, after consistent exercise by the Cebu City Mayor of the power to appoint MCWD directors from 1974 to 2002, the Governor of the Province of Cebu decided to assert her power of appointment. The Governor claims that the provision gives her the power to appoint directors of MCWD whenever none of the cities or municipalities covered by MCWD holds seventy-five percent (75%) of its total active water service connections.<br><br>Despite the Provincial Governor's claim, however, the Cebu City Mayor exercised the authority when he appointed Joel Mari S. Yu in 2008 to fill a vacant seat in MCWD's board of directors.<br><br>Both the Mayor of Cebu City and the Provincial Governor of Cebu claim authority to appoint directors of MCWD in case none of the cities or municipalities covered by MCWD reaches seventy-five percent (75%) of its total active water service connections.<br><br>Petitioners claim that Section 3(b) of Presidential Decree No. 198 is unconstitutional because it violates Cebu City's local autonomy, and the due process and equal protection clause. The provincial government had not participated in the creation of MCWD. Cebu City also holds majority, though not 75% of MCWD's total active water service connections. Hence, Cebu City's Mayor and not Cebu's Provincial Governor should be given the power to appoint directors of MCWD.<br><br>On the other hand, respondents claim that Section 3(b) of Presidential Decree No. 198 is clear that if the 75% requirement under Section 3(b) of Presidential Decree No. 198 is not met, it is the Provincial Governor who has the authority to appoint MCWD directors.<br><br>We are asked to determine whether Section 3(b) of Presidential Decree No. 198 is unconstitutional.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Section 3(b) of Presidential Decree No. 198 is unconstitutional because it violates the local autonomy of cities and municipalities covered by MCWD.

Without hampering them by too specific instructions, they should in general be enjoined, <i>after making themselves familiar with the conditions and needs of the country, to devote their attention in the first instance to the establishment of municipal governments, in which the natives of the islands, both in the cities and in the rural communities, shall be afforded the opportunity to manage their own local affairs to the fullest extent of which they are capable, and subject to the least degree of supervision and control which a careful study of their capacities and observations of the workings of native control show to be consistent with the maintenance of law, order, and loyalty</i>.<br><br><i>The next subject in order of importance should be the organization of government in the larger administrative divisions corresponding to counties, departments, or provinces, in which the common interests of many or several municipalities falling within the same tribal lines, or the same natural geographical limits, may best be subserved by a common administration.</i> Whenever the commission is of the opinion that the condition of affairs in the islands is such that the central administration may safely be transferred from military to civil control, they will report that conclusion to you, with their recommendations as to the form of central government to be established for the purpose of taking over the control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Local government autonomy had been impliedly adopted as State policy as early as 1935 when our Constitution defined the kind of power that the President may exercise over executive departments and local governments. Article VII, Section 11(1) of the 1935 Constitution provided that the President exercised control over executive departments. However, the President's power over local governments was limited to general supervision:<br><blockquote>SEC. 11. (1) The President shall have control of all the executive departments, bureaus, or offices, exercise general supervision over all local governments as may be provided by law, and take care that the laws be faithfully executed.<br></blockquote>"Control" has been consistently defined in our jurisprudence as the power to "alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On the other hand, "supervision" has been defined as "overseeing, or the power or authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their duties, and to take such action as prescribed by law to compel his subordinates to perform their duties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>This court further explained the difference between "control" and "supervision" in <i>Drilon v. Lim</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><blockquote>An officer in control lays down the rules in the doing of an act. If they are not followed, he may, in his discretion, order the act undone or re­ done by his subordinate or he may even decide to do it himself. Supervision does not cover such authority. The supervisor or superintendent merely sees to it that the rules are followed, but he himself does not lay down such rules, nor does he have the discretion to modify or replace them. If the rules are not observed, he may order the work done or re-done but only to conform to the prescribed rules. He may not prescribe his own manner for the doing of the act. He has no judgment on this matter except to see to it that the rules are followed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, when the 1935 Constitution limited the President's power over local government units to supervision, he or she had been proscribed from interfering or taking an active part in the affairs of local government units. The State, at that time, had already recognized local autonomy as a means to more effectively determine and address local concerns.<br><br>The principle of local autonomy was expressly adopted as a State policy in Article II, Section 10 of 1973 Constitution:<br><blockquote>SEC. 10. The State shall guarantee and promote the autonomy of local government units, especially the [barangays], to ensure their fullest development as self-reliant communities.<br></blockquote>A similar provision can be found among the State policies enumerated in Article II of the 1987 Constitution:<br><blockquote>SECTION 25. The State shall ensure the autonomy of local governments.<br></blockquote>Both the 1973 Constitution and the 1987 Constitution devoted a whole Article to local governments as a means to institutionalize the principle of local autonomy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The Article XI<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of the 1973 Constitution enjoined the enactment of a Local Government Code. It defined the relationship between local government units with their component units.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> It explicitly gave local government units a form of fiscal independence by giving them power to create their own revenues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>As a reflection of the increasing importance our State gives to local autonomy, the present Constitution expanded the 1973 Constitution's Article XI to reiterate the guarantee that local governments shall enjoy local autonomy. Section 2 of Article X provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 2. The territorial and political subdivisions shall enjoy local autonomy.<br></blockquote>Aside from the power to create their own revenues, the present Constitution gave local governments entitlement to shares in the national taxes and in proceeds of the utilization of their wealth and resources.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Local government units were also guaranteed sectoral representation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Further, the present Constitution created autonomous regions for areas "sharing common and distinctive historical and cultural heritage, economic and social structures[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The present Constitution, like the 1935 Constitution provides that the President's power over local government units is limited to general supervision. Thus:<br><blockquote>SECTION 4. The President of the Philippines shall exercise general supervision over local governments. Provinces with respect to component cities and municipalities, and cities and municipalities with respect to component barangays shall ensure that the acts of their component units are within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>In other words, the present Constitution reiterated that not even the President may determine and dictate how local government units' duties shall be performed.<br><br>The autonomy guaranteed by the Constitution to local government units should apply not only against the national government but also against other local government units. After all, Section 4 of Article X of the Constitution does not limit only the President's powers over local government units but also the local government units' powers over other local government units. It provides that provinces and cities or municipalities shall only "ensure that the acts of their component units are within the scope of their prescribed powers and functions." This, essentially, refers only to the power of supervision.<br><br>Thus, the national government may only exercise supervisory powers over local government units. Similarly, local government units may only exercise supervisory powers over their component units. Provinces do not exercise control over their component cities and/or municipalities and over highly urbanized cities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Cities or municipalities do not control their barangays.<br><br>The Local Government Code has a general welfare clause that provides local government units with as much power necessary to "[accelerate] economic development and [upgrade] the quality of life for the people in the community[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Section 16 of the Local Government Code provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 16. General Welfare. - Every local government unit shall exercise the powers expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance, and those which are essential to the promotion of the general welfare. Within their respective territorial jurisdictions, local government units shall ensure and support, among other things, the preservation and enrichment of culture, promote health and safety, enhance the right of the people to a balanced ecology, encourage and support the development of appropriate and self-reliant scientific and technological capabilities, improve public morals, enhance economic prosperity and social justice, promote full employment among their residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve the comfort and convenience of their inhabitants.<br></blockquote>Further, the Local Government Code provides that local government units "shall endeavor to be self-reliant"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and shall be responsible for providing the basic services needed by its constituents. Thus:<br><blockquote>SECTION 17.

Provisions granting powers to the provincial government should not only be interpreted in a manner that favors its own local autonomy, but also the local autonomy of local government units outside its control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The spirit of the principle of local autonomy is upheld if local government units are allowed to exercise the most degree of control possible over its policies and operations to the exclusion of other local government units.<br><br>Thus, to attain the goals of giving local autonomy to local governments, the smallest possible unit of local government should be allowed to determine and provide the basic services needed by its constituents in accordance with the Local Government Code. More than the provincial government, municipalities and cities are more familiar with the needs and are more capable of determining the best policies that would serve their constituents.<br><br>Since MCWD's polices are created by MCWD's Board of Directors,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the appointment of directors is the only means by which local government units may exercise control over the policies that will be implemented by MCWD. Any exercise of this appointment power entails great consideration not only of the needs of the most affected but also judgment as to whose decisions could best determine and serve the needs of the local community. The person who could make such judgment is not the governor but the mayor of the most number of barangays served by MCWD. It is that city or municipality that will be most affected by the decisions and policies of the board of directors of MCWD.<br><br>Thus, the power to appoint MCWD's directors may not be taken away by the provincial government from the cities or municipalities covered by MCWD without violating their local autonomy. This interpretation is in consonance with the spirit of the principle of local autonomy. It is in accordance with our state policy to foster self-reliant communities and accountable systems of government.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Further, the presumption of constitutionality accorded to laws passed by Congress should not apply in the same degree to presidential decrees. Presidential decrees and laws passed by the Congress do not belong in the same category.<br><br>The presumption of constitutionality enjoyed by laws is based on the principle of separation of powers implied under our Constitution.<br><br>The executive, legislative, and judicial branches each has distinct powers and duties, which may not be encroached upon by the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>"The executive power [is] vested in the President of the Philippines,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> who must ensure the faithful execution of laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Judicial power is vested upon courts, whose duties, essentially, is to settle actual controversies and declare acts, in proper cases, as void for being an exercise of grave abuse of discretion or for being unconstitutional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Legislative powers are vested solely upon the Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It is the Congress, composed of senators and representatives elected periodically by the people, that enact laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>"The principle [of separation of powers] presupposes mutual respect by and between the executive, legislative and judicial departments of the government and calls for them to be left alone to discharge their duties as they see fit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The principle of separation of powers prevents government powers from being concentrated in one branch of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It has been theorized that a combination of any of the government powers into one person "would create a system with an inherent tendency towards tyrannical actions[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Thus, the principle of separation of powers under our present Constitution ensures that none of the branches are superior to another. The three branches of the government are considered co-equal branches.<br><br>Our Constitution, however, also recognizes the need for coordination among the three branches of the government. Hence, the three branches operate under a system of checks and balances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Each government branch has a means of checking the workings of another branch.<br><br>In <i>Angara v. Electoral Commission</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><blockquote>But it does not follow from the fact that the three powers are to be kept separate and distinct that the Constitution intended them to be absolutely unrestrained and independent of each other. The Constitution has provided for an elaborate system of checks and balances to secure coordination in the workings of the various departments of the government. For example, the Chief Executive under our Constitution is so far made a check on the legislative power that this assent is required in the enactment of laws. This, however, is subject to the further check that a bill may become a law notwithstanding the refusal of the President to approve it, by a vote of two-thirds or three-fourths, as the case may be, of the National Assembly. The President has also the right to convene the Assembly in special session whenever he chooses. On the other hand, the National Assembly operates as a check on the Executive in the sense that its consent through its Commission on Appointments is necessary in the appointment of certain officers; and the concurrence of a majority of all its members is essential to the conclusion of treaties. Furthermore, in its power to determine what courts other than the Supreme Court shall be established, to define their jurisdiction and to appropriate funds for their support, the National Assembly controls the judicial department to a certain extent. The Assembly also exercises the judicial power of trying impeachments. And the judiciary in turn, with the Supreme Court as the final arbiter, effectively checks the other departments in the exercise of its power to determine the law, and hence to declare executive and legislative acts void if violative of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>The presumption of constitutionality accorded to laws passed by the Congress also recognizes the meticulousness imposed by our Constitution on the process by which the legislative department should promulgate laws. Each law passed by the legislative department undergoes three readings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In between those readings, public hearings may be conducted wherein the representatives from the public and private sectors, members of the academe, and experts in the field related to the proposed law may participate. The law may also undergo discussions and debates. Opinions by the representatives from the public, private, and academic communities and the differences that emerge from the discussions and debates will result to several amendments of the proposed law before its actual passage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> After its passage by the Congress, the law shall be submitted to the President for approval.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In sum, the principles of separation of powers, the special process of legislation that allows participation of representatives of the people and the operation of the system of checks and balances provide bases for the presumption of constitutionality we accord to legislative enactments. In <i>Angara v. Electoral Commission</i>:<br><blockquote>More than that, courts accord the presumption of constitutionality to legislative enactments, not only because the legislature is presumed to abide by the Constitution but also because <i>the judiciary in the determination of actual cases and controversies must reflect the wisdom and justice of the people as expressed through their representatives in the executive and legislative departments</i> of the government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In <i>Romualdez v. Hon. Sandiganbayan</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><blockquote>In <i>Garcia v. Executive Secretary</i>, the rationale for the presumption of constitutionality was explained by this Court thus:<br><blockquote>"The policy of the courts is to avoid ruling on constitutional questions and to presume that the acts of the political departments are valid in the absence of a clear and unmistakable showing to the contrary. To doubt is to sustain. This presumption is based on the doctrine of separation of powers which enjoins upon each department a becoming respect for the acts of the other departments. <i>The theory is that as the joint act of Congress and the President of the Philippines, a law has been carefully studied and determined to be in accordance with the fundamental law before it was finally enacted.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote></blockquote>In <i>Lawyers Against Monopoly and Poverty (LAMP), et al. vs. The Secretary of Budget and Management, et al.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><blockquote>In determining whether or not a statute is unconstitutional, the Court does not lose sight of the presumption of validity accorded to statutory acts of Congress. In <i>Fariñas v. The Executive Secretary</i>, the Court held that:<br><blockquote>Every statute is presumed valid. The presumption is that the legislature intended to enact a valid, sensible and just law and one which operates no further than may be necessary to effectuate the specific purpose of the law. Every presumption should be indulged in favor of the constitutionality and the burden of proof is on the party alleging that there is a clear and unequivocal breach of the Constitution.<br></blockquote>To justify the nullification of the law or its implementation, there must be a clear and unequivocal, not a doubtful, breach of the Constitution. In case of doubt in the sufficiency of proof establishing unconstitutionality, the Court must sustain legislation because "<i>to invalidate [a law] based on x x x baseless supposition is an affront to the wisdom not only of the legislature that passed it but also of the executive which approved it</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>These principles were inoperative when President Ferdinand Marcos issued presidential decrees. Presidential decrees were laws promulgated by President Ferdinand Marcos in arrogation of the Congress' legislative powers, under his martial law powers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> The issuance of presidential decrees at that time was an exercise by the executive of his legislative powers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>This was made possible in the 1973 Constitution, which had provisions allowing for such combined powers. Under the 1973 Constitution, the President may exercise legislative powers as long as martial law was in effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Thus, the premises for according in favor of statues a presumption of constitutionality are absent in presidential decrees. Separation of powers, as well as the principle of checks and balances, were limited during the martial law. Indeed, presidential decrees are laws, but they are laws that did not undergo the careful process of discussion, debates, approval and disapproval by representatives of the people. They are not in reality the product of two government branches in coordination and in accordance with the system of checks of balances. They are essentially laws issued by one person.<br><br>Hence, presidential decrees and statutes promulgated by the Congress should not be examined under the same lens. The presumption of constitutionality accorded to legislative acts by the Congress should not equally apply to presidential decrees. The courts should consider the different circumstances under which presidential decrees were issued whenever they examine their validity. Presidential decrees should undergo a stricter review than statutes promulgated by the Congress.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to GRANT the Petition.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> LOCAL GOVT.
