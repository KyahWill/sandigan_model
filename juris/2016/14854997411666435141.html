However, the rate of agency fees it seeks to collect from the non-PEU members is contested, considering its failure to comply with the requirements for a valid increase of union dues, rendering the collection of increased agency fees unjustified.<br><br>Case law interpreting Article 250 (n) and (o)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (formerly Article 241) of the Labor Code, as amended, mandates the submission of three (3) documentary requisites in order to justify a valid levy of increased union dues. These are: <i>(a)</i> an authorization by a written resolution of the majority of all the members at the general membership meeting duly called for the purpose; <i>(b)</i> the secretary's record of the minutes of the meeting, which shall include the list of all members present, the votes cast, the purpose of the special assessment or fees and the recipient of such assessment or fees;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and <i>(c)</i> individual written authorizations for check-off duly signed by the employees concerned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In the present case, however, PEU-NUWHRAIN failed to show compliance with the foregoing requirements. It attempted to remedy the "inadvertent omission" of the matter of the approval of the deduction of two percent (2%) union dues from the monthly basic salary of each union member through the July 1, 2010 GMR,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> entitled "A GENERAL MEMBERSHIP RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE DEDUCTION OF TWO PERCENT (2%) UNION DUES FROM THE MONTHLY BASIC SALARY OF EACH UNION MEMBER," which stated, among others, that:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>the General Membership Assembly (Assembly) "approved the deduction of two percent (2%) union dues from the monthly basic salary of each union member" during its 8<sup>th</sup> General Membership Meeting, <u>as shown in the October 28, 2008 minutes</u>;<br><br></li><li>"through inadvertence, the [October 28, 2008 GMR] failed to include the Assembly's approval of the two percent (2%) deduction of union dues;"<br><br></li><li>the July 1, 2010 GMR is being issued "to confirm and affirm what was agreed upon during the 8<sup>th</sup> General Membership Meeting dated October 28, 2008."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br><br>On the other hand, the adverted October 28, 2008 minutes<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> stated, <i>inter alia, </i> that:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>"the [two percent (2%)] Union dues will have to be implemented since PEU was already affiliated with NUWHRAIN [in] 2007";<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]<br><br></sup></li><li>"it was discussed, deliberated and approved by the majority of members the (sic) 10% of total CBA back wages through [the Assembly] resolution authorizing the payment of attorney's fees."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br><br>It is evident from the foregoing that while the matter of implementing the two percent (2%) union dues was taken up during the PEU-NUWHRAIN's 8<sup>th</sup> General Membership Meeting on October 28, 2008, <u><i>there was no sufficient showing that the same had been duly deliberated and approved. </i></u>The minutes of the Assembly itself belie PEU-NUWHRAIN's claim that the increase in union dues and the corresponding check-off were duly approved since it merely stated that "<u>the [two percent (2%)] Union dues will have to be implemented</u>,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> meaning, it would still require the submission of such matter to the Assembly for deliberation and approval Such conclusion is bolstered by the silence of the October 28, 2008 GMR on the matter of two percent (2%) union dues, <i>in contrast </i>to the payment of 10% attorney's fees from the CBA backwages which was clearly spelled out as having been "<u>discussed and approved</u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Thus, as aptly pointed out by the CA: "<u>[i]f indeed majority of the members of [PEU-NUWHRAIN] approved the increase in union dues, the same should have been mentioned in the [October 28, 2008 minutes], and reflected in the GMR of the same date</u>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Having failed to establish due deliberation and approval of the increase in union dues from one percent (1%) to two percent (2%), as well as the deduction of the two percent (2%) union dues during PEU-NUWHRAIN's 8<sup>th</sup> General Membership Meeting on October 28, 2008, there was nothing to confirm, affirm, or ratify through the July 1, 2010 GMR. Contrary to the ruling of the OSEC in its March 6, 2012 Order, the July 1, 2010 GMR, by itself, cannot justify the collection of two percent (2%) agency fees from the non-PEU members beginning July 2010. The Assembly was not called for the purpose of approving the proposed increase in union dues and the corresponding check-off, but merely to "confirm and affirm" a purported prior action which PEU-NUWHRAIN, however, failed to establish.<br><br>Corollarily, no individual check-off authorizations can proceed therefrom, and the submission of the November 2008 check-off authorizations<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[56]</sup></font> becomes inconsequential. Jurisprudence states that the express consent of the employee to any deduction in his compensation is required to be obtained in accordance with the steps outlined by the law, <b>which must be followed to the letter;</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> however, PEU-NUWHRAIN failed to comply. Thus, the CA correctly ruled that there is no legal basis to impose union dues and agency fees more than that allowed in the expired CBA, <i>i.e., </i>at one percent (1%) of the employee's monthly basic salary.<br><br>In fine, the Court finds no reversible error on the part of the CA in granting petitioner's <i>certiorari </i>petition, and finding that the OSEC gravely abused its discretion in declaring PEU-NUWHRAIN's entitlement to collect two percent (2%) agency fees from the non-PEU members beginning July 2010. The OSEC's March 6, 2012 Order is patently contrary to law, hence, imbued with grave abuse of discretion correctible through <i>certiorari.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>DENIED.</b> The Decision dated February 9, 2015 and the Resolution dated May 21, 2015 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R.
