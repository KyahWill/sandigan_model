Bernardino (Bernardino) unenforceable and having no effect for the reason that the subrogation agreement, a condition precedent, was not executed.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>In 1995, Marcopper Mining Corporation (MMC) obtained an unsecured bridge loan from RCBC in the amount of US$13.7 Million to finance the acquisition of twelve (12) Rig Mining Trucks and one (1) Demag Excavator Shovel. Payment of the bridge loan was supposed to be sourced from the proceeds of a long term loan MMC was seeking from Export-Import Bank (EXIM Bank). EXIM Bank, however, failed to approve the long term loan due to a tailing spill in MMC's mining area in Marinduque which caused the stoppage of MMC's operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Concerned that the short term loan it extended to MMC was unsecured, RCBC negotiated with MMC to provide collateral or security. MMC yielded to RCBC's request and decided to mortgage twelve (12) units of Rig Haul Trucks and one (1) Demag Hydraulic Excavator Shovel covered by a Deed of Chattel Mortgage dated April 23, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Additionally, MMC pledged shares of stocks covered by Deeds of Pledge dated August 29, 1996<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and September 9, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> RCBC later expressed interest in substituting these collaterals with MMC's residential property in Forbes Park (Forbes Park property), which was mortgaged with the Asian Development Bank (ADB).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In a letter dated July 1, 1997<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> to RCBC, MMC proposed two (2) options for the payment of its loan, to wit:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">1) </div></td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">Initiate a foreclosure on the mortgaged assets, thereby realizing a maximum cash proceeds of about $11.6 Million.

It was docketed as Civil Case No. 98-185 and filed before Branch 59 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City.

As its counterclaims, RCBC prayed that Bernardino be declared jointly and severally liable with MMC to pay RCBC the principal amount due under the promissory notes, including the interest and stipulated penalty therein, as well as attorney's fees and damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Ruling of the Trial Court</b><br></center><br>Before resolving the complaint, the RTC, Branch 59, Makati City pointed out that a separate complaint for specific performance docketed as Civil Case No. 98-1661 was filed by MMC against RCBC before the RTC, Branch 57, Makati City. In that case, the issue involved was whether RCBC may be ordered to execute a Deed of Partial Release of Mortgage. The RTC, Branch 57, Makati City ruled in favor of MMC. On appeal, the CA affirmed the RTC Decision. Considering that the issue had been passed upon in Civil Case No. 98-1661, which was then on appeal before us, the RTC, Branch 59 limited the issue before it to the validity of the surety agreements executed by Bernardino.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Ruling in favor of Bernardino, the RTC, Branch 59, Makati City held that he was able to establish his claim by preponderance of evidence. It ruled that the subrogation agreement was a condition precedent before Bernardino may be held liable under the comprehensive surety agreements. Since there was no subrogation agreement, the comprehensive surety agreements are unenforceable and have no effect. The dispositive portion of the RTC Decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff, declaring that for RCBC's unjust refusal to execute the necessary subrogation agreement which is a condition precedent before plaintiff may be held liable under the comprehensive surety agreements, the same are declared unenforceable and of no effect.<br><br>Defendant is also ordered to pay plaintiff the following sums:<br><br>1) P100,000.00 as moral damages;<br>2) P100,000.00 as nominal and exemplary damages;<br>3) P957,540.94 as attorney's fees;<br>4) P44,519.03 as litigation expenses; and<br>5) Costs of suit against herein defendant.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b><br></div><br>The CA denied RCBC's appeal and affirmed the RTC Decision. The CA agreed with the trial court that MMC was led to believe that RCBC agreed to execute a subrogation agreement in favor of Bernardino and to effect a release of the mortgage and pledge.<br><br>The CA also denied RCBC's motion for reconsideration in a Resolution dated July 22, 2008.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Hence, this petition, which raises the main issue of whether RCBC and Bernardino agreed that a subrogation agreement be executed as a condition precedent before Bernardino can be held liable under the surety agreements.<br><br>RCBC maintains that in affirming the Decision of the RTC, the CA, in grave error of law, blatantly disregarded:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Article 1403 of the Civil Code on what constitutes unenforceable contracts.

The issue on whether RCBC had agreed to a release of the six (6) Rig Haul Trucks, one (1) Demag Hydraulic Excavator Shovel, and shares of stock in favor of MMC has already been settled in <i>Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Marcopper Mining Corporation</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>As a rule, we are not a trier of facts. Our jurisdiction in a Rule 45 petition is limited to the review of pure questions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Factual findings of the lower court, especially when affirmed by the appellate court, are usually binding to us.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> However, this rule admits of certain exceptions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> three of which apply in this case: 1) when the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises and conjectures; 2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; and 3) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts. As such, we find it warranted to depart from the general rule and re-examine the facts of the case.<br><br><i>Bernardino failed to establish the existence of a subrogation agreement, that operates as a condition precedent to the surety agreement.</i><br><br>It is a basic rule in evidence that the burden of proof lies upon him who asserts it, not upon him who denies, since, by the nature of things, he who denies a fact cannot produce any proof of it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Thus, the party, whether plaintiff or defendant, who asserts the affirmative of an issue has the <i>onus</i> to prove his assertion in order to obtain a favorable judgment. For the plaintiff, the burden to prove its positive assertions never parts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>As plaintiff in the court <i>a quo</i>, therefore, it was imperative upon Bernardino to prove the allegations in his complaint. The burden of proof will not vest on RCBC the obligation to prove that the subrogation agreement was not a condition precedent before Bernardino may be held liable under the comprehensive surety agreements. Bernardino, however, was unable to discharge this burden. He was unable to establish his cause of action through preponderance of evidence which is the degree of proof required in civil cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Preponderance of evidence is the weight, credit, and value of the aggregate evidence on either side and is usually considered to be synonymous with the term "greater weight of evidence" or "greater weight of the credible evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Preponderance of evidence is a phrase which, in the last analysis, means probability to truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It is evidence which is more convincing to the court as worthier of belief than that which is offered in opposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Here, Bernardino asserted that the surety agreements he signed in favor of RCBC were ineffectual because the subrogation agreement, which the parties had allegedly agreed to execute as a condition precedent, were not executed.<br><br>Both the RTC and the CA gave credence to the testimonies of Bernardino and his witness, Nestor Escalante (Escalante). True, findings by the trial court as to the credibility of witnesses are accorded the greatest respect, and even finality by the appellate courts, since the former is in a better position to observe their demeanor as well as their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In this case, however, the RTC and the CA overlooked certain significant facts in the testimonies of Bernardino's witnesses.<br><br>Bernardino harped on the testimony of Atty. Dueñas that the parties indeed agreed to execute a subrogation agreement. But Atty. Dueñas' testimony is far from being corroborative to the testimonies of Bernardino and Escalante. On the contrary, it is unreliable and inconclusive for being unclear and ambiguous.

We disagree. Although Rojas could not recall some details of the meetings, We find these details innocuous and merely incidental. Rojas cannot be expected to remember every single detail of the meeting with perfect recall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Far from adversely affecting his credibility, his failure to recall every minute detail of what transpired even fortifies it. We have held that the failure of a witness to recall each and every detail of an occurrence may even serve to strengthen rather than weaken his credibility because it erases any suspicion of a coached or rehearsed testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> What is clear from the testimony of Rojas is that the surety agreement was discussed and he was of the opinion, from the bank's perspective, that such security was not enough. Nowhere did he state or admit that the parties agreed to, much less discussed, a subrogation agreement as a condition precedent to the surety agreement.<br><br>In the same vein, Atty. Dueñas' testimony shows that in a series of meetings, the parties discussed a possible "arrangement on the transfer of the collateral" once Bernardino is called to pay the obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Atty. Dueñas testified that Bernardino proposed "that collateral be given him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> While this may pertain to the subrogation agreement Bernardino is claiming, what is glaringly absent from the discussions is the final agreement reached by the parties. For an offer to be binding, the acceptance must be absolute and must not qualify the terms of the offer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Where there is only a proposal and a counter-proposal that did not add up to a final arrangement, there is no meeting of the minds between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Thus, the surety agreements remain unconditional and their validity stands.<br><br>More importantly, the terms of the surety agreements are clear. When the terms of a contract are clear and unambiguous, they are to be read in their literal sense. When there is no ambiguity in the language of a contract, there is no room for construction, only compliance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> As we held in <i>Bautista v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><blockquote><b>The rule is that where the language of a contract is plain and unambiguous, its meaning should be determined without reference to extrinsic facts or aids. The intention of the parties must be gathered from that language, and from that language alone.</b> Stated differently, where the language of a written contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract must be taken to mean that which, on its face, it purports to mean, unless some good reason can be assigned to show that the words used should be understood in a different sense. <b>Courts cannot make for the parties better or more equitable agreements than they themselves have been satisfied to make, or rewrite contracts because they operate harshly or inequitably as to one of the parties, or alter them for the benefit of one party and to the detriment of the other, or by construction, relieve one of the parties from terms which he voluntarily consented to, or impose on him those which he did not.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Citation omitted; emphasis ours.)<br></blockquote>The surety agreements do not include or refer to the execution of a subrogation agreement as a condition precedent before Bernardino could be held liable. Bernardino cannot now come to court asking for the enforcement of an agreement which clearly does not appear in the written contract between him and RCBC.<br><br>The parol evidence rule, in general, restricts the evidence to the surety agreements between MMC and RCBC. The first paragraph of Section 9, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules on Evidence provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 9. <i>Evidence of written agreements</i>. — When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing, it is considered as containing all the terms agreed upon and there can be, between the parties and their successors-in-interest, no evidence of such terms other than the contents of the written agreement.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center></blockquote>Under this rule, when the parties have reduced their agreement into writing, they are deemed to have intended the written agreement to be the sole repository and memorial of everything that they have agreed upon. All their prior and contemporaneous agreements are deemed to be merged in the written document so that, as between them and their successors-in-interest, such writing becomes exclusive evidence of its terms and any verbal agreement which tends to vary, alter or modify it is not admissible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Whatever is not found in the writing is understood to have been waived and abandoned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> This must be so because an oral testimony on an alleged prior or contemporaneous agreement, such as the subrogation agreement subject of Bernardino's testimony in this case, comes from a party who has an interest in the outcome of the case and depends exclusively on human memory. Thus, it is not as reliable as written documentary evidence. Spoken words could be notoriously undesirable unlike a written contract which speaks of a uniform language.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Be that as it may, the rule prohibiting the presentation of parol evidence is not absolute. A party may present evidence to modify, explain or add to the terms of the written agreement if he puts in issue in his pleading any of the following:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">An intrinsic ambiguity, mistake or imperfection in the written agreement; </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td><td><divalign="justify"> The failure of the written agreement to express the true intent and agreement of the parties thereto;</divalign="justify"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(c) </div></td><td><divalign="justify">The validity of the written agreement; or</divalign="justify"></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(d) </div></td><td><divalign="justify">The existence of other terms agreed to by the parties or their successors-in-interest after the execution of the written agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></divalign="justify"></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In his Complaint, however, Bernardino did not plead any exception to the application of the parol evidence rule. All that he pleaded was the alleged collateral agreement with which RCBC must first comply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> We have uniformly held that it is only where a party puts in issue in his pleadings the failure of the written agreement to express the true intent of the parties that the party may present evidence to modify, explain or add to the terms of the written agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The failure of Bernardino, therefore, should have rendered the parol evidence inadmissible. However, no timely objection or protest was made against its admission and RCBC, against whom it was presented, cross-examined the witnesses who testified. Failure to object to the parol evidence constitutes a waiver to its ladmissibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, while admissibility of evidence is an affair of logic and law, determined as it is by its relevance and competence, the weight to be given to such evidence, once admitted, still depends on judicial evaluation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Contrary to the findings of the lower courts, we hold that the parol evidence fails to prove the existence of an alleged subrogation agreement between the parties.<br><br>Firstly, the correspondence exchanged by the parties show that no agreement on the execution of the subrogation agreement was reached. Bernardino claims that discussions about the subrogation agreement were held on a July 3, 1997 meeting, yet, when the. surety agreements were transmitted to RCBC on August 22, 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> he had already duly executed them with nary a colatilla, an addendum, or a disclaimer, about a subrogation agreement. In its letter dated November 24, 1997,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> MMC merely reminded RCBC that its restructured loan is covered by a surety issued by Bernardino, in addition to the other mortgaged equipment. These letters also show that MMC was only concerned with the release of the mining equipment and shares of stocks, but not with the execution of a subrogation agreement. What is even telling is that in the November 24, 1997 letter, MMC stated that the surety is <b>in addition</b> to the other collaterals mortgaged with RCBC. This refutes Bernardino's argument that these collaterals were meant to be retained by RCBC for his ultimate benefit after he pays the obligation of MMC and is subrogated to all the rights of RCBC as a creditor.<br><br>Secondly, significant parts in the testimonies of Rojas and Atty. Duefias, as earlier discussed, bolster RCBC's argument that there was no meeting of the minds between the parties that a subrogation agreement needs to be executed first before Bernardino can be held liable under the surety agreements.<br><br>Lastly, the exception to the parol evidence rule on the ground that the agreement fails to express the true intent of the parties obtains only where the written contract is so ambiguous or obscure in terms that the contractual intention of the parties cannot be understood from a mere reading of the instrument.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> As we have earlier pointed out, the surety agreements are clear and unambiguous. The contractual intention of the parties to bind Bernardino solidarity with MMC is readily understood from a reading of the surety agreements.<br><br><i>As surety, Bernardino is principally and solidarity liable for the obligations arising from the promissory notes.</i><br><br>In <i>Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Marcopper Mining Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> We reversed the lower courts and found that MMC failed to prove that the parties agreed for RCBC to execute a partial release of mortgage and pledge upon assignment to it of the Forbes Park property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> We also ruled favorably on the counterclaims of RCBC, with respect to the principal amount of MMC's promissory notes, the interest, penalties, and attorney's fees stipulated therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> We then directed MMC to pay the amounts expressly stipulated in Non-Negotiable Promissory Notes No. 21-3697 and 21-3797. The complete <i>fallo</i> of our Decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The assailed Decision dated June 6, 2005 and the Resolution dated December 8, 2005 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 77594 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

By guaranty a person, called the guarantor, binds himself to the creditor to fulfill the obligation of the principal debtor in case the latter should failto do so.<br><br>If a person binds himself solidarity with the principal debtor, the provisions of Section 4, Chapter 3, Title I of this Book shall be observed. In such case, the contract; is called a suretyship.<br></blockquote>Suretyship is a contractual relation resulting from an agreement whereby one person, the surety, engages to be answerable for the debt, default or miscarriage of another, known as the principal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> The surety's obligation is not an original and direct one for the performance of his own act, but merely accessory or collateral to the obligation contracted by the principal. Nevertheless, although the contract of a surety is in essence secondary only to a valid principal obligation, his liability to the creditor or promisee of the principal is said to be direct, primary and absolute;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> in other words, he is directly and equally bound with the principal. The surety therefore becomes liable for the debt or duty of another although he possesses no direct or personal interest over the obligations nor does he receive any benefit therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Bernardino cannot now renege on his obligation to pay the promissory notes under the claim that there was a previous agreement between the parties for RCBC to execute a subrogation agreement before Bernardino could be held liable under the surety agreements. We stress that the right to subrogation of a paying surety is by operation of law. Article 2067 of the Civil Code provides in part that the guarantor who, pays is subrogated to all the rights which the creditor had against the debtor. Although Article 2067 explicitly pertains to guarantors, the right to subrogation extends as well to sureties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Similarly, under Article 2071 of the Civil Code, a remedy available to a guarantor (or surety),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> even before having paid, is to demand a security from the principal debtor that shall protect the guarantor (or surety) from any proceedings by the creditor and the danger of insolvency of the debtor in certain cases. Thus:<br><blockquote>Article 2071. The guarantor, even before having paid, may proceed against the principal debtor:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">When he is sued for the payment;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> In case of insolvency of the principal debtor;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> When the debtor has bound himself to relieve him from the guaranty within a specified period, and this period has expired;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4) </div></td><td><div align="justify">When the debt has become demandable, by reason of the expiration of the period for payment;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(5) </div></td><td><div align="justify">After the lapse of ten years, when the principal obligation has no fixed period for its maturity, unless it be of such nature that it cannot be extinguished except within a period longer than ten years;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(6) </div></td><td><div align="justify">If there are reasonable grounds to fear that the principal debtor intends to abscond;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(7) </div></td><td><div align="justify">If the principal debtor is in imminent danger of becoming insolvent.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>x x x</blockquote>It is clear, therefore, that whatever right to a security Bernardino may have can only be demanded from MMC and not from RCBC.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
