				G.R. No. 174379, August 31, 2016</h4>
				<H3>E.I. DUPONT DE NEMOURS AND CO. (ASSIGNEE OF INVENTORS CARINI, DUNCIA AND WONG), PETITIONER, VS. DIRECTOR EMMA C. FRANCISCO (IN HER CAPACITY AS DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OFFICE), DIRECTOR EPIFANIO M. EVASCO (IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE DHUECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF PATENTS), AND THERAPHARMA, INC., RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR>DECISION</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A patent is granted to provide rights and protection to the inventor after an invention is disclosed to the public. It also seeks to restrain and prevent unauthorized persons from unjustly profiting from a protected invention. However, ideas not covered by a patent are free for the public to use and exploit. Thus, there are procedural rules on the application and grant of patents established to protect against any infringement. To balance the public interests involved, failure to comply with strict procedural rules will result in the failure to obtain a patent.<br><br>This resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assailing the Court of Appeals Amended Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated August 30, 2006, which denied the revival of Philippine Patent Application No. 35526, and the Court of Appeals Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated January 31, 2006, which granted the intervention of Therapharma, Inc. in the revival proceedings.<br><br>E.I. Dupont Nemours and Company (E.I. Dupont Nemours) is an American corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> It is the assignee of inventors David John Carini, John Jonas Vytautas Duncia, and Pancras Chor Bun Wong, all citizens of the United States of America.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On July 10, 1987, E.I. Dupont Nemours filed Philippine Patent Application No. 35526 before the Bureau of Patents, Trademarks, and Technology Transfer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The application was for Angiotensin II Receptor Blocking Imidazole (losartan), an invention related to the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The product was produced and marketed by Merck, Sharpe, and Dohme Corporation (Merck), E.I. Dupont Nemours' licensee, under the brand names Cozaar and Hyzaar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The patent application was handled by Atty. Nicanor D. Mapili (Atty. Mapili), a local resident agent who handled a majority of E.I. Dupont Nemours' patent applications in the Philippines from 1972 to 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On December 19, 2000, E.I. Dupont Nemours' new counsel, Ortega, Del Castillo, Bacorro, Odulio, Calma, and Carbonell,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> sent the Intellectual Property Office<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> a letter requesting that an office action be issued on Philippine Patent Application No. 35526.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>In response, Patent Examiner Precila O. Bulihan of the Intellectual Property Office sent an office action marked Paper No. 2 on January 30, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> which stated:<br><blockquote>The appointed attorney on record was the late Atty. Nicanor D. Mapili. The reconstituted documents provided no documents that will show that the authority to prosecute the instant application is now transferred to the present counsel. No official revocation on record is available.<br><br>Therefore, an official revocation of the Power of Attorney of the former counsel and the appointment of the present by the applicant is therefore required before further action can be undertaken.<br><ol>. . . .<br><br><li>Contrary to what was alleged, the Chemical Examining Division's (CED) record will show that as far as the said division is concerned, it did not fail to issue the proper and timely action on the instant application. CED record shows that the subject application was assigned to the examiner on June 7, 1988. A month after that was July 19, 1988, the first Office Action was mailed but was declared abandoned as of September 20, 1988 for applicant's failure to respond within the period as prescribed under Rule 112. Since then, no other official transactions were recorded. This record is complemented by the Examiner-in-charge's own record . . . .<br><br>. . . .<br><br></li><li>It was noted that it took thirteen (13) long years for the applicant to request for such Office Action. This is not expected of the applicant since it is an acceptable fact that almost all inventors/applicants wish for the early disposition for their applications.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>On May 29, 2002, E.I. Dupont Nemours replied to the office action by submitting a Power of Attorney executed by Miriam Meconnahey, authorizing Ortega, Castillo, Del Castillo, Bacorro, Odulio, Calma, and Carbonell to prosecute and handle its patent applications.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> On the same day, it also filed a Petition for Revival with Cost of Philippine Patent Application No. 35526.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In its Petition for Revival, E.I. Dupont Nemours argued that its former counsel, Atty. Mapili, did not inform it about the abandonment of the application, and it was not aware that Atty. Mapili had already died.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> It argued that it discovered Atty. Mapili's death when its senior-level patent attorney visited the Philippines in 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It argued that it only had actual notice of the abandonment on January 30, 2002, the date of Paper No. 2.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Thus, it argued that its Petition for Revival was properly filed under Section 113 of the 1962 Revised Rules of Practice before the Philippines Patent Office in Patent Cases (1962 Revised Rules of Practice).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On April 18, 2002, the Director of Patents denied the Petition for Revival for having been filed out of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> stated:<br><blockquote>Propriety dictates that the well-settled rule on agency should be applied to this case to maintain the objectivity and discipline of the Office. Therefore, for cases such as the instant case, let the Office maintain its position that mistakes of the counsel bind the client,' regardless of the degree of negligence committed by the former counsel. Although it appears that the former counsel, Arty. Nicanor Mapili was remiss in his obligations as counsel for the applicants, the Office cannot revive the abandoned application because of the limitations provided in Rule 115. Clearly, the Petition for Revival was filed beyond the reglementary period. Since the law and rules do not give the Director of Patents the discretion to stretch the period for revival, the Office is constrained to apply Rule 115 to the instant case.<br><br>In view of the foregoing considerations, applicants' petition to revive the subject application is hereby denied.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>E.I. Dupont Nemours appealed the denial to the Director-General of the Intellectual Property Office on August 26, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated October 22, 2003, Director-General Emma C. Francisco denied the appeal and affirmed the Resolution of the Director of Patents.<br><br>On November 21, 2003, petitioner filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for Review seeking to set aside the Intellectual Property Office's Decision dated October 22, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>On August 31, 2004, the Court of Appeals granted the Petition for Review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In allowing the Petition for Revival, the Court of Appeals stated:<br><blockquote>After an exhaustive examination of the records of this case, this Court believes that there is sufficient justification to relax the application of the above-cited doctrine in this case, and to afford petitioner some relief from the gross negligence committed by its former lawyer, Atty. Nicanor D. Mapili[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>The Office of the Solicitor General, on behalf of the Intellectual Property Office, moved for reconsideration of this Decision on September 22, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In the interim, Therapharma, Inc. moved for leave to intervene and admit the Attached Motion for Reconsideration dated October 11, 2004<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and argued that the Court of Appeals' August 31, 2004 Decision directly affects its "vested" rights to sell its own product.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Therapharma, Inc. alleged that on January 4, 2003, it filed before the Bureau of Food and Drugs its own application for a losartan product "Lifezar," a medication for hypertension, which the Bureau granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It argued that it made a search of existing patent applications for similar products before its application, and that no existing patent registration was found since E.I. Dupont Nemours' application for its losartan product was considered abandoned by the Bureau of Patents, Trademarks, and Technology Transfer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It alleged that sometime in 2003 to 2004, there was an exchange of correspondence between Therapharma, Inc. and Merck. In this exchange, Merck informed Therapharma, Inc. that it was pursuing a patent on the losartan products in the Philippines and that it would pursue any legal action necessary to protect its product.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>On January 31, 2006, the Court of Appeals issued the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> granting the Motion for Leave to Intervene. According to the Court of Appeals, Therapharma, Inc. had an interest in the revival of E.I. Dupont Nemours' patent application since it was the local competitor for the losartan product.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> It stated that even if the Petition for Review was premised on the revival of the patent application, Therapharma, Inc.'s intervention was not premature since E.I. Dupont Nemours, through Merck, already threatened Therapharma, Inc. with legal action if it continued to market its losartan product.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>E.I. Dupont Nemours moved for reconsideration on February 22, 2006, assailing the Court of Appeals' January 31, 2006 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>On August 30, 2006, the Court of Appeals resolved both Motions for Reconsideration and rendered the Amended Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> reversing its August 31, 2004 Decision.<br><br>The Court of Appeals ruled that the public interest would be prejudiced by the revival of E.I. Dupont Nemours' application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> It found that losartan was used to treat hypertension, "a chronic ailment afflicting an estimated 12.6 million Filipinos,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and noted that the presence of competition lowered the price for losartan products.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> It also found that the revival of the application prejudiced Therapharma, Inc.'s interest, in that it had already invested more than P20,000,000.00 to develop its own losartan product and that it acted in good faith when it marketed its product.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals likewise found that it erroneously based its August 31, 2004 Decision on E.I Dupont Nemours' allegation that it took seven (7) to 13 years for the Intellectual Property Office to act on a patent application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> It stated that while it might have taken that long to issue the patent, it did not take that long for the Intellectual Property Office to act on application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Citing <i>Schuartz v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> it found that both E.I. Dupont Nemours and Arty. Mapili were inexcusably negligent in prosecuting the patent application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>On October 19, 2006, petitioner E.I. Dupont Nemours filed before this Court this Petition for Review on Certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Both respondents Intellectual Property Office and Therapharma, Inc. were directed to comment on the comment on the Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Upon submission of their respective Comments,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> petitioner was directed to file its Consolidated Reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Thereafter, the parties were directed to file their respective memoranda.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The arguments of the parties present several issues for this Court's resolution, as follows:<br><br>First, whether the Petition for Review on Certiorari complied with Rule 45, Section 4 of the Rules of Court when petitioner failed to attach certain documents to support the allegations in the complaint;<br><br>Second, whether petitioner should have filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court;<br><br>Third, whether the Petition for Review on Certiorari raises questions of fact;<br><br>Fourth, whether the Court of Appeals erred in allowing the intervention of respondent Therapharma, Inc. in petitioner's appeal;<br><br>Fifth, whether the Court of Appeals erred in denying petitioner's appeal for the revival of its patent application on the grounds that (a) petitioner committed inexcusable negligence in the prosecution of its patent application; and (b) third-party rights and the public interest would be prejudiced by the appeal;<br><br>Sixth, whether <i>Schuartz</i> applies to this case in that the negligence of a patent applicant's counsel binds the applicant; and<br><br>Lastly, whether the invention has already become part of public domain.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>The question of whether the Court of Appeals may resolve a motion for intervention is a question that assails an interlocutory order and requests a review of a lower court's exercise of discretion. Generally, a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court will lie to raise this issue in a limited manner. There must be a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion for the writ of certiorari to be issued.<br><br>However, when the Court of Appeals has already resolved the question of intervention and the merits of the case, an appeal through a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is the proper remedy.<br><br>Respondent Therapharma, Inc. argues that the Petition should be dismissed outright for being the wrong mode of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It argues that petitioner should have filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 since petitioner was assailing an act done by the Court of Appeals in the exercise of its discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> It argues that petitions under Rule 45 are limited to questions of law, and petitioner raised findings of fact that have already been affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Petitioner, on the other hand, argues that Rule 65 is only available when there is no appeal or any plain, speedy remedy in the ordinary course of law. Since a petition for review under Rule 45 was still available to it, it argues that it correctly availed itself of this remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Petitioner also argues that there are exceptions to the general rule on the conclusiveness of the Court of Appeals' findings of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> It argues that it was necessary for it to discuss relevant facts in order for it to show that the Court of Appeals made a misapprehension of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The special civil action of certiorari under Rule 65 is intended to correct errors of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Courts lose competence in relation to an order if it acts in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> A petition for review under Rule 45, on the other hand, is a mode of appeal intended to correct errors of judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Errors of judgment are errors committed by a court within its jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> This includes a review of the conclusions of law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> of the lower court and, in appropriate cases, evaluation of the admissibility, weight, and inference from the evidence presented.<br><br>Intervention results in an interlocutory order ancillary to a principal action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Its grant or denial is subject to the sound discretion of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Interlocutory orders, or orders that do not make a final disposition of the merits of the main controversy or cause of action,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> are generally not reviewable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The only exception is a limited one, in that when there is no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, and where it can be shown that the court acted without, in excess, or with such grave abuse of discretion that such action ousts it of jurisdiction.<br><br>Judicial economy, or the goal to have cases prosecuted with the least cost to the parties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> requires that unnecessary or frivolous reviews of orders by the trial court, which facilitate the resolution of the main merits of the case, be reviewed together with the main merits of the case. After all, it would be more efficient for an appellate court to review a case in its entire context when the case is finally disposed.<br><br>The question of whether intervention is proper is a question of law. Settled is the distinction between a question of law and a question of fact. A question of fact arises when there is doubt as to the truth or falsity of certain facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> A question of law, on the other hand, arises when "the appeal raises doubt as to the applicable law on a certain set of facts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> The test often used by this Court to determine whether there is a question of fact or a question of law "is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise it is a question of fact."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Petitioner raises the question of whether Republic Act No. 165 allows the Court of Appeals to grant a motion for intervention. This necessarily requires a determination of whether Rule 19 of the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> applies in appeals of cases filed under Republic Act No. 165. The determination of this question does not require a review of re-evaluation of the evidence. It requires a determination of the applicable law.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>If a petition fails to attach material portions of the record, it may still be given due course if it falls under certain exceptions. Although Rule 45, Section 4 of the Rules of Court requires that the petition "be accompanied by . . . such material portions of the record as would support the petition," the failure to do so will not necessarily warrant the outright dismissal of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Respondent Therapharma, Inc. argues that the Petition should have been outright dismissed since it failed to attach certain documents to support its factual allegations and legal arguments, particularly: the annexes of the Petition for Review it had filed before the Court of Appeals and the annexes in the Motion for Leave to Intervene it had filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> It argues that petitioner's failure to attach the documents violates Rule 45, Section 4, which requires the submission of material portions of the record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, petitioner argues that it was able to attach the Court of Appeals Decision dated August 31, 2004, the Resolution dated January 31, 2006, and the Amended Decision dated August 30, 2006, all of which were sufficient for this Court to give due course to its Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>In <i>Magsino v. De Ocampo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> this Court applied the procedural guideposts in <i>Galvez v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> in determining whether the Court of Appeals correctly dismissed a petition for review under Rule 42 for failure to attach relevant portions of the record. Thus:<br><blockquote>In <i>Galvez v. Court of Appeals</i>, a case that involved the dismissal of a petition for certiorari to assail an unfavorable ruling brought about by the failure to attach copies of all pleadings submitted and other material portions of the record in the trial court (like the complaint, answer and position paper) as would support the allegations of the petition, the Court recognized three guideposts for the CA to consider in determining whether or not the rules of procedures should be relaxed, as follows:<br><blockquote><i>First</i>, not all pleadings and parts of case records are required to be attached to the petition. Only those which are relevant and pertinent must accompany it. The test of relevancy is whether the document in question will support the material allegations in the petition, whether said document will make out a <i>prima facie</i> case of grave abuse of discretion as to convince the court to give due course to the petition.<br><br><i>Second</i>, even if a document is relevant and pertinent to the petition, it need not be appended if it is shown that the contents thereof can also [sic] found in another document already attached to the petition. Thus, if the material allegations in a position paper are summarized in a questioned judgment, it will suffice that only a certified true copy of the judgment is attached.<br><br><i>Third</i>, a petition lacking an essential pleading or part of the case record may still be given due course or reinstated (if earlier dismissed) upon showing that petitioner later submitted the documents required, or that it will serve the higher interest of justice that the case be decided on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>Although <i>Magsino</i> referred to a petition for review under Rule 42 before the Court of Appeals, the procedural guideposts cited in <i>Magsino</i> may apply to this case since the contents of a pleading under Rule 42<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> are substantially the same as the contents of a pleading under Rule 45,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> in that both procedural rules require the submission of "material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>In support of its Petition for Review on Certiorari, petitioner attached the Court of Appeals Decision dated August 31, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> the Resolution dated January 31, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> and the Amended Decision dated August 30, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> The Court of Appeals Resolution and Amended Decision quoted extensive portions of its <i>rollo</i> in support of its rulings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> These conclusions were sufficient to convince this Court not to outright dismiss the Petition but to require respondents to first comment on the Petition, in satisfaction of the first and second procedural guideposts in <i>Magsino</i>.<br><br>Upon filing of its Consolidated Reply,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> petitioner was able to attach the following additional documents:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Petition for Review filed before the Court of Appeals;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Letters dated July 18, 1995, December 12, 1995, and December 29, 1995;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Declaration of Ms. Miriam Meconnahey dated June 25, 2002;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Spreadsheet of petitioner's patent applications handled by Atty.

What may be confidential, and which we agree you have every right to protect by way of the Confidentiality Agreement, are the Specifications and Claims in the patent application, not the product per se. The product has been in the market for years. Hence, how can it be confidential? Or is the ambiguity intended to create a legal handle because you have no cause of action against us should we launch our own version of the losartan product?<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Finally, the questions we posed in our previous letters are plain and simple — <b>Is the Philippine Patent Application No. 35526 still pending before the IPO, i.e., it has neither been withdrawn by your licensor nor denied registration by the IPO for any reason whatsoever? When did your licensor file said application with the IPO?</b> These questions are easy to answer, unless there is an intention to mislead. You are also aware that the IPO is the only government agency that can grant letters patent. This is why we find disturbing your statement that the pendency of the patent application before the IPO is "not relevant". Hence, unless we receive unequivocal answers to the questions above, we regret that we cannot agree to execute the Confidentiality Agreement; otherwise, we may be acknowledging by contract a right that you do not have, and never will have, by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)<br></blockquote>The threat of legal action against respondent Therapharma, Inc. was real and imminent.

The Intellectual Property Code was enacted not only to amend certain provisions of existing laws on trademark, patent, and copyright, but also to honor the country's commitments under the World Trade Organization - Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), a treaty that entered force in the Philippines on January 1, 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup><br><br>The mandatory disclosure requirement in the TRIPS Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> precipitated the shift from a first-to-invent system to a first-to-file system. The first-to-file system required citizens of foreign countries to register their patents in the Philippines before they can sue for infringement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br><br>Lawmakers, however, expressed their concern over the extension of the period of protection for registered patents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> Under Section 21<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> of Republic Act No. 165, a patent had a term of 17 years. The Intellectual Property Code extended the period to 20 years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup><br><br>During the interpellations before the House of Representatives, then Representative Neptali Gonzales II (Gonzales) explained that under the Intellectual Property Code, the period of protection would have been shortened because of the publication requirement:<br><blockquote>MR. TAÑADA. Under the proposed measure, Your Honor, what is the period of protection that is given to the holder of the patent registered?<br><br>MR. GONZALES. Seventeen years from grant of patent, Mr. Speaker. Unlike before . . .<br><br>MR. TAÑADA. Under the present law, Mr. Speaker.<br><br>MR. GONZALES. I mean 17 years from filing, Mr. Speaker, unlike before which is 20 years from grant. Okay.<br><br>I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. Seventeen years from filing under the existing law, 20 years from grant under the proposed measure. It would appear, Mr. Speaker, that the proposed measure seeks to extend the grant of the patent.<br><br>MR. TAÑADA. But you have made the period of protection longer, Mr. Speaker.<br><br>MR. GONZALES. On the contrary, Mr. Speaker, when a similar question was previously propounded before, actually Mr. Speaker, it may decrease in fact the period of protection, Mr. Speaker. Because unlike before 17 years from grant, Mr. Speaker, now 20 years from application or from filing but actually, Mr. Speaker, it normally takes three to four years before a patent is actually granted even under the proposed measure. Because as you can see[,] publication in the BPTTT Gazette would even taken place after 18 months from filing. In other words, the procedure itself is such a manner that normally takes a period of about three years to finally grant the patent. So even if 20 years is given from the time of filing actually in essence it will be the same, Mr. Speaker, because under the existing law 17 years from grant. But even under our existing law from the time that a patent application is filed it also takes about three to four years, Mr. Speaker, to grant the same.<br><br>Now, why from filing, Mr. Speaker? Because the patent holder applicant is now required to publish in a manner easily understood by a person trained or with the same skill as that of a patent holder. And from that time this is published, this process covered by the patent is already made available. In fact, from the time that it is published, any interested person may even examine and go over the records as filed with the BPTTT and, therefore, this new technology or new invention is now made available to persons equipped or possessed with the same skills as that of the patent holder. And that is the reason why the patent is — the time of the patent is now tacked from the time it is filed because as a compromise it is now mandatory to publish the said patent together with its description - the description of the process and even would, at times demand the deposit of sample of the industrial design, Mr. Speaker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup><br></blockquote>Gonzales further clarified that the publication requirements of the Intellectual Property Code would necessarily shorten the period for confidentiality of patent applications:<br><blockquote>MR. MONFORT. Now, another question is, (another is) you know, the time from the filing of the date up to publication which is the period of pendency or confidentiality, may I know how many years will it take, that confidentiality period, variability.<br><br>MR. GONZALES. Eighteen months, Mr. Speaker.<br><br>MR. MONFORT. How many?<br><br>MR. GONZALES. Eighteen months.<br><br>MR. MONFORT. I do not think it is 18 months.<br><br>MR. GONZALES. It is provided for in the law, Mr. Speaker, because prior to the publication, naturally, the records become confidential because the essence of a patent, trademark, or copyright is to give the author or the inventor exclusive right to work on his own invention. And that is his invention, and naturally, it is but right that he should have the exclusive right over his invention.<br><br>On the other hand, the law requires that after 18 months, it should now be published. When it is now published, naturally, it ceases to be confidential in character because it is now ready for examination. It is now ready for possible copying of any interested person because the application, as we have repeatedly said on the floor, would require the filing of a description of the invention that can be carried out by a person similarly trained in the arts and sciences as that of the patent holder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, the absolute secrecy required by the 1962 Revised Rules of Practice would not be applicable to a patent application before the Intellectual Property Office. Section 13 of the 1962 Revised Rules of Practice does not appear in the Intellectual Property Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> in the Rules and Regulations on Inventions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> or in the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations for Patents, Utility Models and Industrial Design.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> The Intellectual Property Code now states that all patent applications must be published in the Intellectual Property Office Gazette and that <i>any interested party</i> may inspect all documents submitted to the Intellectual Property Office. The patent application is only confidential <i>before its publication</i>. Sections 44 and 45 of the Intellectual Property Code provide:<br><blockquote>SECTION 44. Publication of Patent Application. —<br><br>44.1. The patent application shall be published in the IPO Gazette together with a search document established by or on behalf of the Office citing any documents that reflect prior art, after the expiration of eighteen (18) months from the filing date or priority date.<br><br>44.2. After publication of a patent application, any interested party may inspect the application documents filed with the Office.<br><br>44.3. The Director General, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Trade and Industry, may prohibit or restrict the publication of an application, if in his opinion, to do so would be prejudicial to the national security and interests of the Republic of the Philippines. (n)<br><br>SECTION 45. Confidentiality Before Publication. — A patent application, which has not yet been published, and all related documents, shall not be made available for inspection without the consent of the applicant.<br></blockquote>It was inaccurate, therefore, for petitioner to argue that secrecy in patent applications prevents any intervention from interested parties. The confidentiality in patent applications under the Intellectual Property Code is not absolute since a party may already intervene after the publication of the application.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>An abandoned patent application may only be revived within four (4) months from the date of abandonment.

This Court stated:<br><blockquote>[Petitioners lost sight of the fact that the petition could not be granted because of laches. <i>Prior to the filing of the petition for revival of the patent application with the Bureau of Patents, an unreasonable period of time had lapsed due to the negligence of petitioners' counsel. By such inaction, petitioners were deemed to have forfeited their right to revive their applications for patent.</i><br><br>Facts show that the patent attorneys appointed to follow up the applications for patent registration had been negligent in complying with the rules of practice prescribed by the Bureau of Patents. The firm had been notified about the abandonment as early as June 1987, but it was only after December 7, 1987, when their employees Bangkas and Rosas had been dismissed, that they came to know about it. This clearly showed that petitioners' counsel had been remiss in the handling of their clients' applications.<br><br>"A lawyer's fidelity to the cause of his client requires him to be ever mindful of the responsibilities that should be expected of him. A lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him." In the instant case, petitioners' patent attorneys not only failed to take notice of the notices of abandonment, but they failed to revive the application within the four-month period, as provided in the rules of practice in patent cases. These applications are deemed forfeited upon the lapse of such period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner attempts to distinguish itself from <i>Schuartz</i> by arguing that the petitioners in Schuartz had actual notice of abandonment while petitioner here was only able to have actual notice when it received Paper No. 2.<br><br>The four (4)-month period in Section 111<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> of the 1962 Revised Rules of Practice, however, is not counted from <i>actual</i> notice of abandonment but from <i>mailing</i> of the notice.

Section 31 states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 31. Right of Priority. — An application for patent filed by any person who has previously applied for the same invention in another country which by treaty, convention, or law affords similar privileges to Filipino citizens, shall be considered as filed as of the date of filing the foreign application: Provided, That:<br><br>a. the local application expressly claims priority;<br><br>b. it is filed within twelve (12) months from the date the earliest foreign application was filed; and<br><br>c. a certified copy of the foreign application together with an English translation is filed within six (6) months from the date of filing in the Philippines.<br></blockquote>A patent applicant with the right of priority is given preference in the grant of a patent when there are two or more applicants for the same invention. Section 29 of the Intellectual Property Code provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 29. First to File Rule. — If two (2) or more persons have made the invention separately and independently of each other, the right to the patent shall belong to the person who filed an application for such invention, or where two or more applications are filed for the same invention, to the applicant who has the earliest filing date or, the earliest priority date.<br></blockquote>Since both the United States<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup> and the Philippines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> are signatories to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, an applicant who has filed a patent application in the United States may have a right of priority over the same invention in a patent application in the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> However, this right of priority does not immediately entitle a patent applicant the grant of a patent. A right of priority is not equivalent to a patent. Otherwise, a patent holder of any member-state of the Paris Convention need not apply for patents in other countries where it wishes to exercise its patent.<br><br>It was, therefore, inaccurate for petitioner to argue that its prior patent application in the United States removed the invention from the public domain in the Philippines. This argument is only relevant if respondent Therapharma, Inc. had a conflicting patent application with the Intellectual Property Office.

Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup><br><blockquote>Under American jurisprudence, an inventor has no common-law right to a monopoly of his invention. He has the right to make, use and vend his own invention, but if he voluntarily discloses it, such as by offering it for sale, the world is free to copy and use it with impunity. A patent, however, gives the inventor the right to exclude all others. As a patentee, he has the exclusive right of making, using or selling the invention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup><br></blockquote>Under the Intellectual Property Code, a patent holder has the right to "to restrain, prohibit and prevent"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup> any unauthorized person or entity from manufacturing, selling, or importing any product derived from the patent.

However, its mandatory publication also has the correlative effect of bringing new ideas into the public consciousness. After the publication of the patent, any person may examine the invention and develop it into something further than what the original patent holder may have envisioned. After the lapse of 20 years,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup> the invention becomes part of the public domain and is free for the public to use. In <i>Pearl and Dean v. Shoemart, Inc.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup><br><blockquote>To be able to effectively and legally preclude others from copying and profiting from the invention, a patent is a primordial requirement. No patent, no protection. <i>The ultimate goal of a patent system is to bring new designs and technologies into the public domain through disclosure. Ideas, once disclosed to the public without the protection of a valid patent, are subject to appropriation without significant restraint.</i><br><br>On one side of the coin is the public which will benefit from new ideas; on the other are the inventors who must be protected. As held in <i>Bauer &amp; Cie vs. O'Donnell</i>, "The act secured to the inventor the exclusive right to make use, and vend the thing patented, and consequently to prevent others from exercising like privileges without the consent of the patentee. It was passed for the purpose of encouraging useful invention and promoting new and useful inventions by the protection and stimulation new and useful inventions by the protection and stimulation given to inventive genius, and was intended to secure to the public, after the lapse of the exclusive privileges granted the benefit of such inventions and improvements."<br><br>The law attempts to strike an ideal balance between the two interests:<br><blockquote>"(The p)atent system thus embodies a carefully crafted bargain for encouraging the creation and disclosure of new useful and non-obvious advances in technology and design, in return for the exclusive right to practice the invention for a number of years. The inventor may keep his invention secret and reap its fruits indefinitely. In consideration of its disclosure and the consequent benefit to the community, the patent is granted. An exclusive enjoyment is guaranteed him for 17 years, but upon the expiration of that period, the knowledge of the invention inures to the people, who are thus enabled to practice it and profit by its use."<br></blockquote><i>The patent law has a three-fold purpose: "first, patent law seeks to foster and reward invention; second, it promotes disclosures of inventions to stimulate further innovation and to permit the public to practice the invention once the patent expires; third, the stringent requirements for patent protection, seek to ensure that ideas in the public domain remain therefor the free use of the public."</i><br><br>It is only after an exhaustive examination by the patent office that a patent is issued. Such an in-depth investigation is required because "in rewarding a useful invention, the rights and welfare of the community must be fairly dealt with and effectively guarded. <i>To that end, the prerequisites to obtaining a patent are strictly observed and when a patent is issued, the limitations on its exercise are equally strictly enforced.</i> To begin with, a genuine invention or discovery must be demonstrated lest in the constant demand for new appliances, the heavy hand of tribute be laid on each slight technological advance in art."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In addition, a patent holder of inventions relating to food or medicine does not enjoy absolute monopoly over the patent.

In the explanatory note of Bill No. 1156 which eventually became R.A. No. 165, the legislative intent in the grant of a compulsory license was not only to afford others an opportunity to provide the public with the quantity of the patented product, but also to prevent the growth of monopolies. Certainly, the growth of monopolies was among the abuses which Section A, Article 5 of the Convention foresaw, and which our Congress likewise wished to prevent in enacting R.A. No. 165.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup><br></blockquote>The patent holder's proprietary right over the patent only lasts for three (3) years from the grant of the patent, after which any person may be allowed to manufacture, use, or sell the invention subject to the payment of royalties:<br><blockquote>The right to exclude others from the manufacturing, using, or vending an invention relating to food or medicine should be conditioned to allowing any person to manufacture, use, or vend the same after a period of three years from the date of the grant of the letters patent. After all, the patentee is not entirely deprived of any proprietary right. In fact, he has been given the period of three years of complete monopoly over the patent. Compulsory licensing of a patent on food or medicine without regard to the other conditions imposed in Section 34 is not an undue deprivation of proprietary interests over a patent right because the law sees to it that even after three years of complete monopoly something is awarded to the inventor in the form of a bilateral and workable licensing agreement and a reasonable royalty to be agreed upon by the parties and in default of such agreement, the Director of Patent may fix the terms and conditions of the license.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup><br></blockquote>A patent is a monopoly granted only for specific purposes and objectives.
