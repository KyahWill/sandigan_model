				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In some cases, illnesses that are contracted by seafarers and are not listed as occupational diseases under the 2000 Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Employment Contract may be disputably presumed to be work-related or work-aggravated.

A similar issue was decided in <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc., et al. v. Canja.</i><sup><font color="#FF0000">[62]</font></sup> In Eastern Shipping, the Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission became final and executory and was satisfied during the pendency of the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The Court of Appeals modified the Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Eastern Shipping filed a Petition for Review before this court, arguing that the final and executory Decision of the National Labor Relations Commission cannot be modified by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> This court held that:<br><br><blockquote>Section 14, Rule VII of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure provides that decisions, resolutions or orders of the NLRC shall become final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt thereof by the parties, and entry of judgment shall be made upon the expiration of the said period. In <i>St. Martin Funeral Homes v. NLRC,</i> however, it was ruled that judicial review of decisions at the NLRC may be sought via a petition for certiorari before the CA under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court; and under Section 4 thereof, petitioners are allowed sixty (60) days from notice of the assailed order or resolution within which to file the petition. <i><b>Hence, in cases where a petition for certiorari is filed after the expiration of the 10-day period under the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure but within the 60-day period under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the CA can grant the petition and modify, nullify and reverse a decision or resolution of the NLRC</b></i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>Thus, a petition for certiorari assailing a decision of the National Labor Relations Commission is allowed even after the National Labor Relations Commission's Decision has become final and executory, provided that the petition is filed before the expiration of the 60-day reglementary period under Rule 65.<br><br>The reason for this rule was discussed in <i>Leonis Navigation Co., Inc., et al. v. Villamater and/or The Heirs of the Late Catalino U. Villamater, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> where one of the issues was whether the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that final and executory decisions of the National Labor Relations Commission can no longer be questioned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> This court discussed:<br><br><blockquote>Further, a petition for certiorari does not normally include an inquiry into the correctness of its evaluation of the evidence. Errors of judgment, as distinguished from errors of jurisdiction, are not within the province of a special civil action for certiorari, which is merely confined to issues of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion. It is, thus, incumbent upon petitioners to satisfactorily establish that the NLRC acted capriciously and whimsically in order that the extraordinary writ of certiorari will lie. By grave abuse of discretion is meant such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction, and it must be shown that the discretion was exercised arbitrarily or despotically.<br><br>The CA, therefore, could grant the petition for certiorari if it finds that the NLRC, in its assailed decision or resolution, committed grave abuse of discretion by capriciously, whimsically, or arbitrarily disregarding evidence that is material to or decisive of the controversy; and it cannot make this determination without looking into the evidence of the parties. Necessarily, the appellate court can only evaluate the materiality or significance of the evidence, which is alleged to have been capriciously, whimsically, or arbitrarily disregarded by the NLRC, in relation to all other evidence on record. <i>Notably, if the CA grants the petition and nullifies the decision or resolution of the NLRC on the ground of grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction, the decision or resolution of the NLRC is, in contemplation of law, null and void ab initio; hence, the decision or resolution never became final and executory</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)<br></blockquote><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>The Petition in this case does not raise questions of fact. The difference between a question of fact and a question of law was discussed in <i>Century Iron Works, Inc. v. Bañas</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br><blockquote>A question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. For a question to be one of law, the question must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them. The resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of circumstances. Once it is clear that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the question posed is one of fact.<br><br>Thus, the test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise it is a question of fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>Contrary to respondent Bahia Shipping Services, Inc.'s argument, petitioner raised only questions of law. The arguments in this Petition for Review<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[72]</sup></font> show that petitioner does not question the findings of fact of the labor tribunals and the Court of Appeals. The main issue raised by petitioner is whether she is entitled to total and permanent disability benefits based on the factual findings of the labor tribunals. The other issue raised by petitioner is whether the Court of Appeals erred in finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of the National Labor Relations Commission.<br><br>Clearly, the issues raised by petitioner do not require the evaluation of the evidence presented before the labor tribunals. The resolution of the issues raised by petitioner entails a review of applicable laws and not whether the alleged facts are true.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>To resolve a Rule 45 petition for review of a Court of Appeals decision on a Rule 65 petition for certiorari, the question of law that this court must determine is whether the Court of Appeals properly determined the "presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>This court shall determine whether the Court of Appeals was correct in ruling that there was grave abuse of discretion on the part of the National Labor Relations Commission and in granting the Petition for Certiorari filed before the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Petitioner's Norwegian Collective Bargaining Agreement provides that:<br><br><blockquote><b>Article 15 - Death and Disability Insurance</b><br><br><center>xxx xxx xxx<br></center><br><ol start="2"><li>Disability:<br><br><i>A Seafarer who suffers injury as a result of an accident</i> from any cause whatsoever whilst in the employment of the Owner/Company, regardless of fault, including accidents occurring whilst traveling to and from the Dhip [sic] and whose ability to work is reduced as a result thereof, shall in addition to his sick pay, be entitled to compensation according to the provisions of this Agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>Petitioner alleges that she "experienced profuse and consistent bleeding . . . felt extreme dizziness and ha[d] difficulty in breathing"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> but she never alleged any accident that resulted to her illness. Thus, the provision in her collective bargaining agreement is not applicable.<br><br>Considering that petitioner was hired in 2009, the 2000 POEA Standard Employment Contract applies.<br><br>The 2000 POEA Standard Employment Contract defines work-related illness as:<br><br><blockquote><b>Definition of Terms:</b><br>. . . .<br>12. Work-Related Illness - any sickness resulting to disability or death as a result of an occupational disease listed under Section 32-A of this contract with the conditions set therein satisfied.</blockquote><br>Section 20(B) of the Standard Employment Contract provides:<br><br><blockquote>B.

In<i> Dayo v. Status Maritime Corporation,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> this court reiterated the rule on compensability of illnesses as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Settled is the rule that for illness to be compensable, it is not necessary that the nature of the employment be the sole and only reason for the illness suffered by the seafarer. It is sufficient that there is a reasonable linkage between the disease suffered by the employee and his work to lead a rational mind to conclude that his work may have contributed to the establishment or, at the very least, aggravation of any pre-existing condition he might have had.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br></blockquote><br>While the law recognizes that an illness may be disputably presumed to be work-related, the seafarer or the claimant must still show a reasonable connection between the nature of work onboard the vessel and the illness contracted or aggravated.<br><br>In <i>Quizora v. Denholm Crew Management (Phils.), Inc.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Quizora argued that he did not have the burden to prove that his illness was work-related because it was disputably presumed by law.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[80]</sup></font> This court ruled that Quizora "cannot simply rely on the disputable presumption provision mention in Section 20 (B) (4) of the 2000 POEA-SEC."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> This court further discussed that:<br><br><blockquote>At any rate, granting that the provisions of the 2000 POEA-SEC apply, the disputable presumption provision in Section 20 (B) does not allow him to just sit down and wait for respondent company to present evidence to overcome the disputable presumption of work-relatedness of the illness. Contrary to his position, he still has to substantiate his claim in order to be entitled to disability compensation. He has to prove that the illness he suffered was work-related and that it must have existed during the term of his employment contract.

Thus, a seafarer may pursue an action for total and permanent disability benefits if: (a) the company-designated physician failed to issue a declaration as to his fitness to engage in sea duty or disability even after the lapse of the 120-day period and there is no indication that further medical treatment would address his temporary total disability, hence, justify an extension of the period to 240 days; (b) 240 days had lapsed without any certification being issued by the company-designated physician; (c) the company-designated physician declared that he is fit for sea duty within the 120-day or 240-day period, as the case may be, but his physician of choice and the doctor chosen under Section 20-B(3) of the POEA-SEC are of a contrary opinion; (d) the company-designated physician acknowledged that he is partially permanently disabled but other doctors who he consulted, on his own and jointly with his employer, believed that his disability is not only permanent but total as well; (e) the company-designated physician recognized that he is totally and permanently disabled but there is a dispute on the disability grading; (f) the company-designated physician determined that his medical condition is not compensable or work-related under the POEA-SEC but his doctor-of-choice and the third doctor selected under Section 20-B(3) of the POEA-SEC found otherwise and declared him unfit to work; (g) the company-designated physician declared him totally and permanently disabled but the employer refuses to pay him the corresponding benefits; and (h) the company-designated physician declared him partially and permanently disabled within the 120-day or 240-day period but he remains incapacitated to perform his usual sea duties after the lapse of the s<font color="#FF0000"><font color="#000000">aid periods.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[103]</sup></font></font><br></font></blockquote><br>The company-designated physician was justified in not issuing a medical certificate on whether petitioner was fit to work after the lapse of 120 days because petitioner's treatment required more than 120 days.

Secondly, she underwent endometrial dilatation and curettage on July 22, 2010. Thirdly, from July 28, 2010 up to September 6, 2010, she was treated for bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis. Fourthly, she underwent repeat transvaginal ultrasound on September 28, 2010 for re-evaluation of her medical condition and was last seen by the OB-GYNE on October 21, 2010.<br><br>It bears stressing that if the employer's failure to make a declaration on the fitness or disability of the seafarer is due to the latter's need for further medical attention, the period of temporary and total disability may be extended to a maximum of 240 days. Thus, the filing by private respondent of the complaint for permanent disability compensation benefits on September 8, 2010, or 174 days after she was medically repatriated on March 18, 2010, was premature.
