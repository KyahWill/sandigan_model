Among the documents allegedly attached to the said Joint Order were copies of the Supplemental Sworn Statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> of Tuason dated February 21, 2014 and the Sworn Statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> of Cunanan dated February 20, 2014,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> to which Reyes submitted separate Comments<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> on May 13, 2014.

Grave abuse of discretion implies a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment tantamount to lack of jurisdiction.

As correctly pointed out by the Ombudsman, such participation on the part of Reyes was outlined by whistleblowers Luy, Sula, and Suñas as follows:<br><blockquote>[O]nce a PDAF allocation becomes available to Senator Enrile, his staff, in the person of either respondent <b>Reyes</b> or Evangelista, would inform Tuason of this development.

This listing would be sent to <b>Reyes</b> who would then endorse it to the DBM under her authority as Chief-of-Staff of Senator Enrile. After the listing is released by the Office of Senator Enrile to the DBM, Janet Napoles would give Tuason a down payment for delivery to Senator Enrile through <b>Reyes</b>.

To begin with, "[t]he authority to grant immunity is not an inherent judicial function. Indeed, Congress has vested such power in the Ombudsman[,] as well as in the Secretary of Justice. Besides, the decision to employ an accused as a state witness must necessarily originate from the public prosecutors whose mission is to obtain a successful prosecution of the several accused before the courts. The latter do not, as a rule[,] have a vision of the true strength of the prosecution's evidence until after the trial is over. Consequently, courts should generally defer to the judgment of the prosecution and deny a motion to discharge an accused so he can be used as a witness only in clear cases of failure to meet the requirements of Section 17, Rule 119 [of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> As explained in <i>Quarto v. Marcelo</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup><br><blockquote>The decision to grant immunity from prosecution forms a constituent part of the prosecution process. It is essentially a tactical decision to forego prosecution of a person for government to achieve a higher objective. It is a deliberate renunciation of the right of the State to prosecute all who appear to be guilty of having committed a crime. Its justification lies in the particular need of the State to obtain the conviction of the more guilty criminals who, otherwise, will probably elude the long arm of the law. <b><u>Whether or not the delicate power should be exercised, who should be extended the privilege, the timing of its grant, are questions addressed solely to the sound judgment of the prosecution. The power to prosecute includes the right to determine who shall be prosecuted and the corollary right to decide whom not to prosecute. In reviewing the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in these areas, the jurisdiction of the respondent court is limited. For the business of a court of justice is to be an impartial tribunal, and not to get involved with the success or failure of the prosecution to prosecute.</u></b> Every now and then, the prosecution may err in the selection of its strategies, but such errors are not for neutral courts to rectify, any more than courts should correct the blunders of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As earlier mentioned, Tuason admitted to having acted merely as a liaison between Janet Napoles and the Office of Senator Enrile. It is in this capacity that she made "direct arrangements" with Janet Napoles concerning the PDAF "commissions," and "directly received" money from Janet Napoles for distribution to the participants of the scam. In the same manner, Luy and Suñas, being mere employees of Janet Napoles, only acted upon the latter's orders. Thus, the Ombudsman simply saw the higher value of utilizing them as witnesses instead of prosecuting them in order to fully establish and strengthen her case against those mainly responsible for the scam.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup> The Court has previously stressed that the discharge of an accused to be a state witness is geared towards the realization of the deep-lying intent of the State not to let a crime that has been committed go unpunished by allowing an accused who appears not to be the most guilty to testify, in exchange for an outright acquittal, against a more guilty co-accused. It is aimed at achieving the greater purpose of securing the conviction of the most guilty and the greatest number among the accused for an offense committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> In fact, whistleblower testimonies - especially in corruption cases, such as this - should not be condemned, but rather, be welcomed as these whistleblowers risk incriminating themselves in order to expose the perpetrators and bring them to justice. In Re: <i>Letter of Presiding Justice Conrado M. Vasquez, Jr. on CA-G.R. SP No. 103692</i> (<i>Antonio Rosete, et al. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, et al.</i>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> the Court gave recognition and appreciation to whistleblowers in corruption cases, considering that corruption is often done in secrecy and it is almost inevitable to resort to their testimonies in order to pin down the crooked public officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup><br><br>For another, Reyes erroneously posits that under Section 4,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> Rule II of the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman, she is entitled to copies of Tuason's affidavit, as well as the transcripts of the clarificatory hearings conducted by the Ombudsman with Tuason, and that the Ombudsman's denial of such copies constitutes a violation of due process on her part. In <i>Estrada</i>, the Court had already resolved in detail that under both Rule 112 of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure and Section 4, Rule II of the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman, a respondent to a preliminary investigation proceeding (such as Reyes in this case) is only entitled to the evidence submitted by the complainants, and not to those submitted by a co-respondent<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup> (such as Tuason in this case, prior to her grant of immunity as a state witness). It must also be noted that by virtue of the Ombudsman's Joint Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> dated May 7, 2014, Reyes was even provided with copies of Tuason and Cunanan's respective Counter-Affidavits,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup> and directed to file a comment thereon. In fact, Reyes even submitted separate Comments<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup> on May 13, 2014. Thus, there is more reason to decline Reyes's assertion that the Ombudsman deprived her of due process.

As exhibited in the <i>modus operandi</i> discussed earlier, once Janet Napoles was informed of the availability of a PDAF allocation, either she or Luy, as the "lead employee"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[194]</sup> of the JLN Corporation, would prepare a listing of the available projects specifically indicating the IAs. After said listing is released by the Office of Senator Enrile to the DBM, Janet Napoles would give a down payment from her own pockets for delivery to Senator Enrile through Reyes, with the remainder of the amount given to the Senator after the SARO and/or NCA is released. Senator Enrile would then indorse Janet Napoles's NGOs to undertake the PDAF-funded projects,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[195]</sup> which were "ghost projects" that allowed Janet Napoles and her cohorts to pocket the PDAF allocation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[196]</sup><br><br>Based on the evidence in support thereof, the Court is convinced that there lies probable cause against Janet Napoles for the charge of Plunder as it has <i>prima facie</i> been established that: (a) she, in conspiracy with Senator Enrile, Reyes, and other personalities, was significantly involved in the afore-described <i>modus operandi</i> to obtain Senator Enrile's PDAF, who supposedly abused his authority as a public officer in order to do so; (b) through this <i>modus operandi</i>, it appears that Senator Enrile repeatedly received ill-gotten wealth in the form of "kickbacks" in the years 2004-2010; and (c) the total value of "kickbacks'' given to Senator Enrile amounted to at least P172,834,500.00.<br><br>In the same manner, there is probable cause against Janet Napoles for violations of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, as it is ostensible that: (a) she conspired with public officials, <i>i.e.</i>, Senator Enrile and his chief of staff, Reyes, who exercised official functions whenever they would enter into transactions involving illegal disbursements of the PDAF; (b) Senator Enrile, among others, has shown manifest partiality and evident bad faith by repeatedly indorsing the JLN-controlled NGOs as beneficiaries of his PDAF-funded projects - even without the benefit of a public bidding and/or negotiated procurement, in direct violation of existing laws, rules, and regulations on government procurement;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[197]</sup> and (c) the "ghost" PDAF-funded projects caused undue prejudice to the government in the amount of P345,000,000.00.<br><br>At this juncture, the Court must disabuse Janet Napoles of her mistaken notion that as a private individual, she cannot be held answerable for the crimes of Plunder and violations of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 because the offenders in those crimes are public officers. While the primary offender in the aforesaid crimes are public officers, private individuals may also be held liable for the same if they are found to have conspired with said officers in committing the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[198]</sup> This proceeds from the fundamental principle that in cases of conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[199]</sup> In this case, given that the evidence gathered perceptibly shows Janet Napoles's engagement in the illegal hemorrhaging of Senator Enrile's PDAF, the Ombudsman rightfully charged her, with Enrile and Reyes, as a co-conspirator for the aforestated crimes.<br><br>Furthermore, there is no merit in Janet Napoles's assertion that the complaints are insufficient in form and in substance for the reason that it lacked certain particularities such as the time, place, and manner of the commission of the crimes charged. "According to Section 6, Rule 110<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[200]</sup> of the 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure, the complaint or information is sufficient if it states the names of the accused; the designation of the offense given by the statute; the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the approximate date of the commission of the offense; and the place where the offense was committed. <b><u>The fundamental test in determining the sufficiency of the averments in a complaint or information is, therefore, whether the facts alleged therein, if hypotheticallv admitted, constitute the elements of the offense.</u></b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[201]</sup> In this case, the NBI and the FIO Complaints stated that: (a) Senator Enrile, Reyes, and Janet Napoles, among others, are the ones responsible for the PDAF scam; (b) Janet Napoles, <i>et al</i>. are being accused of Plunder and violations of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019; (c) they used a certain <i>modus operandi</i> to perpetuate said scam, details of which were stated therein; (d) because of the PDAF scam, the Philippine government was prejudiced and defrauded in the approximate amount of P345,000,000.00; and (e) the PDAF scam happened sometime between the years 2004 and 2010, specifically in Taguig City, Pasig City, Quezon City, and Pasay City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[202]</sup> The aforesaid allegations were essentially reproduced in the sixteen (16) Informations - one (1) for Plunder<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[203]</sup> and fifteen (15) for violation of RA 3019<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup> - filed before the Sandiganbayan. Evidently, these factual assertions already square with the requirements of Section 6, Rule 110 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure as above-cited. Upon such averments, there is no gainsaying that Janet Napoles has been completely informed of the accusations against her to enable her to prepare for an intelligent defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup> The NBI and the FIO Complaints are, therefore, sufficient in form and in substance.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the Ombudsman did not gravely abuse its discretion in finding probable cause to indict Janet Napoles of the crimes of Plunder and violations of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019.<br><br>As regards the finding of probable cause against the Napoles siblings and De Asis, it must be first highlighted that they are placed in the same situation as Janet Napoles in that they are being charged with crime/s principally performed by public officers (specifically, of Plunder and/or multiple violations of Section 3 [e] of RA 3019) despite their standing as private individuals on account of their alleged conspiracy with public officers, Senator Enrile and Reyes. It is a fundamental legal axiom that "<b>[w]hen there is conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup> Thus, the reasonable likelihood that conspiracy exists between them denotes the probable existence of the elements of the crimes above-discussed equally as to them.<br><br>"Conspiracy can be inferred from and established by the acts of the accused themselves when said acts point to a joint purpose and design, concerted action and community of interests."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup><br><br>With respect to the Napoles siblings, it must be clarified that while it appears from the evidence on record that: (a) they did not serve as officers or incorporators of the JLN-controlled NGOs designated as "project partners" in the implementation of Senator Enrile's PDAF projects;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup> (b) their names did not appear in the table of signatories to the MOAs;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup> and (c) they did not acknowledge receipt of the checks issued by the I As in payment of Senator Enrile's "ghost" PDAF-funded projects, they were nonetheless involved in various phases of the PDAF scam.

To recount, Luy stated that Jo Christine Napoles, as part of the scheme, checked the "vouchers" he had prepared; that the Napoles siblings knew of the "codenames" of the legislators in the illicit "vouchers"; and that they were also included in the actual disbursement of "rebates" to the legislators, among others. Senator Enrile. More so, although Suñas's testimony that the Napoles siblings forged documents and signatures pertaining to the disbursement of the DAR funds which does not directly prove that they had committed the same with respect to Senator Enrile's PDAF, such evidence, when juxtaposed with Luy's testimony, gains relevance in ascertaining the illegal plan, system or scheme to which they were alleged to be involved. It also tends to directly prove the fact that they had knowledge of JLN Corporation's illegal activities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[220]</sup> The Court notes that these accounts gain more credibility not only in view of the whistleblowers' allegations that they worked closely with the Napoles siblings in JLN Corporation for a considerable length of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup> but also that Sula, Suñas, and particularly Luy as "lead employee," were among the most trusted workers of Janet Napoles in the furtherance of the PDAF scam.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[222]</sup> Also, there appears to be no motive for any of these whistleblowers, particularly, Luy, to incredulously implicate the Napoles siblings in this case. With all these factors together, there is, at least, some substantial basis to conclude, that the Napoles siblings were, in all reasonable likelihood, involved in the entire con.<br><br>Neither can the Napoles siblings discount the testimonies of the whistleblowers based on their invocation of the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule under Section 28, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence, which states that the rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another, unless the admission is by a conspirator under the parameters of Section 30 of the same Rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup> To be sure, the foregoing rule constitutes a technical rule on evidence which should not be rigidly applied in the course of preliminary investigation proceedings. In <i>Estrada</i>, the Court sanctioned the Ombudsman's appreciation of hearsay evidence, which would otherwise be inadmissible under technical rules on evidence, during the preliminary investigation "as long as there is substantial basis for crediting the hearsay."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup> This is because "such investigation is merely preliminary, and does not finally adjudicate rights and obligations of parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup> Applying the same logic, and with the similar observation that there lies substantial basis for crediting the testimonies of the whistleblowers herein, the objection interposed by the Napoles siblings under the evidentiary <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule should falter. Ultimately, as case law edifies, "[t]he technical rules on evidence are not binding on the fiscal who has jurisdiction and control over the conduct of a preliminary investigation,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>Therefore, on account of the above-mentioned acts which seemingly evince the Napoles siblings' participation in the conspiracy involving Senator Enrile's PDAF, no grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed against the Ombudsman in finding probable cause against them for fifteen (15) counts of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 as charged.<br><br>In the same vein, the evidence on record exhibits probable cause for De Asis's involvement as a co-conspirator for the crime of Plunder, as well as violations of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019. A perusal thereof readily reveals that De Asis is the President<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[227]</sup> of KPMFI and a member/incorporator<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[228]</sup> of CARED - two (2) among the many JLN-controlled NGOs that were used in the perpetuation of the scam particularly involved in the illegal disbursement of Senator Enrile's PDAF.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[229]</sup> Moreover, in the <i>Pinagsamang Sinumpaang Salaysay</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[230]</sup> of whistleblowers Luy and Suñas, as well as their respective <i>Karagdagang Sinumpaang Salaysay</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[231]</sup> they tagged De Asis as one of those who prepared money to be given to the lawmaker;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[232]</sup> that he, among others, received the checks issued by the IAs to the NGOs and deposited the same in the bank;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[233]</sup> and that, after the money is withdrawn from the bank, De Asis was also one of those tasked to bring the money to Janet Napoles's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[234]</sup> With these, the Court finds that there are equally well-grounded bases to believe that, in all possibility, De Asis, thru his participation as President of KPMFI and member/incorporator of CARED, as well as his acts of receiving checks in the name of said NGOs, depositing them in the NGOs' bank accounts, delivering money to Janet Napoles, and assisting in the delivery of "kickbacks" and "commissions" of the legislators, conspired with the other petitioners to commit the crimes charged against them.<br><br>Certainly, De Asis's defenses, which are anchored on the want of criminal intent, as well as the absence of all the elements of the crime of Plunder on his part, are better ventilated during trial and not during preliminary investigation. At the risk of belaboring the point, a preliminary investigation is not the occasion for the full and exhaustive display of the prosecution's evidence; and the presence or absence of the elements of the crime charged is evidentiary in nature and is a matter of defense that may be passed upon only after a full-blown trial on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[235]</sup><br><br>Hence, for De Asis's apparent participation in the PDAF scam, the Ombudsman did not gravely abuse its discretion in finding probable cause against him for one (1) count of Plunder and fifteen (15) counts of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 as charged.<br><br>In totality, <b>G.R.

The Court, in <i>People v. Castillo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[242]</sup> delineated the functions and purposes of a determination of probable cause made by the public prosecutor, on the one hand, and the trial court, on the other:<br><blockquote>There are two kinds of determination of probable case: executive and judicial. The executive determination of probable cause is one made during preliminary investigation. It is a function that properly pertains to the public prosecutor who is given a broad discretion to determine whether probable cause exists and to charge those whom he believes to have committed the crime as defined by law and thus should be held for trial. Otherwise stated, such official has the quasi-judicial authority to determine whether or not a criminal case must be filed in court. Whether or not that function has been correctly discharged by the public prosecutor, <i>i.e.</i>, whether or not he has made a correct ascertainment of the existence of probable cause in a case, is a matter that the trial court itself does not and may not be compelled to pass upon. <br><br><b><u>The judicial determination of probable cause, on the other hand, is one made by the judge to ascertain whether a warrant of arrest should be issued against the accused. The judge must satisfy himself that based on the evidence submitted, there is necessity for placing the accused under custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice. If the judge finds no probable cause, the judge cannot be forced to issue the arrest warrant.</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[243]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>As above-articulated, the executive determination of probable cause concerns itself with whether there is enough evidence to support an Information being filed. The judicial determination of probable cause, on the other hand, determines whether a warrant of arrest should be issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[244]</sup><br><br>This notwithstanding, the Court in <i>Mendoza v. People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[245]</sup> (<i>Mendoza</i>) clarified that the trial court (or the Sandiganbayan) is given three (3) distinct options upon the filing of a criminal information before it, namely to: (a) dismiss the case if the evidence on record clearly failed to establish probable cause; (b) issue a warrant of arrest if it finds probable cause; and (c) order the prosecutor to present additional evidence in case of doubt as to the existence of probable cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[246]</sup> The Court went on to elaborate that "the option to order the prosecutor to present additional evidence is not mandatory" and reiterated that "the court's first option x x x is for it to 'immediately dismiss the case if the evidence on record clearly fails to establish probable cause.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[247]</sup><br><br>Verily, when a criminal Information is filed before the trial court, the judge, <i>motu proprio</i> or upon motion of the accused, is entitled to make his own assessment of the evidence on record to determine whether there is probable cause to order the arrest of the accused and proceed with the trial; or in the absence thereof, to order the immediate dismissal of the criminal case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[248]</sup> This is in line with the fundamental doctrine that "once a complaint or information is filed in court, any disposition of the case, whether as to its dismissal or the conviction or the acquittal of the accused, rests in the sound discretion of the court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[249]</sup> Nevertheless, the Court, in <i>Mendoza</i> cautions the trial courts in proceeding with dismissals of this nature:<br><blockquote>Although jurisprudence and procedural rules allow it, a judge must always proceed with caution in dismissing cases due to lack of probable cause, considering the preliminary nature of the evidence before it. It is only when he or she finds that the evidence on hand absolutely fails to support a finding of probable cause that he or she can dismiss the case. On the other hand, if a judge finds probable cause, he or she must not hesitate to proceed with arraignment and trial in order that justice may be served.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[250]</sup><br></blockquote>A careful study of the records yields the conclusion that the requirement to personally evaluate the report of the Ombudsman, and its supporting documents, was discharged by the Sandiganbayan when it explicitly declared in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[251]</sup> dated July 3, 2014 that it had "personally [read] and [evaluated] the Information, the Joint Resolution dated March 28, 2013 and Joint Order dated June 4, 2013 of the [Ombudsman], together with the above-enumerated documents, including their annexes and attachments, which are all part of the records of the preliminary investigation x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[252]</sup> A similar pronouncement was made by the Sandiganbayan in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[253]</sup> dated September 29, 2014, wherein it was said that "[a]fter further considering the records of these cases and due deliberations, the Court finds the existence of probable cause against the said accused x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[254]</sup> Later on, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[255]</sup> dated November 14, 2014, the Sandiganbayan affirmed its earlier findings when it held that the presence of probable cause against all the accused "was already unequivocally settled x x x in its [Resolution] dated July 3, 2014 x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[256]</sup> Besides, the Sandiganbayan should be accorded with the presumption of regularity in the performance of its official duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[257]</sup> This presumption was not convincingly overcome by either Reyes or the Napoles siblings through clear and convincing evidence, and hence, should prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[258]</sup> As such, the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause against, <i>inter alia</i>, Reyes and the Napoles siblings was judicially confirmed by the Sandiganbayan when it examined the evidence, found probable cause, and issued warrants of arrest against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[259]</sup><br><br>Also, the Court cannot lend any credence to Reyes's protestations of haste on the part of the Sandiganbayan in issuing the assailed Resolutions, absent any clear showing that the presumed regularity of the proceedings has been breached. Reyes would do well to be reminded of the Court's ruling in <i>Leviste v. Alameda</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[260]</sup> wherein it was instructed that "[s]peed in the conduct of proceedings by a judicial or quasi-judicial officer cannot <i>per se</i> be instantly attributed to an injudicious performance of functions. For one's prompt dispatch may be another's undue haste. The orderly administration of justice remains as the paramount and constant consideration, with particular regard of the circumstances peculiar to each case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[261]</sup><br><br>Finally, no grave abuse of discretion may be imputed on the part of the Sandiganbayan in denying Reyes's motion to suspend proceedings against her in view of her filing of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> questioning the Ombudsman's issuances before the Court, <i>i.e.</i>, <b>G.R. Nos. 212593-94</b>. Under Section 7, Rule 65<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[262]</sup> of the Rules of Court, a mere pendency of a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> in relation to a case pending before the court <i>a quo</i> does not <i>ipso facto</i> stay the proceedings therein, unless the higher court issues a temporary restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction against the conduct of such proceedings. Otherwise stated, a petition for <i>certiorari</i> does not divest the lower courts of jurisdiction validly acquired over the case pending before them. Unlike an appeal, a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is an original action; it is not a continuation of the proceedings in the lower court. It is designed to correct only errors of jurisdiction, including grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Thus, under Section 7 of Rule 65, the higher court should issue against the public respondent a temporary restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction in order to interrupt the course of the principal case. The petitioner in a Rule 65 petition has the burden of proof to show that there is a meritorious ground for the issuance of an injunctive writ or order to suspend the proceedings before the public respondent. She should show the existence of an, urgent necessity for the writ or order, so that serious damage may be prevented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup> In this case, since the Court did not issue any temporary restraining order and/or a writ of preliminary injunction in <b>G.R.

Once the information is filed, the trial court acquires jurisdiction over the case. The trial court then determines the existence of probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest. Any question relating to the disposition of the case should be addressed to the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> In <i>Crespo v.

Castillo and Mejia</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><blockquote>There are two kinds of determination of probable cause: executive and judicial. The executive determination of probable cause is one made during preliminary investigation. It is a function that properly pertains to the public prosecutor who is given a broad discretion to determine whether probable cause exists and to charge those whom he believes to have committed the crime as defined by law and thus should be held for trial. Otherwise stated, such official has the quasi-judicial authority to determine whether or not a criminal case must be filed in court. <i>Whether or not that function has been correctly discharged by the public prosecutor, i.e., whether or not he has made a correct ascertainment of the existence of probable cause in a case, is a matter that the trial court itself does not and may not be compelled to pass upon.</i><br><br>The judicial determination of probable cause, on the other hand, is one made by the judge to ascertain whether a warrant of arrest should be issued against the accused. The judge must satisfy himself that based on the evidence submitted, there is necessity for placing the accused under custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice. If the judge finds no probable cause, the judge cannot be forced to issue the arrest warrant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Although both the prosecutor and the trial court may rely on the same records and evidence, their findings are arrived at independently. Executive determination of probable cause is outlined by the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Republic Act No. 6770,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and various issuances by the Department of Justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> It is the Constitution, however, that mandates the conduct of judicial determination of probable cause:<br><blockquote><center>ARTICLE III <br>BILL OF RIGHTS<br></center><br>Section 2. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of whatever nature and for any purpose shall be inviolable, and <i>no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized</i>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In <i>Ho v. People</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><blockquote>Lest we be too repetitive, we only wish to emphasize three vital matters once more: First, as held in <i>Inting</i>, the determination of probable cause by the prosecutor is for a purpose different from that which is to be made by the judge. Whether there is reasonable ground to believe that the accused is guilty of the offense charged and should be held for trial is what the prosecutor passes upon. The judge, on the other hand, determines whether a warrant of arrest should be issued against the accused, i.e. whether there is a necessity for placing him under immediate custody in order not to frustrate the ends of justice. Thus, even if both should base their findings on one and the same proceeding or evidence, there should be no confusion as to their distinct objectives.<br><br>Second, since their objectives are different, <i>the judge cannot rely solely on the report of the prosecutor in finding probable cause to justify the issuance of a warrant of arrest</i>. Obviously and understandably, the contents of the prosecutor's report will support his own conclusion that there is reason to charge the accused of an offense and hold him for trial. However, <i>the judge must decide independently. Hence, he must have supporting evidence, other than the prosecutor's bare report, upon which to legally sustain his own findings on the existence (or nonexistence) of probable cause to issue an arrest order. This responsibility of determining personally and independently the existence or nonexistence of probable cause is lodged in him by no less than the most basic law of the land.</i> Parenthetically, the prosecutor could ease the burden of the judge and speed up the litigation process by forwarding to the latter not only the information and his bare resolution finding probable cause, but also so much of the records and the evidence on hand as to enable His Honor to make his personal and separate judicial finding on whether to issue a warrant of arrest.<br><br>Lastly, it is not required that the complete or entire records of the case during the preliminary investigation be submitted to and examined by the judge. We do not intend to unduly burden trial courts by obliging them to examine the complete records of every case all the time simply for the purpose of ordering the arrest of an accused. What is required, rather, is that the judge must have sufficient supporting documents (such as the complaint, affidavits, counter-affidavits, sworn statements of witnesses or transcripts of stenographic notes, if any) upon which to make his independent judgment or, at the very least, upon which to verify the findings of the prosecutor as to the existence of probable cause. The point is: he cannot rely solely and entirely on the prosecutor's recommendation, as Respondent Court did in this case. <i>Although the prosecutor enjoys the legal presumption of regularity in the performance of his official duties and functions, which in turn gives his report the presumption of accuracy, the Constitution we repeat, commands the judge to personally determine probable cause in the issuance of warrants of arrest</i>. This Court has consistently held that a judge fails in his bounden duty if he relies merely on the certification or the report of the investigating officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Emphasis provided)<br></blockquote>The conduct of a preliminary investigation is also not a venue for an exhaustive display of petitioners' evidence. It is merely preparatory to a criminal action. In <i>Drilon v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><blockquote>Probable cause should be determined in a summary but scrupulous manner to prevent material damage to a potential accused's constitutional right of liberty and the guarantees of freedom and fair play. <i>The preliminary investigation is not the occasion for the full and exhaustive display of the parties' evidence. It is for the presentation of such evidence as may engender a well-grounded belief that an offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof.</i> It is a means of discovering the persons who may be reasonably charged with a crime. The validity and merits of a party's defense and accusation, as well as admissibility of testimonies and evidence, are better ventilated during trial proper than at the preliminary investigation level.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, in <i>People v. Narca</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> this court pointed out that any alleged irregularity in the preliminary investigation does not render the information void or affect the trial court's jurisdiction:<br><blockquote>It must be emphasized that the preliminary investigation is not the venue for the full exercise of the rights of the parties. This is why preliminary investigation is not considered as a part of trial but merely preparatory thereto and that the records therein shall not form part of the records of the case in court. Parties may submit affidavits but have no right to examine witnesses though they can propound questions through the investigating officer. In fact, a preliminary investigation may even be conducted ex-parte in certain cases. Moreover, in Section 1 of Rule 112, the purpose of a preliminary investigation is only to determine a well grounded belief if a crime was probably committed by an accused. <i>In any case, the invalidity or absence of a preliminary investigation does not affect the jurisdiction of the court which may have taken cognizance of the information nor impair the validity of the information or otherwise render it defective.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>A trial court's finding of probable cause does not rely on the prosecutor's finding of probable cause. Once the trial court finds the existence of probable cause, which results in the issuance of a warrant of arrest, any question on the prosecutor's conduct of preliminary investigation has already become moot.<br><br>In <i>De Lima v. Reyes</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> we dismissed a Petition for Review on Certiorari questioning the Secretary of Justice's finding of probable cause against the accused. Once probable cause has been judicially determined, any question on the executive determination of probable cause is already moot:<br><blockquote>Here, the trial court has already determined, independently of any finding or recommendation by the First Panel or the Second Panel, that probable cause exists to cause the issuance of the warrant of arrest against respondent. Probable cause has been judicially determined. Jurisdiction over the case, therefore, has transferred to the trial court. <i>A petition for <i>certiorari</i> questioning the validity of the preliminary investigation in any other venue has been rendered moot by the issuance of the warrant of arrest and the conduct of arraignment.</i><br><br>The Court of Appeals should have dismissed the Petition for Certiorari filed before them when the trial court issued its warrant of arrest. Since the trial court has already acquired jurisdiction over the case and the existence of probable cause has been judicially determined, a petition for <i>certiorari</i> questioning the conduct of the preliminary investigation ceases to be the "plain, speedy, and adequate remedy" provided by law. Since this Petition for Review is an appeal from a moot Petition for Certiorari, it must also be rendered moot.<br><br>The prudent course of action at this stage would be to proceed to trial. Respondent, however, is not without remedies. He may still file any appropriate action before the trial court or question any alleged irregularity in the preliminary investigation during pre-trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In its July 3, 2014 Resolution, the Sandiganbayan categorically states that "it had 'personally [read] and [evaluated] the Information, the Joint Resolution dated March 28, 2013 and Joint Order dated June 4, 2013 of the [Ombudsman] together with the above-enumerated documents, including their annexes and attachments, which are all part of the records of the preliminary investigation.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In its Resolution dated September 29, 2014, the Sandiganbayan reiterated that "[a]fter further considering the records of these cases and due deliberations, the [Sandiganbayan] finds the existence of probable cause against said accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Warrants of arrest have already been issued against petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, these Petitions questioning the Ombudsman's determination of probable cause have already become moot and academic.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the Petitions.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> An Act Defining and Penalizing the Crime of Plunder (1991).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Rep.
