Elvie P. Lim (Judge Lim) as acting presiding judge of Regional Trial Court Branch 2 (RTC-Br. 2), Borongan, Eastern Samar. The assailed Order granted the Motion for Issuance of Writ of Possession in favor of respondent Teresita Cabe over the property covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 41.<br><br>The Petition likewise prays for the issuance of a preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order (TRO) to enjoin the execution of the assailed Order.<br><br><center><b>THE ANTECEDENT FACTS</b><br></center><br>On 21 May 1997, respondent Cabe, together with Donato A. Cardona II (Cardona II), executed a Deed of Sale with <i>Pacto de Retro</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> over a parcel of land covered by OCT No. 41, registered under the "Heirs of Donato Cardona represented by Jovita T. Cardona."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The sale was with the conformity of Jovita Cardona and spouses Rhodo and Myrna Cardona (Spouses Cardona), who are Cardona II's grandmother and parents, respectively.<br><br>For failure of Cardona II to repurchase the property from her within one year as agreed upon in the deed, Cabe filed a Petition for Consolidation xof Ownership<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> over OCT No. 41 pursuant to Article 1607 of the Civil Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Docketed as Civil Case No. 3488 (consolidation case) and assigned to RTC-Br. 2, the Petition was granted by the trial court through a Decision dated 20 May 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Cardona II questioned the trial court's Decision by filing with the Court of Appeals (CA) a Rule 65 Petition for <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which was dismissed by the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Cardona II further appealed to the Supreme Court, but his appeal was also denied and, on 13 July 2005, an Entry of Judgment issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to this Court's Resolution denying Cardona IPs appeal, respondent Cabe filed a motion for execution of the RTC Decision in the consolidation case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which was granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>RTC-Br. 2 then issued a Writ of Execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Pursuant thereto, the Register of Deeds cancelled OCT No. 41 and issued, in lieu thereof, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 114-2011000028 under the name of respondent Cabe.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, Cabe prayed for the issuance of a Writ of Possession.

This action was filed by Spouses Latoja against Spouses Cardona, who are the parents of Cardona II, respondent in the consolidation case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Among the properties included in the partition case was OCT No. 41,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the same property subject of the consolidation case. The Judgment by Compromise awarded OCT No. 41 on a 50/50 <i>pro indiviso</i> ownership to Spouses Latoja and Spouses Cardona pursuant to their Compromise Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Spouses Latoja contend that Judge Lim, as acting presiding judge of <b>RTC-Br. 2</b>, wrongly granted the motion for the issuance of a Writ of Possession to Cabe despite the Judgment by Compromise he had previously rendered in the partition case. Judge Lim was then the presiding judge of <b>RTC-Br. 1</b>, Borongan, Eastern Samar when he awarded half of the same property to petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Alleging that they are in possession of a portion of the subject property,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> petitioners also pray for the issuance of a TRO to enjoin the implementation of the assailed Order in view of the issuance of the Notice to Vacate issued by the court sheriff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In a Resolution dated 14 December 2011, this Court granted the TRO prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In her Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> respondent Cabe contends that the Decision in the consolidation case had become final on 13 July 2005 after this Court dismissed the appeal of Cardona II and before the Judgment by Compromise was rendered in 2006. Therefore, Judge Lim was simply guided by the rule on the finality of judgment when he issued the assailed Order. Cabe asserts that she is therefore entitled to the writ of possession prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><center><b>THE ISSUE</b><br></center><br>The crucial issue in this case is whether public respondent Judge Lim committed grave abuse of discretion when he issued the Order granting the Motion for Issuance of Writ of Possession in favor of private respondent Cabe in the consolidation case.<br><br><center><b>THE COURT'S RULING</b><br></center><br>We grant the Petition for reasons as follows.<br><br><b><i>The Petition warrants a relaxation of procedural rules.</i></b><br><br>At the outset, We note some procedural lapses in the Petition filed before Us.<br><br>The Court enjoins the observance of the established policy on the hierarchy of courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Here, petitioners filed the present Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> directly before this Court instead of the CA. Such a course of action ought to be disallowed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Moreover, it is a rule that a motion for reconsideration of an assailed order is a condition precedent before filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In the present case, petitioners failed to file a motion for reconsideration of the Order granting the Motion for the Issuance of Writ of Possession, thereby depriving RTC-Br. 2 of the opportunity to correct an error it might have unwittingly committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Despite these procedural lapses, the Court deems it prudent to provide a resolution of the substantial issues raised by the parties. The resolution of these issues is pursuant to the policy that cases should as much as possible be resolved on the merits, and not on technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Strict adherence to rules of procedure must not get in the way of achieving substantial justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The Court, on compelling and meritorious grounds, has overlooked procedural flaws, such as (1) lack of a motion for reconsideration prior to a Rule 65 petition;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (2) non-exhaustion of administrative remedies;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (3) a disregard of the hierarchy of courts;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> and (4) an erroneous service of a petition on the opposing party, instead of the counsel of record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the exceptional circumstances in the instant case demand that the Court forego a rigid application of the technicalities, so as to allow the parties to determine their respective rights and liabilities under the law. In particular, we take note of the fact that the case involved here has been dragging on for years, with the consolidation case commencing as early as 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Further, the merits of the present case, as will be shown later, justify the relaxation of procedural technicalities.<br><br><b><i>Judge Lim committed grave abuse of discretion in granting the Motion for Issuance of Writ of Possession.</i></b><br><br>We find that Judge Lim committed grave abuse of discretion when he issued the Order for the issuance of the Writ of Possession prayed for by respondent Cabe in the consolidation case. We make this finding on grounds other than those posited by petitioners as will further be explained below.<br><br>Jurisprudence provides only these four instances when a writ of possession may issue: (1) land registration proceedings; (2) extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage of real property; (3) judicial foreclosure of property, provided that the mortgagor has possession, and no third party has intervened; and (4) execution sales.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Here, respondent Cabe sought the writ as a consequence of the trial court's Decision ordering the consolidation of the title over the subject property and vesting absolute ownership thereof in her name. Since the instant case clearly does not fall among the four instances enumerated above, the issuance of the Writ of Possession was not proper.<br><br>It is apparent that Cabe availed herself of the wrong remedy in seeking possession of the property via a Writ of Possession. She contends that she is entitled as a matter of right to the issuance of the writ as she has in her favor a court judgment, a writ of execution, and a new TCT under her own name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> This contention lacks merit.<br><br>The consolidation of title prescribed in Article 1607<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> of the Civil Code is merely for the purpose of registering and consolidating title to the property in case of a vendor <i>a retro's</i> failure to redeem.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Here, the trial court's Decision (affirmed by both the CA and the SC) merely resolved the issue of consolidation of ownership over the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Possession and ownership are distinct legal concepts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> A judgment in favor of ownership, therefore, does not necessarily include possession as a necessary incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>To further seek possession of the land would violate the established rule that a writ of execution must conform to the dispositive portion of the decision it seeks to enforce and cannot vary the terms thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Otherwise, the execution is void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Since the Writ of Possession in this case was issued as part of the execution process,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> it is likewise subject to this rule. Consequently, as the judgment being executed does not involve a disposition on Cabe's right of possession, the Writ of Possession itself is a patent nullity.<br><br>Deprived of possession, Cabe's remedy is not a Writ of Possession, but any of the available actions for the recovery of possession of real property, specifically the following: <i>accion interdictal</i>, when the dispossession has not lasted for more than one year; <i>accion publiciana</i>, when the dispossession has lasted for more than one year; or <i>accion reivindicatoria</i>, which seeks the recovery of ownership and necessarily includes possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Judge Lim overlooked the nature of the <i>Pacto de Retro</i> sale entered into by Cabe and Cardona II. It is basic that in a <i>pacto de retro sale</i>, the title and ownership of the property sold are immediately vested in the vendee <i>a retro</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> As a result, the vendee <i>a retro</i> has a right to the immediate possession of the property sold, unless otherwise agreed upon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Therefore, the right of respondent Cabe to possess the subject property must be founded on the terms of the <i>Pacto de Retro</i> Sale itself, and not on the Decision in the consolidation case. It would be erroneous to conclude that she is entitled as a matter of right to possession of the subject property by virtue of the Decision on consolidation which has become final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Judge Lim committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the Order granting Cabe's motion for the issuance of a writ of possession, as he went against basic law and established jurisprudence.<br><br>It must be emphasized that this Petition is confined to the resolution of Judge Lim's authority to order the issuance of the assailed Writ of Possession. Any contention raised as to the validity of the judgments, contracts, or titles involved in this case may be properly threshed out by the parties in a proper action for that purpose.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 65 is <b>GRANTED</b>.
