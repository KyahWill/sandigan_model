				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A determination of where the preponderance of evidence lies is a factual issue which, as a rule, cannot be entertained in a Rule 45 petition. When, however, the sole basis of the trial court for ruling on this issue is evidence that should not have been admitted for being hearsay, this court will embark on its own factual analysis and will, if necessary, reverse the rulings of the lower courts. A traffic accident investigation report prepared by a police officer relying solely on the account of a supposed eyewitness and not on his or her personal knowledge is not evidence that is admissible as an exception to the Hearsay Rule.<br><br>This resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure praying that the assailed May 11, 2011 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and September 8, 2011 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals Former Twelfth Division in CA-G.R.

PGIC paid Fidel Yuboco the entire amount of P320,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Asserting that it was subrogated to Fidel Yuboco's rights and that the proximate cause of the mishap was the negligence of the driver of the truck, PGIC, through counsel, sent DST Movers demand letters. PGIC demanded from DST Movers the amount of P90,000.00, which represented the difference between the P320,000.00 paid by PGIC to Yuboco and the salvage price of P230,000.00, at which PGIC was supposedly able to sell what remained of the sedan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Its demands not having been satisfied, PGIC proceeded to file its Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> for Sum of Money before the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila.

However, it claimed that the truck did not make any trips on February 28, 2002 as it was undergoing repairs and maintenance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> In support of this affirmative defense, DST Movers attached as Annexes "1" to "1-F"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> copies of invoices, receipts, and cash vouchers relating to repairs and maintenance procedures that were undertaken on the truck on specific dates, which included February 28, 2002.<br><br>Following the submission of the parties' position papers, Branch 22 of the Metropolitan Trial Court Manila rendered its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> favoring PGIC's version of events and finding DST Movers liable. The dispositive portion of this Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant ordering to pay the latter to pay the [sic] of Php90,000.00 as actual damages plus interest of 12% per annum from the date of filing of the complaint and the sum of Php10,000.00 as and for attorney's fees and the costs of suit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>On appeal, the ruling of the Metropolitan Trial Court was affirmed in toto by Branch 47 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>DST Movers then filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for Review under Rule 42 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<br><br>In its assailed May 11, 2011 Decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the rulings of the Regional Trial Court and the Metropolitan Trial Court. However, it noted that PGIC failed to prove actual loss with reasonable certainty. As such, the Court of Appeals deleted the award of P90,000.00 in actual damages and replaced it with an award of P25,000.00 in temperate damages.<br><br>In its assailed September 8, 2011 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court of Appeals denied DST Movers' Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>Hence, DST Movers filed the present Petition insisting that its liability was not established by a preponderance of evidence. Specifically, it faults the Metropolitan Trial Court for ruling in favor of PGIC despite how its version of events was supported by nothing more the Traffic Accident Investigation Report. It asserts that reliance on this Report was misplaced as it was supposedly "improperly identified [and] uncorroborated."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>For resolution is the issue of whether petitioner DST Movers Corporation's liability was established by a preponderance of evidence. Subsumed in this is whether it was an error for the Metropolitan Trial Court to admit and lend evidentiary weight to the piece of evidence chiefly relied upon by respondent People's General Insurance Corporation: the Traffic Accident Investigation Report prepared by PO2 Tomas.<br><br><center>I<br></center><br>Petitioner comes to this court through a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. It invites this court to reconsider the consistent rulings of the Court of Appeals, the Regional Trial Court, and the Metropolitan Trial Court that petitioner's liability arising from the February 28, 2002 incident was established by a preponderance of evidence.<br><br>A Rule 45 petition pertains to questions of law and not to factual issues. Rule 45, Section 1 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure is unequivocal:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. Filing of Petition with Supreme Court. — A party desiring to appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on certiorari. <i>The petition shall raise only questions of law</i> which must be distinctly set forth.<br></blockquote>This court's Decision in <i>Cheesman v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> distinguished questions of law from questions of fact:<br><blockquote>As distinguished from a question of law — which exists "when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts" — "there is a question of fact when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or the falsehood of alleged facts;" or when the "query necessarily invites calibration of the whole evidence considering mainly the credibility of witnesses, existence and relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances, their relation to each other and to the whole and the probabilities of the situation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Seeking recourse from this court through a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 bears significantly on the manner by which this court shall treat findings of fact and evidentiary matters. As a general rule, it becomes improper for this court to consider factual issues: the findings of fact of the trial court, as affirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeals, are conclusive on this court. "The reason behind the rule is that [this] Court is not a trier of facts and it is not its duty to review, evaluate, and weigh the probative value of the evidence adduced before the lower courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>A determination of whether a matter has been established by a preponderance of evidence is, by definition, a question of fact. It entails an appreciation of the relative weight of the competing parties' evidence. Rule 133, Section 1 of the Revised Rules on Evidence provides a guide on what courts may consider in determining where the preponderance of evidence lies:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. Preponderance of evidence, how determined. — In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof must establish his case by a preponderance of evidence. In determining where the preponderance or superior weight of evidence on the issues involved lies, the court may consider all the facts and circumstances of the case, the witnesses' manner of testifying, their intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing the facts to which they are testifying, the nature of the facts to which they testify, the probability or improbability of their testimony, their interest or want of interest, and also their personal credibility so far as the same may legitimately appear upon the trial. The court may also consider the number of witnesses, though the preponderance is not necessarily with the greater number.<br></blockquote>Consistent with <i>Cheesman</i>, such determination is a "query [that] necessarily invites calibration of the whole evidence considering mainly the credibility of witnesses, existence and relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances, their relation to each other and to the whole and the probabilities of the situation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On point as regards civil liability for damages, this court in <i>Caina v. People of the Philippines</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> explained:<br><blockquote>Questions on whether or not there was a preponderance of evidence to justify the award of damages or whether or not there was a causal connection between the given set of facts and the damage suffered by the private complainant or whether or not the act from which civil liability might arise exists are questions of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>Equally on point, this court has explained in many instances that a determination of the causes of and circumstances relating to vehicular accidents is a factual matter that this court may not revisit when the findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals are completely in accord.<br><br>In <i>Industrial Insurance Co. v. Bondad</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><blockquote>Questions regarding the cause of the accident and the persons responsible for it are factual issues which we cannot pass upon. It is jurisprudentially settled that, as a rule, the jurisdiction of this Court is limited to a review of errors of law allegedly committed by the appellate court. It is not bound to analyze and weigh all over again the evidence already considered in the proceedings below.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>Likewise, in <i>Viron Transportation v. Delos Santos</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><blockquote>The rule is settled that the findings of the trial court especially when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are conclusive on this Court when supported by the evidence on record. The Supreme Court will not assess and evaluate all over again the evidence, testimonial and documentary adduced by the parties to an appeal particularly where, such as here, the findings of both the trial court and the appellate court on the maker coincide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>However, there are exceptions that leave room for this court to make a factual determination for itself and, ultimately, to overturn the factual findings with which it is confronted:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises and conjectures;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Where there is a grave abuse of discretion;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(4)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(5)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> When the findings of fact are conflicting;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(6) </div></td><td><div align="justify">When the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(7) </div></td><td><div align="justify">When the findings are contrary to those of the trial court;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(8)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(9) </div></td><td><div align="justify">When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioners' main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(10) </div></td><td><div align="justify">When the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In <i>Dela Llana v. Biong</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> this court conducted its own (re-) examination of the evidence as the findings of the Regional Trial Court conflicted with those of the Court of Appeals. The Regional Trial Court held that the proximate cause of the injuries suffered by the petitioner was the supposed reckless driving of the respondent's employee; the Court of Appeals held otherwise. On review, this court sustained the findings of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>In <i>Standard Insurance v. Cuaresma</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> the ruling of the Metropolitan Trial Court was reversed by the Regional Trial Court. The latter was then sustained by the Court of Appeals. On review, this court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. This court noted that the Metropolitan Trial Court erroneously gave weight to the traffic accident investigation report presented by the petitioner as proof of the proximate cause of the damage sustained by a motor vehicle.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>Here, petitioner insists that the Traffic Accident Investigation Report prepared by PO2 Tomas should not have been admitted and accorded weight by the Metropolitan Trial Court as it was "improperly identified [and] uncorroborated."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Petitioner, in effect, asserts that the non-presentation in court of PO2 Tomas, the officer who prepared the report, was fatal to respondent's cause.<br><br>Unlike in <i>Dela Llana</i> and <i>Standard Insurance</i>, the findings of the Metropolitan Trial Court, the Regional Trial Court, and the Court of Appeals in this case are all in accord. They consistently ruled that the proximate cause of the damage sustained by the sedan was the negligent driving of a vehicle owned by petitioner. As with <i>Standard Insurance</i>, however, this conclusion is founded on the misplaced probative value accorded to a traffic accident investigation report. In the first place, this Report should not have been admitted as evidence for violating the Hearsay Rule. Bereft of evidentiary basis, the conclusion of the lower courts cannot stand as it has been reduced to conjecture. Thus, we reverse this conclusion.<br><br>Rule 130, Section 36 of the Revised Rules on Evidence provides for the Hearsay Rule. It renders inadmissible as evidence out-of-court statements made by persons who are not presented as witnesses but are offered as proof of the matters stated. This rule proceeds from the basic rationale of fairness, as the party against whom it is presented is unable to cross-examine the person making the statement:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><blockquote>SECTION 36. Testimony generally confined to personal knowledge; hearsay excluded. — A witness can testify only to those facts which he knows of his personal knowledge; that is, which are derived from his own perception, except as otherwise provided in these rules.<br></blockquote>The Hearsay Rule, however, is not absolute. Sections 37 to 47 of Rule 130 of the Revised Rules on Evidence enumerate the exceptions to the Hearsay Rule. Of these, Section 44—regarding entries in official records—is particularly relevant to this case:<br><blockquote>SECTION 44. Entries in official records. — Entries in official records made in the performance of his duty by a public officer of the Philippines, or by a person in the performance of a duty specially enjoined by law, are prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.<br></blockquote>Precisely as an exception to the Hearsay Rule, Rule 130, Section 44 does away with the need for presenting as witness the public officer or person performing a duty specially enjoined by law who made the entry. This, however, is only true, for as long the following requisites have been satisfied:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">that the entry was made by a public officer or by another person specially enjoined by law to do so;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> that it was made by the public officer in the performance of his duties, or by such other person in the performance of a duty specially enjoined by law; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(c) </div></td><td><div align="justify">that the public officer or other person had sufficient knowledge of the facts by him stated, which must have been acquired by him personally or through official information.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Respondent, the Metropolitan Trial Court, the Regional Trial Court, and the Court of Appeals are all of the position that the Report prepared by PO2 Tomas satisfies these requisites. Thus, they maintain that it is admissible as prima facie evidence of the facts it states. This despite the admitted fact that neither PO2 Tomas, nor the person who supposedly reported the events of February 28, 2002 to PO2 Tomas - the person identified as "G. Simbahon of PNCC/SLEX"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> - gave a testimony in support of the Report.<br><br>They are in serious error.<br><br>The statements made by this court in <i>Standard Insurance</i> are on point:<br><blockquote>[F]or the Traffic Accident Investigation Report to be admissible as prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated, the following requisites must be present:<br><blockquote>... (a) that the entry was made by a public officer or by another person specially enjoined by law to do so; (b) that it was made by the public officer in the performance of his duties, or by such other person in the performance of a duty specially enjoined by law; and (c) that the public officer or other person had sufficient knowledge of the facts by him stated, which must have been acquired by him personally or through official information.<br></blockquote>Regrettably, in this case, petitioner failed to prove the third requisite cited above. As correctly noted by the courts below, while the Traffic Accident Investigation Report was exhibited as evidence, the investigating officer who prepared the same was not presented in court to testify that he had sufficient knowledge of the facts therein stated, and that he acquired them personally or through official information. Neither was there any explanation as to why such officer was not presented. <i>We cannot simply assume, in the absence of proof, that the account of the incident stated in the report was based on the personal knowledge of the investigating officer who prepared it.</i><br><br>Thus, while petitioner presented its assured to testify on the events that transpired during the vehicular collision, his lone testimony, unsupported by other preponderant evidence, fails to sufficiently establish petitioner's claim that respondents' negligence was, indeed, the proximate cause of the damage sustained by Cham's vehicle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> [Emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote>Respondent presented proof of the occurrence of an accident that damaged Fidel Yuboco's Honda Civic sedan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> that the sedan was insured by respondent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and that respondent paid Fidel Yuboco's insurance claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> As to the identity, however, of the vehicle or of the person responsible for the damage sustained by the sedan, all that respondent relies on is the Report prepared by PO2 Tomas.<br><br>It is plain to see that the matters indicated in the Report are not matters that were personally known to PO2 Tomas. The Report is candid in admitting that the matters it states were merely reported to PO2 Tomas by "G. Simbahon of PNCC/SLEX."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It was this "G. Simbahon," not PO2 Tomas, who had personal knowledge of the facts stated in the Report. Thus, even as the Report embodies entries made by a public officer in the performance of his duties, it fails to satisfy the third requisite for admissibility for entries in official records as an exception to the Hearsay Rule.<br><br>To be admitted as evidence, it was thus imperative for the person who prepared the Report—PO2 Tomas—to have himself presented as a witness and then testify on his Report. However, even as the Report would have been admitted as evidence, PO2 Tomas' testimony would not have sufficed in establishing the identity of the motor vehicle and/or the person responsible for the damage sustained by the sedan. For this purpose, the testimony of G. Simbahon was necessary.<br><br>Of course, we are aware that this case was decided by the Metropolitan Trial Court pursuant to the Revised Rule on Summary Procedure (considering that petitioner's total claims amounted to less than P200,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>). Accordingly, no trial was conducted as, after the conduct of a preliminary conference, the parties were made to submit their position papers. There was, thus, no opportunity to present witnesses during an actual trial. However, Section 9 of the Revised Rule on Summary Procedure calls for the submission of witnesses' affidavits together with a party's position paper and after the conduct of a preliminary conference:<br><blockquote>SECTION 9. Submission of Affidavits and Position Papers. — Within ten (10) days from receipt of the order mentioned in the next preceding section,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the parties shall submit the affidavits of their witnesses and other evidence on the factual issues defined in the order, together with their position papers setting forth the law and the facts relied upon by them.<br></blockquote>These affidavits take the place of actual testimony in court and serve to expedite the resolution of cases covered by the Revised Rule on Summary Procedure. Thus, it was still insufficient for respondent to have merely annexed the Report to its Position Paper. By its lonesome, and unsupported by an affidavit executed by PO2 Tomas, the Report was hearsay and, thus, inadmissible.<br><br>As the sole evidence relied upon by respondent as to the identity of the responsible motor vehicle or person has been rendered unworthy of even the slightest judicial consideration, there is no basis for holding—as the Metropolitan Trial Court did—that the motor vehicle responsible for the damage sustained by the sedan was owned by petitioner. Not only this, petitioner has even adduced proof that on February 28, 2002, its Isuzu Elf truck with plate number UAL-295 was undergoing repairs and maintenance and, thus, could not have been at the South Luzon Expressway. The weight of evidence is clearly in petitioner's favor.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is <b>GRANTED</b>.
