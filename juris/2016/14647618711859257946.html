				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before the Court are the motion for reconsideration filed by the Republic of the Philippines (Department of Transportation and Communications) and the Manila International Airport Authority (<i>Republic</i> for brevity), and the respective partial motions for reconsideration of Philippine International Airport Terminals Co., Inc. (<i>PIATCO</i>) and of Takenaka Corporation (<i>Takenaka</i>) and Asahikosan Corporation (<i>Asahikosan</i>). In these motions, the parties assail the Court's Decision dated September 8, 2015 (<i>Decision</i>)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br><u><center><b>I. The Factual Antecedents</b></center></u><br><br><i><b>A. The concession agreement between the<br>Republic and PIATCO; PIATCO's subcontract <br>agreements with Takenaka and Asahikosan</b></i><br><br>On July 12, 1997, the Republic executed a <i><b>concession agreement</b></i> with PIATCO for the construction, development, and operation of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Passenger Terminal III <i>(NAIA-IPT III)</i> under a <i>build-operate-transfer scheme</i>. The parties subsequently amended their concession agreement and entered into several supplemental agreements (collectively referred to as the <i>PIATCO contracts</i>).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>In the PIATCO contracts, the Republic authorized PIATCO to build, operate, and maintain the NAIA-IPT III during the concession period of twenty-five (25) years.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On March 31, 2000, <i><b>PIATCO engaged the services of Takenaka for the construction of the NAIA-IPT III</b></i> under an <b>Onshore Construction Contract.</b> On the same date, <i><b>PIATCO </b></i>also entered into an <b>Offshore Procurement Contract</b> with <i><b>Asahikosan</b></i> for the design, manufacture, purchase, test and delivery of the Plant in the NAIA-IPT III. Both contracts were supplemented by succeeding agreements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In May 2002, <i><b>PIATCO failed to pay for the services rendered by Takenaka and Asahikosan</b></i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><i><b>B. The Agan v. PIATCO</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i><b>case: the <br>nullification of the PIATCO contracts</b></i><br><br>On May 5, 2003, the Court nullified the PIATCO contracts in <i><b>Agan v. PIATCO</b></i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> on the grounds that: (a) the Paircargo Consortium (that later incorporated into PIATCO) was not a duly pre-qualified bidder; and (b) the PIATCO contracts contained provisions that substantially departed from the draft Concession Agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On <b>January 21, 2004</b>, the Court issued a resolution (<i>2004 Agan Resolution</i>), denying PIATCO, et al.'s motion for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Significantly, we stated in the resolution that the<i><b> Republic should first pay PIATCO before it could take over the NAIA-IPTHI</b></i>. We further ruled that "<i>the compensation must be just and in accordance with law and equity for the Republic cannot unjustly enrich itself at the expense of PIATCO and its investors</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><b>C. <i>The expropriation case before the RTC</i><br></b><br>On <b>December 21, 2004</b>, the Republic filed a <b>complaint for the expropriation</b> of the NAIA-IPT III before the Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC</i>) of Pasay, Branch 117, docketed as Civil Case No. 04-0876. Notably, the property to be expropriated only involves the NAIA-IPT III structure and did not include the land which the Republic already owns.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><b>On the same day</b>, the RTC issued a <b>writ of possession</b> in favor of the Republic <b>pursuant to Rule 67</b> of the Rules of Court (<i>Rule 67</i>). The writ was issued based on the Republic's manifestation that it had deposited with the Land Bank of the Philippines (<i>Land Bank</i>) the amount of P3,002,125,000.00, representing the NAIA-IPT Ill's <b>assessed value</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On <b>January 4, 2005</b>, the RTC <b>supplemented its December 21, 2004 order</b>. The RTC applied Republic Act (<i>RA</i>) No. 8974 instead of Rule 67 as basis for the effectivity of the writ of possession. The RTC ruled, among others, that the Land Bank should immediately release to PIATCO the amount of <b>US$62,343,175.77</b>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to be deducted eventually from the just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In the course of the RTC expropriation proceedings, the RTC allowed Takenaka and Asahikosan to intervene in the case. Takenaka and Asahikosan based their intervention on the foreign judgments issued in their favor in the two collection cases that they filed against PIATCO {London awards). Takenaka and Asahikosan asked the RTC to: (a) hold in abeyance the release of just compensation to PIATCO until the London awards are recognized and enforced in the Philippines; and (b) order that the just compensation be deposited with the RTC for the benefit of PIATCO's creditors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The Republic questioned the <b>January 4, 2005</b> RTC order and two other RTC orders<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> before this Court in the case entitled <i><b>Republic v. Gingoyon</b></i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On January 14, 2005, we issued a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the implementation of the assailed RTC orders, including the January 4, 2005 RTC order.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><i><b>D. Developments pending the expropriation <br>case: the Republic v. Gingoyon case</b></i><br><br>In <i>Gingoyon</i>, the Court partly granted the Republic's petition on December 19, 2005.<br><br>We adopted the 2004 <i>Agan </i>Resolution in ruling that the Republic is barred from taking over the NAIA-IPT III until just compensation is paid to PIATCO as the builder and owner of the structure.<br><br>We also ruled that RA No. 8974 applies insofar as it: (a) provides <b>valuation standards</b> in determining the amount of just compensation; and (b) requires the Republic to <i><b>immediately pay </b></i>PIATCO at least the <b>proffered value</b> of the NAIA-IPT III for purposes of <i><b>determining the effectivity of the writ of possession.</b></i><br><br>We also held that <i><b>Rule 67</b></i> shall apply <i><b>to the procedural matters</b></i> of the expropriation proceedings insofar as it is consistent with RA 8974 and its implementing rules and regulations (<i>IRR</i>), and Agan.<br><br>Applying RA No. 8974, <i><b>we held in abeyance the implementation of the writ of possession</b></i> until the Republic <b>directly</b> pays PIATCO the <b>proffered value </b>of P3 billion. We also authorized the Republic to <b>perform acts essential to the operation of the NAIA-IPT III once the writ of possession becomes <i>effective</i>.</b><br><br>For purposes of computing just compensation, we held that PIATCO should only be paid the <b>value of the improvements and/or structures</b> using the <b>replacement cost method</b> under Section 10 of RA 8974 IRR.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> We added, however, that the replacement cost method is only one of the factors to be considered in determining just compensation; <b>equity</b> should also be considered.<br><br>On February 1, 2006, we denied the Republic, et al.'s motion for partial reconsideration. Citing procedural errors, we also denied the motions for intervention of Asahikosan, Takenaka, and Rep. Salacnib F. Baterina.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[20]</sup></font><br><br><b><i>E. The continuation of the expropriation<br>proceedings after the finality of the<br>Gingoyon case; the present cases before<br> the Court</i></b><br><br>Pursuant to our mandate in <i>Gingoyon</i>, the RTC proceeded to determine the amount of just compensation.<br><br>In compliance with the RTC's order, the Republic tendered to PIATCO the P3 billion proffered value on <u><b>September 11, 2006</b></u>. <i><b>On the same day</b></i>, <b>the RTC <i>reinstated the writ of possession </i>in favor of the Republic</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In compliance with the RTC order dated August 5, 2010, the parties and the BOC submitted their appraisal reports on NAIA-IPT III, as follows: (1) the Republic's appraisal was US$149,448,037.00; (2) PIATCO's appraisal was US$905,867,549.47; (3) Takenaka and Asahikosan's appraisal was US$360,969,790.82; and (4) the BOC's appraisal was US$376,149,742.56, plus interest and commissioner's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In the RTC's decision dated May 23, 2011, the RTC computed just compensation at US$116,348,641.10. The RTC further directed the Republic and the team of Takenaka and Asahikosan to pay their respective shares in the BOC expenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>On appeal with the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 98029, the CA issued its amended decision, computing the just compensation at US$371,426,688.24 as of July 31, 2013 plus 6% <i>per annum</i> on the amount due from finality of judgment until fully paid. The CA further held that Takenaka and Asahikosan are both liable to share in the BOC expenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The RTC rulings and CA decision in the expropriation cases led to the present consolidated cases before us, specifically:<br><br><i><b>G.R. No. 181892</b></i> was filed by the Republic to question the RTC's orders: (1) appointing DG Jones and Partners as independent appraiser; (2) directing the Republic to submit a Certificate of Availability of Funds to cover DG Jones and Partners' US$1.9 Million appraisal fee; and (3) sustaining the appointment of DG Jones and Partners as an independent appraiser.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><i><b>G.R. Nos. 209917, 209731</b></i>, and <i><b>209696</b></i> were filed by the Republic, PIATCO, and Takenaka and Asahikosan, respectively questioning the CA's decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><u><b><center>II. Our ruling dated September 8, 2015 <br>in G.R. Nos. 181892, 209917, 209696, 209731</center></b></u><br><br>In our <b>Decision dated September 8, 2015</b>, we applied the standards laid down under Section 7, RA 8974 and Section 10 of RA 8974 IRR. We likewise applied equity pursuant to <i>Gingoyon</i>.<br><br>We ruled that PIATCO, as the owner of the NAIA-IPT III, is the <b>sole recipient</b> of the just compensation even though Takenaka and Asahikosan actually built the NAIA-IPT III.<br><br>We did not grant Takenaka and Asahikosan's prayer to set aside a portion of just compensation to secure their claims, as we would be pre­empting the Court's ruling in the enforcement case, specifically, G.R. No. 202166, which is still pending before the Court.<br><br>We ruled that the Republic shall only have ownership of the NAIA-IPT III <b>after</b> it <b>fully</b> pays PIATCO the just compensation due. However, the determination of whether the NAIA-IPT III shall be burdened by liens and mortgages even after the full payment of just compensation is still premature.<br><br>In <b>computing the just compensation</b>, we applied the <b>depreciated replacement cost method</b> consistent with Section 10 of RA 8974 IRR and the principle that the property owner of the expropriated property shall be compensated for his <i><b>actual loss</b></i>. We therefore agreed with the Gleeds' deduction of depreciation and deterioration from the construction cost.<br><br>We adopted Gleeds' construction cost at US$300,206,693.00 as the base value at December 2002. We also rejected the Republic's argument that the amounts pertaining to the <i>unnecessary areas, structural defect,</i> and <i>costs for rectification for contract compliance </i>should be excluded from the base value. We likewise did not add attendant costs as it already formed part of the Gleeds' computation of construction cost.<br><br>Applying equity, we adjusted the replacement cost computed at December 2002 to December 2004 values using the Consumer Price Index.<br><br>We likewise imposed interest on the unpaid amount of just compensation, reckoned from September 11, 2006 when the writ of possession was reinstated in favor of the Republic.<br><br>In summary, we computed the just compensation as of December 21, 2004 at US$326,932,221.26. We deducted from this sum the proffered value of US$59,438,604.00. We ruled that the resulting difference of US$267,493,617.26 shall earn a straight interest of 12% per annum from September 11, 2006 until June 30, 2013, and a straight interest of 6% per annum from July 1, 2013, until full payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Finally, we reversed the CA's ruling that Takenaka and Asahikosan were liable to share in the BOC expenses. We ruled that the Republic shall solely bear these expenses as part of the costs of expropriation. We however ruled that PIATCO, which voluntarily paid a portion of the BOC expenses and did not question the rulings ordering it to pay, is deemed to have waived its right not to share in these expenses.<br><br><center><b><u>III. The parties' motion for reconsideration and<br>motions for partial reconsideration of our September 8, 2015 Decision</u></b></center><br><br>The parties assail our Decision. The Republic filed its motion for reconsideration while PIATCO and Takenaka and Asahikosan filed their respective partial motions for reconsideration.<br><br><i><b>A. The Republic's motion for reconsideration</b></i><br><br>The Republic argues as follows:<br><br><i><b>First</b></i>, the Court should declare that, upon payment of just compensation, full ownership shall be vested in the Republic, <i>free from liens and encumbrances.</i><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[28]</sup></font><br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, the just compensation <i>should not earn interest</i>. The Republic prays for the deletion of US$242,810,918.54 awarded to PIATCO by way of interest.<br><br>According to the Republic, the present case is <i>sui generis</i> as the expropriation resulted from the nullification of the concession agreement; hence, the traditional notion of "just compensation" is inapplicable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The Republic cites our rulings in <i>Agan</i> and <i>Gingoyon</i> that the <i>principle of unjust enrichment or solutio indebiti</i> is the standard in fixing just compensation in the present case. According to the Republic, this principle results in the application of the doctrine of restitution which arose as a consequence of Agon's nullification of the concession agreements.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[30]</sup></font> The Republic referred to Justice Panganiban's concurring opinion in <i>Agan</i> that the <i>quantum meruit</i> principle should be applied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The Republic further argues that the award of interest is unjustifiable because: (<i>a</i>) PIATCO has no "income-generating capacity" from the expropriated structures due to the nullification of the concession agreements; and (<i>b</i>) the Republic should not be made liable to pay interest as the delay in the prompt payment of just compensation was due to the deliberate refusal of PIATCO, Takenaka and Asahikosan to submit the valuation of the NAIA-IPT III.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The Republic concludes that the Court's award of interest in the present case is contrary to <i>Agan</i> and <i>Gingoyon</i> and would result in PIATCO "profiting" from its own misdeed that caused the nullification of the concession agreements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><i><b>Third</b></i>, the Court erred in not deducting from the computed just compensation the <i>amounts pertaining to structural defects, unnecessary areas,</i> and <i>rectification</i> for contract compliance.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The Republic asserts that the amounts pertaining to NAIA-IPT Ill's <b>structural defects</b> should be excluded from the computation of just compensation. According to the Republic, the equiponderance of evidence rule is inapplicable because it had proven by overwhelming evidence that the NAIA-IPT III suffered from massive structural defects. PIATCO allegedly admitted this fact in the Scott Wilson Report.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The Republic also points to the structural remediation programs that MIAA conducted prior to the NAIA-IPT Ill's operation, showing that it was structurally defective. PIATCO also failed to refute the findings of TGCI, one of the Republic's engineering experts, that the NAIA-IPT III would not have been damaged by the 2008 Pangasinan earthquake if it had been structurally sound.<br><br>The Republic posits that it was forced to expropriate a structure that does not conform with the design intended to serve its purpose; worse, the design contains facilities that are not essential for an airport (such as the retail mall and excess retail concession space). PIATCO should not be compensated for these structures as the Republic had to spend for the rectification expenses.<br><br><u><i><b>B. PIATCO's partial motion for reconsideration</b></i></u><br><br>PIATCO seeks the partial reconsideration of our decision under the following arguments:<br><br><i><b>First</b></i>, the Court erred in applying the <i>depreciated replacement cost method in computing just compensation</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>RA 8974 and its IRR never used the terms "depreciated replacement cost," "deterioration," or any other type of adjustment to the replacement cost.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><i><b>Second</b></i>, the financial concept of <i>depreciation is inapplicable</i> in the determination of just compensation in expropriation cases. <i>An asset may still be valuable and yet appear as fully depreciated in financial statements.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><i><b>Third</b></i>, assuming the accounting concept of "depreciation" is relevant, <i>depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use</i>. The Republic should therefore bear the cost of depreciation since the NAIA-IPT III was available for use only in December 21, 2004 when the Republic operated it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>PIATCO further argues that Gleeds, which first visited NAIA-IPT III only on May 2006, could not have possibly evaluated deterioration in the structure that supposedly occurred between 2002 and 2004.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[40]</sup></font><br><br><i><b>Fourth</b></i>, PIATCO argues that the Court erred in <i>excluding</i> PIATCO's computation of <i>attendant costs.</i><br><br>According to PIATCO, the photocopied documents evidencing its attendant costs are admissible and have probative value. These documents were accompanied by the affidavit dated December 14, 2010 of PIATCO's VP for Legal and Corporate Affairs, Atty. Moises S. Tolentino, Jr. (<i>Atty. Tolentino</i>). In his affidavit, he identified the documents and affirmed that these photocopies were certified true copies and/or faithful reproductions of the originals in his possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>PIATCO further argues that these documents were submitted in a summary and informal proceeding before the BOC. The parties' failure to object to the offered evidence rendered the photocopy documents admissible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, PIATCO points out that the construction cost in the Gleeds report, which the Court had adopted in the present case, excluded attendant costs, financing costs, and other associated costs as confirmed by the Scott Wilson Report. <i>Even Gleeds admitted that the attendant costs reflected in its report excluded the financing cost</i> in the amount of US$26,602,890.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> As such, at the very least, PIATCO should be awarded financing costs on top of the construction cost as supported by documents submitted to the lower court.<br><br>PIATCO further avers that the Court has misquoted item 3.1.17 of the Scott Wilson Report in page 99 of our Decision. The quote in our Decision states that PIATCO has paid US$7.9 million to the QA Inspectors (JAC) and US$4.2 million to PCI, SOM, PACICON and JGC, and this appears "<u><b>not reasonable</b></u>." PIATCO alleged that the correct provision of clause 3.1.17 in the Scott Wilson Report states that these PIATCO payments appear "<b>not unreasonable</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The Court should award PIATCO's attendant costs in view of Scott Wilson's findings that the paid fees under clause 3.1.17 are <b>reasonable</b>. <font color="#FF0000"><sup>[45]</sup></font><br><br><i><b>Fifth</b></i>, PIATCO argues that the Court erred in reckoning the period for the interest payment only on September 11, 2006. PIATCO avers that the Court is <b>mistaken </b>in its impression that the <i>Republic took possession of NAIA-IPT III only on September 11, 2006</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>PIATCO insists that the interest should be computed from the date of the actual taking or on December 21, 2004 when the Republic filed the expropriation complaint and <b>actually</b> took physical possession of NAIA-IPT III. According to PIATCO, the RTC order dated January 7, 2005 confirms this fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>PIATCO also argues that the Republic stubbornly refused to pay the proffered value, thus resulting in the delay of the reinstatement of the writ of possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In the computation of interest, PIATCO further argues that the Court should consider the leap years, specifically years 2008 and 2012, with 366 days instead of just 365 days as stated in our Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>PIATCO likewise brings to the Court's attention the <i>discrepancy on the dates mentioned in the Decision.</i> PIATCO notes the Court's statement on page 41 of the Decision that the CA reckoned the period for the computation of interest <i>on September 11, 2006.</i> However, page 42 of our Decision shows in tabular form that the CA computed the interest from December 21, 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>According to PIATCO, the abovementioned date of "September 11, 2006" in page 41 of the Decision might have been a typographical error since the other statements in the Decision were consistent that the CA computed interest from December 21, 2004. In any case, PIATCO reiterates its position that the interest rate of 12% <i>per annum</i> should be computed from December 21, 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><i><b>Sixth</b></i>, PIATCO argues that it should <i>not be held liable to share the BOC expenses</i> in view of the Court's Decision that the Republic should solely bear the cost of expropriation. PIATCO disagrees with the Court's statement that PIATCO's voluntary payment served as a waiver of its right not to share in the BOC expenses.<br><br>According to PIATCO, its payment was out of faithful compliance with the RTC's order dated March 11, 2011, directing the Republic, PIATCO and Takenaka and Asahikosan to proportionately share in the BOC's mobilization fund.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Consequently, PIATCO invokes the principle of <i>solutio indebiti</i> and equity in arguing that it should be refunded the P2.550 million that it had mistakenly paid as its share in the BOC expenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><i><b>Seventh,</b></i> PIATCO argues that the Bureau of Internal Revenue's (<i>BIR</i>) present and future tax assessments against PIATCO in relation to the supply for and construction of the NAIA-IPT III should be added to the just compensation. This approach is consistent with the definition of "replacement cost" under Section 10 of RA 8974 1RR. PIATCO manifested that the BIR had intensified its harassment on PIATCO since the promulgation of our Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><u><i><b>C. Asahikosan and Takenaka's motion for partial reconsideration</b></i></u><br><br>Takenaka and Asahikosan argue that the Court misconstrued their prayers in the petition. They clarified that they are not asking the Court to order that any part of the just compensation be paid directly to them.

Scott Wilson's statement on the unreasonableness of Gleeds' computation only pertains to the baggage handling item out of the seven (7) deterioration items.<br><br>At any rate, Gleeds sufficiently showed how it arrived at the amount of deterioration.

Act No. 8974, but to principles of equity as well</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup><br><br>In our Decision now on reconsideration,<i> we simply pursued the above directive in Gingoyon</i>. Specifically, we applied the law, RA 8974, and equity in: (1) adopting the depreciated replacement cost method in computing just compensation; and (2) adjusting the computed 2002 replacement cost of NAIA-IPT III to its 2004 value.<br><br>By adopting the depreciated replacement cost method, we took into consideration that the Republic did not expropriate a brand new airport at the time of taking on December 21, 2004.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> Similarly, we considered that PIATCO should be compensated for the 2004 value of the airport by adjusting the 2002 computed construction cost to its 2004 value by using the consumer price index.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup><br><br>In applying RA 8974 and equity in our computation of just compensation, <b>we</b> <i>thus complied with the mandate of Agan </i>that the Republic cannot unjustly enrich itself at the expense of PIATCO and its investors. We did this by ordering the Republic to pay just compensation, <i><u>in the context of expropriation</u>, which the Republic itself filed to acquire the NAIA-IPT III.</i><br><br>In applying <i>Agan</i> and <i>Gingoyon</i>, we also fulfilled our duty to award compensation that is fair and just both to the Republic and PIATCO.<br><br>Consequently, we cannot adopt Justice Panganiban's concurring opinion in Agan prescribing the application of the principle of <i>quantum meruit</i>; his opinion - it should be noted - had never been made a part of the majority decision.<br><br>In these lights, we deny the Republic's argument that we should not impose interest on the just compensation award to PIATCO.<br><br><i><b>C.2.

Hence, there is no reason to doubt that the Republic was fully aware of the <i>legal realities </i>(<i>i.e</i>., the law, rules and prevailing jurisprudence governing expropriation cases) attendant to such filing. We thus reject any opposition to the imposition of interest that has no relation to the settled rules on expropriation, such as PIATCO's alleged bad faith.<br><br>In expropriation cases, our jurisprudence has established that interest should be paid on the computed just compensation due when delay in payment takes place,<i> i.e, regardless </i>of PIATCO's<i> alleged</i> bad faith in contracting with the Republic.<br><br>We have consistently ruled that just compensation does not only refer to the full and fair equivalent of the property taken; it also means, equally if not more than anything else, payment in full without delay.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> The basis for the imposition of interest in cases of delay is none other than our Constitution which commands the condemnor to pay the property owner the <i>full and fair equivalent</i> of the property <i>from the date of taking</i>. This provision likewise presupposes that the condemnor incurs delay if it does not pay the property owner the <i>full amount of just compensation on the date of taking.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup><br><br>In other words, interest on the unpaid compensation becomes due as compliance with the constitutional mandate on eminent domain and as a basic measure of fairness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> The owners' loss is not only his property but also its income-generating potential.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup><br><br>We disagree with the Republic's position that PIATCO's bad faith in the nullified concession agreements should negate any award of interest in its favor. We disagree, too, with the Republic's argument that PIATCO has no income-generating capacity as it no longer has the right to operate the NAIA-IPT III under the nullified concession agreements.<br><br>In advancing these arguments, the Republic confuses its <i>right of action arising from the nullification of the concession agreement and its right of action arising from the exercise of its power of eminent domain.</i> These two rights of action are totally distinct from each other, giving rise to distinct rights and obligations among the parties to the case, and prescribing distinct proceedings before the courts.<br><br>At the risk of repetition, we stress that<i> the Republic availed of the remedy of expropriation </i>rather than a case arising from the nullification of contract. Thus, issues such as PIATCO's bad faith resulting in the nullification of the concession agreements may not be properly considered in the present case.<br><br>Since the Republic <u><i>chose</i></u> to file the present expropriation case to acquire NAIA-ITP III, we are bound to follow the appropriate expropriation proceeding, the settled jurisprudence in expropriation case, and use the applicable expropriation laws and rules as guiding principles.<br><br>For these reasons, we maintain our ruling imposing interest on the computed just compensation (less the proffered value).<br><br><i><b>C.3. On the Republic's argument<br>that PIATCO is not entitled to the <br>interest award as it caused the delay <br>in the computation of just compensation.</b></i><br><br>We now resolve the Republic's argument that PIATCO is not entitled to interest, as it is guilty of delay in the expropriation proceedings for the computation of just compensation.<br><br>In pursuing this argument, the Republic forgets that the <i>delay</i> in the <i>payment</i> of just compensation,<i> and not the delay in the proceedings for its computation</i>, is the legal basis for the imposition of interest on the unpaid just compensation.<br><br>m our Decision, we imposed the interest on the unpaid just compensation starting September 11, 2006 when the writ of possession granted in favor of the Republic became effective. We ruled that, in view of the effectivity of the writ of possession on September 11, 2006, <i>the Republic effectively <u>deprived PIATCO of the ordinary use</u> of the NAIA-IPT III as of this date</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> and PIATCO could no longer exercise all the attributes of ownership over NAIA-IPT III, particularly the right of possession.<br><br>In expropriation cases, the State must pay for the shortfall in the earning potential immediately lost due to the taking, and the absence of a replacement property from which income can be derived. We established this rule in order to comply with the constitutional mandate that the owner of the expropriated property must be compensated for his actual loss; the income-generating potential is part of this loss and should therefore be fully taken into account.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><br>Clearly, the concept of delay for purposes of the imposition of interest on the unpaid just compensation is based on the <i>effect on the owner's rights</i> of the Republic's non-payment of the full amount of just compensation at the date the possession and effective taking of the expropriated property took place.<br><br>While the delay in the computation of just compensation (because of the protracted proceeding) may also delay the payment of just compensation, we note that, in this case, the delay was<i> not</i> entirely attributable to any particular party, <i>i.e.</i>, to PIATCO and/or Takenaka and Asahikosan, as the Republic contends. The "delay" arose because all the parties to the case had <i>taken procedurally permissible steps</i> in order to protect their respective interests; the complexity, too, of appraising a specialized property like the NAIA-IPT III cannot likewise be discounted.<br><br>We remind the Republic that the computation of just compensation is not always a simple affair and may take time, particularly in the case of a specialized property like the NAIA-IPT III. Delay should not be imputed on the owner alone unless it delayed the proceedings purposely and unreasonably. The facts of the present case do not show that neither PIATCO nor Takenaka and Asahikosan purposely and unreasonably acted to cause delay. The more tenable view is that all the parties took remedial measures, within legitimate and reasonable limits, to protect their respective claims, thus, the belated determination of the just compensation.<br><br>For all these reasons, the Republic would have to pay the amount of just compensation computed as of the date of the effective taking (December 21, 2004) plus the interest which runs from the date it took possession and <i>actually</i> took over the property (September 11, 2006), regardless of the perceived delay in the determination of just compensation.<br><br><i><b>C.4 PIATCO's arguments on the<br>reckoning period of the interest<br>award from September 11, 2006</b></i><br><br>We now address PIATCO's arguments on the imposition of interest on the unpaid just compensation awarded to it.<br><br>PIATCO first questions the reckoning period of the interest.that we imposed on the unpaid just compensation. PIATCO argues that since the Republic <i>actually </i>took possession of NAIA-IPT III on December 21, 2004 (the date of filing of the complaint for expropriation), then it should be the reckoning period of the interest payment and <i>not</i> on September 11, 2006 when the writ of possession was reinstated. Furthermore, the delay in the payment of the proffered value on September 11, 2006 was due to the Republic's fault, which should not prejudice PIATCO.<br><br>We do not find PIATCO's arguments persuasive.<br><br>PIATCO's unsupported claim that the Republic <i>actually</i> took possession of the NAIA-IPT III on December 21, 2004 cannot be a valid basis for us to reckon the accrual of the interest on that date.<br><br>We cannot also accord merit to PIATCO's reliance on the RTC's order dated January 7, 2005 where it stated that the Republic actually took possession of NAIA-IPT III on December 21, 2004.<br><br>We note that the RTC issued its January 7, 2005 order <i>without motion and hearing</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> from which it could properly infer its factual statement on the Republic's actual possession of the NAIA-IPT III on December 21, 2004.<br><br>Significantly,<i> Gingoyon</i> noted that this January 7, 2005 order was issued without prior consultation with either the Republic or PIATCO.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> Furthermore, we note that the Republic's alleged possession was not the issue resolved in the RTC order; the crux of the order was the RTC's appointment of commissioners.<br><br><i>Gingoyon</i> is the case that settled the basis and standards for the <i>effectivity of the writ of possession in favor of the Republic.</i> In ruling, therefore, that the interest should be reckoned from September 11, 2006, our basis was our final and executory ruling in Gingoyon, which is undisputably applicable in the present case.<br><br>To recall, the writ of possession was the subject of two (2) conflicting RTC orders - the first was the December 21, 2004 order based on Rule 67; the second was the January 4, 2005 order based on RA 8974 instead of Rule 67.<br><br>The January 4, 2005 order <i><b>supplemented</b></i> the December 21, 2004 order and effectively imposed more stringent requirements as conditions for the effectivity of the December 21 writ of possession. Notably, the Republic, pending <i>Gingoyon</i>, did not have to comply with the conditions in the January 4, 2005 order as we had issued in its favor a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against its implementation. The effectivity of the writ of possession was therefore <i>still then</i> at issue in <i>Gingoyon</i>.<br><br>In <i>Gingoyon</i>, we reconciled<i> Agan</i>, RA 8974 and Rule 67 in: (1) resolving the <i>effectivity of the writ of possession</i> issued in favor of the Republic; and (2) determining the standards in computing just compensation. We pointed out that the RTC erroneously relied on Rule 67 in issuing the December 21, 2004 writ of possession; we also ruled on the RTC's misapplication of RA 8974 in issuing the January 4, 2005 order.<br><br><i>On the <u>pre-requisites</u> for the effectivity of the writ of possession</i>, we ruled that FLA 8974 guarantees compliance with the Agan requirement that just compensation be first paid to PIATCO before the Republic could take­over the NAIA-IPT III. Specifically, RA 8974 assures the private property owner the payment of, <i>at the very least</i>, the proffered value of the property to be seized. We also ruled that <i>the <u>payment of the proffered value to the owner, followed by the issuance of the writ of possession</u></i> in favor of the Republic, is precisely the scheme under RA 8974, one that facially complied with the prescription laid down in the 2004 Agan Resolution.<br><br>Consequently, in<i> Gingoyon, we held in abeyance the writ of possession dated December 21, 2004</i> pending proof of the Republic's actual payment to PIATCO of the proffered value of the NAIA-IPT III of F3,002,125,000.00. <i>We expressly ruled that the Republic would be entitled to the writ of possession only once it pays PIATCO the amount of the proffered value.</i><br><br><i>On the <u>effects</u> of an effective writ of possession, we also held in Gingoyon that upon the effectivity of the writ of possession, the Republic is authorized to perform the acts that are essential to the operation of the NAIA-IPT III as an international airport terminal</i>. These acts include the repair, reconditioning, and improvement of the complex, maintenance of the existing facilities and equipment, installation of new facilities and equipment, provision for services and facilities pertaining to the facilitation of air traffic and transport, and other services that are integral to a modern-day international airport.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br><br>It is undisputed that <b>the Republic tendered to PIATCO the proffered value on <u>September 11, 2006</u>, <i>leading to the reinstatement of the writ of possession in favor of the Republic on the same day</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup><br><br>Thus, applying <i>Gingoyon</i>, we ruled in our Decision now under challenge, that<i> the reinstatement of the writ of possession on September 11, 2006 empowered the Republic to take the property for public use, <u>and to effectively deprive PIATCO of the ordinary use of the NAIA-IPT III</u></i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup><br><br>Based on these considerations, we maintain our ruling that the interest on the just compensation (less proffered value) should accrue only from September 11, 2006 when the Republic effectively deprived PIATCO of the ordinary use of the NAIA-IPT III.<br><br><i><b>C.5 On PIATCO's arguments that <br>it should not be prejudiced by the<br>Republic's delay in paying the <br>proffered value</b></i><br><br>We disagree with PIATCO that the Republic deliberately refused to pay the proffered value, resulting in the delay of its payment.<br><br>We find that the Republic's filing of the <i>Gingoyon</i> case was a reasonable legal move in view of the two (2) RTC orders relative to the effectivity of the writ of possession.

PIATCO's payment pursuant to the RTC rulings, which it did not assail, served as its conformity with these rulings, whose finality against PIATCO we cannot modify in the present case.<br><br>PIATCO should have questioned the rulings that are adverse to it; that it did not and even willingly complied means that it had accepted the ruling. It is well-settled, too, that the negligence and mistakes of counsel bind the client.

On Takenaka andAsahikosan's claims</b></i><br><br>We cannot grant Takenaka and Asahikosan's argument that a portion of the just compensation be set aside to cover for their claims against PIATCO. Takenaka and Asahikosan's arguments are contrary to the constitutional and jurisprudential mandates on just compensation and our final and executory rulings in <i>Agan</i> and <i>Gingoyon.</i><br><br>To reiterate, just compensation should be paid to the<i> owner and it should be real, substantial, full and ample</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> Therefore, the Republic must pay PIATCO the <u><i>full amount</i></u> of the just compensation computed in the present case.<br><br>Furthermore, if we set aside a portion of the just compensation to cover Takenaka and Asahikosan's claims, we would also be running against our final and executory rulings in <i>Agan</i> and <i>Gingoyon</i> mandating that just compensation should be <i>fully </i>paid to PIATCO as the<i> owner </i>of the NAIA-IPT III.<br><br>Stated differently, the mere setting aside of a definite portion of the just compensation to cover the claim of a <i>non-owner</i> (especially if the non-owner's claim is <i>not yet fixed or confirmed</i> by a final ruling) would defeat the constitutional mandate that <i>full payment</i> be made to the property owner. We thus cannot grant Takenaka and Asahikosan's plea even if we can later release to PIATCO the portion that is set aside (in the event that Takenaka and Asahikosan's claims turn out to be excessive or totally unjustified).<br><br>Takenaka and Asahikosan also conveniently ignore the adverse consequences of their request. They do not seem to realize that the Court would deprive PIATCO of the <i>uses of its money</i> during the<i> entire period</i> a portion of the just compensation is put in escrow.<br><br>Worse, if Takenaka and Asahikosan's claims are later<i> partially or wholly denied</i>, there is the matter of interest: who will pay the interest on the amount set aside? Will it be the Republic or will it be Takenaka and Asahikosan? Will they equally share the burden? These are the complications that Takenaka and Asahikosan avoided in their insistence to have a portion of the just compensation set aside to cover claims that have not even been judicially confirmed with finality in the Philippines.<br><br>Finally, we <i>clarify</i> our holding that if we grant Takenaka and Asahikosan's prayer to <i>merely</i> set aside a portion of the just compensation to secure their claims, we would thereby pre-empt the Court's ruling in the pending enforcement case (G.R. No. 202166).<br><br>In truth, we would not pre-empt the Court's ruling in the enforcement case ifwe set aside a portion of the just compensation in favor Takenaka and Asahikosan. <i>The Court would still have to apply the law to the unique facts of that case regardless of our holding in the present case.</i><br><br>Nevertheless, there is simply no basis to set aside a portion of the just compensation in favor of a <i>non-owner</i>. As explained, setting aside Takenaka and Asahikosan's claim purportedly in the interest of "equity and justice" would defeat the essence of just compensation. We remind Takenaka and Asahikosan that the invocation of the Court's equity jurisdiction can never be used to violate the law and the Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup><br><br>In light of the discussion above, we deny Takenaka and Asahikosan's arguments in its partial motion for reconsideration.<br><br><b><i>I.

 RA 8974 is silent on the reckoning period of interests in the 
expropriation of property for national infrastructure projects. Pursuant
 to Section 14 of RA 8974 IRR, the Rules of Court suppletorily applies. 
In this respect, Section 10, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>Section
 10. Rights of plaintiff after judgment and payment. — Upon payment by 
the plaintiff to the defendant of the compensation fixed by the 
judgment, <u>with legal interest thereon from the taking of the possession of the property</u>,
 or after tender to him of the amount so fixed and payment of the costs,
 the plaintiff shall have the right to enter upon the property 
expropriated and to appropriate it for the public use or purpose defined
 in the judgment, or to retain it should he have taken immediate 
possession thereof under the provisions of section 2 hereof. If the 
defendant and his counsel absent themselves from the court, or decline 
to receive the amount tendered, the same shall be ordered to be 
deposited in court and such deposit shall have the same effect as actual
 payment thereof to the defendant or the person ultimately adjudged 
entitled thereto. (10a) (underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>However,
 even without this provision, interest on just compensation will still 
accrue on the date of taking since the Section 9, Article III of the 
1987 Constitution provides that just compensation must be paid on the
