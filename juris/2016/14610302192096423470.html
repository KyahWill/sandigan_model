Solvency is a state where the businesses' liabilities are less than its assets.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Corporate rehabilitation is a type of proceeding available to a business that is insolvent. In general, insolvency proceedings provide for predictability that commercial obligations will be met despite business downturns.

It is considered state policy<br><br><blockquote>to encourage debtors, both juridical and natural persons, and their creditors to <i>collectively and realistically resolve</i> and adjust competing claims and property rights[.] . . . [Rehabilitation or liquidation shall be made with a view to ensure or maintain certainty and predictability in commercial affairs, preserve and maximize the value of the assets of these debtors, recognize creditor rights and respect priority of claims, and ensure equitable treatment of creditors who are similarly situated.

The corporation receives assistance from the court and a disinterested rehabilitation receiver to balance the interest to recover and continue ordinary business, all the while attending to the interest of its creditors to be paid equitably. These interests are also referred to as the <i>rehabilitative</i> and the <i>equitable</i> purposes of corporate rehabilitation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>The nature of corporate rehabilitation was thoroughly discussed in P<i>ryce Corporation v.

Rather than leave it to the strongest or most resourceful amongst all of them, the state steps in to equitably distribute the corporation's limited resources.<br>.... <br><br>Rather than let struggling corporations slip and vanish, the better option is to allow commercial courts to come in and apply the process for corporate rehabilitation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br></blockquote><br><i>Philippine Bank of Communications v.

The alternative might be a chaotic rush by all creditors to file separate cases with the possibility of different; trial courts issuing various writs competing for the same assets. Rehabilitation is a means to temper the effect of a business downturn experienced for whatever reason. In the process, it gives entrepreneurs a second chance. Not only is it a humane and equitable relief, it encourages efficiency and maximizes welfare in the economy.<br><br>Clearly then, there are instances when corporate rehabilitation can no longer be achieved. When rehabilitation will not result in a better present value recovery for the creditors,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> the more appropriate remedy is liquidation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>It does not make sense to hold, suspend, or continue to devalue outstanding credits of a business that has no chance of recovery. In such cases, the optimum economic welfare will be achieved if the corporation is allowed to wind up its affairs in an orderly manner.

It is true that Rule 1, Section 6 of the Rules of Court provides that the "[r]ules shall be liberally construed in order to promote their objective of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding." However, this provision does not negate the entire Rules of Court by providing a license to disregard all the other provisions. Resort to liberal construction must be rational and well-grounded, and its factual bases must be so clear such that they outweigh the intent or purpose of an apparent reading of the rules.<br><br>Rule 43 prescribes the mode of appeal for corporate rehabilitation cases:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 5. <i>How appeal taken</i>. - Appeal shall be taken by filing a verified petition for review in seven (7) legible copies with the Court of Appeals, <i>with proof of service of a copy thereof on the adverse party and on the court or agency a quo</i>.

Instead, petitioner only impleaded the Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court, contrary to Section 6(a) of Rule 43. Second, it did not serve a copy of the Petition on some of its creditors, specifically, its former employees. Finally, it did not serve a copy of the Petition on the Regional Trial Court.<br><br>Petitioner justified its failure to furnish its former employees with copies of the Petition by stating that the former employees were late in filing their opposition before the trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> It also stated that its failure to furnish the Regional Trial Court with a copy of the Petition was unintentional.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals correctly dismissed petitioner's Rule 43 Petition as a consequence of non-compliance with procedural rules.

It begs the indulgence of the court to give due course to its Petition based on their belated compliance with some of these procedural rules and the policy on the liberal construction of procedural rules.<br><br>There are two kinds of "liberality" with respect to the construction of provisions of law. The first requires ambiguity in the text of the provision and usually pertains to a situation where there can be two or more viable meanings given the factual context presented by a case. Liberality here means a presumption or predilection to interpret the text in favor of the cause of the party requesting for "liberality."<br><br>Then there is the "liberality" that actually means a request for the suspension of the operation of a provision of law, whether substantive or procedural. This liberality requires equity. There may be some rights that are not recognized in law, and if courts refuse to recognize these rights, an unfair situation may arise.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> Specifically, the case may be a situation that was not contemplated on or was not possible at the time the legal norm was drafted or promulgated.<br><br>It is in the second sense that petitioner pleads this court.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>Our courts are not only courts of law, but are also courts of equity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> Equity is justice outside legal provisions, and must be exercised in the absence of law, not against it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> In <i>Reyes v.

Liberality acknowledges a lacuna in the text of a provision of law. This may be because those who promulgated the rule may not have foreseen the unique circumstances of a case at bar. Human foresight as laws and rules are prepared is powerful, but not perfect.<br><br>Liberality is not an end in itself. Otherwise, it becomes a backdoor disguising the arbitrariness or despotism of judges and justices. In <i>North Bulacan Corp. v. PBCom</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> the Regional Trial Court ignored several procedural rules violated by the petitioning corporation and allowed rehabilitation in the guise of liberality. This court found that the Regional Trial Court grossly abused its authority when it allowed rehabilitation despite the corporation's blatant non-compliance with the rules.<br><br>The factual antecedents of a plea for the exercise of liberality must be clear. There must also be a showing that the factual basis for a plea for liberality is not one that is due to the negligence or design of the party requesting the suspension of the rules. Likewise, the basis for claiming an equitable result—for all the parties—must be clearly and sufficiently pleaded and argued. Courts exercise liberality in line with their equity jurisdiction; hence, it may only be exercised if it will result in fairness and justice.<br><br><center>IV</center><br>The first rule breached by petitioner is the failure to implead all the indispensable parties. Petitioner did not even interpose reasons why it should be excused from compliance with the rule to "state the full names of the parties to the case, without impleading the court... as ... respondents." Petitioner did exactly the opposite. It failed to state the full names of its creditors as respondents. Instead, it impleaded the Presiding Judge of the originating court.<br><br>The Rules of Court requires petitioner to implead respondents as a matter of due process. Under the Constitution, "[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of the law."<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[134]</sup></font> An appeal to a corporate rehabilitation case may deprive creditor-stakeholders of property. Due process dictates that these creditors be impleaded to give n them an opportunity to protect the property owed to them.<br><br>Creditors are indispensable parties to a rehabilitation case, even if a rehabilitation case is non-adversarial. In<i> Boston Equity Resources, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup><br><br><blockquote>An indispensable party is one who has such an interest in the controversy or subject matter of a case that a final adjudication cannot be made in his or her absence, without injuring or affecting that interest. He or she is a party who has not only an interest in the subject matter of the controversy, but "an interest of such nature that a final decree cannot be made without affecting [that] interest or leaving the controversy in such a condition that its final determination may be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience. It has also been considered that an indispensable party is a person in whose absence there cannot be a determination between the parties already before the court which is effective, complete or equitable." Further, an indispensable party is one who must be included in an action before it may properly proceed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup></blockquote><br>A corporate rehabilitation case cannot be decided without the creditors' participation. The court's role is to balance the interests of the corporation, the creditors, and the general public. Impleading creditors as respondents on appeal will give them the opportunity to present their legal arguments before the appellate court. The courts will not be able to balance these interests if the creditors are not parties to a case. Ruling on petitioner's appeal in the absence of its creditors will not result in judgment that is effective, complete, and equitable.<br><br>This court cannot exercise its equity jurisdiction and allow petitioner to circumvent the requirement to implead its creditors as respondents. Tolerance of such failure will not only be unfair to the creditors, it is contrary to the goals of corporate rehabilitation, and will invalidate the cardinal principle of due process of law.<br><br>The failure of petitioner to implead its creditors as respondents cannot be cured by serving copies of the Petition on its creditors. Since the creditors were not impleaded as respondents, the copy of the Petition only serves to inform them that a petition has been filed before the appellate court. Their participation was still significantly truncated. Petitioner's failure to implead them deprived them of a fair hearing. The appellate court only serves court orders and processes on parties formally named and identified by the petitioner. Since the creditors were not named as respondents, they could not receive court orders prompting them to file remedies to protect their property rights.<br><br>The next procedural rule that petitioner pleaded to suspend is the rule requiring it to furnish all parties with copies of the Rule 43 Petition. Petitioner admitted its failure to furnish its former employees with copies of the Petition because they belatedly filed their claims before the Regional Trial Court.<br><br>This argument is specious at best; at worst, it foists a fraud on this court. The former employees were unable to raise their claims on time because petitioner did not declare them as creditors. The Amended Petition did not contain any information regarding pending litigation between petitioner and its former employees. The only way the former employees could become aware of the corporate rehabilitation proceedings was either through the required publication or through news informally circulated among their colleagues. Clearly, it was petitioner who caused the belated filing of its former employees' claims when it failed to notify its employees of the corporate rehabilitation proceedings. Petitioner's failure was conveniently and disreputably hidden from this court.<br><br>Former employee Luzviminda C. Cueto filed her Manifestation and Registration of Monetary Claim as early as November 25, 2005. Alejandro Olit, et al., the other employees, filed their Comment on September 27, 2006. By the time petitioner filed its Petition for Review dated November 21, 2006 before the Court of Appeals, it was well aware that these individuals had expressed their interest in the corporate rehabilitation proceedings. Petitioner and its counsel had no excuse to exclude these former employees as respondents on appeal.<br><br>Petitioner's belated compliance with the requirement to serve the Petition for Review on its former employees did not cure the procedural lapse. There were two sets of employees with claims against petitioner: Luzviminda C. Cueto and Alejandro Olit, et al. When the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's appeal, petitioner only served a copy on Alejandro Olit, et al. Petitioner still did not serve a copy on Luzviminda C. Cueto.<br><br>We do not see how it will be in the interest of justice to allow a petition that fails to inform some of its creditors that the final order of the corporate rehabilitation proceeding was appealed. By not declaring its former employees as creditors in the Amended Petition for Corporate Rehabilitation and by not notifying the same employees that an appeal had been filed, petitioner consistently denied the due process rights of these employees.<br><br>This court cannot be a party to the inequitable way that petitioner's employees were treated.<br><br>Petitioner also pleaded to be excused from the requirement under Rule 6, Section 5 of the Rules of Court to serve a copy of the Petition on the originating court. According to petitioner, the annexes for the Petition for Review filed before the Court of Appeals arrived from Lucena City on the last day of filing the petition. Petitioner's representative from Lucena City and petitioner's counsel rushed to compile and reproduce all the documents, and in such rush, failed to send a copy to the Regional Trial Court. When petitioner realized that it failed to furnish the originating court with a copy of the Petition, a copy was immediately sent by registered mail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br><br>Again, petitioner's excuse is unacceptable. Petitioner had 15 days to file a Rule 43 petition, which should include the proof of service to the originating court. Rushing the compilation of the pleading with the annexes has nothing to do with being able to comply with the requirement to submit a proof of service of the copy of the petition for review to the originating court. If at all, it further reflects the unprofessional way that petitioner and its counsel treated our rules.<br><br>As this court has consistently ruled, "[t]he right to appeal is not a natural right[,] nor a part of due process; it is merely a statutory privilege, and may be exercised only in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of the law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup><br><br>In line with this, liberality in corporate rehabilitation procedure only generally refers to the trial court, not to the proceedings before the appellate court. The Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation covers petitions for rehabilitation filed before the Regional Trial Court. Thus, Rule 2, Section 2 of the Interim Rules of Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation, which refers to liberal construction, is limited to the Regional Trial Court. The liberality was given "to assist the parties in obtaining a just, expeditious, and inexpensive disposition of the case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup><br><br>In <i>Spouses Ortiz v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> the petitioners made a procedural mistake with the attachments of the petition before the Court of Appeals. The petitioners subsequently provided the correct attachments; however, this court still upheld the Court of Appeals' dismissal:<br><br><blockquote>The party who seeks to avail [itself] of [an appeal] must comply with the requirements of the rules. Failing to do so, the right to appeal is lost. Rules of procedure are required to be followed, except only when for the most persuasive of reasons, they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[141]</sup></font></blockquote><br>Petitioner's excuses do not trigger the application of the policy of liberality in construing procedural rules. For the courts to exercise liberality, petitioner must show that it is suffering from an injustice not commensurate to the thoughtlessness of its procedural mistakes. Not only did petitioner exercise injustice towards its creditors, its Rule 43 Petition for Review did not show that the Regional Trial Court erred in dismissing its Amended Petition for Corporate Rehabilitation.<br><br><center>V</center><br><br>Petitioner's main argument for the continuation of corporate rehabilitation proceedings is that the Regional Trial Court should have allowed petitioner to clarify its Amended Petition with respect to details regarding its assets and its liabilities to its creditors instead of dismissing the Petition outright.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup><br><br>The Regional Trial Court correctly dismissed the Amended Petition for Corporate Rehabilitation.

If the results of such examination and analysis show that there is<i> a real opportunity to rehabilitate the corporation in view of the assumptions made and financial goals stated</i> in the proposed rehabilitation plan, then it may be said that a rehabilitation is feasible. In this accord, the rehabilitation court should not hesitate to allow the corporation to operate as an on-going concern, albeit under the terms and conditions stated in the approved rehabilitation plan. <i>On the other hand, if the results of the financial examination and analysis clearly indicate that there lies no reasonable probability that the distressed corporation could be revived and that liquidation would, in fact, better subserve the interests of its stakeholders, then it may be said that a rehabilitation would not be feasible.</i> In such case, the rehabilitation court may convert the proceedings into one for liquidation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Professor Stephanie V.

A corporation's assets may be more than its current liabilities, but some assets may be in the form of land or capital equipment, such as machinery or vessels. Rehabilitation sees to it that these assets generate more value if used efficiently rather than if liquidated.<br><br>On the other hand, this court enumerated the characteristics of a rehabilitation plan that is infeasible:<br><br><blockquote>(a) the absence of a sound and workable business plan;<br><br>(b)&nbsp; baseless and unexplained assumptions, targets and goals;<br><br>(c) speculative capital infusion or complete lack thereof for the execution of the business plan;<br><br>(d) cash flow cannot sustain daily operations; and<br><br>(e) negative net worth and the assets are near full depreciation or fully depreciated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In addition to the tests of <i>economic feasibility</i>, Professor Stephanie V.

This is contrary to the goal of corporate rehabilitation, which is to allow present value recovery for creditors. The plan to buy new vessels after selling the two vessels it currently owns is neither sound nor workable as a business plan.<br><br>The other part of the rehabilitation plan entails selling properties of petitioner's sister company.

Act No. 10142 (2010), sec. 4(gg) defines rehabilitation as: "the restoration of the debtor to a condition of successful operation and solvency, if it is shown that its continuance of operation is economically feasible and its creditors can recover by way of the present value of payments projected in the plan, more if the debtor continues as a going concern than if it is immediately liquidated." This is because if rehabilitation is still viable, creditors may still be able to recover the full value of the credit. If the assets are immediately liquidated even when rehabilitation is viable, creditors run the risk of sharing in the losses of the corporation, especially if the book value of its assets is less than its outstanding credits.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> J.
