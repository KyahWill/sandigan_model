Thus, the general rules on examination of witnesses under Rule 132 of the Rules of Court should be observed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Lastly, petitioner Go-Perez contends that the Court of Appeals ignored Rule 132, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, which provides that a witness must testify in open court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> That Cleary is the plaintiff himself is material as there is nothing for him to discover when he deposes himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondent Thomas Cleary maintains that Rule 23, Section 4 of the Rules of Court on the taking of deposition applies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> He is "out of the Philippines" as an American citizen residing in the United States.

All that is required under the rules is that "reasonable notice" be given "in writing to every other party to the action[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Thus, the trial court's discretion in ruling on whether a deposition may be taken is not unlimited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Respondent adds that this Court has allowed the taking of testimonies through deposition in lieu of their actual presence at trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> He argues that with the new rules, depositions serve as both a method of discovery and a method of presenting testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> That the court cannot observe a deponent's demeanor is insufficient justification to disallow deposition. Otherwise, no deposition can ever be taken as this objection is common to all depositions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Respondent contends that <i>Northwest</i> does not apply as the deposition in that case was found to have been improperly and irregularly taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Lastly, respondent argues that the presiding judge of the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion in denying his Motion for Court Authorization to Take Deposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> That he is an American residing in the United States is undisputed. The trial court even issued the Order dated January 13, 2009 directing him to inform the court of the "steps he . . . has taken and the progress of his request for a deposition taking filed, if any, with the Department of Justice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> In later disallowing the deposition as he is "not suffering from any impairment, physical or otherwise," the presiding judge acted in an arbitrary manner amounting to lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The deposition sought is in accordance with the rules. The expenses in attending a deposition proceeding in the United States cannot be considered as a substantial reason to disallow deposition since petitioners may send cross-interrogatories.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>These consolidated Petitions seek a review of the Court of Appeals Decision reversing the trial court's ruling and allowing Cleary to take his deposition in the United States. Thus, the issues for resolution are:<br><br>First, whether the limitations for the taking of deposition under Rule 23, Section 16 of the Rules of Court apply in this case; and<br><br>Second, whether the taking of deposition under Rule 23, Section 4(c)(2) of the Rules of Court applies to a non-resident foreigner plaintiff's direct testimony.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>Utmost freedom governs the taking of depositions to allow the widest scope in the gathering of information by and for all parties in relation to their pending case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The relevant section in Rule 23 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 23<br>DEPOSITIONS PENDING ACTION<br></center><br>SECTION 1. <i>Depositions pending action, when may be taken</i>. - By leave of court after jurisdiction has been obtained over any defendant or over property which is the subject of the action, or without such leave after an answer has been served, <b><i>the testimony of any person, whether a party or not, may be taken, at the instance of any party, by deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories</i></b>. The attendance of witnesses may be compelled by the use of a subpoena as provided in Rule 21. Depositions shall be taken only in accordance with these Rules. The deposition of a person confined in prison may be taken only by leave of court on such terms as the court prescribes. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>As regards the taking of depositions, Rule 23, Section 1 is clear that the testimony of any person may be taken by deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories at the instance of any party.<br><br><i>San Luis</i> explained that this provision "does not make any distinction or restriction as to who can avail of deposition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Thus, this Court found it immaterial that the plaintiff was a non-resident foreign corporation and that all its witnesses were Americans residing in the United States.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>On the use of depositions taken, we refer to Rule 23, Section 4 of the Rules of Court. This Court has held that "depositions may be used without the deponent being actually called to the witness stand by the proponent, under certain conditions and for certain limited purposes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> These exceptional cases are enumerated in Rule 23, Section 4(c) as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC 4. <i>Use of depositions</i>. - At the trial or upon the hearing of a motion or an interlocutory proceeding, any part or all of a deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had due notice thereof, in accordance with any one of the following provisions:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>(c) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds: (1) that the witness is dead; or <b><i>(2) that the witness resides at distance more than one hundred (100) kilometers from the place of trial or hearing, or is out of the Philippines, unless it appears that his absence was procured by the party offering the deposition;</i></b> or (3) that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or (4) that the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or (5) upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used[.] (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The difference between the <i>taking</i> of depositions and the use of depositions taken is apparent in Rule 23, which provides separate sections to govern them. Jurisprudence has also discussed the importance of this distinction and its implications:<br><blockquote>The availability of the proposed deponent to testify in court does not constitute "good cause" to justify the court's order that his deposition shall not be taken. That the witness is unable to attend or testify is one of the grounds when the deposition of a witness may be used in court during the trial. But the same reason cannot be successfully invoked to prohibit the taking of his deposition.<br><br><b><i>The right to take statements and the right to use them in court have been kept entirely distinct. The utmost freedom is allowed in taking depositions; restrictions are imposed upon their use. As a result, there is accorded the widest possible opportunity for knowledge by both parties of all the facts before the trial.</i></b> Such of this testimony as may be appropriate for use as a substitute for <span style="font-style: italic;">viva voce</span> examination may be introduced at the trial; the remainder of the testimony, having served its purpose in revealing the facts to the parties before trial, drops out of the judicial picture.<br><br>. . . [U]nder the concept adopted by the new Rules, the deposition serves the double function of a method of discovery — with use on trial not necessarily contemplated — and a method of presenting testimony. Accordingly, no limitations other than relevancy and privilege have been placed on the taking of depositions, while the use at the trial is subject to circumscriptions looking toward the use of oral testimony wherever practicable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The rules and jurisprudence support greater leeway in allowing the parties and their witnesses to be deposed in the interest of collecting information for the speedy and complete disposition of cases.<br><br>In opposing respondent's Motion for Court Authorization to Take Deposition, petitioners contest at the deposition-taking stage. They maintain that the right to take deposition is subject to the restrictions found in Rule 23, Section 16 of the Rules of Court on orders for the protection of parties and deponents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Rule 23, Section 16 of the Rules of Court is on orders for the protection of parties and deponents from annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression. The provision reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 16. <i>Orders for the protection of parties and deponents</i>. — After notice is served for taking a deposition by oral examination, upon motion seasonably made by any party or by the person to be examined and for good cause shown, the court in which the action is pending may make an order that the deposition shall not be taken, or that it may be taken only at some designated place other than that stated in the notice, or that it may be taken only on written interrogatories, or that certain matters shall not be inquired into, or that the scope of the examination shall be held with no one present except the parties to the action and their officers or counsel, or that after being sealed the deposition shall be opened only by order of the court, or that secret processes, developments, or research need not be disclosed, or that the parties shall simultaneously file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the court or the court may make any other order which justice requires <b><i>to protect the party or witness from annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression</i></b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The provision includes a full range of protective orders, from designating the place of deposition, limiting those in attendance, to imposing that it be taken through written interrogatories. At the extreme end of this spectrum would be a court order that completely denies the right to take deposition. This is what the trial court issued in this case.<br><br>While Section 16 grants the courts power to issue protective orders, this grant involves discretion on the part of the court, which "must be exercised, not arbitrarily, capriciously or oppressively, but in a reasonable manner and in consonance with the spirit of the law, to the end that its purpose may be attained."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>A plain reading of this provision shows that there are two (2) requisites before a court may issue a protective order: (1) there must be notice; and (2) the order must be for good cause shown. In <i>Fortune Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> this Court discussed the concept of good cause as used in the rules:<br><blockquote>The matter of good cause is to be determined by the court in the exercise of judicial discretion. <b><i>Good cause means a substantial reason—one that affords a legal excuse.</i></b> Whether or not substantial reasons exist is for the court to determine, as there is no hard and fast rule for determining the question as to what is meant by the term "for good cause shown."<br><br>The requirement, however, that good cause be shown for a protective order puts the <b><i>burden on the party seeking relief to show some plainly adequate reasons for the order</i></b>. A particular and specific demonstration of facts, as distinguished from conclusory statements, is required to establish good cause for the issuance of a protective order. <b><i>What constitutes good cause furthermore depends upon the kind of protective order that is sought.</i></b><br><br>In light of the general philosophy of full discovery of relevant facts and the board statement of scope in Rule 24, and in view of the power of the court under Sections 16 and 18 of said Rule to control the details of time, place, scope, and financing for the protection of the deponents and parties, <b><i>it is fairly rare that it will be ordered that a deposition should not be taken at all</i></b>. All motions under these subparagraphs of the rule must be supported by "good cause" and a strong showing is required before a party will be denied entirely the right to take a deposition. A mere allegation, without proof, that the deposition is being taken in bad faith is not a sufficient ground for such an order. Neither is an allegation that it will subject the party to a penalty or forfeiture. The mere fact that the information sought by deposition has already been obtained through a bill of particulars, interrogatories, or other depositions will not suffice, although if it is entirely repetitious a deposition may be forbidden. The allegation that the deponent knows nothing about the matters involved does not justify prohibiting the taking of a deposition, nor that whatever the witness knows is protected by the "work product doctrine," nor that privileged information or trade secrets will be sought in the course of the examination, nor that all the transactions were either conducted or confirmed in writing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Thus, we consider the trial court's explanation for its denial of respondent's Motion for Court Authorization to Take Deposition. The trial court's Order was based on two (2) premises: first, that respondent should submit himself to our court processes since he elected to seek judicial relief with our courts; and second, that respondent is not suffering from any impairment and it is best that he appear before our courts considering he is the plaintiff himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>On the first premise, apparent is the concern of the trial court in giving undue advantage to non-resident foreigners who file suit before our courts but do not appear to testify. Petitioners support this ruling. They contend that the open-court examination of witnesses is part of our judicial system. Thus, there must be compelling reason to depart from this procedure in order to avoid suits that harass Filipino litigants before our courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Moreover, they argue that it would be costly, time-consuming, and disadvantageous for petitioners and their counsels to attend the deposition to be taken in Los Angeles for the convenience of respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>In the Stock Purchase and Put Agreement, petitioners and respondent alike agreed that respondent had the sole discretion to elect the venue for filing any action with respect to it.<br><br>Paragraph 9.02 of the Agreement is clear that the parties "waive any other preferential jurisdiction by reason of domicile."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> If respondent filed the suit in the United States—which he had the option to do under the Agreement—this would have been even more costly, time-consuming, and disadvantageous to petitioners who are all Filipinos residing in the Philippines.<br><br>There is no question that respondent can file the case before our courts. With respondent having elected to file suit in Cebu, the bone of contention now is on whether he can have his deposition taken in the United States. The trial court ruled that respondent should consequently submit himself to the processes and procedures under the Rules of Court.<br><br>Respondent did avail himself of the processes and procedures under the Rules of Court when he filed his Motion. He invoked Rule 23, Section 4(c)(2) of the Rules of Court and requested to have his deposition taken in Los Angeles as he was "out of the Philippines."<br><br>Moreover, Rule 23, Section 1 of the Rules of Court no longer requires leave of court for the taking of deposition after an answer has been served. According to respondent, he only sought a court order when the Department of Foreign Affairs required one so that the deposition may be taken before the Philippine Embassy or Consulate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>That neither the presiding judge nor the parties will be able to personally examine and observe the conduct of a deponent does not justify denial of the right to take deposition. This objection is common to all depositions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> Allowing this reason will render nugatory the provisions in the Rules of Court that allow the taking of depositions.<br><br>As suggested by the Court of Appeals, the parties may also well agree to take deposition by written interrogatories<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> to afford petitioners the opportunity to cross-examine without the need to fly to the United States.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>The second premise is also erroneous. That respondent is "not suffering from any impairment, physical or otherwise" does not address the ground raised by respondent in his Motion. Respondent referred to Rule 23, Section 4(c)(2) of the Rules of Court, in that he was "out of the Philippines."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> This Section does not qualify as to the condition of the deponent who is outside the Philippines.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>Petitioners argue that the deposition sought by respondent is not for discovery purposes as he is the plaintiff himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> To support their contention, they cite <i>Northwest</i>, where this Court held that Rule 132 of the Rules of Court—on the examination of witnesses in open court—should be observed since the deposition was only to accommodate the petitioner's employee who was in the United States, and not for discovery purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>Jurisprudence has discussed how "[u]nder the concept adopted by the new Rules, the deposition serves the double function of a method of discovery—with use on trial not necessarily contemplated—and a method of presenting testimony."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> The taking of depositions has been allowed as a departure from open-court testimony. <i>Jonathan Landoil International Co. Inc. v. Spouses Mangundadatu</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> is instructive:<br><blockquote>The Rules of Court and jurisprudence, however, do not restrict a deposition to the sole function of being a mode of discovery before trial. Under certain conditions and for certain limited purposes, it may be taken even after trial has commenced and may be used without the deponent being actually called to the witness stand. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Dasmariñas Garments v. Reyes</span>, we allowed the taking of the witnesses' testimonies through deposition, in lieu of their actual presence at the trial.<br><br>Thus, "<b><i>[d]epositions may be taken at any time after the institution of any action, whenever necessary or convenient</i></b>. There is no rule that limits deposition-taking only to the period of pre-trial or before it; no prohibition against the taking of depositions after pre-trial." There can be no valid objection to allowing them during the process of executing final and executory judgments, when the material issues of fact have become numerous or complicated.<br><br>In keeping with the principle of promoting the just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding, <b><i>depositions are allowed as a "departure from the accepted and usual judicial proceedings of examining witnesses in open court</i></b> where their demeanor could be observed by the trial judge." Depositions are allowed, <b><i>provided they are taken in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Court</i></b> (that is, with leave of court if the summons have been served, without leave of court if an answer has been submitted); and provided, further, that a circumstance for their admissibility exists.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>When a deposition does not conform to the essential requirements of law and may reasonably cause material injury to the adverse party, its taking should not be allowed. This was the primary concern in <i>Northwest Airlines v. Cruz</i>. In that case, the ends of justice would be better served if the witness was to be brought to the trial court to testify. The locus of the oral deposition therein was not within the reach of ordinary citizens, as there were time constraints; and the trip required a travel visa, bookings, and a substantial travel fare.

Moran had these comments:<br><br>The advisory committee of the United States Supreme Court said that this provision is <b><i>intended to be one of the safeguards for the protection of the parties and deponents on account of the unrestricted right to discovery given by sections 1 and 2 of this Rule</i></b>. A party may take the deposition of a witness who knows nothing about the case, with the only purpose of annoying him or wasting the time of the other parties. In such case, the court may, on motion, order that the deposition shall not be taken. <b><i>Or, a party may designate a distinct place for the taking of a deposition, and the adverse party may not have sufficient means to reach that place, because of poverty or otherwise, in which case the court, on motion, may order that the deposition be taken at another place, or that it be taken by written interrogatories.</i></b> The party serving the notice may wish to inquire into matters the disclosure of which may be oppressive or embarrassing to the deponent, especially if the disclosure is to be made in the presence of third persons, or, the party serving the notice may attempt to inquire into matters which are absolutely private of the deponent, the disclosure of which may affect his interests and is not absolutely essential to the determination of the issues involved in the case. Under such circumstances, the court, on motion, may order 'that certain matter shall not be inquired into or that the scope of the examination shall be limited to certain matters, or that the examination shall be held with no one present except the parties to the action and their officers or counsel, or that after being sealed the deposition shall be opened only by order of the court, or that secret processes, developments, or research need not be disclosed, or that the parties shall simultaneously file specific documents or informations enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the court.' In other words, this provision affords the adverse party, as well as the deponent, sufficient protection against abuses that may be committed by a party in the exercise of his unlimited right to discovery. As a writer said: 'Any discovery involves a prying into another person's affairs, a prying that is quite justified if it is to be a legitimate aid to litigation, but not justified if it is not to be such an aid.' For this reason, <b><i>courts are given ample powers to forbid discovery which is intended not as an aid to litigation, but merely to annoy, embarrass or oppress either the deponent or the adverse party, or both</i></b>" (Id. at 368-369; emphasis supplied).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> G.R.
