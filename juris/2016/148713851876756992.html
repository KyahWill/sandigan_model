				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Illegal recruitment is a crime committed by a person who, not having the valid license or authority required by law to enable him to lawfully engage in recruitment and placement of workers, undertakes any of the activities within the meaning of "recruitment and placement" mentioned in Article 13(b) of the <i>Labor Code, </i>or any of the prohibited practices enumerated in Section 6 of Republic Act No. 8042 <i>(Migrant Workers' Act), </i>against three or more persons, individually or as a group.<br><br><center><b>The Case</b></center><br><br>The accused-appellants assail the decision promulgated on March 18, 2011,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[1]</sup></font> whereby the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed their convictions for illegal recruitment in large scale and three counts of <i>estafa </i>handed down on November 25, 2004 by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 18, in Cagayan de Oro City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><center><b>Antecedents</b></center><br><br>The factual and procedural antecedents, as summarized by the CA, are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Accused-appellants Owen Marcelo Cagalingan (Owen) and Beatriz B.

Nevertheless, due to budgetary constraints, accused spouses were brought to the court <i>a quo </i>only on June 4, 2004.<br><br>Thereafter, upon arraignment both accused assisted by counsel pleaded "not guilty" to the crimes charged. Joint trial ensued thereafter.<br><br>The prosecution presented as witnesses the following: private complainants Arcele, Reynalyn, Laarni, and Roselle; Leonardo G. Rodrigo (Leonardo), Officer-in-Charge of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA)-Regional Extension Unit-10, Cagayan de Oro City; and Marichu Damasing (Marichu), Branch Clerk of Court, Branch 1, MTCC-Cagayan de Oro City. The evidence presented by the prosecution established the following facts.<br><br>On different dates and occasions, private complainants were recruited by Accused Spouses to work in Macau, China for a fee. Accused spouses Owen and Beatriz were from Vigan, Ilocos Sur but Owen grew up and finished his high school education in Cagayan de Oro City. Owen is the first cousin of the husbands of private complainants Reynalyn and Roselle and the nephew of the husband of private complainant Norma.<br><br>Private complainant Arcele testified that she met accused spouses on October 28, 2002 at around 12 o'clock noon, at the house of private complainant Norma. The latter introduced accused spouses to her and she was told by accused Owen that her wife, accused Beatriz, was asked by her employer, a certain Lu Ting Hoi Simon, of Macau, China to hire office workers who are computer literate to work at Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Beatriz confirmed this information and added that she was even given a leave of absence by her employer just to come home in order to hire workers. It was Owen who explained to her about the job and the requirements like: passport, bio-data, Diploma in lieu of Transcript of Records, and Forty Thousand Pesos (P40,000.00) for roundtrip tickets and documentation fees as Beatriz could not speak Visayan.<br><br>On November 6, 2002, Arcele paid Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00) to accused Owen and subsequently, another P5,000.00 after she mortgaged her house in order to raise the required amount. She was issued a receipt for the P20,000.00 and was told that the balance of P20,0000.00 was needed for the documentation fee. She was likewise told that her departure for Manila would be on November 22, 2002 and on November 23, 2002 for Macau, China. Nonetheless, as she was not able to pay the P20,000.00 before the scheduled date, her departure was postponed. Hence, on November 23, 2002, she paid in full the balance of P20,000.00 without receipt as she trusted accused spouses. The departure was rescheduled on November 29, 2002 for Manila at 3 o'clock in the afternoon and on November 30, 2002 for Macau, China. They further agreed that Accused Spouses would fetch her at her house at 12 o'clock noon on November 29, 2002. Unfortunately, on the said date and time, accused spouses failed to appear. Hence, she decided to proceed to Cagayan de Oro City airport and look for accused spouses but the latter were not around. Instead, she met the other recruits at the airport and they all realized that they were victims of illegal recruitment. She and the other private complainants went home aggrieved and humiliated.<br><br>Private complainant Reynalyn likewise recounted that accused Owen was the first cousin of her husband and accused spouses were introduced to her by her parents-in-law on October 4, 2002 as the latter stayed at the house of her parents-in-law located adjacent to her house. Accused Owen offered to help her find work in Macau, China as accused Beatriz was allegedly asked by her employer to find Filipino workers who could replace the Taiwanese and Protuguese workers in Mandarin Oriental Hotel at Macau, China. As Reynalyn was not a college graduate, she was told that she could be assigned at the laundry section with a salary rate equivalent to Eighteen Thousand Pesos (P18,000.00) per month. She was told to secure her passport, to fill-up the bio-data with Chinese character and to pay P40,000.00 for plane tickets and other documents. She paid accused spouses the said amount and a receipt was issued to her. However, on the scheduled date of departure to Manila on November 29, 2002, she waited for accused spouses at the airport but to her disappointment, the latter failed to show up.<br><br>Another prosecution witness, private complainant Laarni, also testified that it was private complainant Roselle who informed her that accused spouses were recruiting workers for Macau, China. On October 21, 2002, she met Roselle together with accused spouses and the latter asked her if she was willing to work in Macau. She was asked about her educational background and upon knowing that she is an AB Journalism graduate, and took up computer informatics, Beatriz assured her that she could work in Macau. She was offered as office secretary for a two (2) years contract with a salary of P18,000.00 a month. She was then given a bio-data with Chinese characters with a corresponding English translation to fill up and was required to submit her transcript of records, diploma, certificate of employment and a photocopy of her passport. She was also required to pay P40,000.00 for the processing fee, plane ticket and documentation. Thereafter, accused spouses made follow-ups at the office of her father at Branch 1, MTCC-Cagayan de Oro City.<br><br>On November 20, 2002, she met accused spouses again at the office of her father and she told accused spouses that she might not proceed with her application as she was able to raise only P11,500.00 and the said amount was even borrowed from a lending institution. Accused Spouses nonetheless accepted the said amount and told her that the balance of the payment would be deducted from her salary in Macau, China. Thereafter, Accused Spouses issued a receipt and she was told that her departure for Manila would be on November 29, 2002 and they would just meet at Cagayan de Oro airport at 1 o'clock in the afternoon. However, on the said date, she did not find accused spouses at the airport and upon inquiry from the airline counter she was informed that their names were not on the plane manifest.<br><br>The testimony of Laarni as to the receipt of P11,500.00 was collaborated by prosecution witness Marichu Damasing. She testified that the said amount was received by Beatriz and the latter even counted the money at her table. The receipt was prepared by Laarni's father and was signed by Beatriz and witnessed by her. She further testified that upon receipt of the said amount, accused spouses left the office.<br><br>Corollarily, private complainant Roselle narrated that she met accused spouses on October 4, 2002 at the house of her mother-in-law. Accused spouses told her that they would be hiring workers for Macau, China and considering that at that time she was jobless, she told them of her interest to apply for work. She was then offered the position of an office clerk for two (2) years with a monthly salary of P22,000.00 and was asked to submit the required documents and to pay P40,000.00 as placement fee. Albeit it was the first time she met them, yet, she trusted them considering that Owen was the first cousin of his husband and they were staying at the same house. On November 20, 2002, she initially paid P20,000.00 and on November 26, 2002, the balance of P20,000.00. A receipt was issued to her and she was told that her departure to Manila would be on November 29, 2002. Upon the request of accused spouses, a "despidida" party was held on November 28, 2002 at the house of private complainant Reynalyn located just beside the house of her mother-in-law.<br><br>She further narrated that on November 29, 2002, accused spouses left the house of her mother-in-law at about 8 o'clock in the morning and told her that they would go to Gusa, Cagayan de Oro City to attend another "despidida" party and they would just meet at the airport. Accordingly, at about 12 o'clock noon, she and other private complainants were already at the Cagayan de Oro City airport but accused spouses were not around. They stayed at the airport until 5 o'clock in the afternoon but still accused spouses did not show up. Together with the other private complainants, they proceeded to Macabalan, Cagayan de Oro City at the house of Arcele and stayed there until 12 o'clock midnight as she was ashamed of her neighbours (sic). When she finally got home, she and her family checked the bag of accused spouses which was left at the house of her mother-in-law and to their surprise, the bag contained pillows only. Hence, she reported the incident and upon verification with the POEA she learned that Accused Spouses were not licensed recruiters.<br><br>The prosecution likewise presented Leonardo, the officer-in-charge of the POEA-Regional Extension Unit-10. At the trial, he issued certifications upon requests of private complainants Reynalyn, Roselle, Arcele and Norma certifying that upon verification of their computer database, accused spouses were neither licensed nor authorized to recruit workers and/or applicants for employment abroad.<br><br>On the other hand, the accused spouses denied the charges against them and argued that they neither recruited nor promised private complainants any work in Macau and explained that it was very difficult to find work in Macau, China unless they have relatives or siblings working there who could find work for them and who could recommend them to their employers. Albeit they admitted to be in Cagayan de Oro City sometime in August and September 2002, yet, they denied being in Cagayan de Oro City sometime in October and November 2002 as alleged by private complainants. They admitted that they met private complainants on different occasions while they were in Cagayan de Oro City as some of them were relatives of accused Owen but they asserted that they neither offered any work nor required private complainants to submit any documents and pay any amount for possible work in Macau. In fact, it was private complainants who requested them to find work for them in Macau but they turned down their requests as it was very difficult to find work in said place. They likewise denied having received any money from private complainants because they were not in Cagayan de Oro City when the alleged payments were made and as indicated in the receipts and they further testified that some of the private complainants were hard up and were incapable of producing the said amount. They could not think of any reason why private complainants accused them and filed charges against them except that they turned down their requests for job placements in Macau, China.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br><br><center><b>Judgment of the RTC</b></center><br><br>On November 25, 2004, the RTC rendered judgment convicting the accused-appellants,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> disposing:<br><br><blockquote><b>IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING,</b> the court finds accused OWEN MARCELO CAGALINGAN and BEATRIZ B.

First, it was proved by private complaints that accused spouses were not licensed or authorized to engage in recruitment activities. This fact was substantiated by POEA's Certifications and as testified to by the Officer-in-Charge of the POEA who issued the same. Second, private complainants testified and proved that indeed accused spouses undertook acts constituting recruitment and placement as defined under Article 13 (b) of the Labor Code. They testified that they were induced, offered and promised by accused spouses employment in Macau, China for two (2) years for a fee. They were made to believe that accused spouses were authorized to hire them and capable of sending them to Macau for work with higher pays. They paid accused spouses for documentation and processing fees, yet, they were unable to go abroad. These testimonies, as well as the documentary evidence they submitted consisting of the receipts issued to them by accused spouses, all proved that the latter were engaged in recruitment and placement activities. And third, there are five (5) complainants against whom accused spouses are alleged to have recruited.<br><br>Moreover, the defense proffered by accused spouses consisted merely of alibi and denial. It is however noteworthy to state that denial, like alibi, is inherently a weak defense and it is not at all persuasive. Accused spouses did not deny being in Cagayan de Oro City, albeit they asserted to have arrived months earlier than the alleged date, and they likewise did not deny having met private complainants on different occasions as some of the private complainants were even relatives of accused Owen.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Parenthetically, there is no question that accused spouses are likewise liable for <i>estafa </i>under Article 315 (2) (a) of the Revised Penal Code. We are convinced that the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt Accused Spouses' guilt for three (3) counts of <i>Estafa.</i><br><br>x x x x<br><br>There are three ways of committing <i>estafa </i>under Article 315 (a) of the Revised Penal Code: <b>(1)</b> by using a fictitious name; <b>(2) by falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions;</b> and <b>(3)</b> by means of other similar deceits. Under this class of <i>estafa, </i>the element of deceit is indispensable. Likewise, it is essential that the false statement or fraudulent representation constitutes the very cause or the only motive which induces the complainant to part with the thing of value.<br><br>In the present case, private complainants were led to believe by accused spouses that they possessed the power and qualifications to provide them with work in Macau when in fact they were neither licensed nor authorized to do so. Accused spouses made it appear to private complainants that Beatriz was requested by her employer to hire workers for Macau, when in fact she was not. They even recruited their own relatives in the guise of helping them get better jobs with higher pays abroad for them to improve their standard of living. Likewise, private complainants were deceived by accused spouses by pretending that the latter could arrange their employment in Macau, China. With these misrepresentations, false assurances and deceit, they suffered damages and they were forced to part with their hard-earned money, as one of them even testified to have mortgaged her house and another, to have borrowed money from a lending institution just to raise the alleged processing fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The factual findings of the CA are accepted because the Court is not a trier of facts. Such findings, which affirmed those of the RTC as the trial court, are now even binding on us. This is because the RTC had the unique advantage to observe the witnesses' demeanor while testifying, and the personal opportunity to test the accuracy and reliability of their recollections of past events, both of which are very decisive in a litigation like this criminal prosecution for the serious crime of illegal recruitment committed in large scale where the parties have disagreed on the material facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The Court may revise such findings in its rare and extraordinary role of a trier of facts only when the appellants convincingly demonstrate that such findings were either erroneous, or biased, or unfounded, or incomplete, or unreliable, or conflicted with the findings of fact of the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Alas, that demonstration was not made herein.<br><br>The records show that the Prosecution presented the complainants themselves to establish that the accused-appellants had made the complainants believe that they could deploy them abroad for a fee despite their having had no license or authority to do so from the proper government agency; receipts; and the certification from the POEA on the lack of the license to recruit having been issued in favor of the accused-appellants.<br><br>In contrast, the accused-appellants offered only denial. Such defense was futile because denial, essentially a negation of a fact, did not prevail over the affirmative assertions of the fact. The courts – trial as well as appellate – have generally viewed denial in criminal cases with considerable caution, if not outright rejection. This dismissive judicial attitude comes from the recognition that denial is inherently weak and unreliable by virtue of its being an excuse too easy and too convenient for the guilty to make. Denial, to be worthy of consideration at all, should be substantiated by clear and convincing evidence. Hence, the appeal of the accused should also fail because it relied solely on negative and self-serving negations. Verily, the denial carried no weight in law and had no greater evidentiary value than the testimonies of credible witnesses of the Prosecution who testified on affirmative matters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>We next ascertain if the CA properly affirmed the imposition of the penalties for illegal recruitment in large scale and the three counts of <i>estafa.</i><br><br>Under Section 7(b)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of the <i>Migrant Workers' Act, </i>the penalty for illegal recruitment in large scale is life imprisonment and fine of not less than P500,000.00 nor more than P1,000,000.00 Although Republic Act No. 10022,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> approved on March 8, 2010, has since introduced an amendment to the <i>Migrant Workers' Act </i>to raise the imposable fine to not less than P2,000,000.00 nor more than P5,000,000.00, the amendment does not apply herein because the illegal recruitment subject of this case was committed in October and November, 2002, or long before the amendment took effect. Accordingly, we hold that the RTC and CA correctly imposed life imprisonment and fine of P1,000,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>For the three counts of <i>estafa, </i>the relevant legal provision is Article 315, first paragraph, of the <i>Revised Penal Code, </i>which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Article 315. Swindling (<i>estafa). </i>- Any person who shall defraud another by any of the means mentioned herein below shall be punished by:<br><br>1st. The penalty of <i>prision correccional</i> in its maximum period to <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum period, if the amount of the fraud is over 12,000 pesos but does not exceed 22,000 pesos; and if such amount exceeds the latter sum, the penalty provided in this paragraph shall be imposed in its maximum period, adding one year for each additional 10,000 pesos; but the total penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed twenty years. In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed <i>prision mayor </i>or <i>reclusion temporal, </i>as the case may be.<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br><br>The minimum of the indeterminate sentence for each count of <i>estafa </i>is fixed within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by Article 315 of the <i>Revised Penal Code,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which is <i>prision correccional </i>in its minimum period to <i>prision correccional </i>in its medium period <i>(i.e., </i>six months and one day to four years and two months). The RTC imposed the minimum of four years, nine months, and eleven days of <i>prision correccional, </i>thereby exceeding the legal range for the minimum of the indeterminate sentence. Accordingly, the minimum of the indeterminate sentence is reduced to four years of <i>prision correccional </i>considering the absence of any modifying circumstances.<br><br>As to the maximum term for each count of <i>estafa </i>under the <i>Indeterminate Sentence Law, </i>the maximum period of the prescribed penalty is first determined, and the incremental penalty of one year of imprisonment for every P10,000.00 in excess of P22,000.00 is then added, provided that the total penalty shall not exceed 20 years. To compute the maximum period of the prescribed penalty, the time included in <i>prision correccional </i>maximum to <i>prision mayor </i>minimum shall be divided into three equal portions, with each portion forming a period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Based on the computation, the maximum period for <i>prision correccional </i>maximum to <i>prision mayor </i>minimum is from six years, eight months, and 21 days to eight years. The incremental penalty, when proper, shall thus be added to anywhere from six years, eight months, and 21 days to eight years, at the discretion of the court. In computing the incremental penalty, the amount defrauded shall be subtracted by P22,000.00, and the difference shall be divided by P10,000.00. Any fraction of a year is disregarded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>For the maximum term of the three counts of <i>estafa, </i>the RTC imposed nine years. We note that the RTC ordered the gravest imposable penalty within the range (eight years of <i>prision mayor </i>plus the one-year incremental penalty). However, because neither the RTC nor the CA found the attendance of any modifying circumstance,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> we reduce the maximum to six years, eight months, and 21 days of <i>prision mayor </i>and add the incremental penalty of one year, or a total of seven years, eight months, and 21 days.<br><br>Finally, in line with prevailing jurisprudence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the accused-appellants shall pay interest of 6% <i>per annum </i>on the respective amounts due to each of the complainants, reckoned from the finality of this decision until the amounts are fully paid.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Court <b>AFFIRMS</b> the decision promulgated on March 18, 2011 <b>IN ALL RESPECTS</b> subject to the following <b>MODIFICATIONS:</b><br><br>1.
