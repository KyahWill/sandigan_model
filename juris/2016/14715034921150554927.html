Thus, MC No. 2-A was not violated. Being the owner of the property, petitioner had the personality to be granted a right of retention. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Besides, the area of the property, being only 3.9524 hectares, is well within the retention limit granted by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Respondents appealed the resolution to the DAR,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> but the DAR Secretary dismissed the appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> He ruled that a violation of MC No. 8 is not one of the grounds to deprive a landowner of her right to retention.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Thus, even if the sale between Cristino and petitioner is null and void, the land would still be deemed owned by Cristino for purposes of determining whether Cristino and/or Isabel is entitled to retention.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Since the DAR recognized the right of retention of Isabel over the property, its sale to petitioner did not violate PD No. 27 and RA No. 6657. The tenants of the property are not prejudiced by the act of selling the property because what was sold is part of the retained area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The DAR Secretary also found that the property was within the coverage of PD No. 27 for being tenanted rice and corn land. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Respondents moved for the reconsideration of the Order, but the DAR Secretary denied their motion for lack of merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Respondents filed an appeal with the Office of the President (OP).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> They claimed that the earlier sale by Cristino of the seven hectares to Lito was already an implied exercise of the retention limit of spouses Cristino and Isabel. What was sold to petitioner is already over and above the retention limit of seven hectares, and thus petitioner, as substitute for Isabel can no longer exercise the retention right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>In its Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the OP granted the appeal and denied the application for retention of Isabel as substituted by petitioner. According to the OP, the right of retention granted to landowners is not absolute, and the voluntary conveyance made after the effectivity of PD No. 27, such as the sale in this case could be considered as an implied relinquishment of such right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> he OP also found that the Deed of Sale and Affidavit of Non-Tenancy stating that the property was not tenanted at the time of sale were self-serving and could not overcome the findings of the DAR officials who found that the property was occupied by farmer-beneficiaries.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Petitioner thus appealed to the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>On May 20, 2009, the CA affirmed the OP Decision, <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> According to the CA, it was not proven that Cristino had no knowledge of the OLT coverage of his property,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and that Cristino may be presumed to have already exercised his right of retention over the first seven hectares of land he earlier sold to Lito.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Thus, the subsequent sale of the property to petitioner should no longer form part of the seven hectare limit provided under PD No. 27.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Further, the CA, like the OP, sustained the findings of the agrarian reform officials that the property was tenanted,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and thus, the sale was prohibited under MC No. 18-81 in relation to MC No. 2-A.<br><br>On August 25, 2009, the CA denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Hence, this petition.<br><br>Petitioner maintains that she has a right of retention over the property sold to her by Cristino because: (a) the land is not covered by PD No. 27; (b) the land is within the retention limit and not subject to distribution;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (c) she is a purchaser in good faith;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> and (d) the property is already registered in her name.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Respondents, on the other hand, argue that petitioner has no right of retention over the property, being a mere successor-in-interest resulting from an illegal conveyance because: (a) the property is tenanted; and (b) Cristino had already exercised his right of retention when he sold the seven hectares to Lito in 1975.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><u><center><b> The Court's Ruling</b></center></u><br>We deny the petition.<br><br><i> Validity of the sale and </i><br><i> petitioner's right of retention</i><br><br>The requisites for coverage under the OLT Program pursuant to PD No. 27 are the following: (a) the land must be devoted to rice or corn crops; and (b) a system of share-crop or lease-tenancy obtains in the land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Petitioner insists that at the time of the sale on October 12, 1976, the property was not tenanted as evidenced by the Deed of Sale and the Affidavit of Non-Tenancy executed by Cristino declaring that the property was not tenanted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Moreover, she now claims that respondents failed to prove that the land was primarily devoted to rice and corn.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Therefore, the sale of the property in her favor did not violate PD No. 27.<br><br>The existence of tenancy over the subject property has already been declared by the DAR, the OP and the CA. It was only the DARRO which declared otherwise, solely relying on Cristino's declaration in the Affidavit of Non-Tenancy. Like the DAR, OP and the CA, we find that Cristino's Affidavit of Non-Tenancy is self-serving and merely executed to comply with the requisites for the sale to petitioner. We note too, that per the MARO Memorandum dated October 16, 1990, <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> petitioner acknowledged that respondents have been <i>bonafide </i>tenant-tillers of the property even before its sale to her was consummated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In appeals in agrarian cases, it is a long-standing rule that when the appellate court has confirmed that the findings of fact of the agrarian courts are borne out by the records, such findings are conclusive and binding on this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Further, the well-settled rule is that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, since "the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> It is not our function to review, examine and evaluate or weigh the probative value of the evidence presented.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>In the proceedings below, petitioner never alleged that the property was not tenanted or outside the coverage of the OLT.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> This argument was raised only before the CA in her petition for review.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Neither did she assail the finding that the property is rice and/or corn land. She alleged that respondents failed to prove that the land was devoted to the production of rice and corn only in her Reply dated July 19, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Points of law, theories, issues and arguments not brought to the attention of the trial court will not be and ought not to be considered by a reviewing court, as these cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. Basic consideration of due process impels this rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>The existence of tenancy and the use of land for planting rice and/or corn having been established, we find no reason to overturn the same. Thus, the land is within the coverage of the OLT under PD No. 27.<br><br>Pursuant to PD No. 27, the DAR issued MC Nos. 2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> and 2-A,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> series of 1973, and MC No. 8,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> series of 1974.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> MC No. 2-A which amended MC No. 2 provides the following explicit prohibition, among others:<br><br><blockquote>h. <b>Transfer of ownership after October 21, 1972, </b><b> except to the actual tenant-farmer tiller. </b> If transferred to him, the cost should be that prescribed by Presidential Decree No. 27. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>While MC No. 8 subsequently repealed or modified MC Nos. 2 and 2- A, and other circulars or memoranda inconsistent with it, providing that:<br><br><blockquote>4. No act shall be done to undermine or subvert the intent and provisions of Presidential Decrees, Letters of Instructions, Memoranda and Directives, such as the following and/or similar acts:&nbsp; xxx<br><blockquote>f) <b>Transferring ownership to tenanted rice </b><b> and/or corn lands after October 21, 1972, except </b><b> to the actual tenant- farmers or tillers </b> but in strict conformity to the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 27 and the requirements of the DAR. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote></blockquote><br>Petitioner cannot use the defense of being a good faith buyer, since she raised this issue only in the present petition for review. Nevertheless we cannot hold that petitioner is a buyer in good faith. A purchaser m good faith is one who buys a property without notice that some other person has a right to, or interest in, the property and pays full and fair price at the time of purchase or before he has notice of the claim or interest of other persons in the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Petitioner in this case was aware that the property was tenanted at the time of sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Another factor which militates against petitioner's claim is the very application for retention Isabel filed which she substituted for. Isabel's application for retention is an acknowledgement that the property is covered by the OLT under PD No. 27, as in fact she indicated in her application that the sale to petitioner was contrary to PD No. 27.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> In her Petition for Clarificatory Order, petitioner claimed that retention should be granted in her favor being the recognized transferee of whatever right Cristino might have had over the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Thus, she also impliedly acknowledged that the property is covered by PD No. 27. It is illogical for someone to invoke a right and at the same time claim that the requisites for the exercise of the said right are not present. Petitioner cannot claim retention rights and deny coverage under PD No. 27.<br><br>Petitioner's allegation that her title is conclusive evidence of her ownership of the property<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> is misplaced. We have held that a certificate of title cannot always be considered as conclusive evidence of ownership:<br><br><blockquote>Moreover, placing a parcel of land under the mantle of the Torrens system does not mean that ownership thereof can no longer be disputed. <b>Ownership is different from a </b><b> certificate of title, the latter only serving as the best </b><b> proof of ownership over a piece of land. The certificate </b><b> cannot always be considered as conclusive evidence of </b><b> ownership. </b> In fact, mere issuance of the certificate of title in the name of any person does not foreclose the possibility that the real property may be under co-ownership with persons not named in the certificate, or that the registrant may only be a trustee, or that other parties may have acquired interest over the property subsequent to the issuance of the certificate of title. Needless to say, registration does not vest ownership over a property, but may be the best evidence thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>In sum, the property, being tenanted rice and/or corn land, is under the coverage of the OLT, and could not have been validly sold after October 21, 1972. The sale between Cristino and petitioner on October 12, 1976, having been made in violation of PD No. 27 and its implementing guidelines is void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Petitioner, not being the owner of the property, does not have the right of retention over the property. Consequently, ownership reverts to Cristino. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br><i> Cristino's right of retention</i><br><br>The ownership reverting to Cristino notwithstanding, we cannot make a determination whether Cristino, or his heirs may still exercise the right to retention. We take exception to the OP and the CA's findings that (1) Cristino's heirs cannot exercise the right of retention because Cristino had no intention to retain the property, and (2) Cristino is presumed to have already exercised his right of retention over the first seven hectares sold to Lito.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>We find no basis for these declarations. Under Section 3 of DAR Administrative Order No. 4, Series of 1991, cited by the CA, the heirs may exercise the original landowner's right to retention if they can prove that the decedent had no knowledge of OLT Coverage over the subject property. As such, the intent must be proven by the heirs seeking to exercise the right. In this case, the heirs did not have the opportunity to prove Cristino's intent because the DARRO, without requiring proof of such intent, granted the application for retention filed by Isabel, Cristino's widow.<br><br>Further, Isabel, or Cristino's heirs, if any, were not given the opportunity to present evidence when the issue of intent to retain was raised in the proceedings below, since petitioner has already substituted Isabel. The record shows that respondents presented no evidence or legal basis to prove the so-called implied exercise of retention. This was a mere allegation on the part of the respondents, a matter which Cristino's heirs, if any, failed to rebut, as they were never part of the proceedings. We note that Isabel died after she filed the application for retention,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> and no heir or legal representative of Cristino participated in the proceedings thereafter.<br><br>When a party to a pending action dies and the claim is not extinguished, the Rules of Court require a substitution of the deceased in accordance with Section 16<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> of Rule 3. In <i>De la Cruz </i>v. <i>Joaquin,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> we explained the importance of the substitution of a deceased party:<br><br><blockquote>The rule on the substitution of parties was crafted to protect every party's right to due process. The estate of the deceased party will continue to be properly represented in the suit through the duly appointed legal representative. Moreover, no adjudication can be made against the successor of the deceased if the fundamental right to a day in court is denied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup></blockquote><br>Thus, in all proceedings, the legal representatives must appear to protect the interests of the deceased.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Because Isabel was never substituted by her heirs or legal representative in this case, no adjudication can be had on Cristino's right of retention as a matter of due process.<br><br>Cristino's heirs, if there be any, may still apply for, and exercise the right of retention if they can show entitlement thereto.<br><br><b> WHEREFORE, </b> in view of the foregoing, the petition is <b>DENIED </b>for lack of merit.
