Moreover, the opposition of the Solicitor General is a collateral attack against a certificate of title which is also disallowed under Section 48 of P.D. 1529, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 48. Certificate not subject to collateral attack. – A certificate of title shall not be subject to collateral attack. It cannot be altered, modified, or cancelled except in a direct proceeding in accordance with law."</blockquote><br>Thus, in Magay vs. Estiandanan, 69 SCRA 456, the Supreme Court held:<br><br><blockquote>"It is well-settled that a Torrens title cannot be collaterally attacked. The issue on the validity of the title can only be raised in an action expressly instituted for that purpose." (citing Legarda and Prieto vs. Saleeby, 31 Phil. 590; Director of Lands vs. Gan Tan, 89 Phil. 184; Hederson vs. Garrido, 90 Phil. 624; Samonte, et al., vs. Sambilon, et al., 107 Phil. 189).</blockquote><br><br>Moreover, petitioner should be accorded presumption that the Commissioner of Land Registration had complied with his official duties in accordance with law. The competence of the Commissioner of Land Registration to approve and disapprove survey plans, including consolidation and subdivision surveys has not been refuted and challenged. Before a consolidation or subdivision survey is conducted by geodetic engineer or before the survey is approved by competent authority, there must be proof that the party in whose behalf the survey is to be conducted is the owner of the property or has valid authority to grant permission for the survey. In the instant case, it is presumed that before the Commissioner of Land Registration approved the consolidation and subdivision survey as plan (LRC) RS-288-D, there was sufficient and existing proof submitted by petitioner of her ownership of the land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br><br>On January 10, 2002, a certain Corazon Delizo and Consuelo Delizo requested the Land Registration Authority to investigate Rodriguez's Transfer Certificates of Title Nos.

T-12826 and T-12827. These titles were given application numbers VA(B) No. 6590 and VA(B) No. 6591, respectively. Rodriguez submitted applications for Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. T-12826 and T-12827 to the Baguio Validation Committee for its evaluation and decision.<br><br>Rodriguez claims that the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals did not explicitly state that the Land Management Bureau transmitted the applications to the other members of the Baguio Validation Committee. Besides this statement, she presents no other evidence to support the claim that the files pertaining to her applications were not before the Baguio Validation Committee. However, her act of submitting the applications to the Baguio Validation Committee is already an acknowledgment of the Committee's jurisdiction to decide on the matter. In effect, Rodriguez placed her applications within the Committee's power.<br><br>Thus, the ruling on Transfer Certificates of Title Nos.

On the other hand, <i>res judicata </i>by conclusiveness of judgment precludes the questioning of a fact or issue in a second case if the fact or issue has already been judicially determined in the first case between the same parties:<br><br><blockquote>There is "bar by prior judgment" when, as between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second case that is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. In this instance, the judgment in the first case constitutes an absolute bar to the second action. Otherwise put, the judgment or decree of the court of competent jurisdiction on the merits concludes the litigation between the parties, as well as their privies, and constitutes a bar to a new action or suit involving the same cause of action before the same or any other tribunal.<br><br>But where there is identity of parties in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action, the first judgment is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined and not as to matters merely involved therein. This is the concept of <i>res judicata </i>known as "conclusiveness of judgment." Stated differently, any right, fact, or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action before a competent court in which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or subject matter of the two actions is the same.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>The elements of <i>res judicata are: </i>(1) the first judgment must be final; (2) the first judgment was rendered by a court that has jurisdiction over the subject and the parties; (3) the disposition must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) the parties, subject, and cause of action in the first judgment are identical to that of the second case.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[141]</sup></font> If, in the first judgment and in the second case, the causes of action are different such that only the parties and the issues are the same, there Is <i>res judicata </i>by conclusiveness of judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup><br><br><i>Nabus v.

The only identities thus required for the operation of the judgment as an estoppel, in contrast to the judgment as a bar, are identity of parties and identity of issues.<br><br>It has been held that in order that a judgment in one action can be conclusive as to a particular matter in another . action between the same parties or their privies, it is essential that the issues be identical. If a particular point or question is in issue in the second action, and the judgment will depend on the determination of that particular point or question, a former judgment between the same. parties will be final and conclusive in the second if that same point or question was in issue and adjudicated in the first suit; but the adjudication of an issue in the first case is not conclusive of an entirely different and distinct issue arising in the second. In order that this rule may be applied, it must clearly and positively appear, either from the record itself or by the aid of competent extrinsic evidence that the precise point or question in issue in the second suit was involved and decided in the first. And in determining whether a given question was an issue in the prior action, it is proper to look behind the judgment to ascertain whether the evidence necessary to sustain a judgment in the second action would have authorized a judgment for the same party in the first action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br><br>Therefore, the parties and issues in the two cases must be the same for <i>res judicata</i> by conclusiveness of judgment to apply.<br><br>The parties in the two cases are considered the same even when they are not identical if they share substantially the same interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> It is enough that there is privity between the party in the first case and in the second case, as when a successor-in-interest or an heir participates in the second case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup><br><br>There is identity of issues when a competent court has adjudicated the fact, matter, or right, or when the fact, matter, or right was "necessarily involved in the determination of the action[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> To determine whether an issue has been resolved in the first case, it must be ascertained that the evidence needed to resolve the second case "would have authorized a judgment for the same party in the first action."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> Thus, if the fact or matter litigated in the first case is re-litigated in the second case, it is barred by <i>res judicata</i> by conclusiveness of judgment.<br><br>In LRC Case No. 445-R, the Regional Trial Court granted Rodriguez's Petition to correct the caption of Resurvey Subdivision Plan (LRC) No. RS-288-D and the technical descriptions of the properties in the Transfer Certificates of Title based on Section 108 of Presidential Decree No. 1529.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> The trial court provided the following rationale:<br><br><blockquote>The opposition filed by the Office of the Solicitor General challenging the validity of the subject titles is in effect an attempt to reopen the decree of registration which Section 108 of PD 1529 categorically disallows. Moreover, the opposition of the Solicitor General is a collateral attack against a certificate of title which is also disallowed under Section 48 of P.D. 1529, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 48. Certificate not subject to collateral attack. – A certificate of title shall not be subject to collateral attack. It cannot be altered, modified, or cancelled except in a direct proceeding in accordance with law.<br></blockquote><br>Thus, in Magay vs. Estiandanan, 69 SCRA 456, the Supreme Court held:<br><br><blockquote>It is well-settled that a Torrens title cannot be collaterally attacked. The issue on the validity of the title can only be raised in an action expressly instituted for that purpose. (citing Legarda and Prieto vs. Saleeby, 31 Phil. 590; Director of Lands vs. Gan Tan, 89 Phil. 184; Hederson vs. Garrido, 90 Phil. 624; Samonte, et al., vs. Sambilon, et al., 107 Phil. 189).</blockquote><br><br>Moreover, petitioner should be accorded presumption that the Commissioner of Land Registration had complied with his official duties in accordance with law. The competence of the Commissioner of Land Registration to approve and disapprove survey plans, including consolidation and subdivision surveys has not been refuted and challenged. Before a consolidation or subdivision survey is conducted by geodetic engineer or before the survey is approved by competent authority, there must be proof that the party in whose behalf the survey is to be conducted is the owner of the property or has valid authority to grant permission for the survey. In the instant case, it is presumed that before the Commissioner of Land Registration approved the consolidation and subdivision survey as plan (LRC) RS-288-D, there was sufficient and existing proof submitted by petitioner of her ownership of the land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The Court of Appeals, acting on the Motion for Reconsideration and eventually reversing its ruling, applied <i>res judicata </i>by conclusiveness of judgment. It declared the Baguio Validation Committee barred from determining whether there was a fraudulent expansion of the areas covered by the Transfer Certificates of Title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> The Court of Appeal found that the issue of whether there was a fraudulent expansion had already been resolved; thus, the applications for validation 'may no longer dispute this finding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals committed an error too obvious for this Court to neglect. Its conclusions are not only contrary to the facts; they are also not in accord with existing doctrine.<br><br>The Regional Trial Court did not determine whether there was a fraudulent expansion of the properties covered by the Transfer Certificates of Title. What the trial court stated was that no collateral attack can be made on the Transfer Certificates of Title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup><br><br>Rather than substantially rule on the validity of the titles, the Regional Trial Court in LRC Case No. 445-R held that the procedure could not accommodate the objections of the Solicitor General.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br>An attack is considered collateral when it incidentally questions the validity of the transfer certificate of title in an action seeking a different relief.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> This is opposed to a direct attack through an action that seeks to annul or set aside the transfer certificate of title itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup><br><br>Certainly, a collateral attack cannot be made on a transfer certificate of title to maintain the "integrity and guaranteed legal indefeasibility of a Torrens title."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> Nonetheless, the issuance of a transfer certificate of title does not mean it can no longer be questioned when it has been acquired through fraud. The validity of a transfer certificate of title may still be put to issue, provided it must be directly done through a court action seeking to annul or set it aside.<br><br>The Regional Trial Court's denial of the Office of the Solicitor General's opposition on the ground that it is a collateral attack on the Transfer Certificates of Title is not a judgment on the validity of the Transfer Certificate of Titles. <b><i>It made no finding on the validity of the titles based on Republic v. Marcos. It did not consider any evidence of fraud.</i></b><br><br>What the trial court found was that there was a <i>presumption </i>that the Commissioner of Land Registration regularly performed his duties and was competent in approving the resurvey plan, such that Rodriguez must have shown proof that she owned the properties. This presumption could not have been overturned or proved otherwise in the same case as the trial court would again delve into questioning the validity of the Transfer Certificates of Title. Thus, the Office of the Solicitor General's filing of an appeal questioning this presumption would have been a fruitless exercise. It would just be deemed a collateral attack on the titles and would not have been considered in the first place.<br><br>Since there is no judicial determination of fraud, <i>res judicata </i>by conclusiveness of judgment cannot apply. The ruling in LRC Case No. 445-R cannot bar the issue of whether there was a fraudulent expansion of the property covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. T-12828, T-12829, T-12830, T-12831, and T-12832. These Transfer Certificates of Title may still be questioned in a direct action seeking its nullification.<br><br>It is, thus, of no moment that the judgment in LRC Case No. 445-R became final and executory and has been executed. What may no longer be questioned is the correction of the caption of the resurvey plan and the technical descriptions on the Transfer Certificates of Title, not the validity of&nbsp;<i></i>those Transfer Certificates of Title. The Office of the Solicitor General cannot be faulted for no longer appealing the ruling of the Regional Trial Court. It is erroneous to declare that the government is already barred by estoppel by laches in failing to appeal the case.<br><br>Filing a case to cancel these titles is no longer necessary in light of <i>Marcos </i> and Presidential Decree No. 1271. Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1271 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 1. All orders and decisions issued by the Court of First Instance of Baguio and Benguet in connection with the proceedings for the reopening of Civil Reservation Case No. 1, GLRO Record No. 211, covering lands within the Baguio Townsite Reservation, and 1 decreeing such lands in favor of private individuals or entities, are hereby declared null and void and without force and effect; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that all certificates of titles issued on or before July 31, 1973 shall be considered valid and the lands covered by them shall be deemed to have been conveyed in fee simple to the registered owners upon a showing of, and compliance with, the following conditions:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>The lands covered by the titles are not within any government, public or quasi-public reservation, forest, military or otherwise, as certified by appropriating government agencies;<br><br></li><li>Payment by the present title holder to the Republic of the Philippines of an amount equivalent to fifteen per centum (15%) of the assessed value of the land whose title is voided as of revision period 1973 (P.D. 76), the amount payable as follows: Within ninety (90) days of the effectivity of this Decree, the holders of the titles affected shall manifest their desire to avail of the benefits of this provision and shall pay ten per centum (10%) of the above amount and the balance in two equal installments, the first installment to be paid within the first year of the effectivity of this Decree and the second installment within a year thereafter.</li></ol></blockquote><br><br>Contrary to the rationalization of the Regional Trial Court in LRC Case No. 445-R, Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1271 already declared null and void all certificates of titles issued on or before July 31, 1973; this was in connection with the reopening of Civil Reservation Case No. 1, G.L.R.O. Rec. No. 211. Thus, the Transfer Certificates of Title do not enjoy the presumption of regularity accorded to all transfer certificates of titles. By law, they are considered invalid unless validated by the Baguio Validation Committee.<br><br>Our courts should be more aware of the machinations used by unscrupulous parties to acquire and title lands in Baguio City. As in this case, parties obtained more land through a resuryey of property. They filed an action or proceeding to "correct" the technical descriptions or the supporting survey plans. Trial courts become participants in this scheme by denying the intervention or opposition of the Solicitor General and, as in LRC Case No. 445-R, make very loose observations regarding the presumptions of validity of obviously defective titles already declared null and void by <i>Marcos</i> and confirmed as such by Presidential Decree No. 1271. Thereafter, in subsequent cases, as in these cases, the party who gains through a simple resurvey of its property erroneously raises <i>res judicata</i> as a defense; thus the party secures its spurious titles against any further legal questions.<br><br>These machinations brought about by the clearly erroneous application of doctrine should stop. Otherwise, genuine property owners in Baguio City will forever be unsure of possible land grabbing.<br><br><center><b>IV</b></center><br><br>We determine whether Rodriguez complied with all the requirements for validation as provided by Presidential Decree No. 1271 and its Internal Rules and Regulations.<br><br>Transfer Certificates of Title Nos.
