These shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a Government grant and shall be entitled to a certificate of title under the provisions of this chapter. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote><br>A similar provision is found in Section 14(1) of Presidential Decree No. 1529, otherwise known as the Property Registration Decree, which reads:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 14. <i>Who May Apply</i>. — The following persons may file in the proper Court of First Instance an application for registration of title to land, whether personally or through their duly authorized representatives:<br><blockquote>(1) Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership since June 12, 1945, or earlier.</blockquote></blockquote><br>This court in <i>Heirs of Mario Malabanan v. Republic</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> has clarified that the fixed date of June 12, 1945 qualifies possession and occupation, not land classification, as alienable and disposable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> The agricultural land subject of the application needs only to be classified as alienable and disposable as of the time of the application, provided the applicant's possession and occupation of the land dates back to June 12, 1945, or earlier.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Thus:<br><br><blockquote>The dissent stresses that the classification or reclassification of the land as alienable and disposable agricultural land should likewise have been made on June 12, 1945 or earlier, because any possession of the land prior to such classification or reclassification produced no legal effects. It observes that the fixed date of June 12, 1945 could not be minimized or glossed over by mere judicial interpretation or by judicial social policy concerns, and insisted that the full legislative intent be respected.<br><br>We find, however, that the choice of June 12, 1945 as the reckoning point of the requisite possession and occupation was the sole prerogative of Congress, the determination of which should best be left to the wisdom of the lawmakers. Except that said date qualified the period of possession and occupation, no other legislative intent appears to be associated with the fixing of the date of June 12, 1945. Accordingly, the Court should interpret only the plain and literal meaning of the law as written by the legislators.<br><br>Moreover, an examination of Section 48 (b) of the Public Land Act indicates that Congress prescribed no requirement that the land subject of the registration should have been classified as agricultural since June 12, 1945, or earlier. As such, the applicant's imperfect or incomplete title is derived only from possession and occupation since June 12, 1945, or earlier. This means that the character of the property subject of the application as alienable and disposable agricultural land of the public domain determines its eligibility for land registration, not the ownership or title over it. Alienable public land held by a possessor, either personally or through his predecessors-in-interest, openly, continuously and exclusively during the prescribed statutory period is converted to private property by the mere lapse or completion of the period. In fact, by virtue of this doctrine, corporations may now acquire lands of the public domain for as long as the lands were already converted to private ownership, by operation of law, as a result of satisfying the requisite period of possession prescribed by the <i>Public Land Act.</i> It is for this reason that the property subject of the application of Malabanan need not be classified as alienable and disposable agricultural land of the public domain for the entire duration of the requisite period of possession.<br><br>To be clear, then, the requirement that the land should have been classified as alienable and disposable agricultural land at the time of the application for registration is necessary only to dispute the presumption that the land is inalienable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>The ruling in <i>Heirs of Malabanan</i> adopted the earlier interpretation in <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals and Naguit</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> that Section 14(1) of the Property Registration Decree "merely requires the property sought to be registered as already alienable and disposable at the time the application for registration of title is filed."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> This court also emphasized in Naguit the absurdity that would result in interpreting Section 14(1) as requiring that the public land should have already been characterized as alienable by June 12, 1945.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Besides, we are mindful of the absurdity that would result if we adopt petitioner's position. Absent a legislative amendment, the rule would be, adopting the OSG's view, that all lands of the public domain which were not declared alienable or disposable before June 12, 1945 would not be susceptible to original registration, no matter the length of unchallenged possession by the occupant. Such interpretation renders paragraph (1) of Section 14 virtually inoperative and even precludes the government from giving it effect even as it decides to reclassify public agricultural lands as alienable and disposable. The unreasonableness of the situation would even be aggravated considering that before June 12, 1945, the Philippines was not yet even considered an independent state.<br><br>Instead, the more reasonable interpretation of Section 14(1) is that it merely requires the property sought to be registered as already alienable and disposable at the time the application for registration of title is filed. If the State, at the time the application is made, has not yet deemed it proper to release the property for alienation or disposition, the presumption is that the government is still reserving the right to utilize the property; hence, the need to preserve its ownership in the State irrespective of the length of adverse possession even if in good faith. However, if the property has already been classified as alienable and disposable, as it is in this case, then there is already an intention on the part of the State to abdicate its exclusive prerogative over the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Untenable is petitioner's reliance on <i>Republic v. Diloy</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> which pronounced that the period of possession before the declaration that land is alienable and disposable agricultural land should be excluded in the computation of possession for purposes of confirmation of imperfect title.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Diloy was based on <i>Republic v. Herbieto</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> which was expressly declared in <i>Heirs of Malabanan</i> to be incorrect and without precedental value with respect to Section 14(1). The court declared that:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he correct interpretation of Section 14(1) is that which was adopted in <i>Naguit</i>. The contrary pronouncement in <i>Herbieto</i>, as pointed out in <i>Naguit,</i> absurdly limits the application of the provision to the point of virtual inutility since it would only cover lands actually declared alienable and disposable prior to 12 June 1945, even if the current possessor is able to establish open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession under a<i> bona fide</i> claim of ownership long before that date.<br><br>Moreover, the Naguit interpretation allows more possessors under a <i>bona fide </i>claim of ownership to avail of judicial confirmation of their imperfect titles than what would be feasible under Herbieto. This balancing fact is significant, especially considering our forthcoming discussion on the scope and reach of Section 14(2) of the Property Registration Decree.<br>. . . .<br><br>Thus, neither <i>Herbieto</i> nor its principal discipular ruling <i>Buenaventura</i> has any precedental value with respect to Section 14(1). On the other hand, the ratio of<i> Naguit</i> is embedded in Section 14(1), since it precisely involved [a] situation wherein the applicant had been in exclusive possession under a<i> bona fide</i> claim of ownership prior to 12 June 1945. The Court's interpretation of Section 14(1) therein was decisive to the resolution of the case. Any doubt as to which between <i>Naguit</i> or <i>Herbieto</i> provides the final word of the Court on Section 14(1) is now settled in favor of Naguit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Petitioner's claim that "[t]he alienable nature of the land is essential to the bona fide claim of ownership and possession since June 12, 1945"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> is likewise untenable. In A<i>FP Retirement and Separation Benefits System (AFP-RSBS) v. Republic</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Although adverse, open, continuous, and notorious possession in the concept of an owner is a conclusion of law to be determined by courts, it has more to do with a person's belief in good faith that he or she has just title to the property that he or she is occupying. It is unrelated to the declaration that land is alienable or disposable. A possessor or occupant of property may, therefore, be a possessor in the concept of an owner prior to the determination that the property is alienable and disposable agricultural land. His or her rights, however, are still to be determined under the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup></blockquote><br>We proceed to the second issue relating to the sufficiency of evidence showing the nature and length of respondent's possession over the land. As a rule, factual findings of both the trial court and the Court of Appeals are binding on this court. Petitioner did not show the existence of any exceptions for us to depart from this rule.<br><br>The trial court and the Court of Appeals found that respondent applicant had sufficiently proved its and its predecessors-in-interest's continuous possession of the land tracing back to June 12, 1945 or earlier. Possession since 1945 was established through testimonies of respondents' witnesses, the unbroken chain of tax declarations in the name of Catalina Rivera, the person from whom respondent bought the property in 1996, and a certification from the municipal treasurer that all previous taxes had been paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Tax declarations or realty tax payments constitute at least proof that the holder has a sincere and honest claim of title over the property. Moreover, witness Bonifacia Sugarol, the owner of the adjoining land, stated that the land was owned by Ignacia Rivera and inherited by Catalina; and the land was planted with corn and had many tenants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Contrary to petitioner's claim, respondent was able to present in evidence the tax declaration for 1945. What were not presented were tax declarations before 1945 because as testified by a representative from the Office of the Municipal Assessor of Sogod, all its records before the war were destroyed. This was discussed by the Court of Appeals, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The applicant also presented a representative from the Office of the Municipal Assessor of Sogod in the person Ranito Quadra relative to the tax declaration history of Lot 2533. The oldest tax declaration on file in the said government office was TD 04024 (marked and submitted as Exh. "CC") for the year 1945. In the said tax declaration, a notation was placed in the entry -<br><br><div align="center">I (a) Land (Agricultural/Mineral) <br>ASSESSOR'S FINDINGS<br></div><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="20%"><div align="CENTER">Kind</div></td> <td width="20%"><div align="CENTER">Area</div></td> <td width="18%"><div align="CENTER">Class</div></td> <td width="18%"><div align="CENTER">Unit Value</div></td> <td width="24%"><div align="CENTER">Market Value</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">Cornland</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">4.0000</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">3a</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">P800.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td height="21"><div align="CENTER">Maguey</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">2.0000</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">1a</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">120.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td height="21"><div align="CENTER">Pasture</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">4.0169</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">120.50</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td height="21"><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td height="21"><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td height="21"><div align="CENTER">Total</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">10.0169</div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="CENTER">P1040.50</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><br>As can be gleaned from the face of this evidence, the land was already devoted to the planting of corn, maguey and the rest was pastureland. Also, i[t] appears that TD 04024 cancelled the previous tax declaration with number TD 1417. A testimony was also adduced by the same witness that the previous tax declarations covering the property cannot be produced anymore because all of their records prior to the Second World War were destroyed.<br><br>Analyzing the above-quoted testimony as well as the documentary evidence submitted, it can be clearly surmised that the land was devoted to agriculture in 1945 and even prior to that year. Based on human experience, the area planted with corn and maguey is a considerable tract of land that it presupposes that the land ceased to be a forest land. Such that, even if the land was declared to be alienable and disposable only in the year 1986, the actual use of Catalina Rivera of this tract of land was already agriculture.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Thus, respondent had established (by itself and through its predecessor-in-interest) its possession in the concept of owner of the property since 1945.
