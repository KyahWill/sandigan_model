As the trustee of the National Government to whom petitioner's assets were transferred under Proclamation No. 50,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> the Asset Privatization Trust acquired the liabilities attached to those assets. <br>The tax lien over the property here is one such liability, and petitioner may ask, as it did the Asset Privatization Trust, for contribution for the payment of the unpaid tax and the tax lien's consequent cancellation.<br><br>However, petioner need not await for contribution from the Asset Privatization Trust before it can fulfill its obligation to deliver a clean title to the property to respondent. Petitioner, as mortgagee of the property, can very well pay the tax liability and cause the cancellation of the tax lien. There was no legal impossibility to speak of, as the proviso in Section 219<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> of the National Internal Revenue Code states that "any mortgagee, purchaser or judgment creditor" to whom no tax lien shall be valid until notice of the lien is filed before the Register of Deeds.

These provisions—which release debtors from their obligations if they become legally or physical impossible or so difficult to be manifestly beyond the contemplation of the parties—only apply to obligations to do.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> They do not apply to obligations to give as when a party is obliged to deliver a thing<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> which, in this case, is a certificate of title to a real property free from liens and encumbrances.<br><br>Interestingly, petitioner contends that it would have been liable for violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act if it paid the tax liability of Marinduque Industrial and Mining Corporation to cancel the tax lien on the property. According to petitioner:<br><blockquote>[The Development Bank of the Philippines] is a government bank.<u> To pay the taxes of a private corporation out of its coffers, and when such account was already transferred to a Government Liquidator, such as [the Asset Privatization Trust], would be a crime punishable under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Law, at the very least</u> not to mention the enormous amount of not less than P44 Mililion Pesos involved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> (Underscoring in the original)</blockquote>This argument is wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lien is a "legal claim or charge on property, either real or personal, as a collateral or security for the payment of some debt or obligation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> A lien, until discharged, follows the property. Hence, when petitioner acquired the property, the bank also acquired the liabilities attached to it, among them being the tax liability to the Bureau of Internal Revenue. That the unpaid taxes were incurred by the defunct Marinduque Industrial and Mining Corporation is immaterial. In acquiring the property, petitioner assumed the obligation to pay for the unpaid taxes.<br><br>Thus, should petitioner pay the remaining P24,311,997.41 to the Bureau of Internal Revenue, it would not be paying the taxes of a private corporation. It would be paying the liability attached to its own property, and there would be no violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<br><br><div align="center"><b>II</b><br></div><br>With petitioner capable of having the tax lien cancelled, it cannot insist on the admission of its third-party complaint against the Asset Privatization Trust. The admission of a third-party complaint requires leave of court; the discretion is with the trial court. If leave is denied, the proper remedy is to file a complaint to be docketed as a separate case. As explained in<i> Firestone Tire and Rubber Company of the Philippines v. Tempongko:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><blockquote>The third-party complaint, is therefore, a procedural device whereby a "third party" who is neither a party nor privy to the act or deed complained of by the plaintiff, may be brought into the case with leave of court, by the defendant, who acts as third party plaintiff to enforce against such third party defendant a right for contribution, indemnity, subrogation or any other relief, in respect of the plaintiff's claim. The third party complaint is actually independent of and separate and distinct from the plaintiff's complaint. Were it not for this provision of the Rules of Court, it would have to be filed independently and separately from the original complaint by the defendant against the third party. But the Rules permit defendant to bring in a third party defendant or so to speak, to litigate his separate cause of action in respect of plaintiff's claim against a third party in the original and principal case with the object of avoiding circuitry of action and unnecessary proliferation of lawsuits and of disposing expeditiously in one litigation the entire subject matter arising from one particular set of facts. Prior leave of Court is necessary, so that where the allowance of a third party complaint would delay the resolution of the original case, such as when the third-party defendant cannot be located or where matters extraneous to the issue of possession would unnecessarily clutter a case of forcible entry, or the effect would be to introduce a new and separate controversy into the action, the salutary object of the rule would not be defeated, and the court should in such cases require the defendant to institute a separate action. When leave to file the third party complaint is properly granted, the Court renders in effect two judgments in the same case, one on the plaintiff's complaint and the other on the third party complaint.&nbsp; When he finds favorably on both complaints, as in this case, he renders judgment on the principal complaint in favor of plaintiff against defendant and renders another judgment on the third party complaint in favor of defendant as third party plaintiff, ordering the third party defendant to reimburse the defendant whatever amount said defendant is ordered to pay plaintiff in the case. Failure of any of said parties in such a case to appeal the judgment as against him makes such judgment final and executory. By the same token, an appeal by one party from such judgment does not inure to the benefit of the other party who has not appealed nor can it be deemed to be an appeal of such other party from the judgment against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup>&nbsp; (Citations omitted)</blockquote>There was no grave abuse of discretion in denying leave to admit the third-party complaint against the Asset Privatization Trust. As the Court of Appeals observed, the trial court would have wasted time and effort had it admitted the third-party complaint. Respondent, the original plaintiff, had already rested its case when the Motion for Leave was filed. The original case would have dragged on with the addition of a new party at a late stage of the trial. We agree with the following discussion of the Court of Appeals:<br><blockquote>While the Rules of Court does not provide a definite period in which a third-party complaint may be filed, Section 12, Rule 6 thereof requires leave of court before filing the same. Whether to grant such leave is entrusted to the discretion of the court.<br><br>We do not find any abuse of discretion on the part of the court<i> a quo</i> in denying the leave. It bears to emphasize that the rationale for permissive joinder of a third-party defendant who may be liable to the original defendant is judicial economy. This practice avoids multiplicity of actions and saves time and reduplication of effort by trying all issues together in one action. However, there is little economy in waiting to join the third-party defendant after the original plaintiff rested its case, as [the Development Bank of the Philippines] did in this case, especially when it tried to pass on its liability to [the Asset Privatization Trust] at the very first instance. Not only will the probable delay prejudice Clarges [Realty Corporation], there is also great possibility of prejudice to [the Asset Privatization Trust].
