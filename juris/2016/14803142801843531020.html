Gladys P. Garcia (Atty. Garcia), of the Citizens Legal Assistance Office detailed at the Pasay City Hall. Balasbas, <i>et al.</i> alleged that they have been residing in the premises for the past thirty-two (32) years. They used to pay rentals to a certain Jesus Uy but stopped in 1975 when they learned that Jesus Uy was not the owner of the lot on which they lived. The property on which their houses stand is not included in Uy Realty's property as shown in the vicinity map of the City Assessor of Pasay City. Uy Realty's property is designated as Lot No. 555 while the portion of the property where Balasbas, <i>et al.</i>'s houses stand is designated as Lot No. 537 [Lot No. 587 <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>] Uy Realty encroached upon a portion of Lot No. 587 by covering the creek which separates the lot where Balasbas, <i>et al.</i>'s houses are built.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> They prayed for the dismissal of the complaint and claimed moral and exemplary damages, as well as litigation expenses, from Uy Realty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>During the pre-trial on July 11, 1985, <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the parties agreed that the only issue to be resolved is whether the property claimed by Uy Realty is the same property on which Balasbas, <i>et al.</i>'s houses stand, or, whether the property claimed by Uy Realty goes beyond the area covered by its title such that a portion of it encroaches upon the land on which Balasbas, <i>et al</i>. built their dwellings.<br><br>Trial ensued.

The trial court ordered the creation of a survey team which will conduct an actual survey on the land based on the technical description found in TCT No. 24612. The team would consist of two (2) representatives from each party, and a geodetic engineer from the City Engineer's Office of Pasay City as the team leader.<br><br>Engineer Amador Abaya (Engr. Abaya) of the City Engineer's Office was designated as the team leader.

The questions surrounding the execution of the compromise agreement and its subsequent approval by the RTC, the accuracy of the Abaya and De Lara survey reports, and the declaration that petitioners' houses occupy a portion of Uy Realty's property require the re-evaluation of the factual findings of the RTC and the CA. On this score alone, the petition fails.<br><br>Just the same, even if we relax the rules, the substantial merits of the petition are insufficient to reverse the Decisions of the RTC and the CA.<br><br>The findings of the RTC and the CA regarding petitioners' encroachment on Uy Realty's property are based on the results of the surveys Engr.

The stipulation was re-affirmed at the hearing on July 6, 1987.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Such stipulation served as the basis of the partial judgment issued on July 9, 1987 where the RTC made the following pronouncement:<br><br><blockquote><b>The parties in the above-entitled case, assisted by their respective counsel</b> (<i>sic</i>), <b>made the following admissions and/or stipulations</b> embodied in the Commissioner's Report dated March 31, 1987, counsel for plaintiff's manifestation and motion dated May 18, 1987, counsel for the defendants manifestation and motion dated June 11, 1987 amplified in the order dated June 11, 1987, counsel for the defendants' written manifestation dated June 19, 1987, and again affirmed by attending counsels on July 6, 1987 x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote><br>A party may make judicial admissions in (1) the pleadings; (2) during the trial, by verbal or written manifestations or stipulations; or (3) in other stages of the judicial proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> The veracity of judicial admissions requires no further proof and may be controverted only upon a clear showing that the admissions were made through palpable mistake or that no admissions were made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>Here, the stipulation of facts constitutes judicial admissions. Thus, in order to contradict them, Balasbas, <i>et al.</i> must show that they were made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made. No such showing was made in this case.<br><br>Equally well-settled is the rule that a client is bound by the acts, even mistakes of his counsel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The rationale for the rule is that a counsel, once retained, holds the implied authority to do all acts necessary or, at least, incidental to the prosecution and management of the suit in behalf of his client, such that any act or omission by counsel within the scope of the authority is regarded, in the eyes of the law, as the act or omission of the client himself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The exceptions to this rule are: (1) where reckless or gross negligence of counsel deprives the client of due process of law; (2) when its application will result in outright deprivation of the client's liberty or propetiy; or (3) where the interests of justice so require.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> In this case, other than petitioners' self-serving and bare allegation that their previous counsels have purposely kept them ignorant of the status of their case, petitioners did not present evidence to substantiate their claim.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Petition is <b>DENIED</b> for lack of merit.
