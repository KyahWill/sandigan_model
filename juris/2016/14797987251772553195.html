For Tsuji's failure to declare the subject jewelry as required by customs laws, the same was confiscated and withheld in the In-Bond Room Section, Baggage Assistance Division (In­-Bond Room Section) of the Bureau of Customs (BOC) at the NAIA, which issued a Held Baggage Receipt No. 18875 in Tsuji's favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The subject jewelry was then deposited to the Cashier's vault for appraisal and inventory.

Moreover, no justification was given for their actions. Finally, it ruled that the fact that the BOC indemnified Tsuji for the loss of her jewelry does not exculpate them from liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, respondent appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> to the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated July 24, 2015, the CA modified the OMB decision and found respondent administratively liable, instead, for Simple Misconduct, a less grave offense punishable with suspension of one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the first offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> While it sustained the OMB's findings that respondent committed an act of misconduct, it found that the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rules that characterize the offense as Grave Misconduct were not shown to be present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Considering that there were no attending mitigating or aggravating circumstances in this case, the CA imposed upon respondent the medium penalty of suspension of three (3) months without pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The FIO moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated November 10, 2015; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before This Court</b><br></center><br>The primordial issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not respondent should be held administratively liable for Grave Misconduct, instead of Simple Misconduct as found by the CA.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>At the outset, the Court emphasizes that as a general rule, factual findings of the Ombudsman are conclusive when supported by substantial evidence and are accorded due respect and weight, especially when affirmed by the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In this case, except as to the legal conclusion on what administrative offense was committed by respondent, the OMB·and the CA are one in finding that respondent committed a misconduct when he (<i>a</i>) delivered the inbonded tin can of jewelry to Vigilia, knowing fully well that it was not his duty nor was he authorized to do so; and (<i>b</i>) failed to justify or offer an explanation for his action.<br><br>Misconduct generally means wrongful, improper or unlawful conduct motivated by a premeditated, obstinate or intentional purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> It is intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of a rule of law or standard of behavior and to constitute an administrative offense, the misconduct should relate to or be connected with the performance of the official functions and duties. of a public officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> It is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>There are two (2) types of misconduct, namely: grave misconduct, with which respondent was charged, and simple misconduct. In grave misconduct, as distinguished from simple misconduct, the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of an established rule must be manifest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Without any of these elements, the transgression of an established rule is properly characterized merely as simple misconduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the CA ruled that respondent was guilty only of Simple Misconduct because the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rules that characterize the offense as Grave Misconduct were lacking.<br><br>The Court disagrees.<br><br>Contrary to the CA's finding, respondent acted in <u>flagrant disregard of established</u> rules when he transferred the subject jewelries from the In-Bond Room to the Cashier Section without any authority.<br><br>In <i>Imperial, Jr. v. Government Service Insurance System</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> the Court elucidated the instances where flagrant disregard of rules obtains, thus:<br><blockquote>Flagrant disregard of rules is a ground that jurisprudence has already touched upon. It has been demonstrated, among others, in the instances when there had been open defiance of a customary rule; in the repeated voluntary disregard of established rules in the procurement of supplies; in the practice of illegally collecting fees more than what is prescribed for delayed registration of marriages; when several violations or disregard of regulations governing the collection of government funds were committed; and <b>when the employee arrogated unto herself responsibilities that were clearly beyond her given duties. The common denominator in these cases was the employee's propensity to ignore the rules as clearly manifested by his or her actions</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, in <i>Re: Letter of Judge Lorenza Bordios Paculdo, Municipal Trial Court, Br. 1, San Pedro, Laguna on the Administrative Lapses Committed by Nelia P. Rosales</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> the Court ruled that an employee's act of arrogating unto herself responsibilities that were clearly beyond her given duties as a utility worker constitutes grave misconduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> On the other hand, in <i>Ampil v. Office of the Ombudsman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Court found the respondent Register of Deeds guilty of grave misconduct and ordered his dismissal from service when he erroneously issued Condominium Certificates of Title without following the established rules on land registration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In the same vein, it was not respondent's duty as Customs Security Guard II of the In-Bond Room Section, nor does he have the authority, to remove or release the sealed tin can of jewelry from the In-Bond Room Section to Customs Cashier Vigilia. Other than his self-serving and uncorroborated claim that he did so for "safekeeping" purposes, he was not able to establish sufficient justification for his actions. Even if he had reasonable ground to believe that the subject jewelry was in danger of being lost in the In-Bond Room Section, he still needed to secure (<i>a</i>) the necessary clearance/authorization from the official custodian thereof or a higher BOC official having supervision over such officer before he can transfer the subject jewelry to another location, and strictly in accordance with such officer's/official's instructions, and/or (<i>b</i>) comply with existing laws<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and rules<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> for the removal of seized items before releasing the same to any person. Instead, he merely stated that he, together with a witness, <i>viz.</i>, Tiñana, brought the subject jewelry to the BOC cashier who received the same,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> conveniently omitting any mention of how he got possession of the subject jewelry, or that his actions were upon the prompting of any BOC officer/official. These, despite his express admission<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> that the transfer of inbonded articles was not within his duties. Thus, the Court finds that he acted not with mere overzealousness but committed a usurpation of function that does not pertain to his position, or an <i>ultra vires</i> act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Verily, this Court has repeatedly emphasized the time-honored rule that a "[p]ublic office is a public trust [and] [p]ublic officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> This high constitutional standard of conduct is not intended to be mere rhetoric, and should not be taken lightly considering that those in the public service are enjoined to fully comply with this standard or run the risk of facing administrative sanctions ranging from reprimand to the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Based on the confluence of events as afore-discussed, respondent failed to measure up to the standards of conduct prescribed for his position. As an accountable employee charged with the safeguarding of seized items in the In-Bond Room&nbsp;&nbsp; Section, he was&nbsp; expected&nbsp; to exercise utmost responsibility and fidelity in the discharge of that duty, and to ensure that they would only be transferred to another location and/or released to authorized persons, and pursuant to proper authority issued by the official custodian thereof, a higher BOC official, or upon court order. However, he disregarded even the most basic established procedural requirement of prior authorization from a higher BOC official before removing the subject jewelry from the custody of the In-Bond Room Section, which paved the way for its loss, and the consequent damage to the owner of the subject jewelry, Tsuji, and in the process, eroded the public's trust in the BOC as enforcer of the Philippines' tariff and customs laws, and all other laws, rules and regulations relating to the tariff and customs administration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the Court finds respondent guilty of Grave Misconduct which is classified as a grave offense punishable by dismissal even for first time offenders,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> with all the accessory penalties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> By jurisprudence, the Court has additionally imposed the forfeiture of all other benefits, except accrued leave credits, salaries and allowances earned up to the time of dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
