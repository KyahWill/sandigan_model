				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For consideration is the <i>Manifestation and Omnibus Motion (Omnibus Motion)</i> dated October 12, 2012 interposed by respondent Republic of the Philippines (Republic). In it, respondent claims that the Court, in its September 4, 2012 Resolution, has not included as part of its assets to be reconveyed to it the 25.45 million San Miguel Corporation (SMC) shares subject of the Compromise Agreement dated March 20 and 22, 1990 entered into by and between the SMC Group and the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) Group that SMC subsequently converted to treasury shares.<br><br><div align="JUSTIFY"><br><center><b>Antecedents</b><br></center><br>On March 26, 1986, the Coconut Industry Investment Fund Holding Companies ("CIIF") sold 33,133,266 SMC common shares to Andres Soriano III of the SMC Group for P3,313,326,600.00, payable in four (4) installments. On April 1, 1986, the SMC Group paid the initial purchase price of P500 million to the UCPB as administrator of the CIIF (the "UCPB Group"). The sale was transacted through the stock exchange and the shares were then registered in the name of Anscor-Hagedom Securities, Inc. (AHSI). <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On April 7, 1986, the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) sequestered the shares of stock. Due to the sequestration, the SMC Group suspended payment of the balance of the purchase price of the subject stocks. In retaliation, the UCPB Group attempted to rescind the sale by filing a complaint with the Regional Trial Court of Makati. The complaint, however, was eventually ordered dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Early 1989 developments saw the SMC and UCPB groups successfully threshing out their dispute over the aborted sale of the over 33.1 million SMC shares which have meanwhile ballooned to 175,274,960 as a consequence of dividends and stock splits. But because any settlement required PCGG's intervention, Andres Soriano III, for SMC, and Ramon Y. Sy, for UCPB, in a joint letter of October 31, 1989, informed the PCGG about a proposal which would have the two groups give PCGG an "arbitration fee" in the form of 5,500,000 SMC shares to support the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>PCGG approved the proposal. Thus, on March 20 and 22, 1990, SMC and UCPB representing the CIIF signed a <i>Compromise Agreement and Amicable Settlement </i>(<i>"Compromise Agreement"</i>). Its pertinent provisions state:<br><br><blockquote>3.1. The sale of the shares covered by and corresponding to the first installment of the 1986 Stock Purchase Agreement consisting of Five Million SMC Shares is hereby recognized by the parties as valid and effective as of 1 April 1986. Accordingly, said shares and all stock and cash dividend declared thereon after 1 April 1986 shall pertain, and are hereby assigned, to SMC. x x x<br><br>3.2. The First Installment Shares shall revert to the SMC treasury for dispersal pursuant to the SMC Stock Dispersal Plan attached as Annex "A-1" hereof. The parties are aware that these First Installment Shares shall be sold to raise funds at the soonest possible time for the expansion program of SMC. x x x<br><br>3.3. The sale of the shares covered by and corresponding to the second, third and fourth installments of the 1986 Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby rescinded effective 1 April 1986 and deemed null and void, and of no force and effect. Accordingly, all stock and cash dividends declared after 1 April 1986 corresponding to the second, third and fourth installments shall pertain to CIIF Holding Corporations. x x x</blockquote><br>On March 23, 1990, the SMC and the UCPB Groups filed with the Sandiganbayan a <i>Joint Petition for Approval of the Compromise Agreement and Amicable Settlement ('Joint Petition")</i>, docketed as CC No. 0102.4<br><br>On June 18, 1990, the PCGG joined the OSG in praying that the SMC and UCPB Groups' <i>Joint Petition</i> be treated as an incident of Civil Case (CC) No. 0033, a case for the recovery of ill-gotten wealth instituted by the PCGG with the Sandiganbayan against former President Ferdinand Marcos, Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. ("Cojuangco"), et al. on July 31, 1987. PCGG, however, interposed no objection to the implementation of the <i>Compromise Agreement </i>subject to some conditions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On July 4, 1991, the SMC and UCPB Groups filed a <i>Joint Manifestation of Implementation of Compromise Agreement and of Withdrawal of Petition</i> therein stating that they have implemented the Compromise Agreement with the conditions set by the PCGG and, accordingly, withdrawing their Joint Petition. They informed the Sandiganbayan of the execution of the following corporate acts:<br><br><blockquote>a. On instructions of the SMCGroup, the certificates of stock registered in the name of Anscor-Hagedom Securities, Inc. (AHSI) representing 175,274,960 SMC shares were surrendered to the SMC corporate secretary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>b. The said SMC shares were reissued and registered in the record books of SMC in the following manner: i) Certificates for 25,450,000 SMC shares were registered in the name of SMC, as treasury; ii) Certificates for 144,324,960 SMC shares were registered in the name of the CIIF Holding Companies; iii) Certificates for 5,500,000 SMC shares were registered in the name of the PCGG.<br><br>c. The UCPB Group has delivered to the SMC Group the amount of P500,000,000.00 in full payment of the UCPB preferred shares.<br><br>d. The SMC Group delivered to the UCPB Group the amount of 481,628,055.99 representing accumufated dividends (from Apri 11, 1986) on the shares reverted to the CIIF Holding Companies.</blockquote><br><b>The PCGG, for its part, manifested that it has no objection to the action thus taken by the SMC and UCPB Groups</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> COCOFED, et al. and Cojuangco filed their respective motions, both dated July 4, 1991, to nullify the implementation of the <i>Compromise Agreement.

By Resolution of May 6, 2004, the graft court denied the desired intervention.</b><br><br>The next day, the Sandiganbayan granted the Republic's<i> Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and/or Partial Summary Judgment</i> in CC No. 0033-F in its May 7, 2004 PSJ, holding that "[t]he CIIF Companies having been acquired with public funds, the 14 CIIF-Holding Companies and all their assets, <i>including the CIIF Block of SMC Shares,</i> being public in character, belong. to the government."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In so ruling, the Sandiganbayan declared the 33,133,266 sequestered SMC shares subject of the stock purchase agreement by the CIIF Holding Companies and Andres Soriano III as owned by the Republic in trust for the coconut farmers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In its Resolution of May 11, 2007 in CC No. 0033-F, the Sandiganbayan held that there is no need for further trial on the issue regarding the actual percentage of the sequestered CIIF Block of SMC shares vis-a-vis the outstanding capital stock of SMC, effectively deleting the last paragraph of the dispositive portion of its May 7, 2004 PSJ.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>It is upon the foregoing factual backdrop and proceedings that herein petitioners have filed the captioned consolidated <i>Petitions for Review on Certiorari</i> in May 2007.<br><br>Awaiting the decision thereon, COCOFED filed on July 24, 2009 an <i>Urgent Motion to Approve the Conversion of the SMC Common Shares into SMC Series 1 Preferred Shares</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> praying for the approval of the conversion of the Class "A" and Class."B" common shares registered in the name of the 14 CIIF Holding Companies (listed in Annex "D" of the motion)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> into SMC Series 1 Preferred Shares.<br><br>By then, the 14 CIIF Holding Companies' registered shareholdings in SMC already totaled 753,848,312 shares after dividend yields and availment by the CIIF of stock rights offering on April 11, 2005 of additional 28,645,672 shares.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>On September I7, 2009, this Court issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> approving with qualification the conversion, viz:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court APPROVES the conversion of the 753,848,312, ·sMC Common Shares <u>registered</u> in the CIIF companies to SMC SERIES 1 PREFERRED SHARES of 753,848,312, the converted shares to be registered in the names of the CIIF companies in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the conversion offer set forth in SMC's Information Statement and appended as Annex "A" of COCOFED's Urgent Motion to Approve the Conversion of the CIIF SMC Common Shares into Series 1 Preferred Shares.

To stress, a part of these shares evolved from the 144,324,960 shares registered in the name of the CIIF Holding Companies following the implementation of the Compromise Agreement and augmented by the 28,645,672 shares availed during the stock rights offering in Apri12005. The September 17, 2009 Resolution did not include the 25.45 million shares in the name of SMC as treasury shares. Neither did the same Resolution encompass the "arbitration fee" shares which already amounted to 27,571,409 Class "A" and Class "B" shares as of July 30, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On June 28, 2011, respondent Republic filed with the Court an <i>Urgent Motion to Direct the San Miguel Corporation (SMC) to Comply with the Final and Executory Resolutions dated October 24, 1991 and March 18, 1992 of the Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> praying that this Court direct SMC to comply with the Sandiganbayan's October 25, 1991 and March 18, 1992<br><br>Resolutions.

In the main, SMC argued that the <i>Compromise Agreement</i> whence it derives its right on the treasury shares is effective and the Republic has no ground to assail it.<br><br>In its September 4, 2012 Resolution denying COCOFED's motion for reconsideration, the Court sought to reflect the current number of the shares registered in the name of the CIIF companies and so held:<br><br><blockquote><b>As of 1983, the Class A and B San Miguel Corporation (SMC) common shares in the names of the 14 CIIF Holding Companies are 33,133,266 shares</b>.

In that Resolution which has long become final and executory, the Court, upon motion of COCOFED and with the approval of the Presidential Commission on Good Government, granted the conversion of 753,848,312 Class "A" and Class "B" SMC common shares registered in the name of the CIIF companies to SMC Series 1 Preferred Shares of 753,848,312, subject to certain terms and conditions</b>.

Shares mentioned in this Court's September 4, 2012 Resolution does not equate to the 33,133,266 SMC common shares specified in its January 24, 2012 Decision. The Republic posits that the 25.45 million SMC treasury shares form part of the CIIF block of SMC shares totaling 33,133,266 shares as of 1983, which the Court has declared to be owned by the Government. Hence, the Republic prays that a new resolution be issued:<br><br><blockquote>1.

Nos. 104037-38 and 109797 which directed the delivery to the [PCGG] of the treasury shares, including all the accrued cash and stock dividends from 1986 up to the present;<br><br>3. AWARDING actual damages in favor of the Republic of the Philippines in the form of legal interest on the cash and cash value of the stock dividends and cash dividends which ought to have accrued and delivered to the Republic and the PCGG by the SMC in compliance with the aforesaid resolutions and decision of. the Sandiganbayan and the Honorable Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>In its <i>Comment</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated December 2, 2013 on the above <i>Manifestation and Omnibus Motion</i>, SMC maintains that the adverted SMC treasury shares belong to SMC pursuant to the March 20 and 22, 1990 <i>Compromise Agreement</i> and that this Court is without jurisdiction to order it to deliver the 25.45 million treasury shares to the Government since SMC's intervention in CC No. 0033-F was denied and so it is a non-party in said case.<br><br><b><center>Our Ruling</center><br>No Jurisdiction over SMC since it is not a party to the case</b><br><br>It is elementary that every person must be heard and given his day in court before a judgment involving his life, liberty or property issues against him. This rule is enshrined no less in the very first section of the Bill of Rights of our Constitution:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <b>No person shall be deprived of</b> life, liberty or<b> property without due process of law</b>, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Corporate persons, needless to stress, are entitled to the due process protection. Thus, in <i>Palm Avenue Holding Co., Inc. v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> the Court echoed our ruling in <i>PCGG v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> that the failure to implead a corporation in a suit for the recovery of ill-gotten wealth against its stockholders cannot bind the corporation itself; otherwise, its fundamental right to due process will be violated, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The Court's ruling in <b><i><u>Presidential Commission on Good Government v. Sandiganbavan</u></i></b><u>, which <b>remains good law, reiterates the necessity of the Republic to actually implead corporations as defendants in the complaint, out of recognition for their distinct and separate personalities, failure to do so would necessarily be denying such entities their right to due process</b></u><b>. Here, the writ of sequestration issued against the assets of the Palm Companies is not valid because the suit in Civil Case No. 0035 against Benjamin Romualdez as shareholder in the Palm Companies is not a suit against the latter</b>. The Court has held, contrary to the assailed Sandiganbayan Resolution in G.R. No. 173082, that <b><u>failure to implead these corporations as defendants</u></b> and merely annexing a list of such corporations to the complaints <b><u>is a violation of their right to due process for it would be, in effect, disregarding their distinct and separate personality without a hearing</u></b>. Here, the Palm Companies were merely mentioned as Item Nos. 47 and 48, Annex A of the Complaint, as among the corporations where defendant Romualdez owns shares of stocks. <b>Furthermore, while the writ of sequestration was issued on October 27, 1986, the Palm Companies were impleaded in the case only in 1997, or already a decade from the ratification of the Constitution in 1987, way beyond the prescribed period.</b></blockquote><br>As a corollary rule, this Court has held that execution may issue only upon <b>a person who is a party to the action or proceeding</b>, and not against one who did not have or was denied his day in court. We said as much in <i>Atilano v. Asaali</i>: <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It is well-settled that <b><u>no man shall be affected by any proceeding to which he is a stranger, and strangers to a case are not bound by a judgment rendered by the court</u></b>. Execution of a judgment can only be issued against one who is a party to the action, and not against one who, not being a party thereto, did not have his day in court.

The <i>fallo</i> was clarified precisely to reflect the present number of shares<u> registered in the name of the CIIF companies</u>. Thus, the 5.5 million shares with the PCGG, and the 25.45 million shares with SMC, were no longer included therein.<br><br>There was never an equivalence made or implied between the 33,133,266 common shares and the 753,848,312 SMC Series 1 Preferred Shares. As observed, the current number of 753,848,312 SMC Series 1 Preferred Shares was taken from this -Court's September 17, 2009 Resolution, where there was no mention of the original 33,133,266 common shares. The September 17, 2009 Resolution limited itself to the conversion of the shares remaining <u>in the name of the CIIF companies</u> from common to Series 1 Preferred shares., i.e., those arising from the 144,324,960 shares registered in the name of CIIF companies following the implementation of the compromise agreement and the additional 28,645,672 subscribed by them in April 1995 following SMC's stock rights offering. This is so considering that COCOFED's "Urgent Motion: To Approve the Conversion of the SMC Common Shares Into SMC Series 1 Preferred Shares" dated July 24, 2009 specifically asked for the exchange of "ALL THE <b>SHARES OF STOCK OF SMC THAT ARE PRESENTLY SEQUESTERED AND REGISTERED IN THE RESPECTIVE NAMES OF THE 14 CIIF HOLDING COMPANIES IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF 753,848,312</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> COCOFED did not ask for the conversion of all the shares that arose from the original 33,133,266 SMC Common Shares given the claim and possession of the remaining portion by the PCGG and the SMC over the remainder.<br><br>In other words, COCOFED did not ask for the conversion of the 5.5 million arbitration shares already in the name of PCGG because the shares were already transferred and registered in the name of PCGG as of July 1991.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Likewise, COCOFED did not ask for the conversion of the SMC treasury shares because it had no claim on them anymore, as the same were already transferred and registered in the name of SMC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> As a matter of fact, certificates of stocks were issued to SMC and PCGG, specifically: (1) Certificate Nos. 004127, 004128, and 015555 for PCGG; and (2) Certificate Nos. 004129 and 015556 for SMC. Thus, the PCGG shares and the SMC treasury shares were no longer included in the September 17, 2009 and September 4, 2012 Resolutions, which were limited to the 753,848,312 shares still registered in the name of COCOFED.<br><br>There is no gainsaying that the treasury shares were originally derived from the more than 33.13 million shares acquired by the CIIF shares in 1983. However, SMC is persistent in its claim of ownership over the 25.45 million shares following the events that transpired after the purchase by the CIIF of the shares in 1983. Thus, it is not incompatible, much less "illogical," to hold that the original 33,133,266 SMC common shares were bought with public funds in 1983 and yet the treasury shares may not now belong to the government given the foregoing events that supervened after the purchase of these shares, which, as will be discussed, bore the imprimatur of the government agency appointed to administer them.<br><br><b>The Republic participated in the Compromise Agreement</b><br><br>To sway this Court, the Republic relies on the fact that the Compromise Agreement between SMC and the CIIF Companies ratifYing the sale of the first installment shares had been submitted but has not been approved by the Sandiganbayan. But note, neither has the Compromise Agreement been disapproved by that or this Court. Nowhere in <i>San Miguel Corporation v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> did the Court rule on the validity of the Compromise Agreement, much less "indirectly [deny] approval of the Compromise Agreement,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> since it was not the issue presented for the Court's resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The absence of an explicit approval of the Compromise Agreement by the Sandiganbayan, however, did not and does not preclude the PCGG from recognizing the agreement. In fact, the PCGG exercised ownership over the arbitration shares by asking, through the OSG, for the conversion of the PCGG shares into preferred shares per a Motion dated September 30, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> More importantly, it retained ownership of the said arbitration fee shares from 1991 up to the present. Undoubtedly, the Republic, through the PCGG, implicitly recognized the validity of the Compromise Agreement.<br><br>The graft court's disinclination to explicitly approve the Compromise Agreement was, as admitted in the Dissent, only intended to prevent any "prejudice [of] their eventual delivery to their lawful owner or owners who will be determined at the close of the judicial proceeding."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In effect, the Sandiganbayan intended to conserve the SMC shares <i><b>for the party who will eventually be declared the beneficial owner thereof</b></i>. <br><br>Per this Court's January 2012 Decision, beneficial ownership of the shares pertains to the Republic. But as things stood, <u><b>the Republic was actually involved in the Compromise Agreement and its implementation.</b></u><br><br>It is not lost on this Court that the PCGG, the government's primary representative in sequestration proceedings, virtually gave its consent to SMC's continuous possession of the 25.45 million shares by approving the Compromise Agreement on which SMC predicates its claim over the shares and continuing its possession of the so-called "arbitration fee" shares that came out of the same Compromise Agreem nt.<br><br>Put differently, the PCGG, the government agency empowered to exercise sequestration powers over the 25.45 SMC treasury shares, gave its consent to SMC's claim of ownership and possession of the treasury shares by approving the Compromise Agreement on which SMC predicates its claim and also asserting and exercising ownership and possession of the so­ called "arbitration· fees of 5.5 SMC shares that came out of the Compromise Agreement." This may be the real reason why PCGG did not implement the SB orders dated October 25, 1991 and March 18, 1992 which ordered SMC to surrender the treasury shares.<br><br>What is more, at the time the Compromise Agreement was signed, SMC's board was dominated by PCGG nominees and other government representatives.<br><br>The facts recited in <i>Cojuangco, Jr. v. Roxas</i><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[64]</sup></font> reveal that on April 18, 1989, the annual meeting ofSMC shareholders was held. Among the matters taken up was the election of fifteen (15) members of the board of directors for the ensuing year. On such date, there were 140,849,970 shares outstanding, of which 133,224,130 shares, or 94.58%, were present at the meeting, either in person or by proxy.<br><br>Because of PCGG's ciaim that the shares of stock were under sequestration, PCGG was allowed to represent and vote 85,756,279 shares of stocks, or almost 2/3 of the actual votes cast. With PCGG voting the 85,756,279 shares or 1,286,744,185 votes, the following were elected members of the SMC Board:<br><blockquote><ol><li>Mr. Eduardo De Los Angeles</li><li>Mr. Feliciano Belmonte, Jr.</li><li>Mr. Teodoro L.

Hence, 10 out of the 15 members of the SMC Board were government-nomi ated and elected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>It would, therefore, be fair to state that the 10 men nominated and elected by the government to the SMC Board for the years 1989-1990 and 1990-1991 have actually acted to advance the interest ofthe Republic at the time that the Compromise Agreement was signed and implemented.<br><br>Without a doubt, the Republic had a hand in the transactions that eventually led to the designation of the more than 25.45 million shares as SMC treasury shares. Indeed, it is not disputed that the PCGG and, ergo, the Republic had an "influence" in the execution and eventual implementation of the Compromise Agreement through their representatives in the SMC Board.<br><br>Furthermore, neither has the PCGG ever moved for the actual execution of the Sandiganbayan's October 25, 1991 and March 18, 1992 Orders now relied upon by the Republic in claiming its renewed interest on the treasury shares. Twenty-four (24) years had elapsed and the Republic, either through the OSG or the PCGG, has not lifted even a finger to execute and enforce the said Sandiganbayan Orders. It should have filed a motion or instituted an action therefor within five·(5) or ten (10) years, as the case may be, as prescribed under the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> At the very least, the' Republic should have asked for a citation of contempt. Regrettably, the Republic did nothing.<br><br>Certainly, the PCGG and, ergo, the Republic had no interest to do so given the 5.5 million, now more than 27.5 million, shares it had accepted as "arbitration fees." Evidently, whatever will be the outcome of CC 0033-F, i.e., whether the courts grant the shares to the Republic, COCOFED, or the coconut farmers, the Republic through the PCGG was already assured of a piece of the pie.<br><br>Indeed, for all intents and purposes, it is safe to state that SMC is an innocent bystander caught betweethe conflict between the government, certain individuals, and COCOFED over the shares. There is, therefore, no reason for the Court to now resolve the incident at bar to benefit the Republic at the expense of SMC.<br><br><b>Unjust Enrichment and Estoppel bar the Republic's Motion</b><br><br>There is nothing on record that says that the government offered to return the P500 million to the SMC Group. That is to say, while the· respondent Republic is asking for the delivery and reconveyance of the 25.45 million shares, it has not intimated its intention to return the P500 million it received (through the CIIF Companies now declared as government-owned) for the same shares. The inevitable conclusion that can be made is the Republic plans to keep the P500 million along with the 25.45 million shares. Such retention and acquisition of the P500 million would, in context, amount to a flagrant and arbitrary deprivation of SMC's property in violation of the company's due process right. This act definitely trenches on the sacred Constitutional guarantee of due process.<br><br>Elementary rules against unjust enrichment,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> if not the sporting idea of fair play, forbid the Republic to retain the P500 million with the over 25.45 millibn shares it now claims. At the very least, everyone has a reasonable expectation that the Republic follow its own laws, foremost of which is the Constitution.<br><br>In sum, by keeping the P500-million first installment, approving through tht; PCGG the Compromise Agreement, and even taking and keeping an "arbitration fee," the government descended to the level of an ordinary citlizen and stripped itself of the vestiges of immunity that is otherwise available to it in the perfonnance of governmental acts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Clearly, it is now vulnerable to the application of the principle of estoppel which militates against the grant of respondent's motion.<br><br>While the general rule is that the State cannot be put in estoppel by the mistakes or errors of its officials or agents, it is established that "[t]he rule on non-estoppel of the government is not designed to perpetrate an injustice."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> :Thus, several exceptions to the Republic's non-estoppel have been recogriized. In <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>The general rule is that the State cannot be put in estoppel by the mistaks or errors of its officials or agents. However, like all general rules, this is also subject to exceptions, viz.:<br><blockquote>"Estoppel against the public are little favored. They should not be invoked except in rare and unusual circumstances and may not be invqked where they would operate to defeat the effective operation of a polity adopted to protect the public. They must be applied with circlimspection and should be applied only in those special cases where the interests of justice clearly require it. Nevertheless, the <u><b>government must not be allowed to deal dishonorably or capriciously with its citizens, and must not play an ignoble part or do a shabby thing; andi subject to limitations ..., the doctrine of equitable estoppel mall be invoked against public authorities</b></u> as well as against private individuals."<br></blockquote><br>In <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan</i>, the government, in its effort to recoveill-gotten wealth, tried to skirt the application of estoppel against it by invoking a specific constitutional provision. The Court countered:<br><br>"We agree with the statement that the State is immune from estoppel, but this concept is understood to refer to acts and mistakes of its officials especially those which are irregular (Sharp International Marketing vs. Court of Appeals, 201 SCRA 299; 306 [1991]; Republic v.

I humbly submit that it did.<br><br>The modification in the Resolution dated 4 September 2012 stemmed from that which was dated 17 September 2009, approving the conversion of the 753,848,312 SMC Common Shares registered in the name of CIIF companies to the SMC Series 1 Preferred Shares of 753,848,312. It also ordered that the preferred shares remain in <i>custodia legis,</i> and that their ownership be subject to a final ownership determination by the Court.<br><br>Notably, a thorough reading of the Resolution dated 17 September 2009 shows nowhere was there any reference to the amount "33,133,266."<br><br>What is clear, however, is the following statement in the Resolution dated 1 7 September 2009:<br><br>As records show, <b>PCGG sequestered the 753,848,312 SMC common shares registered in the name of CIIF companies on April 7, 1986.</b> From that time on, these sequestered shares became subject to the management, supervision, and control of PCGG, pursuant to Executive Order No. (EO) 1, Series of 1986, creating that commission x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>The first sentence above has for its reference <i>Republic v.

To be precise, this Court ruled:<br><br><blockquote>It appears that on March 26, 1986,<b> the Coconut Industry Investment Fund Holding Companies ("CIIF" for brevity) sold 33,133,266 shares of the outstanding capital stock of San Miguel Corporation</b> to Andres Soriano III ofthe SMC Group payable in four (4) installments.<br><br>On April 1, 1986, Andres Soriano III paid the initial P500 million to the UCPB as administrator of the CIIF. The sale was transacted through the stock exchange and the shares were registered in the name of Anscor­ Hagedom Securities, Inc. (AHSI).<br><br><b>On April 7, 1986, the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) then led by the former President of the Senate, the Honorable Jovito R.

From 1983 to November 19, 2009 when the Republic of the Philippines representing the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) filed the "Motion to Approve Sale of CIIF SMC Series I Preferred Shares," <b>the common shares of the CIIF Holding companies increased to 753,848,312</b> Class A and B SMC common shares.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br>The use of the word "increased" connotes that by the mere passage of time and appreciation of value, the former 33,133,266 shares became 753,848,312.<br><br>In fact, even the <i>ponente</i> cited<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> this portion of the Resolution dated 4 September 2012 showing that the 33,133,266 common shares in the names of the 14 CIIF companies "increased" to 753,848,312 Class A and B SMC common shares. Notably, there was no mention of any deduction involving the 25.45 million treasury shares.<br><br>It thus became a matter of concern for me when, later in the Resolution, it was ruled that the 753,848,312 SMC Series 1 Prefened Shares as reflected in the <i>fallo</i> of the Resolution dated 4 September 2012 "<b>are the only remaining shares in the name of the CIIF companies that can be, and were in fact, declared as owned by the Government,</b>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> due to the deduction of the 25.45 million SMC treasury shares and the 5.5 million shares in the form of arbitration fees for the PCGG.<br><br>If the Court made a mistake in the modification of the Resolution dated 4 September 2012, it seems the most opportune time to correct that inadvertence. The Court has always proceeded under the assumption of equivalence between the 33,133,266 common shares and the 753,848,312 SMC Series 1 Prefened Shares. If it is now apparent that there is no such equivalence, then this Court may want to revisit the modification made in the Resolution dated 4 September 2012. Our Decision dated 24 January 2012 should stand, in that the entire 33,133,266 common shares as of 1983 are declared owned by the government and, as such, are to be used only for the benefit of all coconut farmers and for the development of the coconut industry. Hence, the entire 33,133,266 common shares as of 1983 in whatever form they may now be should be ordered reconveyed to the government.<br><br><i><b>Approval of the Compromise Agreement</b></i><br><br>We note the provisions of the Compromise Agreement and Amicable Settlement <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Compromise Agreement) forged between SMC, Neptunia Corporation Limited, Andres Soriano III, and ANSCOR Hagedorn Securities, Inc.

Thus, without the fulfillment of the condition that the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Sandiganbayan be obtained, the Compromise Agreement can neither be considered effective nor the source of rights on the treasury shares as invoked by SMC.<br><br>When the Sandiganbayan Resolutions dated 25 October 1991 and 18 March 1992 were assailed in a petition for certiorari, the Court - speaking through then Associate Justice, later Chief Justice, Reynato S.

Because it is not yet known whether the sequestered shares are part of the alleged ill-gotten wealth of former President Marcos and his "cronies," any disposition concerning these shares falls within the unquestionable jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan and is subject to its approval. Furthermore, its order regarding the treasury shares is merely preservative in nature.<br><br>The Court quoted with approval the Sandiganbayan ruling with regard to the contention of the SMC Group that the latter could no longer tum over the certificates of stock for the 25.25 million sequestered shares, because they had become treasury shares.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The Sandiganbayan ruled that these sequestered shares can only become SMC's treasury shares or reacquired property if the sale between the UCPB Group and the SMC Group is allowed. Moreover, SMC cannot be deemed to have reacquired the shares, because it is only one among several buyers thereof. Even assuming that these have indeed become treasury shares, the Sandiganbayan ruled that they remain sequestered and cannot be subject to acts that would remove them from <i>custodia legis.</i><br><br>Considering the foregoing, the following pronouncementsin the Resolution appears to be not in order:<br><br><ol><li>"[T]he Compromise Agreement partook of the nature of a bonafide proprietary business transaction of the government."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br></li><li>"[T]he PCGG, the government's primary representative in sequestration proceedings, virtually gave its consent to the SMC's continuous possession of the 25.45 million shares by approving the Compromise Agreement on which SMC predicates its claim over the shares and continuing its possession ·of the so-called 'arbitration fee' shares that came out of the same Compromise Agreement."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br></li><li>"[T]he Republic had a hand in the transactions that eventually led to the designation of the more than 25.45 million shares as SMC treasury shares."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></li></ol><br>The Compromise Agreement requires the Sandiganbayan's approval for two things: (1) the consent of the PCGG and (2) the effectivity of the agreement in general. The SMC and UCPB Group needed that approval in a form that was unequivocal, and not merely implied from a lack of disapproval. Absent such approval, there is no Compromise Agreement to speak of. No rights can emanate from that transaction, because its existence depends on the fulfillment of a condition voluntarily imposed by the parties.<br><br>For the Court to require the Republic to return the P500 million to SMC at this time would be tantamount to saying that the Compromise Agreement has been disapproved by the Sandiganbayan. Again, there has been no pronouncement regarding the approval or disapproval of the Compromise Agreement. Thus, the declaration that the Republic had been unjustly enriched or was estopped from claiming ownership over the 25.45 million treasury shares may prove to be too early if not unfair.<br><br>There seems to be no basis for the Court to conclude that "the Republic plans to keep the 500 million along with the 25.45 million shares."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Likewise without apparent basis is the statement of the Court that to "resolve the incident at bar [would be] to benefit the Republic at the expense of SMC."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> These statements may be properly juxtaposed with the averment of the Republic that the present value of the shares is "17.65 billion pesos"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> had they not been reverted to the SMC treasury pursuant to the implementation of the Compromise Agreement without the imprimatur ofthe Sandiganbayan.<br><br>There should be an effort to distinguish between the government ownership of the CIIF companies and the entire CIIF block of SMC shares on the one hand and the validity of the Compromise Agreement on the other. The first has been unequivocally declared by this Court in the Decision dated 24 January 2012. The second is still pending before the Sandiganbayan. The correctness of the modification made in the Resolution dated 4 September 2012 bears heavily on the first, while the question regarding the 5.5 million shares in the form of arbitration fees for the PCGG and the 25.45 million SMC treasury shares is dependent on the second. The first is our concern at the moment; the second is not.<br><br>The Resolution has correctly stated that the issues regarding SMC's right over the 25.45 million treasury shares remain unresolved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> As such, it is not proper for the Court to declare that the 753,848,312 SMC SMC Series 1 Preferred Shares are the only ones that remained of the 33,133,266 CIIF block of SMC shares, because the 5.5 million shares in the fonn of arbitration fees for the PCGG and the 25.45 million SMC treasury shares should no longer be included therein. The appropriate course of action is to order all 33,133,266 CIIF block of SMC shares to be reconveyed to the government and then thresh out in a separate proceeding whether SMC had a right over the 25.45 million shares allegedly bought under the Compromise Agreement. This Resolution may even be utilized by SMC to invoke the principle of <i>res judicata</i> in that envisioned separate action or proceeding to be instituted by the Republic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>It is inconsistent for the Resolution to claim that "the manner of SMC's acquisition of the shares was arms-length and not made through public funds,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and yet point out that the SMC board was dominated by PCGG nominees and other gpvernment representatives at the time the Compromise Agreement was signed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> That kind of influence, as illustrated by the Resolution, negates the meaning of an anns-length transaction.<br><br>Furthermore, the circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the shares make it suspect.

On top of all of the above, SMC filed before the Sandiganbayan in Civil Case No. 0033-F a "Motion to Intervene" dated February 2, 2004 through a "Complaint-in-Intervention" of even date in which it alleged, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>2.

A judicial admission also removes an admitted fact from the field of controversy. Consequently, an admission made in the pleadings cannot be controverted by the party making such admission and are conclusive as to such party, and all proofs to the contrary or inconsistent therewith should be ignored, whether objection is interposed by the party or not. The allegations, statements or admissions contained in a pleading are conclusive as against the pleader. A party cannot subsequently take a position contrary of or inconsistent with what was pleaded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br>SMC had its chances to be heard, asked for reliefs, and as discussed above, even admitted that the treasury shares were part of the entire 33,133,266 SMC common shares that were sequestered and kept under legal custody in Civil Case No. 0033.<br><br>On this score, I must point out that in the Decision dated 24 January 2012, the Court has already made a pronouncement on the nature of the CIIF companies and the CIIF block of SMC shares as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Since the CIIF companies and the CIIF block of SMC shares were acquired using coconut levy funds - funds, which have been established to be public in character it goes without saying that these acquired corporations and assets ought to be regarded and treated as government assets. Being government properties, they are accordingly owned by the Government, for the coconut industry pursuant to currently existing laws.<br><br>It may be conceded hypothetically, as COCOFED et al. urge, that the 14 CIIF holding companies acquired the SMC shares in question using advances from the CIIF companies and from UCPB loans. But there can be no gainsaying that the same advances and UCPB loans are public in character, constituting as they do assets of the 14 holding companies, which in turn are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the 6 CIIF Oil Mills. And these oil mills were organized, capitalized and/or financed using coconut levy funds. In net effect, the CIIF block of SMC shares are simply the fruits of the coconut levy funds acquired at the expense of the coconut industry. In <i>Republic v. COCOFED</i>. the <i>en banc</i> Court, speaking through Justice (later Chief Justice) Artemio Panganiban, stated: "<i>Because the su jecl UCPB shares were acquired with government funds, the government becomes their prima facie beneficial and true owner</i>." By parity of reasoning, the adverted block of SMC shares, acquired as they were with government funds, belong to the government as, at the very least, their beneficial and true owner.<br><br>We thus affirm the decision of the Sandiganbayan on this point. But as We have earlier discussed, reiterating our holding in Republic v. COCOFED, tl:l.e States avowed policy or purpose in creating the coconut levy fund is for the development of the entire coconut industry, which is one of the major industries that promotes sustained economic stability, and not merely the livelihood of a significant segment of the population. Accordingly, We sustain the ruling of the Sandiganbayan in CC No. 0033-F that the CIIF companies and the CIIF block of SMC shares are public funds necessary owned by,the Government. We, however, modify the same in the following wise: Tnese shares shall belong to the Government, which shall be used only for the benefit of the coconut farmers and for the development of the coconut industry.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote><br>It was only because of the obstinate refusal of SMC to heed the Sandiganbayan's directives to deliver the shares, and its stark circumvention of the sequestration proceedings tht the Compromise Agreement was brazenly implemented despite the absence of the Sandiganbayan's approval. This Court cannot countenance these acts of SMC by holding it blameless and putting the Republic in estoppel through the delayed action of its agents.<br><br>I therefore vote to <b>GRANT</b> the Republic's motion.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Philippine Coconut Producers Federation, Inc. v.

When the petitioners and UCPB Group filed their Joint Manifestation of Implementation of the Compromise Agreement and of Withdrawal of Petition, the Sandiganbayan cautioned that "the PCGG, the UCPB and the SMC Group shall always act with due regard to the sequestered character of the shares of stock involved as well as the fruits thereof, more particularly to prevent the loss or dissipation of their value." The caution was wisely given in view of the many contested provisions of the Compromise Agreement. For one, the Sandiganbayan observed that the conversion of the SMC shares to treasury shares will result in a change in the status of the sequestered shares in that:<br><br><blockquote>1. When the SMC converts these common shares to treasury stock, it is converting those outstanding shares into the corporation's property for which reason treasury shares do not earn dividends.<br><br>2. The retained dividends which would have accrued to those shares if converted to treasury would go into the corporation and enhance the corporation as a whole. The enhancement to the specific sequestered shares, however, would be only to the extent aliquot in relation to all the other outstanding SMC shares.<br><br>3. By converting the 26.45 million shares of stock into treasury shares, the SMC has altered not only the voting power of those shares of stock since treasury shares do not vote, but the SMC will have actually enhanced the voting strength of the other outstanding shares of stock to the extent that these 26.45 million shares no longer vote.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> (Emphasissupplied)</blockquote><br>These Sandiganbayan Resolutions were the assailed judgments in <i>San Miguel</i>, which were eventually upheld by this Court in its September 14, 2000 Decision in G.R.

It may be used to make the record speak the truth, but not to make it speak what it did not speak but ought to have spoken. If the court has not rendered a judgment that it might or should have rendered, or if it has rendered an imperfect or improper judgment, it has no power to remedy these errors or omissions by ordering the entry <i>nunc pro tunc</i> of a proper judgment. Hence a court in entering a judgment nunc pro tunc has no power to construe what the judgment means, but only to enter of record such judgment as had been formerly rendered, but which had not been entered of record as rendered. In all cases the exercise of the power to enter judgments <i>nunc pro tunc</i> presupposes the actual rendition of a judgment, and a mere right to a judgment will not furnish the basis for such an entry.<br><br>There can be no doubt that such an entry may operate so as to save proceedings which have been had before it is made, but where no proceedings have been had and the jurisdiction of the court over the subject has been withdrawn in the meantime, a court has no power to make a <i>nunc pro tunc</i> order. If the court has omitted to make an order, which it might or ought to have made, it cannot, at a subsequent term, be made <i>nunc pro tunc</i>. According to some authorities, in all cases in which an entry nunc pro tunc is made, the record should show the facts which authorize the entry, but other courts hold that in entering an order <i>nunc pro tunc</i> the court is not confined to an examination of the judge's minutes, or written evidence, but may proceed on any satisfactory evidence, including parol testimony. In the absence of a statute or rule of court requiring it, the failure of the judge to sign the journal entries or the record does not affect the force of the order granted.<br><br>The phrase <i>nunc pro tunc</i> signifies 'now for then,' or that a thing is done now that shall have the same legal force and effect as if done at the time it ought to have been done. A court may order an act done <i>nunc pro tunc</i> when it, or some one of its immediate ministerial officers, has done some act which for some reason has not been entered of record or otherwise noted at the time the order or judgment was made or should have been made to appear on the papers or proceedings by the ministerial officer.<br><br>The object of a judgment <i>nunc pro tunc</i> is not the rendering of a new judgment and the ascertainment and determination of new rights, but is one placing in proper form on the record, the judgment that had been previously rendered, to make it speak the truth, so as to make it show what the judicial action really was, not to correct judicial errors, such as to render a judgment which the court ought to have rendered, in place of the one it did erroneously render, nor to supply nonaction by the court, however erroneous the judgment may have been.<br><br>A <i>nunc pro tunc</i> entry in practice is an entry made now of something which was actually previously done, to have effect as of the former date. Its office is not to supply omitted action by the court, but to supply an omission in the record of action really had, but omitted through inadvertence or mistake.<br><br>Except as to the rights of third parties, a judgment <i>nunc pro tunc</i> is retrospective, and has the same force and effect, to all intents and purposes, as if it had been entered at the time when the judgment was originally rendered.<br><br>It is competent for the court to make an entry <i>nunc pro tunc</i> after the term at which the transaction occurred, even though the rights of third persons may be affected. But entries <i>nunc pro tunc</i> will not be ordered except where this can be done without injustice to either party, and as a <i>nunc pro tunc</i> order is to supply on the record something which has actually occurred, it cannot supply omitted action by the court. Record entries <i>nunc pro tunc</i> can properly be made only when based on some writing in a cause which directly or by fair inference indicates the purpose of the entry so sought to be made, or on the personal knowledge and recollection of the court; but in a case where a statement of facts was filed after adjournment of the court for the term, but within the time allowed by an order not entered in the minutes on an oral motion made therefore at the trial, the court at a subsequent term was held to have jurisdiction to permit the filing of such order <i>nunc pro tunc</i> on the recollection of the judge and other parol testimony that the order had been applied for and granted during the previous term, without any memorandum or other written evidence thereof.
