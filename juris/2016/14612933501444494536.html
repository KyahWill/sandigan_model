Free Patent No. 400087 was used as basis in the issuance of OCT No. P-6903 which was transcribed in the Registration Book of the Register of Deeds of Misamis Oriental on August 4, 1970.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Section 118<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> of Commonwealth Act No. 141, otherwise known as the Public Land Act, prohibits the alienation or encumbrance of lands acquired under free patent or homestead within a period of five years from the date of issuance of the patent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> The parties, however, never raised this issue on prohibition, but this failure will not deter us from resolving the issue. We have held that:<br><blockquote>We cannot turn a blind eye on glaring misapplications of the law or patently erroneous decisions or resolutions simply because the parties failed to raise these errors before the court. Otherwise, we will be allowing injustice by reason of the mistakes of the parties' counsel and condoning reckless and negligent acts of lawyers to the prejudice of the litigants. Failure to rule on these issues amounts to an abdication of our duty to dispense justice to all parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote>We have explained the rationale behind this prohibition in <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><blockquote>The prohibition against the encumbrance—lease and mortgage included—of a homestead which, by analogy applies to a free patent, is mandated by the rationale for the grant, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>"It is well-known that the homestead laws were designed to distribute disposable agricultural lots of the State to land-destitute citizens for their home and cultivation. Pursuant to such benevolent intention the State prohibits the sale or encumbrance of the homestead (Section 116) within five years after the grant of the patent. After that five-year period the law impliedly permits alienation of the homestead; but in line with <b>the primordial purpose to favor the homesteader and his family</b> the statute provides that such alienation or conveyance (Section 117) shall be subject to the right of repurchase by the homesteader, his widow or heirs within five years. This Section 117 is undoubtedly a complement of Section 116. <b>It aims to preserve and keep in the family of the homesteader that portion of public land which the State had gratuitously given to him.</b> It would, therefore, be in keeping with this fundamental idea to hold, as we hold, that the right to repurchase exists not only when the original homesteader makes the conveyance, but also when it is made by his widow or heirs. This construction is clearly deducible from the terms of the statute."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>Under Section 124 of the Public Land Act, any acquisition, conveyance, alienation, transfer, or other contract made or executed in violation of Sections 118 to 123 of the Public Land Act shall be unlawful and null and void from its execution. The violation shall also produce the effect of annulling and cancelling the grant, title, patent or permit originally issued, recognized or confirmed actually or presumptively. The violation shall also cause the reversion of the property and its improvements to the State. The contract executed in violation of these sections being void, it is not susceptible of ratification, and the action for the declaration of the absolute nullity of such a contract is imprescriptible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>In this case, portions of Lot No. 532 were conveyed to petitioners by virtue of two Deeds of Absolute Sale executed on May 24, 1969 and June 18, 1970, or after the grant and issuance of Free Patent No. 400087<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> on May 28, 1968. Both Deeds of Absolute Sale were executed within the prohibited period of five years. Consequently, following Section 124, these Deeds are null and void and produce no effect. They did not convey any right from Spouses Bajao to petitioners on the property. The parties could not have claimed ignorance of the free patent grant. We held in <i>Beniga v. Bugas</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><blockquote>Section 118 does not exempt patentees and their purported transferees who had no knowledge of the issuance of the patent from the prohibition against alienation; for the law does not say that the five years are to be counted "from knowledge or notice of issuance" of the patent or grant. The date of the issuance of the patent is documented and is a matter of government and official record. As such, it is more reliable and precise than mere knowledge, with its inherent frailties. Indeed, the policy of the law, which is to give the patentee a place where to live with his family so that he may become a happy citizen and a useful member of our society, would be defeated were ignorance of the issuance of a patent a ground for the non-application of the prohibition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br></blockquote>Nonetheless, although Section 124 states that a violation of Section 118 causes the reversion of the property to the State, we have held that a private individual may not bring an action for reversion or any action which would have the effect of cancelling a free patent and the corresponding certificate of title issued on the basis thereof, with the result that the land covered thereby will again form part of the public domain, since only the Solicitor General or the officer acting in his stead may do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Until then, respondent, as heir of the vendors, has the better right to remain in possession of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>The rule of <i>pari delicto</i> will not apply here in view of the nullity of the contracts of sale between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> To have it otherwise would go against the public policy of preserving the grantee's right to the land under the homestead law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> In <i>Binayug v. Ugaddan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> we returned the properties which were acquired through a grant of a homestead patent to the heirs of the original owner after it was proven that the properties were alienated within the five-year prohibition period under Section 118 of the Public Land Act. Citing <i>De los Santos v. Roman Catholic Church of Midsayap, et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> we explained:<br><blockquote>In <i>De los Santos v. Roman Catholic Church of Midsayap</i>, a homestead patent covering a tract of land in Midsayap, Cotabato was granted to Julio Sarabillo (Sarabillo) on December 9, 1938. (XT No. RP-269 was issued to Sarabillo on March 17, 1939. On December 31, 1940, Sarabillo sold two hectares of land to the Roman Catholic Church of Midsayap (Church). Upon Sarabillo's death, Catalina de los Santos (De los Santos) was appointed administratrix of his estate. In the course of her administration, De los Santos discovered that Sarabillo's sale of land to the Church was in violation of Section 118 of the Public Land Act, prompting her to file an action for the annulment of said sale. The Church raised as defense Section 124 of the Public Land Act, as well as the principle of <i>pari delicto</i>. The Court, in affirming the CFI judgment favoring De los Santos, ratiocinated:<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>x x x Here [De Los Santos] desires to nullify a transaction which was done in violation of the law. Ordinarily the principle of <i>pari delicto</i> would apply to her because her predecessor-in-interest has carried out the sale with the presumed knowledge of its illegality, but <b>because the subject of the transaction is a piece of public land, public policy requires that she, as heir, be not prevented from re-acquiring it because it was given by law to her family for her home and cultivation. This is the policy on which our homestead law is predicated</b>. This right cannot be waived. "It is not within the competence of any citizen to barter away what public policy by law seeks to preserve". <b>We are, therefore, constrained to hold that [De Los Santos] can maintain the present action it being in furtherance of this fundamental aim of our homestead law.</b><br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>Jurisprudence, therefore, supports the return of the subject properties to respondents as Gerardo's heirs following the declaration that the Absolute Deed of Sale dated July 10, 1951 between Gorardo and Juan is void for being in violation of Section 118 of the Public Land Act, as amended. That the subject properties should revert to the Slate under Section 124 of the Public Land Act, as amended, is a non-issue, the State not even being a party herein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br></blockquote>With respect to the purchase price of P2,400 which petitioners paid for the land, respondent should return it with interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> We similarly ruled in the recent case of <i>Tingalan v. Spouses Melliza</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> which also involved the void sale of land covered by the Public Land Act, as amended. We applied the rule that upon annulment of the sale, the purchaser's claim is reduced to the purchase price and its interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>But, even on the assumption that there was no violation of Section 118 of the Public Land Act, the ruling of the CA that petitioners' action has already prescribed would have been correct.<br><br>Petitioners allege that respondent fraudulently included the property in TCT No. T-7133, which was issued on February 13 and October 2, 1981.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Article 1456<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> of the Civil Code provides that a person acquiring property through mistake or fraud becomes, by operation of law, a trustee of an implied trust for the benefit of the real owner of the property. An action for reconveyance based on an implied trust generally prescribes in 10 years, the reckoning point of which is the date of registration of the deed or the date of issuance of the certificate of title over the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Thus, petitioners had 10 years from 1981 or until 1991 to file their complaint for reconveyance of property.
