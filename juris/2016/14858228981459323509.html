DECISION</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BRION, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a direct recourse to this Court from the Regional Trial Court (<em>RTC</em>), Branch 58, Angeles City, through a petition for review on <em>certiorari</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court on a pure question of law. The petition seeks the reversal of the November 8, 2013 decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the RTC in SCA Case No. 12-410. In the assailed decision, the RTC declared Revenue Regulation (<em>RR</em>) No. 2-2012 unconstitutional and without force and effect. <p align="center"><b><u>The Facts</u></b> </p><p> In response to reports of smuggling of petroleum and petroleum products and to ensure the correct taxes are paid and collected, petitioner Secretary of Finance Cesar V. Purisima - pursuant to his authority to interpret tax laws<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and upon the recommendation of petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (<em>CIR</em>) Kim S. Jacinto-Henares signed RR 2-2012 on February 17, 2012. </p><p>The RR requires the payment of value-added tax (<em>VAT</em>) and excise tax on the importation of all petroleum and petroleum products coming directly from abroad and brought into the Philippines, <u>including Freeport and economic zones (<i>FEZs</i>)</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> It then allows the credit or refund of any VAT or excise tax paid<em> if the taxpayer proves</em> that the petroleum previously brought in has been sold to a duly registered FEZ locator and used pursuant to the registered activity of such locator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p> In other words, an FEZ locator must first pay the required taxes upon entry into the FEZ of a petroleum product, and must thereafter prove the use of the petroleum product for the locator's registered activity in order to secure a credit for the taxes paid. </p><p>On March 7, 2012, Carmelo F. Lazatin, in his capacity as Pampanga First District Representative, filed a petition for prohibition and injunction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> against the petitioners to annul and set aside RR 2-2012. </p><p>Lazatin posits that Republic Act No. (RA) 9400<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> treats the Clark Special Economic Zone and Clark Freeport Zone (together hereinafter referred to as <em>Clark FEZ</em>) as a separate customs territory and allows tax and duty-free importations of raw materials, capital and equipment into the zone. Thus, the imposition of VAT and excise tax, even on the importation of petroleum products into FEZs (like <em>Clark FEZ</em>), directly contravenes the law. </p><p>The respondent Ecozone Plastic Enterprises Corporation <em>(EPEC</em>) sought to intervene in the proceedings as a co-petitioner and accordingly entered its appearance and moved for leave of court to file its petition-in-intervention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p>EPEC claims that, as a Clark FEZ locator, it stands to suffer when RR 2-2012 is implemented. EPEC insists that RR 2-2012's mechanism of requiring even locators to pay the tax first and to subsequently claim a credit or to refund the taxes paid effectively removes the locators' tax-exempt status. </p><p> The RTC initially issued a temporary restraining order to stay the implementation of RR 2-2012. It eventually issued a writ of preliminary injunction in its order dated April 4, 2012. </p><p>The petitioners questioned the issuance of the writ. On May 17, 2012, they filed a petition for <em>certiorari</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> before the Court of Appeals (CA) assailing the RTC's order. The CA granted the petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and denied the respondents' subsequent motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> The respondents stood their ground by filing a petition for review on<em> certiorari</em> before this Court (G.R. No. 208387) to reinstate the RTC's injunction against the implementation of RR 2-2012, and by moving for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction. We denied the motion but nevertheless required the petitioners to comment on the petition. </p><p> The proceedings before the RTC in the meanwhile continued. On April 18, 2012, petitioner Lazatin amended his original petition, converting it to a petition for declaratory relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The RTC admitted the amended petition and allowed EPEC to intervene.</p><p> In its decision dated November 8, 2013, the RTC ruled in favor of Lazatin and EPEC.</p><p> <em>First</em>, on the procedural aspect, the RTC held that the original petition's amendment is allowed by the rules and that amendments are largely preferred; it allowed the amendment in the exercise of its sound judicial discretion to avoid multiplicity of suits and to give the parties an opportunity to thresh out the issues and finally reach a conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p><em>Second</em>, the RTC held that Lazatin and EPEC had legal standing to question the validity of RR 2-2012. Lazatin's allegation that RR 2-2012 effectively amends and modifies RA 9400 gave him standing as a legislator: the amendment of a tax law is a power that belongs exclusively to Congress. Lazatin's allegation, according to the RTC, sufficiently shows how his rights, privileges, and prerogatives as a member of Congress were impaired by the issuance of RR 2-2012. </p><p> The RTC also ruled that the case warrants a relaxation on the rules on legal standing because the issues touched upon are of transcendental importance. The trial court considered the encompassing effect that RR 2-2012 may have in the numerous freeport and economic zones in the Philippines, as well as its potential impact on hundreds of investors operating within the zones. </p><p> The RTC then held that even if Lazatin does not have legal standing, EPEC's intervention cured this defect: EPEC, as a locator within the Clark FEZ, would be adversely affected by the implementation of RR 2-2012. </p><p><em>Finally</em>, the RTC declared RR 2-2012 unconstitutional. RR 2-2012 violates RA 9400 because it imposes taxes that, by law, are not due in the first place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Since RA 9400 clearly grants tax and duty-free incentives to Clark FEZ locators, a revocation of these incentives by an RR directly contravenes the express intent of the Legislature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> In effect, the petitioners encroached upon the prerogative to enact, amend, or repeal laws, which the Constitution exclusively granted to Congress. </p><p align="center"> <b><u>The Petition</u></b> </p><p>The petitioners anchor their present petition on two arguments: 1) respondents have <i>no legal standing</i>, and 2) RR 2-2012 is <i>valid and constitutional</i>. </p><p>The petitioners submit that the Lazatin and EPEC do not have legal standing to assail the validity of RR 2-2012. </p><p><i>First</i>, the petitioners claim that Lazatin does not have the requisite legal standing as he failed to exactly show how the implementation of RR 2- 2012 would impair the exercise his official functions. Respondent Lazatin merely generally alleged that his constitutional prerogatives to pass or amend laws were gravely impaired or were about to be impaired by the issuance of RR 2-2012. He did not specify the power that he, as a legislator, would be encroached upon. </p><p>While the Clark FEZ is within the district that respondent Lazatin represents, the petitioners emphasize that Lazatin failed to show that he is authorized to file a case on behalf of the locators in the FEZ, the local government unit, or his constituents in general.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> To the petitioners, if RR 2- 2012 ever caused injury to the locators or to any of Lazatin's constituents, only these injured parties possess the personality to question the petitioners' actions; respondent Lazatin cannot claim this right on their behalf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> </p><p>The petitioners claim, too, that the RTC should not have brushed aside the rules on standing on account of transcendental importance. To them, this case does not involve public funds, only a speculative loss of profits upon the implementation of RR 2-2012; nor is Lazatin a party with more direct and specific interest to raise the issues in his petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Citing <i>Senate v. Ermita</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the petitioners argue that the rules on standing cannot be relaxed. </p><p><i>Second</i>, petitioners also argue that EPEC does not have legal standing to intervene. That EPEC will ultimately bear the VAT and excise tax as an end-user, is misguided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The burden of payment of VAT and excise tax may be shifted to the buyer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and this burden, from the point of view of the transferee is no longer a tax but merely a component of the cost of goods purchased. The statutory liability for the tax remains with the seller. Thus, EPEC cannot say that when the burden is passed on to it, RR 2-2012 effectively imposes tax on it as a Clark FEZ locator. </p><p> The petitioners point out that RR 2-2012 imposes an "advance tax" only upon importers of petroleum products. If EPEC is indeed a locator, then it enjoys tax and duty exemptions granted by RA 9400 so long as it does not bring the petroleum or petroleum products to the Philippine customs territory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p> The petitioners legally argue that RR 2-2012 is valid and constitutional. </p><p><em>First</em>, petitioner submit that RR 2-2012's issuance and implementation are within their powers to undertake.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> RR 2-2012 is an administrative issuance that enjoys the presumption of validity in the manner that statutes enjoy this presumption; thus, it cannot be nullified without clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> </p><p> <em>Second</em>, petitioners contend that while RA 9400 does grant tax and customs duty incentives to Clark FEZ locators, there are conditions before these benefits may be availed of. The locators cannot invoke outright exemption from VAT and excise tax on its importations without first satisfying the conditions set by RA 9400, that is, the importation must not be removed from the FEZ and introduced into the Philippine customs territory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p> These locators enjoy what petitioners call a <em>qualified tax exemption</em>. They must first pay the corresponding taxes on its imported petroleum. Then, they must submit the documents required under RR 2-2012. If they have sufficiently shown that the imported products have not been removed from the FEZ, their earlier payment shall be subject to a refund.</p><p> The petitioners lastly argue that RR 2-2012 does not withdraw the locators' tax exemption privilege. The regulation simply requires proof that a locator has complied with the conditions for tax exemption. If the locator cannot show that the goods were retained and/or consumed within the FEZ, such failure creates the presumption that the goods have been introduced into the customs territory without the appropriate permits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> On the other hand, if they have duly proven the disposition of the goods within the FEZ, their "advance payment" is subject to a refund. Thus, to the petitioners, to the extent that a refund is allowable, there is in reality a tax exemption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b><u>Counter-arguments</u></b> </p><p> Respondents Lazatin and EPEC, maintaining that they have standing to question its validity, insist that RR 2-2012 is unconstitutional. </p><p><i>Respondents have standing as<br> lawmaker and FEZ locator.</i> </p><p>The respondents argue that a member of Congress has standing to protect the prerogatives, powers, and privileges vested by the Constitution in his office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> As a member of Congress, his standing to question executive issuances that infringe on the right of Congress to enact, amend, or repeal laws has already been recognized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> He suffers substantial injury whenever the executive oversteps and intrudes into his power as a lawmaker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p><p>On the other hand, the respondents point out that RR 2-2012 explicitly covers FEZs. Thus, being a Clark FEZ locator, EPEC is among the many businesses that would have been directly affected by its implementation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> </p><p> <i>RR 2-2012 illegally imposes taxes <br> on Clark FEZs.</i> </p><p>The respondents underscore that RA 9400 provides FEZ locators certain incentives, such as tax- and duty-free importations of raw materials and capital equipment. These provisions of the law must be interpreted in a way that will give full effect to law's policy and objective, which is to maximize the benefits derived from the FEZs in promoting economic and social development.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p>They admit that the law subjects to taxes and duties the goods that were brought into the FEZ and subsequently introduced to the Philippine customs territory. However, contrary to petitioners' position that locators' tax and duty exemptions are <em>qualified</em>, their incentives apply <em>automatically</em>. </p><p> According to the respondents, petitioners' interpretation of the law contravenes the policy laid down by RA 9400, because it makes the incentives subject to a suspensive condition. They claim that the condition â the removal of the goods from the FEZ and their subsequent introduction to the customs territory â is resolutory; locators enjoy the granted incentives<em> upon bringing the goods into the FEZ</em>. It is only <em>when the goods are shown to have been brought into the customs territory</em> will the proper taxes and duties have to be paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> RR 2-2012 reverses this process by requiring the locators to pay "advance" taxes and duties first and to subsequently prove that they are entitled to a refund, thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> RR 2-2012 indeed allows a refund, but a refund of taxes that were not due in the first place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p><p> The respondents add that even the refund mechanism under RR 2-2012 is problematic. They claim that RR 2-2012 only allows a refund when the petroleum products brought into the FEZ are subsequently<em> sold</em> to FEZ locators or to entities that similarly enjoy exemption from direct and indirect taxes. The issuance does not envision a situation where the petroleum products are directly brought into the FEZ and are <em>consumed </em>by the same entity/locator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Further, the refund process takes a considerable length of time to secure, thus requiring cash outlay on the part of locators;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> even when the claim for refund is granted, the refund will not be in cash, but in the form of a Tax Credit Certificate (TCC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p><p> As the challenged regulation directly contravenes incentives legitimately granted by a legislative act, the respondents argue that in issuing RR 2-2012, the petitioners not only encroached upon congressional prerogatives and arrogated powers unto themselves; they also effectively violated, brushed aside, and rendered nugatory the rigorous process required in enacting or amending laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p><p align="center"> <b><u>Issues</u></b> </p><p>We shall decide the following issues: </p><ol start="" type="I"><li> Whether respondents Lazatin and EPEC have legal standing to bring the action of declaratory relief; and<br><br> </li><li>Whether RR 2-2012 is valid and constitutional. </li></ol> <p align="center"><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b> </p><p> We do not find the petition meritorious. </p><table width="30%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="7%"><strong>I.</strong></td> <td width="88%"><strong>Respondents have legal standing to file petition for declaratory relief. </strong></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The party seeking declaratory relief must have a<em> legal interest</em> in the controversy for the action to prosper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> This interest must be material not merely incidental. It must be an interest that which will be affected by the challenged decree, law or regulation. It must be a present substantial interest, as opposed to a mere expectancy or a future, contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p> Moreover, in case the petition for declaratory relief specifically involves a question of constitutionality, the courts will not assume jurisdiction over the case unless the person challenging the validity of the act possesses the requisite<em> legal standing</em> to pose the challenge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p><p> <em>Locus standi </em>is a personal and substantial interest in a case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the challenged governmental act. The question is whether the challenging party alleges such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy so as to assure the existence of concrete adverseness that would sharpen the presentation of issues and illuminate the court in ruling on the constitutional question posed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> We rule that the respondents satisfy these standards.</p><p><i>Lazatin has legal standing as<br> a legislator.</i> </p><p> Lazatin filed the petition for declaratory relief before the RTC in his capacity as a member of Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> He alleged that RR 2-2012 was issued directly contravening RA 9400, a legislative enactment. Thus, the regulation encroached upon the Congress' exclusive power to enact, amend, or repeal laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> According to Lazatin, a member of Congress has standing to challenge the validity of an executive issuance if it tends to impair his prerogatives as a legislator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></p><p> We agree with Lazatin.</p><p> In<em> Biraogo v. The Philippine Truth Commission</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> we ruled that legislators have the legal standing to ensure that the prerogatives, powers, and privileges vested by the Constitution in their office remain inviolate. To this end, members of Congress are allowed to question the validity of any official action that infringes on their prerogatives as legislators.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> </p><p> Thus, members of Congress possess the legal standing to question acts that amount to a usurpation of the legislative power of Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Legislative power is exclusively vested in the Legislature. When the implementing rules and regulations issued by the Executive contradict or add to what Congress has provided by legislation, the issuance of these rules amounts to an undue exercise of legislative power and an encroachment of Congress' prerogatives. </p><p> To the same extent that the Legislature cannot surrender or abdicate its legislative power without violating the Constitution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> so also is a constitutional violation committed when rules and regulations implementing legislative enactments are contrary to existing statutes. No law can be amended by a mere administrative rule issued for its implementation; administrative or executive acts are invalid if they contravene the laws or to the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </p><p> Thus, the allegation that RR. 2-2012 â an executive issuance purporting to implement the provisions of the Tax Code â directly contravenes RA 9400 clothes a member of Congress with legal standing to question the issuance to prevent undue encroachment of legislative power by the executive.</p><p> <i>EPEC has legal standing as a <br> Clark FEZ locator.</i> </p><p> EPEC intervened in the proceedings before the RTC based on the allegation that, as a Clark FEZ locator, it will be directly affected by the implementation of RR 2-2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> </p><p> We agree with EPEC. </p><p> It is not disputed that RR 2-2012 relates to the imposition of VAT and excise tax and applies to all petroleum and petroleum products that are imported directly from abroad to the Philippines, <b>including FEZs</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p> As an enterprise located in the Clark FEZ, its importations of petroleum and petroleum products will be directly affected by RR 2-2012. Thus, its interest in the subject matter â a personal and substantial one â gives it legal standing to question the issuance's validity. </p><p> In sum, the respondents' respective interests in this case are sufficiently substantial to be directly affected by the implementation of RR 2-2012. The RTC therefore did not err when it gave due course to Lazatin's petition for declaratory relief as well as PEC's petition-in-intervention. </p><p> In light of this ruling, we see no need to rule on the claimed transcendental importance of the issues raised. </p><table width="30%" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="7%"><strong>II.</strong></td> <td width="93%"><strong> RR 2-2012 is invalid and unconstitutional. </strong></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>On the merits of the case, we rule that RR 2-2012 is invalid and unconstitutional because: a) it illegally imposes taxes upon FEZ enterprises, which, by law, enjoy tax-exempt status, and b) it effectively amends the law (i.e., RA 7227, as amended by RA 9400) and thereby encroaches upon the legislative authority reserved exclusively by the Constitution for Congress. </p><p><em>FEZ enterprises enjoy tax- and <br> duty-free incentives on its<br> importations. </em> </p><p> In 1992, Congress enacted RA 7227 otherwise known as the "Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992" to enhance the benefits to be derived from the Subic and Clark military reservations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> RA 7227 established the Subic Special economic zone and granted such special territory various tax and duty incentives. </p><p> To effectively extend the same benefits enjoyed in Subic to the Clark FEZ, the legislature enacted RA 9400 to amend RA 7227.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Subsequently, the Department of Finance issued Department Order No. 3-2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> to implement RA 9400 (<em>Implementing Rules</em>). </p><p> Under RA 9400 and its Implementing Rules, Clark FEZ is considered a customs territory<em> separate</em> and distinct from the Philippines customs territory. Thus, as opposed to<em> importations</em> into and<em> establishments </em>in the Philippines customs territory,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> which are fully subject to Philippine customs and tax laws, <em>importations</em> into and <em>establishments</em> located within the Clark FEZ (<em>FEZ Enterprises</em>)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> enjoy special incentives, including tax and duty-free importation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> More specifically, Clark FEZ enterprises shall be entitled to the freeport status of the zone and a <em>5% preferential income tax rate</em> on its gross income, in lieu of national and local taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><p> RA 9400 and its Implementing Rules grant the following:</p><p> <em>First</em>, the law provides that<em> importations of raw materials and capital equipment </em>into the FEZs shall be<em> tax- and duty-free</em>. It is the<em> specific transaction</em> (i.e., importation) that is exempt from taxes and duties. </p><p> <em>Second</em>, the law also grants <em>FEZ enterprises tax- and duty-free importation</em> and a preferential rate in the payment of income tax, in lieu of all national and local taxes. These incentives exempt the<em> establishment</em> itself from taxation. </p><p> Thus, the Legislature intended FEZs to enjoy tax incentives in general â whether with respect to the<em> transactions</em> that take place within its special jurisdiction, or the <em>persons/establishments</em> within the jurisdiction. From this perspective, the tax incentives enjoyed by <em>FEZ enterprises </em>must be understood to <em>necessarily include</em> the tax exemption of<em> importations of selected articles</em> into the FEZ.</p><p> We have ruled in the past that FEZ enterprises' tax exemptions must be interpreted within the context and in a manner that promotes the legislative intent of RA 7227<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> and, by extension, RA 9400. Thus, we recognized that<em> FEZ enterprises are exempt from both direct and indirect internal revenue taxes</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> In particular, they are considered <em>VAT-exempt entities</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></p><p> In line with this comprehensive interpretation, we rule that<em> the tax exemption enjoyed by FEZ enterprises covers internal revenue taxes imposed on goods brought into the FEZ, including the Clark FEZ, such as VAT and excise tax</em>. </p><p> <i>RR 2-2012 illegally imposes VAT and excise<br> tax on goods brought into the FEZs.</i> </p><p>Section 3 of RR 2-2012 provides the following: </p><p> <em>First</em>, whenever petroleum and petroleum products are<em> imported</em> and/or <em>brought directly</em> to the Philippines, the<em> importer </em>of these goods is required to pay the corresponding <strong>VAT</strong> and <strong>excise tax </strong>due on the importation. </p><p><em>Second</em>, the importer, as the payor of the taxes, may subsequently seek a <em>refund</em> of the amount previously paid by filing a corresponding claim with the Bureau of Customs (<em>BOC</em>). </p><p><em>Third</em>, the claim shall only be granted upon showing that the<strong> necessary condition </strong>has been fulfilled. </p><p>At first glance, this imposition â a mere tax administration measure according to the petitioners â appears to be consistent with the taxation of similar imported articles under the Tax Code, specifically under its Sections 107<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> and 148<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> (in relation with Sections 129<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and 131<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup>) . </p><p> However, RR 2-2012 <em>explicitly covers even petroleum and petroleum products imported and/or brought into the various FEZs in the Philippines</em>. Hence, when an FEZ enterprise brings petroleum and petroleum products into the FEZ, under RR 2-2012, it shall be considered an importer liable for the taxes due on these products. </p><p> The crux of the controversy can be found in this feature of the challenged regulation. </p><p> The petitioners assert that RR 2-2012 simply implements the provisions of the Tax Code on collection of internal revenue taxes, more specifically VAT and excise tax, on the importation of petroleum and petroleum products. To them, FEZ enterprises enjoy a <em>qualified tax exemption</em> such that they have to pay the tax due on the importation first, and thereafter claim a refund, which shall be allowed only upon showing that the goods were not introduced to the Philippine customs territory. </p><p>On the other hand, the respondents contend that RR 2-2012 imposes taxes on FEZ enterprises, which in the first place are not liable for taxes. They emphasize that the tax incentives under RA 9400 apply <em>automatically</em> upon the importation of the goods. The proper taxes on the importation shall only be due if the enterprises can later show that the goods were subsequently introduced to the Philippine customs territory. </p><p>Since the tax exemptions enjoyed by FEZ enterprises under the law extend even to VAT and excise tax, as we discussed above, it follows and we accordingly rule that <em>the taxes imposed by Section 3 of RR 2-2012 directly contravene these exemptions.</em> <em><strong>First</strong></em>, the regulation erroneously considers petroleum and petroleum products brought into a FEZ as taxable importations. <em><strong>Second</strong></em>, it unreasonably burdens FEZ enterprises by making them pay the corresponding taxes â an obligation from which the law specifically exempts them â even if there is a subsequent opportunity to refund the payments made. </p><p><em>Petroleum and petroleum products brought<br> into the FEZ and <strong>which remain therein</strong> are </em> </p><p><em>not taxable importations. </em> </p><p> RR 2-2012 clearly imposes VAT and excise tax on the importation of petroleum and petroleum products into FEZs. S<em>trictly speaking, however, articles brought into these FEZs are not taxable importations under the law</em> based on the following considerations: </p><p> <em>First, importation</em> refers to bringing goods from abroad<em> into the Philippine customs jurisdiction</em>. It begins from the time the goods enter the Philippine jurisdiction and is deemed terminated when the applicable taxes and duties have been paid or the goods <em>have left the jurisdiction of the BOC</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p><p><em>Second</em>, under the Tax Code,<em> imported goods</em> are subject to VAT and excise tax. These taxes shall be paid prior to the release of the goods from <em>customs custody</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Also, for VAT purposes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> an<em> importer</em> refers to any person who brings goods<em> into the Philippines</em>. </p><p> <em>Third</em>, the Philippine VAT system adheres to the <em>cross border doctrine</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Under this rule, no VAT shall be imposed to form part of the cost of the goods destined for consumption <strong>outside the Philippine customs territory</strong>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Thus, we have already ruled before that an FEZ enterprise cannot be <em>directly</em> charged for the VAT on its sales, nor can VAT be passed on to them<em> indirectly</em> as added cost to their purchases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> </p><p> <em>Fourth</em>, laws such as RA 7227, RA 7916, and RA 9400 have established certain special areas as<em> separate customs territories</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> In this regard, we have already held that such jurisdictions, such as the Clark FEZ, are, by legal fiction,<em> foreign territories</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> </p><p> <em>Fifth</em>, the Implementing Rules provides that goods<em> initially introduced</em> into the FEZs and <em>subsequently brought out </em>therefrom and introduced into the Philippine customs territory shall be considered as<em> importations</em> and thereby subject to the VAT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> One such instance is the sale by any FEZ enterprise to a customer located in the customs territory, which the VAT regulations refer to as a<em> technical importation</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> </p><p>We find it clear from all these that when goods (<em>e.g</em>., petroleum and petroleum products) are brought into an FEZ, <em>the goods remain to be in foreign territory</em> and are not therefore goods introduced into Philippine customs territory subject to Philippine customs and tax laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> </p><p>Stated differently, goods brought into and traded within an FEZ are generally beyond the reach of national internal revenue taxes and customs duties enforced in the Philippine customs territory. This is consistent with the incentive granted to FEZs exempting the <em>importation itself </em>from taxes and duties. </p><p> <em>Therefore, the act of bringing the goods into an FEZ is not a taxable importation. As long as the goods remain (e.g., sale and/or consumption of the article within the FEZ) in the FEZ or re-exported to another foreign jurisdiction, they shall continue to be tax-free</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> However, once the goods are introduced into the Philippine customs territory, it ceases to enjoy the tax privileges accorded to FEZs. It shall then be considered as an <em>importation</em> subject to all applicable national internal revenue taxes and customs duties.</p><p> <i>The tax exemption granted to FEZ <br> enterprises is an immunity from tax liability<br> <b> and </b>from the payment of the tax.</i> </p><p> The respondents claim that when RR 2-2012 was issued, petroleum and petroleum products brought into the FEZ by FEZ enterprises suddenly became subject to VAT and excise tax, in direct contravention of RA 9400 (with respect to Clark FEZ enterprises). Such imposition is not authorized under any law, including the Tax Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> </p><p> On the other hand, the petitioners argue that RR 2-2012 does not withdraw the tax exemption privileges of FEZ enterprises. As their tax exemption is merely <em>qualified</em>, they cannot invoke outright exemption. Thus, FEZ enterprises are required to pay internal revenue taxes first on their imported petroleum under RR 2-2012. They may then refund their previous payment upon showing that the condition under RA 9400 has been satisfied â that is, the goods have not been introduced to the Philippines customs territory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> To the petitioners, to the extent that a refund is allowable, there is still in reality a tax exemption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> </p><p> We disagree with this contention. </p><p> <em>First</em>, FEZ enterprises bringing goods into the FEZ should not be considered as<em> importers</em> subject to tax in the same manner that the very act of bringing goods into these special territories does not make them<em> taxable importations</em>. We emphasize that the exemption from taxes and duties under RA 9400 are granted not only to <em>importations </em>into the FEZ, but also specifically to each FEZ enterprise. As discussed, the tax exemption enjoyed by <em>FEZ enterprises</em> necessarily includes the tax exemption of the <em>importations of selected articles</em> into the FEZ. </p><p> <em>Second</em>, the essence of a tax exemption is the<em> immunity</em> or<em> freedom</em> from a charge or burden to which others are subjected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> It is a waiver of the government's right to collect<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> the amounts that would have been collectible under our tax laws. <em>Thus, when the law speaks of a tax exemption, it should be understood as freedom from the imposition and payment of a particular tax.</em> </p><p> Based on this premise, we rule that the<em> refund mechanism provided by</em> <i>RR 2-2012 does not amount to a tax exemption</i>. Even if the possibility of a subsequent refund exists, the fact remains that FEZ enterprises must still spend money and other resources to pay for something they should be immune to in the first place. This completely contradicts the essence of their tax exemption.</p><p> In the same vein, we cannot agree with the view that FEZ enterprises have the duty to prove their entitlement to tax exemption first before fully enjoying the same; we find it illogical to determine whether a person is exempted from tax without first determining if he is subject to the tax being imposed. We have reminded the tax authorities to determine first if a person is liable for a particular tax, applying the rule of strict interpretation of tax laws, before asking him to prove his exemption therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Indeed, as entities exempted on taxes on importations, FEZ enterprises are clearly beyond the coverage of any law imposing those very charges. There is no justifiable reason to require them to prove that they are exempted from it.</p><p> More importantly, we have also recognized that the exemption from local and national taxes granted under RA 7227, as amended by RA 9400, are <em>ipso facto</em> accorded to FEZs. In case of doubt, conflicts with respect to such tax exemption privilege shall be resolved in favor of these special territories.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></p><p><em> RR 2-2012 is unconstitutional. </em> </p><p>According to the respondents, the power to enact, amend, or repeal laws belong exclusively to Congress.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> In passing RR 2-2012, petitioners illegally amended the law â a power solely vested on the Legislature. </p><p> We agree with the respondents. </p><p> The power of the petitioners to interpret tax laws is not absolute. The rule is that regulations may not enlarge, alter, restrict, or otherwise go beyond the provisions of the law they administer; administrators and implementors cannot engraft additional requirements not contemplated by the legislature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> </p><p> It is worthy to note that RR 2-2012 does not even refer to a specific Tax Code provision it wishes to implement. <em>While it purportedly establishes mere administration measures for the collection of VAT and excise tax on the importation of petroleum and petroleum products, not once did it mention the pertinent chapters of the Tax Code on VAT and excise tax. </em> </p><p>While we recognize petitioners' essential rationale in issuing RR 2-2012, the procedures proposed by the issuance cannot be implemented at the expense of entities that have been clearly granted statutory tax immunity. </p><p> Tax exemptions are granted for specific public interests that the Legislature considers sufficient to offset the monetary loss in the grant of exemptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> To limit the tax-free importation privilege of FEZ enterprises by requiring them to pay subject to a refund clearly runs counter to the Legislature's intent to create a free port where the "free flow of goods or capital within, into, and out of the zones" is ensured.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> </p><p> Finally, the State's inherent power to tax is vested exclusively in the Legislature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> We have since ruled that the power to tax includes the power to grant tax exemptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Thus, the imposition of taxes, as well as the grant and withdrawal of tax exemptions, shall only be valid pursuant to a legislative enactment. </p><p> As RR 2-2012, an executive issuance, attempts to withdraw the tax incentives clearly accorded by the legislative to FEZ enterprises, the <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup>petitioners have arrogated upon themselves a power reserved exclusively to Congress, in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. </p><p> In these lights, we hereby rule and declare that RR 2-2012 is null and void. </p><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, we hereby <strong>DISMISS</strong> the petition for lack of merit, and accordingly <strong>AFFIRM</strong> decision of the Regional Trial Court dated November 8, 2013 2001 in SCA Case No. 12-410. </p><p><strong>SO ORDERED. </strong> </p><p><em>Sereno, C.J., Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Peralta, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Perez, Mendoza, Reyes, Perlas-Bernabe, Leonen,</em> and<em> Caguioa, JJ.,</em> concur.<br> <em>Jardeleza,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> J.,</em> no part. <br><br></p><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="noshade" align="center"> <p align="right"><strong> </strong></p> <p align="center"> <b>NOTICE OF JUDGMENT</b> </p> <p> Sirs/Mesdames: </p> <p>Please take notice that on <u>November 29, 2016</u> a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Decision</span>/Resolution, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on January 6, 2017 at 10:55 a.m.</p> <table width="100%" border="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="62%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="38%"><p align="center">Very truly yours, </p> <p align="center"> <strong>(SGD) FELIPA G.

In any event, the possessor of petroleum or petroleum products must be able to present sufficient evidence that the excise taxes due thereon have been paid, otherwise the excise taxes due on said goods shall be collected from said possessor/user. </p><p> In case of sale/introduction of petroleum and petroleum products, or part of the volume thereof, by a Freeport/Economic zone registered enterprise, or part/volume thereof, into the customs territory or to a Freeport/Economic zone registered enterprise not enjoying tax privileges, or any sale to an entity not enjoying 0% VAT rate, the seller shall be liable for 12% VAT. In this instance, no refund for VAT shall be allowed the importer or an assessment for VAT shall be issued to the said importer, if the refund has already been granted, and another assessment for VAT shall be made against the seller. </p><p> For each and every importation of petroleum and petroleum products, the importer thereof shall secure the prescribed ATRIG from the SIR's Excise Tax Regulatory Division (ETRD), and pay the Value-Added and excise taxes, as computed, before the release thereof from the BOC's custody. In case of subsequent sale/introduction to customs territory by a Freeport/Economic zone-registered enterprise of petroleum and petroleum products, the importer shall secure the necessary Withdrawal Certificate. </p><p> For excise tax purposes, all importers of petroleum and petroleum products shall secure a Permit to Operate with the BIR's ETRD.
