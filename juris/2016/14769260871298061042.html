Helen assured the female undercover that their marriage process could be hurried.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> She also claimed that it was possible for the marriage to be solemnized the next day, but the marriage certificate would only be dated when the marriage license became available.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Court Administrator found that the respondent judges in that case connived with the court personnel, who acted as "fixers" in solemnizing marriages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The judges heedlessly kept solemnizing marriages despite irregularities in the requirements provided under the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution dated July 10, 2007, this Court treated the judicial audit team's memorandum as an administrative complaint against the respondent judges, including Tormis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The judges were directed to file their comments on the charges against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> They were also suspended pending resolution of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On August 24, 2007, Senior Deputy Court Administrator Zenaida N.

The team reported that out of the 643 marriage certificates examined, 280 marriages were solemnized under Article 34 of the Family Code. The logbooks of the MTCC Branches indicate a higher number of solemnized marriages than the number of marriage certificates in the courts' custody. There is also an unusual number of marriage licenses obtained from the local civil registrars of the towns of Barili and Liloan, Cebu. There were even marriages solemnized at 9 a.m. with marriage licenses obtained on the same day. The town of Barili, Cebu is more than sixty (60) kilometers away from Cebu City and entails a travel time of almost two (2) hours. Liloan, Cebu, on the other hand, is more than ten (10) kilometers away from Cebu City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The Report included the court employees' admissions of their participation in the alleged misdeeds.

Tormis</i></b><br><br>Judge Tormis solemnized a total of one hundred eighty-one (181) marriages from 2003 to 2007 based on the marriage certificates actually examined. However, the monthly report of cases showed that she solemnized three hundred five (305) marriages instead for the years 2004 to 2007. The OCA report also noted that it was only in July 2007 that her court started to use a logbook to keep track of marriages.<br><br>Respondent judge solemnized thirty-seven (37) marriages with incomplete or missing documents such as the marriage license, certificate of legal capacity to marry, and the joint affidavit of cohabitation. In several instances, only affidavits were submitted by the foreign parties in lieu of the certificate of legal capacity to marry.<br><br>Judge Tormis solemnized thirteen (13) marriages despite the questionable character of the validity of the required documents particularly the marriage license. The judicial audit team found numerous erasures and superimpositions on entries with regard to the parties' place of residence. In one instance, the judge solemnized the marriage of Rex Randy E. Cujardo and Anselma B. Laranio on 28 December 2006 despite the marriage license containing a rubberstamp mark saying, "THIS LICENSE EXPIRES ON" and a handwritten note saying "12/28/06" under it.<br><br><br>The judge solemnized a total of forty-seven (47) marriages under Article 34 of the Family Code wherein the marriage requirements' authenticity was doubtful due to the circumstances of the cohabitation of the parties and the given address of the parties. These irregularities were evident in the case of 22-year-old John Rey R. Tibalan and Ana Liza Secuya who were married on 25 May 2007. The residential address of the couple in the marriage certificate is "Sitio Bamboo, Buhisan, Cebu City." Flowever, there was an application for marriage license attached to the marriage certificate showing that Secuya's address is "F. Lopez Comp. Morga St., Cebu City."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court ruled that:<br><blockquote><ol start="3"><li><b>Judge Rosabella M.

During the scheduled hearing, the representative from OCA manifested that they are presenting two (2) witnesses in the persons of Celerina Plaza and Crisanto Dela Cerna. The purposes of their testimonies are for them to substantiate the allegations against former Judge Tormis, identify and authenticate the existence and veracity of their respective affidavits submitted to the Court. However, the two witnesses failed to appear during the proceedings of this case. Thus, their affidavits are considered hearsay and inadmissible in evidence . . . in this proceeding. The affidavit are [sic] not entirely reliable evidence in court due to their incompleteness and inaccuracies that may have attended in their formulation. The affidavit does not purport to contain a complete narration of facts and that court testimonies are generally viewed as more reliable as they are subjected to cross examination from the opposing party. . . . Likewise, Atty. Rullyn Garcia, the OCA audit team head, failed to appear. The purpose of his testimony would be to shed light more on whether the alleged affidavits executed by Celerina Plaza and Crisanto Dela Cema were actually and voluntarily submitted to the Court and, if so, who required them to execute and submit the same to the Court.<br><br>. . . .<br><br>The determination of the merit of th[ese] disbarment proceedings may not be relied upon solely on the premise of the dismissal from the service of former Judge Tormis. As earlier discussed, the grounds for dismissal from the service of former Judge Tormis, in her capacity as presiding judge, in administrative matter is different from this disbarment proceedings against her. Otherwise, the Court would have ruled on the disbarment aspect, which shall be incorporated in the decision of dismissal from the service of former Judge Tormis in one decision only. As provided for under the constitutional right to due process, former Judge Tormis should be given full opportunity to be heard and confront witnesses against her in th[ese] disbarment proceedings. This constitutional right should not be denied to former Judge Tormis, who cried for due process since her dismissal from the service.<br><br>. . . .<br><br><b><u>For the dismissal from the service, in her capacity as judge, for gross inefficiency or neglect of duty and of gross ignorance of the law in performance of her duties as presiding judge.</u></b><br><br>Former Judge Tormis cried for justice in dismissing her from service, as presiding judge, without according her due process. She was not given the opportunity to be heard but the only basis of her dismissal from the service was the testimonies/allegations against her of some courts [sic] personnel, who were allegedly intimidated by the judicial audit team, during the judicial audit. She was not given the chance to confront nor furnished copies of the said court personnel's testimonies. She was denied her constitutional right against searches and seizures of documents from her sala when the audit team obtained documents and records, as evidence against her, when they conducted the investigation in her sala, since she was not informed of the said audit.<br><br>In A.M. No P-08-2519 and A.M. No. P-08-2520, the Court held that the rights against unreasonable searches and seizures as provided under Section 2, Article III in the Constitution may be invoked even in administrative proceedings. The exclusionary rule under Section 3 (2), Art. Ill of the Constitution also bars the admission of evidence obtained in violation of such'right. The fact that the present case is administrative in nature, does not render the above principle inoperative. As expounded in Zulueta vs C.A., any violation of the aforestated constitutional right renders the evidence inadmissible for any purpose in any proceedings.<br><br>. . . . <br><br>Records show that all the administrative sanctions against former Judge Tormis were all for simple gross inefficiency or neglect of duties and gross ignorance of the law in the discharge of her duties and responsibilities as the presiding judge of the MTCC, Br. 4, Cebu City. Neither of these findings held her for gross misconduct, which constitute immoral conduct, that would tend to affect her standing and moral character as an officer of the court and as a member of the Bar. Further, she has never been found guilty for graft and corruption during her entire service in the judiciary as a member of the bench in the lower court that would cause her automatically disbarred from the practice of law.<br><br>Finally, the counter-charges of former Judge Tormis against Atty.
