It is settled that the Court is not a trier of facts, and this rule applies with greater force in labor cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Generally, it may only look into factual issues in labor cases when the factual findings of the LA, the NLRC, and the CA are conflicting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Hence, if there is no cogent reason to hold otherwise, the Court ought to defer to the findings of the foregoing tribunals on this question of fact.<br><br>In this case, it should be recalled that in the LA's November 28, 2011 Decision, the LA categorically declared petitioner to be the employer of respondent and accordingly, dismissed the complaint against Fabulous Jeans and Arqueza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Consequently, in the Memorandum of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> before the NLRC, where Fabulous Jeans joined petitioner as respondent-appellant, it was argued that the LA should have dismissed the charges against petitioner instead, considering that respondent was employed as a field driver for Fabulous Jeans, and that there was no employer-employee relationship between him and petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The NLRC failed to explicitly address the said issue in its April 30, 2012 Resolution, referring to respondents-appellants (petitioner, <i>et al.</i> in this case) collectively as the employer. However, it particularly debunked petitioner's assertion that there was ample evidence that respondent voluntarily resigned and that he refused to return to work anymore;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> and pinpointed petitioner as the one that knew where to look for respondent after the latter had allegedly disappeared.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The CA, on the other hand, minced no words when it declared petitioner as attempting to avoid liability by claiming that it has a separate and distinct personality from that of Fabulous Jeans without offering evidence to buttress the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Hence, considering that the LA, the NLRC, and the CA consistently found petitioner liable as the employer of respondent, the Court sees no compelling reason to depart from their judgment on this score.<br><br>In fact, it is even worth noting that respondent claimed in his Position Paper<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> before the LA that he was hired by petitioner and was required to report for work at its store in Cagayan de Oro City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> This was confirmed by petitioner in its own Position Paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> declaring respondent to be "a field driver for the Cagayan de Oro Branch of (petitioner) HSY MARKETING LTD., CO., (NOVO JEANS &amp; SHIRT)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Clearly, petitioner should be bound by such admission and must not be allowed to continue to deny any employer-employee relationship with respondent.<br><br>To add, the Court had already exposed the practice of setting up "distributors" or "dealers" which are, in reality, dummy companies that allow the mother company to avoid employer-employee relations and, consequently, shield the latter from liability from employee claims in case of illegal dismissal, closure, unfair labor practices, and the like.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Respondent had categorically alleged the commission of such pernicious practice in his Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> dated July 14, 2011, as follows:<br><blockquote><ol start="2"><li>That for the many years that I have been employed with NOVO, I have observed that although they used the business name NOVO Jeans and Shirts, the ownership of each and every branch in the entire Mindanao was put under different corporate names like a) Asian Distributor in Bayugan; b) Novotel (with Hotel) in Ozamis City; c) HSY Marketing Limited Corporation as their mother corporation; d) Fabulous Jeans and Shirts in Iligan City and Cagayan de Oro City;<br><br></li><li>That the different ownership used by Respondent NOVO in its different branches was to minimize business tax;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Despite these statements, petitioner failed to present evidence to rebut the same. Therefore, it cannot be allowed to evade liability as the employer of respondent.<br><br><center><b>II.</b><br></center><br>The Court likewise upholds the unanimous conclusion of the lower tribunals that respondent had not been dismissed at all. Other than the latter's unsubstantiated allegation of having been verbally terminated from his work, no substantial evidence was presented to show that he was indeed dismissed or was prevented from returning to his work. In the absence of any showing of an overt or positive act proving that petitioner had dismissed respondent, the latter's claim of illegal dismissal cannot be sustained, as such supposition would be self-serving, conjectural, and of no probative value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Similarly, petitioner's claims of respondent's voluntary resignation and/or abandonment deserve scant consideration, considering petitioner's failure to discharge the burden of proving the deliberate and unjustified refusal of respondent to resume his employment without any intention of returning. It was incumbent upon petitioner to ascertain respondent's interest or non-interest in the continuance of his employment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> but to no avail.<br><br>Hence, since there is no dismissal or abandonment to speak of, the appropriate course of action is to reinstate the employee (in this case, herein respondent) without, however, the payment of backwages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Notably, the reinstatement ordered here should not be construed as a relief proceeding from illegal dismissal; instead, it should be considered as a declaration or affirmation that the employee may return to work because he was not dismissed in the first place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> For this reason, the Court agrees with petitioner that the LA, the NLRC, and the CA erred in awarding separation pay in spite of the finding that respondent had not been dismissed. Properly speaking, <b><u>liability for the payment of separation pay is but a legal consequence of illegal dismissal where reinstatement is no longer viable or feasible</u></b>. As a relief granted in lieu of reinstatement, it goes without saying that an award of separation pay is inconsistent with a finding that there was no illegal dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> <b><u>This is because an employee who had not been dismissed, much less illegally dismissed, cannot be reinstated.</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Moreover, <b><u>as there is no reinstatement to speak of, respondent cannot invoke the doctrine of strained relations</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> to support Ms prayer for the award of separation pay. In the case of <i>Capili v. NLRC</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the Court explained that:<br><blockquote>The award of separation pay cannot be justified solely because of the existence of "strained relations" between the employer and the employee. <b>It must be given to the employee only as an alternative to reinstatement emanating from illegal dismissal. When there is no illegal dismissal, even if the relations are strained, separation pay has no legal basis.</b> Besides, the doctrine on "strained relations" cannot be applied indiscriminately since every labor dispute almost invariably results in "strained relations;" otherwise, reinstatement can never be possible simply because some hostility is engendered between the parties as a result of their disagreement. That is human nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In fine, petitioner is ordered to reinstate respondent to his former position without the payment of backwages. If respondent voluntarily chooses not to return to work, he must then be considered as having resigned from employment. This is without prejudice, however, to the willingness of both parties to continue with their former contract of employment or enter into a new one whenever they so desire.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br><center><b>III.</b><br></center><br>While petitioner should not be adjudged liable for separation pay, the Court nonetheless sustains the award of service incentive leave pay in favor of respondent, in accordance with the finding of the CA that respondent was a regular employee of petitioner and is, therefore, entitled to such benefit. As the CA aptly pointed out:<br><blockquote>[R]espondent is not a field personnel as defined above because of the nature of his job as a company driver. Expectedly, respondent is directed to deliver the goods at a specified time and place and he is not given the discretion to solicit, select[,] and contact prospective clients. Respondent in his Position Paper claimed that he was required to report for work from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. at the company's store located at Velez-Gomez Street, Cagayan de Oro City. Certainly then, respondent was under the control and supervision of petitioners. Respondent, therefore, is a regular employee whose task is usually necessary and desirable to the usual trade and business of the company. Thus, he is entitled to the benefits accorded to regular employees, including service incentive leave pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court has already held that <b><u>company drivers who are under the control and supervision of management officers — like respondent herein — are regular employees entitled to benefits including service incentive leave pay</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> "Service incentive leave is a right which accrues to every employee who has served 'within 12 months, whether continuous or broken, reckoned from the date the employee started working, including authorized absences and paid regular holidays unless the working days in the establishment as a matter of practice or policy, or that provided in the employment contracts, is less than 12 months, in which case said period shall be considered as one [(1)] year.' It is also commutable to its money equivalent if not used or exhausted at the end of the year. In other words, an employee who has served for one (1) year is entitled to it. He may use it as leave days or he may collect its monetary value."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Petitioner, as the employer of respondent, and having complete control over the records of the company, could have easily rebutted the said monetary claim against it by presenting the vouchers or payrolls showing payment of the same. However, since petitioner opted not to lift a finger in providing the required documentary evidence, the ineluctable conclusion that may be derived therefrom is that it never paid said benefit and must, perforce, be ordered to settle its obligation to respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>.
