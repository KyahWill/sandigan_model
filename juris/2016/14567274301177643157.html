Petitioner asks this court to review the facts of the case:<br><br><blockquote>This Honorable Court is now, from the foregoing, confronted with a controversy as to which will prevail - the findings of facts of the trial court which is based on preponderance of evidence or the findings of facts of the court <i>a quo</i> which is based on the alleged misapprehension of facts allegedly committed by the former court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Petitioner admits that she is raising factual issues that this court cannot entertain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> However, she argues that this case falls under the exceptions to this rule.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup><br><br><center>II<br></center><br>Parties praying that this court review the factual findings of the Court of Appeals must demonstrate and prove that the case clearly falls under the exceptions to the rule.

Grave abuse of discretion is defined, thus:<br><br><blockquote>By grave abuse of discretion is meant such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be grave as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility and must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.<br><br>Grave abuse of discretion refers not merely to palpable errors of jurisdiction; or to violations of the Constitution, the law and jurisprudence. It refers also to cases in which, for various reasons, there has been a gross misapprehension of facts.<sup><font color="#FF0000">[139]</font> </sup>(Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>This exception was first laid down in <i>Buyco v. People, et al</i>.:<sup><font color="#FF0000">[140]</font><br></sup><br><blockquote>In the case at bar, the Tenth Amnesty Commission, the court of first instance and the Court of Appeals found, in effect, that the evidence did not suffice to show that appellant had acted in the manner contemplated in the amnesty proclamation. Moreover, unlike the Barrioquinto cases, which were appealed <i>directly</i> to this Court, which, accordingly, had authority to pass upon the validity of the findings of fact of the court of first instance and of its conclusions on the veracity of the witnesses, the case at bar is before us on appeal <i>by certiorari</i> from a decision of the Court of Appeals, <i>the findings and conclusions of which, on the aforementioned subjects, are not subject to our review, except in cases of grave abuse of discretion,</i> which has not been shown to exist.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner fails to convince this court that the Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion in reversing the trial court's factual findings and appreciation of the evidence presented by the parties. Petitioner claims that:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he court a quo gravely abused its discretion when it rendered its assailed decision and resolution since it contravened the principle that "findings of fact of trial courts are entitled to great respect and are bindings [sic] on the Supreme Court in the absence of showing bias, partiality, or grave abuse of discretion on the part of the presiding judge" - (People vs. Vitancur, 345 SCRA 414) and the principle that "in the absence of a palpable error or grave abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge, the trial court's evaluation of the credibility of witnesses will not be disturbed on appeal" - (People vs. Mendez, 335 SCRA 147).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup></blockquote><br>Other than saying that the Court of Appeals allegedly failed to apply doctrines laid down by this court, petitioner has not presented this court with cogent reasons why the Court of Appeals gravely abused its discretion when it re-evaluated the evidence presented by the parties and reached different factual findings.<br><br>Grave abuse of discretion, to be an exception to the rule, must have attended the evaluation of the facts and evidence presented by the parties. In <i>Cariño v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> the issue presented before this court was "whether the respondent Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion in concluding that the Deed of Sale of House and Transfer of Rights (Exhibit 'D-l'), on which the petitioners have based their application over the questioned lot, is simulated and, therefore, an inexistent deed of sale."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> To resolve the issue, this court examined whether there was substantial and convincing evidence to support the factual findings of the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup><br><br>In any case, the Court of Appeals' reversal or modification of the factual findings of the trial court does not automatically mean that it gravely abused its discretion. The Court of Appeals, acting as an appellate court, is still a trier of facts. Parties can raise questions of fact before the Court of Appeals and it will have jurisdiction to rule on these matters. Otherwise, if only questions of law are raised, the appeal should be filed directly before this court.<br><br>This is not to say that the trial court's findings of fact, especially with regard to the credibility of witnesses, are of little weight. The doctrine in the cases cited by petitioner, <i>People v. Vitancur</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> and <i>People v. Mendez</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> is a time-honored rule. The trial court's findings of fact are given much weight because of the trial court judges' first-hand knowledge and familiarity with the disposition of the witnesses who testified before them, and this is important in certain cases. However, this doctrine does not diminish the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction in reviewing the factual findings of the trial court. Further, in the cited cases, the Court of Appeals did not even have the opportunity to review the factual findings of the trial court as the case was directly elevated to this court on automatic appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup><br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>The Court of Appeals' appreciation of the weight of the evidence presented by the parties is opposed to that of the trial court. Unlike the trial court, the Court of Appeals did not give any weight to Antonio Gonzales' testimony.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> Instead, it relied on the tax declarations presented by the parties to find the market value of the fishpond in 1982.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup><br><br>While the factual findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court, this alone does not automatically warrant a review of factual findings by this court. In <i>Uniland Resources v. Development Bank of the Philippines</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It bears emphasizing that mere disagreement between the Court of Appeals and the trial court as to the facts of a case does not of itself warrant this Court's review of the same. It has been held that the doctrine that the findings of fact made by the Court of Appeals, being conclusive in nature, are binding on this Court, applies even if the Court of Appeals was in disagreement with the lower court as to the weight of evidence with a consequent reversal of its findings of fact, so long as the findings of the Court of Appeals are borne out by the record or based on substantial evidence. While the foregoing doctrine is not absolute, petitioner has not sufficiently proved that his case falls under the known exceptions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>The lower courts' disagreement as to their factual findings, at most, presents only prima facie basis for recourse to this court:<br><br><blockquote>One such exception, of course, is where — as here — the factual findings of the Court of Appeals conflict with those of the Trial Court, but it is one that must be invoked and applied only with great circumspection and upon a clear showing that manifestly correct findings have been unwarrantedly rejected or reversed. On the one hand, the trial court is the beneficiary of the rule that its findings of fact are entitled to great weight and respect; on the other, the Court of Appeals is, as a general proposition, the ultimate judge of the facts in a case appealed to it — a prerogative which is at the same time a duty conferred upon it by law. Thus, while a conflict in their findings may <i>prima facie</i> provide basis for a recourse to this Court, only a showing, on the face of the record, of gross or extraordinary misperception or manifest bias in the Appellate Court's reading of the evidence will justify this Court's intervention by way of assuming a function usually within the former's exclusive province. There is no showing here of such exceptional circumstances, petitioners advertence to certain findings of the Court of Appeals in her view contrary to the weight or import of the evidence notwithstanding. In short, nothing in the record warrants this Court's substituting its own assessment of the evidence for that of the Court of Appeals in contravention of the general rule that restricts to questions of law the scope of its review of the latter's decisions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br><i>Garcia, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et al.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> the case cited by <i>Medina</i> as basis for this exception, supports this pronouncement. In <i>Garcia,</i> this court considered the contrary findings of the Court of Appeals and the trial court as one of the circumstances compelling this court to find out whether the case falls under the exceptions allowing it to review factual findings of the Court of Appeals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> Thus:<br><br><blockquote>The preliminary question which poses itself in connection with this first assignment of error is whether this Court may make its own findings of feet independently of those made by the Court of Appeals. The general rule is that the appellate court's findings are conclusive, but this rule is not without some recognized exceptions, such as:<br><blockquote>(1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is a grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) when the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee.</blockquote><i>Several circumstances compelled us to go into the record of this case in order to find out whether or not it falls within the exceptions above stated</i>: first, the findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; second, said findings are in the nature of conclusions, without citation of the specific evidences on which they are based; and third, the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioners' main and reply briefs, with the corresponding references to the record, are not disputed by the respondents. These facts are necessary for a clear understanding and proper resolution of the issue of rescission in this case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The three (3) circumstances in <i>Garcia</i> that compelled this court to look into the records of the case to determine whether an exception exists were then included as exceptions to the rule in <i>Tolentino v. De Jesus</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> and subsequent cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> In <i>Remalante v. Tibe</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> this court, in a footnote, discussed:<br><br><blockquote>In <i>Sacay v. Sandiganbayan,</i> the Court enumerated four more exceptions:<br><br>. . . (7) the findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) said findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioners' main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; (10) the finding of fact of the Court of Appeals is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on record.<br><br>However, in <i>Garcia,</i> the Court considered exception Nos. 7, 8 and 9 as circumstances that, taken together, compelled it to go into the record of the case in order to find out whether or not it fell within any of the six established exceptions.<br><br>On the other hand, exception No. 10 may be considered as an illustration of the fourth exception — that the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner failed to show why the factual findings of the Court of Appeals are without any basis. Petitioner does not dispute the tax declarations relied upon by the Court of Appeals.. Instead, petitioner insists that the testimony of Antonio Gonzales should be given weight despite the valid and substantial basis provided by the Court of Appeals to find otherwise. She still failed to clarify and explain the anomaly between Antonio Gonzales' testimony on the purchase price of the fishpond sold to Precillano Gonzales Development Corporation and the provision on the purchase price in the Deed of Sale presented.<br><br>We do not find any compelling reason to review the factual findings of the Court of Appeals.
