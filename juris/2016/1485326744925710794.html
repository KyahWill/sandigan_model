SP No. 123997, which affirmed the rulings of the Energy Regulatory Commission (<em>ERC</em>) specifying respondent's capacity allocation as a power producer. <p> The facts of the case follow.</p><p> The Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 (<em>EPIRA</em>), or Republic Act (<em>R.A</em>.) No. 9136, which was signed into law by then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on June 8, 2001, was intended to provide a framework for the restructuring of the electric power industry, including the privatization of the assets of the National Power Corporation (NPC), the transition to the desired competitive structure and the definition of the responsibilities of the various government agencies and private entities with respect to the reform of the electric power industry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p><p> The EPIRA also provided for the creation of petitioner Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (<em>PSALM</em>), a governmentÂ­-owned and controlled corporation which took over ownership of the generation assets, liabilities, independent power producer (<em>IPP</em>) contracts, real estate and other disposable assets of the NPC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> PSALM's principal purpose under the law is to "manage the orderly sale, disposition, and privatization of NPC generation assets, real estate and other disposable assets, and IPP contracts with the objective of liquidating all NPC financial obligations and stranded contract costs in an optimal manner."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p><p> Among the assets put on sale by PSALM was the 600-MW Batangas Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant in Calaca, Batangas (<em>Calaca Power Plant</em>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In July 2009, DMCI Holdings, Inc. (DMCI) was declared the highest bidder in the sale.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The sale was effected through an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) executed by PSALM and DMCI on July 29, 2009, and became effective on August 3, 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p> On December 2, 2009, DMCI transferred all of its rights and obligations under the APA and the Land Lease Agreement (also called Final Transaction Documents) to herein respondent SEM-Calaca Power Corporation (<em>SCPC</em>) by entering into an Amendment, Accession and Assumption Agreement that was signed by PSALM, DMCI and SCPC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Under the agreement, SCPC took over all the rights and obligations of DMCI under the said documents. SCPC also alleged that on that same date, it took over the physical possession, operation and maintenance of the Calaca Power Plant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> Also on the same date, SCPC started providing electricity to customers listed in Schedule W of the APA, among which is MERALCO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p> Schedule W is partially

Instead, PSALM paid it the amount of only Php934,114,678.04, or short of Php959,913,626.96, which allegedly represents the cost of electricity that PSALM charged against SCPC representing the power NPC supposedly obtained from WESM to fill the alleged deficiency in SCPC's supply to MERALCO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></p><p> Eventually, following negotiations between the parties, PSALM agreed, through a letter dated June 21, 2010, to cap MERALCO's nominations from the Calaca Power Plant "in any hour up to 169MWh or 10.841% of each hourly energy nomination submitted by MERALCO to NPC under the MERALCO TSC effective June 26, 2010."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p> However, as SCPC was insisting that the MERALCO cap should have taken effect much earlier, or on December 2, 2009, i.e., the date of effectivity of the APA, and as the parties failed to execute the Implementation, Agreement and Protocol (Implementation Agreement) covering the parties' responsibilities with regards to the supply of power to MERALCO, SCPC made an offer to PSALM for the issues to be brought to the ERC for arbitration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The proposal, however, was rejected by PSALM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p> Hence, SCPC initiated the instant case by filing a Petition for Dispute Resolution (with Prayer for Provisional Remedies) before the Energy Regulatory Commission (<em>ERC</em>) against NPC and PSALM.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p> In its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated July 6, 2011, the ERC ruled in favor of SCPC and against NPC and PSALM, with the following dispositive portion: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered, the Commission hereby resolves the issues raised in this instant dispute as follows:</p> <ol><li> SCPC's obligation under Schedule W of the APA is to deliver 10.841% of MERALCO's energy requirements but not to exceed 169,000 kW capacity allocation, at any given hour;</li><li>The obligation to deliver 10.841% of MERALCO's energy requirements, but not to exceed 169,000 kW capacity, at any given hour, shall commence from December 2, 2009 when the physical possession, occupation and operation of the Calaca Power Plant was formally turned over to SCPC; </li><li>The NPC and PSALM have no basis, in fact and in law, to charge against SCPC the nominations beyond the 169,000 kW capacity which NPC allegedly purchased for MERALCO from the WESM. There being no basis to charge SCPC, PSALM must return all the payments of MERALCO which were withheld by PSALM, including the amount representing the cost of electricity nominated and purchased by NPC beyond the 169,000 kW from the WESM for the period January 2010 to June 25, 2010;</li><li> The payment of interests on the amount to be returned by PSALM to SCPC is in order. However, in the absence of a stipulation, the amount of interest shall be pegged at 6% per annum; and</li><li>NPC shall continue to nominate for MERALCO's energy requirements, in accordance with the TSC between them. However, in nominating for MERALCO's contract energy under the APA, NPC shall consider the 169,000 kW capacity limit, in accordance with Schedule W of the APA, considering the generating capacity of the Calaca Power Plant. In the absence of an Implementation Agreement and Protocol, all nominations made for MERALCO by SCPC in accordance with the APA, shall henceforth be billed through NPC and payment thereof shall be collected directly from MERALCO by SCPC.</li></ol> <p> Accordingly, the NPC is hereby enjoined from making nominations beyond the 169,000 kW of MERALCO's allocation. On the other hand, PSALM is hereby directed to (1) refrain from charging against SCPC the cost of power beyond the 169,000 kW of MERALCO's allocation and to (2) refrain from withholding all MERALCO payments for electricity supplied by SCPC.</p> <p> The NPC, PSALM and SCPC are further directed to account for and reconcile the amounts charged against the SCPC by PSALM, on account of the NPC's nominations and purchases from the WESM beyond the 169,000 kW capacity allocation during the period January 2010 to June 25, 2010. Thereafter, the parties are directed to submit to the Commission the reconciled computation of the over-nominations and other MERALCO payments withheld by PSALM for the said period, within ten (10) days from receipt of this Decision. Further, PSALM is hereby directed to return to SCPC, the amount as computed and reconciled, including the interests thereon at the rate of 6% per annum, within ten (10) days from the parties' submission of the reconciled computation to the Commission. Finally, the parties are directed to submit their Compliance with the foregoing dispositions within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Decision.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> PSALM filed a motion for reconsideration of the above decision. However, in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated February 13, 2012, the ERC denied the said motion.</p><p> Aggrieved, PSALM filed a Petition for Review of the ERC decision to the Court of Appeals (CA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></p><p> In its assailed Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated September 4, 2012, the CA denied PSALM's petition and upheld the findings of the ERC. The dispositive portion of the decision states: </p><blockquote> <p> WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is DENIED. The Decision dated July 6, 2011 and the Order dated February 13, 2012 of the Energy Regulatory Commission in ERC Case No. 2010-058 are hereby AFFIRMED.</p> <p> SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The CA sustained the ERC's interpretation of the APA that SCPC's obligation was to supply 10.841% of MERALCO's energy requirement, but not to exceed 169,000 kW at any given hour, as such interpretation would reconcile the presence of the two figures in Schedule W and harmonize the provisions of the said contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Likewise, the appellate court upheld ERC in explaining why a cap of 169,000 kW is placed on SCPC's obligation to supply electricity to MERALCO, the explanation being: unlike before the privatization when NPC, with all its generation assets, was the sole supplier of MERALCO and, therefore, could obtain electricity from any of those assets, in the current situation, SCPC is just one of many suppliers and SCPC's asset is only the Calaca Power Plant, which has a limited capacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The CA likewise stated that the findings of administrative or regulatory agencies on matters within their technical area of expertise are generally accorded not only respect but finality if such findings are supported by substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p><p> PSALM filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the decision above, but the same was likewise denied in a Resolution of the CA, dated November 27, 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p>Hence, PSALM goes to this Court via the present Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari.</em> </p><p> PSALM contends that the CA erred in placing a cap of 169,000 kW on SCPC's obligation to supply 10.841% of MERALCO's requirement. It insists that SCPC stepped into the shoes of NPC and PSALM in terms of the fulfillment of the obligation of the latter to supply 10.841% of MERALCO's nominated volume.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In PSALM's view, SCPC is deemed to have assumed PSALM's rights and obligations under the Power Supply Contracts (<em>PSCs</em>) subject to the conditions specified in Schedule W.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> </p><p> Further, it adds that Schedule W is unambiguous and requires no construction or interpretation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Allegedly, the figure 169,000 kW is not meant to qualify the 10.841% of MERALCO's energy requirement;

No error attended the CA's affirmation of the ruling of the ERC.</p><p> It is general practice among the courts that the rulings of administrative agencies like the ERC are accorded great respect, owing to a traditional deference given to such administrative agencies equipped with the special knowledge, experience and capability to hear and determine promptly disputes on technical matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Factual findings of administrative agencies that are affirmed by the Court of Appeals are generally conclusive on the parties and not reviewable by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Although there are instances when such a practice is not applied, such as when the board or official has gone beyond its/his statutory authority, exercised unconstitutional powers or clearly acted arbitrarily without regard to its/his duty or with grave abuse of discretion, or when the actuation of the administrative official or administrative board or agency is tainted by a failure to abide by the command of the law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> none of such instances obtain in the present case which would prompt this Court to reverse the findings of the tribunal below.</p><p> On the contrary, We find the ERC to have acted within its statutory powers as defined in Section 43 (u), RA 9136, or the EPIRA Law, which grants it original and exclusive jurisdiction "over all cases involving disputes between and among participants or players in the energy sector."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Jurisprudence also states that administrative agencies like the ERC, which were created to address the complexities of settling disputes in a modern and diverse society and economy, count among their functions the interpretation of contracts and the determination of the rights of parties, which traditionally were the exclusive domain of the judicial branch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Such broadened quasi-judicial powers of administrative agencies are explained in the case of <em>Antipolo Realty Corporation v. NHA</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> which states: </p><blockquote> <p> In this era of clogged court dockets, the need for specialized administrative boards or commissions with the special knowledge, experience and capability to hear and determine promptly disputes on technical matters or essentially factual matters, subject to judicial review in case of grave abuse of discretion, has become well nigh indispensable. Thus, in 1984, the Court noted that "between the power lodged in an administrative body and a court, the unmistakable trend has been to refer it to the former. x x x."</p> <p> xxxx</p> <p> In general, the quantum of judicial or quasi-judicial powers which an administrative agency may exercise is defined in the enabling act of such agency. In other words, the extent to which an administrative entity may exercise such powers depends largely, if not wholly, on the provisions of the statute creating or empowering such agency.<strong> In the exercise of such powers, the agency concerned must commonly interpret and apply contracts and determine the rights of private parties under such contracts. One thrust of the multiplication of administrative agencies is that the interpretation of contracts and the determination of private rights thereunder is no longer a uniquely judicial function, exercisable only by our regular courts.</strong> </p> </blockquote> <p> As the foregoing imply, the ERC merely performed its statutory function of resolving disputes among the parties who are players in the industry, and exercised its <em>quasi</em>-judicial and administrative powers as outlined in jurisprudence by interpreting the contract between the parties in the present dispute, the so-called APA and specifically its Schedule W. </p><p> As for the correctness of the ERC's interpretation and finding, this Court examined the records and found no reason to depart from the rule that especially when supported by substantial evidence and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, the findings of a <em>quasi</em>-judicial body like the ERC deserve the highest respect, if not finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> </p><p> The petitioner PSALM assails ERC's holding that SCPC's obligation is "to deliver 10.841% of MERALCO's energy requirements but not to exceed 169,000 kW capacity allocation, at any given hour," which the ERC based on its interpretation of the figures 169,000 kW and 10.841% found in three columns of Schedule W.</p><p> We affirm the ERC's interpretation, as upheld by the CA. </p><p> Among the key principles in the interpretation of contracts is that espoused in Article 1370, paragraph 1, of the Civil Code, quoted as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> Art. 1370. If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control.</p> </blockquote> <p> The rule means that the contract's meaning should be determined from its clear terms without reference to extrinsic facts or aids.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> The intention of the parties must be gathered from the contract's language, and from that language alone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Stated differently, where the language of a written contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract must be taken to mean that which, on its face, it purports to mean, unless some good reason can be assigned to show that the words should be understood in a different sense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></p><p> Thus, conversely, when the terms of the contract are unclear or are ambiguous, interpretation must proceed beyond the words' literal meaning. Paragraph 2 of the same Article 1370 provides: </p><blockquote> <p> If the words appear to be contrary to the evident intention of the parties, the latter shall prevail over the former. </p> </blockquote> <p>Discerning the parties' true intent requires the application of other principles of contract interpretation. Jurisprudence dictates that when the intention of the parties cannot be discerned from the plain and literal language of the contract, or where there is more than just one way of reading it for its meaning, the court must make a preliminary inquiry of whether the contract before it is an ambiguous one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> A contract provision is ambiguous if it is susceptible of two reasonable alternative interpretations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> In such case, its interpretation is left to the court, or another tribunal with jurisdiction over it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> More simply, "interpretation" is defined as the act of making intelligible what was before not understood, ambiguous, or not obvious; it is a method by which the meaning of language is ascertained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> The "interpretation" of a contract is the determination of the meaning attached to the words written or spoken which make the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> </p><p> In the case at bar, the Court finds that ambiguity indeed surrounds the figures 10.841% and 169,000 kW found in the contract, the former because it does not indicate a base value with a specific quantity and a definite unit of measurement and the latter because there is uncertainty as to whether it is a cap or limit on the party's obligation or not. These were similarly the findings of both the ERC and the appellate court. Even to the casual observer, it is obvious that the plain language alone of Schedule W does not shed light on these figures. </p><p> The ERC correctly explained and interpreted these provisions, in this wise: </p><blockquote> <p>It is worthy to note that Schedule W of the APA indicates the value "10.841%", which is enclosed in parenthesis, under the name of MERALCO in the first column, without any reference as to its base value. The figure 10.841% simply written as it is (without reference on the base value), is an incomplete mathematical sentence and, therefore, is susceptible to several interpretations. For instance, it can be construed as 10.841% of the entire SCPC capacity (10.841% of 322 MW) or it can also be taken to mean that 169,000 kW represents 10.841% of MERALCO's contract energy. A close scrutiny of Schedule W, however, indicates that 10.841% is not synonymous to 169,000 kW,<em> i.e.</em>, 169,000 kW does not represent 10.841% of MERALCO's energy requirement. To complete its meaning, the figure 10.841% should have been followed by a reference value and should have been written as "<u>10.841%</u> of ..." a specific base reference. Thus, to use 10.841% as the reference value alone for MERALCO's contract energy at any given hour would not be appropriate under the circumstances because SCPC would not have an idea of how much energy MERALCO would need at any given time and the capacity that the power plant can generate may not match with it. </p> <p> On the other hand, to use the nominal figure 169,000 kW alone in reference to MERALCO's contract energy would likewise not be appropriate under the circumstances because the "10.841%" value written in parenthesis underneath the name "MERALCO" in the first column of Schedule W cannot just simply be ignored. </p> <p> To synthesize, the Commission believes that neither of the figures (10.841% or 169,000 kW) taken alone should be controlling in reference to MERALCO's contract energy under the APA. The 10.841% value should be read and harmonized with the nominal figure 169,000 kW in order to give meaning to both, consistent with and in relation to the APA. In giving meaning to the words and intention of Schedule W, the Commission abides by the law stipulated under Article 1374 of the New Civil Code, which provides: </p> <blockquote> <p> ART. 1374. The various stipulations of a contract shall be interpreted together, attributing to the doubtful ones that sense which may result from all of them taken jointly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> </p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p> The ambiguity in Schedule W partly lies in the figure "10.841%," which lacks a base value and is bereft of any specific quantity or number (in kilowatts or any other unit) to represent the generated electricity that SCPC was obliged to deliver to MERALCO. A mere percentage below MERALCO's name without indicating what it is and what its base value is amounts to an incomplete numerical statement. Then, on the right columns, specific quantities, including the "160,000 kW," are laid down which seem to correspond or add up to SCPC's generating capacity but which, in the "Notes" section of the schedule, are confusingly referred to as merely "indicative,"<em> i.e.</em>, estimates, which do not help reduce the uncertainty. </p><p>Such a lack of clarity results in a perplexing situation wherein the obligation to deliver could be interpreted as open-ended by one party â the obligee, but could be argued as "capped" or "limited" by the other party â the obligor. Obviously, such divergence needed to be addressed by a disinterested third party like the ERC. </p><p>Although how such confusion came about despite the presumed knowledge of both parties of both the high and low ranges of MERALCO's projected requirements, at any given time, as well as the limited generating capacity of the Calaca Power Plant, the supplier's sole generating asset, is beyond the subject of this review, what is certain is that there is an ambiguity that, if left to stand or to remain unresolved, would inevitably lead to interminable disputes. Thus, the Court sustains the ERC's decision to interpret the contract as well as its resulting interpretation and explanation. </p><p>The ERC correctly cited another principle under the Civil Code in contract interpretation which states, </p><blockquote> <p>Art. 1374. The various stipulations of a contract shall be interpreted together, attributing to the doubtful ones that sense which may result from all of them taken jointly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p>Additionally, under the Rules on Evidence, it is required that: </p> <blockquote> <p> RULE 130 </p> <p>xxxx </p> <p>Sec. 11. <em>Instrument construed so as to give effect to all provisions</em>. - In the construction of an instrument where there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all. </p> </blockquote> <p>Then, case law is also settled on the rule that contracts should be so construed as to harmonize and give effect to its different provisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> The legal effect of a contract is not determined alone by any particular provision disconnected from all others, but from the whole read together.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> </p><p> Following the above rules and principles, the ERC correctly interpreted the ambiguity in Schedule W in a way that would render all of the contracts' provisions effectual. Although there was ambiguity, as earlier stated, in the figures 10.841% and 169,000 kW that appear on the said schedule, the ERC properly harmonized both provisions. It did not just disregard or dispense with either of the figures as such would have violated the principles that the "various stipulations of the contract shall be interpreted together" and that the "doubtful provisions shall be attributed with the sense which may result from all of them taken jointly." Instead, it interpreted both in a way that they would be preserved and work together. The parties clearly intended for the figures to be in the contract and bestowed such with meanings which the ERC had no power to just ignore or remove. </p><p>As stated by the ERC, the 10.841% without any base reference is mathematically incomplete and therefore opens itself up to various interpretations; thus, it is ambiguous. On the other hand, the 169,000 kW, which appears twice in Schedule W, if treated as merely "indicative" or just an "estimate," as PSALM alleges, would be rendered insignificant or as if it was not even written in the contract, and the same could be said of all the other figures in the schedule including the 10.841%. Clearly, this was not the intention of the parties. The parties clearly assigned a common meaning to the figures and they were not mere estimates nor insignificant because, otherwise, the contract would be ineffectual and without these figures, the contract would not have even been signed in the first place. </p><p>It bears emphasis as well that the contract APA and its Schedule W appear to have been prepared by PSALM, so that the interpretation of any obscure or ambiguous words or stipulations therein should not favor it, as it is presumed to have caused such obscurity or ambiguity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> </p><p>Moreover, overturning the ERC's and the CA's interpretation would result in the absurd scenario of requiring SCPC to supply more than 169,000kW for MERALCO despite the fact that its contracted demand levels for various customers listed in Schedule W were pegged at 322 MW only and its dependable capacity is only 330 MW. As this Court has verified in the records, the ERC correctly explained that the Calaca Power Plant only produces up to 322 MW in electricity net of plant use; out of such produced, MERALCO obtains the biggest allocation of 169,000 kW (169 M) whereas the rest of the customers share 153,000 kW (153MW).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> It would be highly unreasonable to require SCPC to allocate even a marginal increase from 169,000 kW for MERALCO when such would cause it to renege on its obligations to supply its other customers. Such an interpretation that would lead to an unreasonableness which is frowned upon, for another oft-cited rule in the interpretation of contracts is that "the reasonableness of the result obtained, after analysis and construction of the contract, must also be carefully considered."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> </p><p> PSALM also contends that other stipulations in the contract such as the Special Conditions of the MERALCO TSC, as well as SCPC's option to enter into back-to-back supply contracts with other generators (or to purchase directly from the market), should it become unable to supply the contracted power under Schedule W, clearly are indications that there is no cap in SCPC's supply obligations. The contention, however, has no merit and, upon this Court's own examination of the contracts, affirms as correct the ERC's explanation in its Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> dated March 12, 2012 dismissing PSALM's motion for reconsideration, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> A. NPC/PSALM's OBLIGATION UNDER THE TSC</p> <p> Under the TSC contracted between MERALCO and NPC, the latter is obliged to deliver MERALCO's total energy requirements. As such, NPC is required to exhaust all means to find other sources of power to replace any curtailed energy at no extra cost to MERALCO. <strong>Simply put, NPC is directly responsible to make up for any shortfall under the MERALCO TSC.</strong> In fact, in its "Motion for Reconsideration," PSALM mentioned that "<em>Undeniably, Respondent PSALM under the MERALCO TSC is obligated to deliver the entire contracted energy as stated therein. x x x" and that "Respondent PSALM's obligation is to keep MERALCO whole</em>."</p> <p> It must be emphasized that <strong>NPC and PSALM's obligation to supply the entire energy contract to MERALCO, including the obligation to replace any curtailed energy, was not passed on or assigned to SCPC.</strong> Only the portion of the contract energy as defined in Part I of Schedule W was assigned to SCPC. Such is clear under Part II of Schedule W, which states:</p> <blockquote> <p><em> "Part II. Special Conditions of the MERALCO TSC</em></p> <p><em> The following conditions, unique to the MERALCO-NPC contract, shall apply to the assigned portion of the Contract Energy from the MERALCO TSC.</em></p> <p><em> 1. Neither the MERALCO TSC nor any portion thereof shall be assigned to the Buyer. It is the Contract Energy specified in part I that is the subject of the assignment." </em></p> </blockquote> <p>B. SCPC'S OBLIGATION UNDER SCHEDULE W OF THE APA</p> <p> On the other hand, under Schedule W of the APA, SCPC is legally obligated to deliver 10.841% of MERALCO's energy requirements but not to exceed 169,000 kW capacity allocation at any given hour. Accordingly, SCPC is responsible for any shortfall and is under obligation to provide and make up for curtailed energy if it fails to produce up to 169,000 kW capacity, at any given hour.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup></p> </blockquote> <p> The above explanation by the ERC states, in simple terms, that SCPC is not accountable for any shortfall once it had delivered 169,000 kW at any given hour, the same being the responsibility of NPC. SCPC becomes liable only whenever it fails to deliver whichever is lower of 169,000 kW or 10.841% of MERALCO's requirements, at any given hour.
