Thus, without the required written authority from the donor, the CA held that the disposition of the land covered by TCT No. T-41367 is prohibited and the land's subsequent registration under TCT No. T-322971 is void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>However, the CA nullified the transfers made to Javonillo and Armentano because these transfers violated Section 6 of Article IV of the ALRAI Constitution.

The petitions also involve the same parties and raise interrelated issues.<br><br><center><b>The Issues</b><br></center><br>Petitioners raise the following issues for resolution of the Court, to wit:<br><br><ol><li>Whether respondents should be reinstated as members of ALRAI; and<br></li><li>Whether the transfers of the donated lots are valid.<br></li></ol><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center><br>We find the petition partly meritorious.<br><br><i>I.

We agree with the CA's finding that respondents were illegally dismissed from ALRAI.<br><br>We stress that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, since "the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It is not our function to review, examine and evaluate or weigh the probative value of the evidence presented.<br><br>When supported by substantial evidence, the findings of fact of the CA are conclusive and binding on the parties and are not reviewable by this Court, unless the case falls under any of the recognized exceptions in Jurisprudence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The court <i>a quo</i> held that respondents are <i>bona fide</i> members of ALRAL<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> This finding was not disturbed by the CA because it was not raised as an issue before it and thus, is binding and conclusive on the parties and upon this Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> In addition, both the court <i>a quo</i> and the CA found that respondents were illegally removed as members of ALRAI. Both courts found that in terminating respondents from ALRAI, petitioners deprived them of due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Section 91<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> of the Corporation Code of the Philippines (Corporation Code)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> provides that membership in a non-stock, non-profit corporation (as in petitioner ALRAI in this case) shall be terminated in the manner and for the cases provided in its articles of incorporation or the by-laws.<br><br>In tum, Section 5, Article II of the ALRAI Constitution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> states:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 5. - Termination of Membership - Membership may be lost in any of the following: a) <b>Delinquent in the payment of monthly dues</b>; b) <b>failure to [attend] any annual or special meeting of the association for three consecutive times without justifiable cause</b>, and c) expulsion may be exacted by majority vote of the entire members, on causes which herein enumerated: 1) Act and utterances which are derogatory and harmful to the best interest of the association; 2) Failure to attend any annual or special meeting of the association for six (6) consecutive months, which shall be construed as lack of interest to continue his membership, and 3) any act to conduct which are contrary to the objectives, purpose and aims of the association as embodied in the charter[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioners allege that the membership of respondents in ALRAI was terminated due to (a) non-payment of membership dues and (b) failure to consecutively attend meetings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> However, petitioners failed to substantiate these allegations. In fact, the court <i>a quo</i> found that respondents submitted several receipts showing their compliance with the payment of monthly dues.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Petitioners likewise failed to prove that respondents' absences from meetings were without any justifiable grounds to result in the loss of their membership in ALRAI.<br><br>Even assuming that petitioners were able to prove these allegations, the automatic termination of respondents' membership in ALRAI is still not warranted. As shown above, Section 5 of the ALRAI Constitution does not state that the grounds relied upon by petitioners will cause the <i>automatic</i> termination of respondents' membership. Neither can petitioners argue that respondents' memberships in ALRAI were terminated under letter (c) of Section 5, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>x x x c) expulsion may be exacted by majority vote of the entire members, on causes which herein enumerated: 1) Act and utterances which are derogatory and harmful to the best interest of the association; 2) Failure to attend any annual or special meeting of the association for six (6) consecutive months, which shall be construed as lack of interest to continue his membership, and 3) any act to conduct which are contrary to the objectives, purpose and aims of the association as embodied in the charter; x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Although termination of membership from ALRAI may be made by a majority of the members, the court <i>a quo</i> found that the "guideline (referring to Section 2, Article III of the ALRAI Constitution) was not followed, hence, complainants' ouster from the association was illegally done."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The court <i>a quo</i> cited Section 2, Article III of the ALRAI Constitution which provides, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 2. -Notice- The Secretary shall give or cause to be given written notice of all meetings, regular or special to all members of the association at least three (3) days before the date of each meetings either by mail or personally. Notice for special meetings shall specify the time and the purposes or purpose for which it was called; x x x <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></blockquote><br>The CA concurred with the finding of the court <i>a quo</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> The CA noted that the evidence presented revealed that the General Meeting for the termination of membership was to be held on July 29, 2001, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon; but the Notice to all officers and members of ALRAI informing them about the General Meeting appeared to have been signed by ALRAI's President only on July 27, 2001.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Thus, the CA held that the "notice for the July 29, [2001] meeting where the general membership of ALRAI approved the expulsion of some of the respondents was short of the three (3)-day notice requirement. More importantly, the petitioners have failed to adduce evidence showing that the expelled members were indeed notified of any meeting or investigation proceeding where they are given the opportunity to be heard prior to the termination of their membership."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The requirement of due notice becomes more essential especially so since the ALRAI Constitution provides for the penalties to be imposed in cases where any member is found to be in arrears in payment of contributions, or is found to be absent from any meeting without any justifiable cause. Section 3, Article II and Section 3, Article III of the ALRAI Constitution provide, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><center>Article II<br><br>x x x<br></center><br>Sec. 3. - Suspension of members Any member who shall be six (6) months in arrears in the payment of monthly dues or additional contributions or assessments shall be automatically suspended and may be reinstated only upon payment of the corresponding dues in arrears or additional contributions and after approval of the board of Directors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br><center>x x x<br><br>Article III<br>x x x<br></center><br>Sec. 3. - Any member who shall be absent from any meeting without justifiable causes shall be liable to a fine of Two Pesos (P 2.00);<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></blockquote><br>Clearly, members proved to be in arrears in the payment of monthly dues, contributions, or assessments shall only be automatically suspended; while members who shall be absent from any meeting without any justifiable cause shall only be liable for a fine. Nowhere in the ALRAI Constitution does it say that the foregoing actions shall cause the automatic termination of membership.

Then there was illegal partial distribution of the donated lands.

The first cause of action pertains to the corporate right of ALRAI involving its corporate properties which it owned by virtue of the Deeds of Donation. In derivative suits, the real party-in-interest is the corporation, and the suing stockholder is a mere nominal party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> A derivative suit, therefore, concerns "a wrong to the corporation itself."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>However, we liberally treat this case (in relation to the cause of action pertaining to ALRAI's corporate properties) as one pursued by the corporation itself, for the following reasons.<br><br>First, the court <i>a quo</i> has jurisdiction to hear and decide this controversy. Republic Act No. 8799,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> in relation to Section 5 of Presidential Decree No. 902-A,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> vests the court <i>a quo</i> with original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 5. x x x<br><br>(a) Devices or schemes employed by or any acts, of the board of directors, business associates, its officers or partnership, amounting to fraud and misrepresentation which may be detrimental to the interest of the public and/or of the stockholders, partners, members of associations or organizations registered with the Commission.</blockquote><br>Second, we note that petitioners did not object to the institution of the case (on the ground that a derivative suit should have been lodged instead of an individual suit) in any of the proceedings before the court <i>a quo</i> or before the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Third, a reading of the complaint (in relation to the cause of action pertaining to ALRAI's corporate properties) shows that respondents do not pray for reliefs for their personal benefit; but in fact, for the benefit of the ALRAI, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>c) To cease and desist from selling donated lands subject of this case and to annul the titles transferred to Armando Javonillo, Ma. Acelita Armentano, Romeo de Ia Cruz, Asuncion Alcantara and Lily Loy x x x.<br><br>d) To annul the Land Titles fraudulently and directly transferred from the (sic) Dacudao in the names of Defendants Javonillo, Armentano, Romeo de la Cruz and Alcantara, and subsequently to Defendant Lily Loy in the name of Agdao Landless Assiociation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup></blockquote><br>The reliefs sought show that the complaint was filed ultimately to curb the alleged mismanagement of ALRAI's corporate properties. We note that the danger sought to be avoided in <i>Evangelista v. Santos</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> does not exist in this case. In <i>Santos</i>, plaintiff stockholders sought damages against the principal officer of the corporation, alleging that the officer's mismanagement of the affairs and assets of the corporation brought about the loss of the value of its stocks. In ruling against the plaintiff-stockholders, this Court held that "[t]he stockholders may not directly claim those damages <i>for themselves</i> for that would result in the appropriation by, and the distribution among them of part of the corporate assets before the dissolution of the corporation x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> More, in <i>Santos,</i> if only the case was brought before the proper venue, this Court added, "we note that the action stated in their complaint is susceptible of being converted into a derivative suit for the benefit of the corporation by a mere change in the prayer."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>In this case, the reliefs sought do not entail the premature distribution of corporate assets. On the contrary, the reliefs seek to preserve them for the corporate interest of ALRAI. Clearly then, any benefit that may be recovered is accounted for, not in favor of respondents, but for the corporation, who is the real party-in-interest Therefore, the occasion for the strict application of the rule that a derivative suit should be brought in order to protect and vindicate the interest of the corporation does not obtain under the circumstances of this case.<br><br><i>Commart (Phils.), Inc. v. Securities and Exchange Commission</i> (SEC)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> upholds the same principle. In that case, the chairman and board of directors of Commart were sued for diverting into their private accounts amounts due to Commart as commissions. Respondents argued that the Hearing Panel of the SEC should dismiss the case·on the ground that it has no jurisdiction over the matter because the case is not a derivative suit The Hearing Panel denied the motion, and was affirmed by the SEC. Upon appeal, this Court affirmed the decision of the SEC, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The complaint in SEC Case No. 2673, particularly paragraphs 2 to 9 under First Cause of Action, readily shows that it avers the <i>diversion of corporate income</i> into the private bank accounts of petitioner x x x and his wife. Likewise, the principal relief prayed for in the complaint is the recovery of a sum of money <i>in favor of the corporation</i>. This being the case, the complaint is definitely a derivative suit. xxx<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>In any case, the suit is for the benefit of Commart itself, for a judgment in favor of the complainants will necessarily mean recovery by the corporation of the US$2.5 million alleged to have been diverted from its coffers to the private bank accounts of its top managers and directors. Thus, the prayer in the Amended Complaint is for judgment ordering respondents x x x, "to account for and to, turn over or deliver to the Corporation" the aforesaid sum, with legal interest, and "ordering all the respondents, as members of the Board of Directors to take such remedial steps as would protect the corporation from further depredation of the funds and property."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup></blockquote><br>Fourth, based on the records, we find that there is substantial compliance with the requirements of a derivative suit, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>a) [T]he party bringing suit should be a shareholder as of the time of the act or transaction complained of, the number of his shares not being material;<br><br>b) [H]e has tried to exhaust intra-corporate remedies,<i> i.e.,</i> has made a demand on the board of directors for the appropriate relief but the latter has failed or refused to heed his plea; and<br><br>c) [T]he cause of action actually devolves on the corporation, the wrongdoing or harm having been, or being caused to the corporation and not to the particular stockholder bringing the suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup></blockquote><br>Here, the court <i>a quo</i> found that respondents are <i>bona fide</i> members of ALRAI.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> As for the second requisite, respondents also have tried to demand appropriate relief within the corporation, but the demand was unheeded. In their Memorandum before the CA, respondents alleged, thus:<br><br><blockquote>4.18 The occurrence of the series of distressing revelation prompted <u>Respondents to confront Defendant Armentano on the accounting of all payments made including the justification for the illegal distribution of the Donated Land to four persons mentioned in preceding paragraph (4.12) of this memorandum. Unfortunately, Petitioner Armentano merely reasoned their (referring to the four persons) right to claim ownership of the land as compensation for their service and attorney's fees</u>;<br><br>4.19 Anxious of the plan of action taken by the Respondents against the Petitioners, the latter started harassing the unschooled Respondents by unduly threatening them. <u>Respondents simply wanted the land due them, an accounting of the finances of the Association and justification of the illegal disposition of the Donated Land which was donated for the landless members of the Association;</u><br><br>4.20 As a consequence, Petitioners on their own, with grave abuse of power and in violation of the Constitution and By-Laws of the Association maliciously expelled the Respondents particularly those persistently inquisitive about Petitioners' moves and acts which only emphasized their practice of upholding the MOB RULE by presenting solicited signatures of alleged members and non-members written on a scrap of paper signifying confirmation of the ouster (sic) members. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup></blockquote><br>We note that respondents' demand on Armentano substantially complies with the second requirement. While it is true that the complaining stockholder must show that he has exhausted all the means within his reach to attain within the corporation the redress for his grievances, demand is unnecessary if the exercise will result in futility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> Here, after respondents demanded Armentano to justify the transfer of ALRAI's properties to the individual petitioners, respondents were expelled from the corporation, which termination we have already ruled as invalid. To our mind, the threat of expulsion against respondents is sufficient to forestall any expectation of further demand for relief from petitioners. Ultimately, to make an effort to demand redress within the corporation will only result in futility, rendering the exhaustion of other remedies unnecessary.<br><br>Finally, the third requirement for the institution of a derivative suit is clearly complied with. As discussed in the previous paragraphs, the cause of action and the reliefs sought ultimately redound to the benefit of ALRAI. In this case, and as in a proper derivative suit, ALRAI is the party-in-interest and respondents are merely nominal parties.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, and considering further the interest of justice, and the length of time that this case has been pending, we liberally treat this case as one pursued by the corporation to protect its corporate rights. As the court<i> a quo</i> noted, this case "commenced [on] April 2, 2002, blossomed in a full-blown trial and ballooned into seven (7) voluminous rollos."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>We now proceed to resolve the issue of the validity of the transfers of the donated lots to Javonillo, Armentano, DelaCruz, Alcantara and Loy. We agree with the CA in ruling that the TCTs issued in the names of Javonillo, Armentano and Alcantara are void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> We modify the ruling of the CA insofar as we rule that the TCTs issued in the names of Dela Cruz and Loy are also void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> <br><br>One of the primary purposes of ALRAI is the giving of assistance in uplifting and promoting better living conditions to all members in particular and the public in general.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> One of its objectives includes "to uplift and promote better living condition, education, health and general welfare of all members in particular and the public in general by providing its members humble shelter and decent housing."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Respondents maintain that it is pursuant to this purpose and objective that the properties subject of this case were donated to ALRAI.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>Section 36, paragraphs 7 and 11 of the Corporation Code provide:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 36. <i>Corporate powers and capacity</i>. - Every corporation incorporated under this Code has the power and capacity:<br><blockquote><center>x x x<br></center><br>7.

It is therefore important to determine whether the grant or conveyance is pursuant to a legitimate corporate purpose, or is at least reasonable and necessary to further its purpose.<br><br>Based on the records of this case, we find that the transfers of the corporate properties to Javonillo, Armentano, Dela Cruz, Alcantara and Loy are bereft of any legitimate corporate purpose, nor were they shown to be reasonably necessary to further ALRAI's purposes. This is principally because, as respondents argue, petitioners "personally benefitted themselves by allocating among themselves vast track of lands at the dire expense of the landless general membership of the Association."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>We take first the cases of Dela Cruz, Alcantara and Loy.<br><br>We disagree with theCA in ruling that the TCTs issued in the name of Dela Cruz are valid. The transfer of property to him does not further the corporate purpose of ALRAI. To justify the transfer to Dela Cruz, petitioners merely allege that, "[o]n the other hand, the lots given by ALRAI to Romeo de la Cruz were compensation for the financial assistance he had been extending to ALRAI."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> Records of this case do not bear any evidence to show how much Dela Cruz has extended to ALRAI as financial assistance. The want of evidence to support this allegation cannot allow a determination whether the amount of the financial help that Dela Cruz extended to ALRAI is commensurate to the amount of the property transferred to him. The lack of evidence on this point is prejudicial to ALRAI because ALRAI had parted with its property without any means by which to determine whether the transfer is fair and reasonable under the circumstances.<br><br>The same is true with the transfer of properties to Alcantara. Petitioners allege that Alcantara's husband, Atty. Pedro Alcantara, "handled all the legal work both before the Regional Trial Court in Davao City (Civil Case No. 16192) and the Court of Appeals in Manila (CA GR No. 13744). He agreed to render his services although he was being paid intermittently, with just small amounts, in the hope that he will be compensated when ALRAI triumphs in the litigation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Petitioners thus claim that "[b]ecause of the legal services of her husband, who is now deceased, petitioner Alcantara was given by ALRAI two (2) lots x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>Petitioners admit that Atty.

It is generally recognized as valid and binding, but must be laid down in an express contract. In the same case, we have identified the circumstances to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a claim for attorney's fees as follows: (1) the amount and character of the service rendered; (2) labor, time, and trouble involved; (3) the nature and importance of the litigation or business in which the services were rendered; (4) the responsibility imposed; (5) the amount of money or the value of the property affected by the controversy or involved in the employment; (6) the skill and experience called for in the performance of the services; (7) the professional character and social standing of the attorney; (8) the results secured; (9) whether the fee is absolute or contingent, it being recognized that an attorney may properly charge a much larger fee when it is contingent than when it is not; and (10) the financial capacity and economic status of the client have to be taken into account in fixing the reasonableness of the fee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br><br>In this case however, petitioners did not substantiate the extent of the services that Atty. Pedro Alcantara rendered for ALRAL In fact, no engagement or retainer contract was ever presented to prove the terms of their agreement. Petitioners did not also present evidence as to the value of the ALRAI properties at the time of transfer to Alcantara. There is therefore no proof that the amount of the properties transferred to Alcantara, in addition to the legal fees he received, is commensurate (as compensation) to the reasonable value of his legal services. Using the guidelines set forth in <i>Rayos</i>, absent proof, there is no basis to determine whether the transfer of the property to Alcantara is reasonable under the circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup><br><br>The importance of this doctrine in Rayos is emphasized in the Canons of Professional Ethics<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> and the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> In both, the overriding consideration is the reasonableness of the terms of the contingent fee agreement, so much so that the grant of the contingent fee is subject to the supervision of the court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup><br><br><i>Spouses Cadavedo v.

In that case, this Court was confronted with the issue of whether the contingent attorney's fees consisting of one-half of the property that was subject of litigation was valid and reasonable. This Court ruled that the attorney's fee is excessive and unconscionable, and is therefore void. The Court said that as "matters then stood, [there] was not a sufficient reason to justify a large fee in the absence of any showing that special skills and additional work had been involved."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> The Court also noted that Spouses Cadavedo and Atty.

Pedro Alcantara. Further, as adverted to in previous paragraphs, receipts show that intermittent payments as legal fees have already been paid to him. We also note that in this case, not only one-half of a property was transferred to Alcantara as compensation; but two whole parcels of land - one with more or less 400 square meters (TCT No. 41366), and the other with more or less 395 square meters (TCT No. 41367). <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> The amount of fee contracted for, <i>standing alone and unexplained</i> would be sufficient to show that an unfair advantage had been taken of the client, or that a legal fraud had been perpetrated on him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br>Consequently, we also find that Alcantara's subsequent sale to Loy is not valid. Alcantara cannot sell the property, over which she did not have the right to own, in the first place. More, based on the records, the court <i>a quo</i> had already made a finding that Loy is guilty of bad faith as to render her purchase of the property from Alcantara void. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br><br>We likewise find that there is failure to show any legitimate corporate purpose in the transfer of ALRAI's corporate properties to Javonillo and Armentano.<br><br>The Board Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> confirming the transfer of ALRAI's corporate properties to Javonillo and Armentano merely read, "[t]hat the herein irrevocable confirmation is made in recognition of, and gratitude for the outstanding services rendered by x x x Mr. Armando Javonillo, our tireless President and Mrs. Acelita Armentano, our tactful, courageous, and equally tireless Secretary, without whose efforts and sacrifices to acquire a portion of the realty of Dacudao &amp; Sons, Inc., would not have been attained."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> In their Memorandum, petitioners also alleged that "[t]he most difficult part of their (Javonillo and Armentano) job was to raise money to meet expenses. x x x It was very difficult for petitioners Javonillo and Armentano when they needed to pay P300,000.00 for realty tax on the land donated by Dakudao and Sons, Inc. to ALRAI. It became more difficult when the Bureau of Internal Revenue was demanding P6,874,000.00 as donor's tax on the donated lands. Luckily, they were able to make representation with the BIR to waive the tax."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup><br><br>These reasons cannot suffice to prove any legitimate corporate purpose in the transfer of the properties to Javonillo and Armentano. For one, petitioners cannot argue that the properties transferred to them will serve as reimbursements of the amounts they advanced for ALRAL There is no evidence to show that they indeed paid the realty tax on the donated lands. Neither did petitioners present any proof of actual disbursements they incurred whenever Javonillo and Armentano allegedly helped Atty. Pedro Alcantara in handling the cases involving ALRAI.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> Like in the cases of Dela Cruz and Alcantara, absent proof, there was no basis by which it could have been determined whether the transfer of properties to Javonillo and Armentano was reasonable under the circumstances at that time. Second, petitioners cannot argue that the properties are transferred as compensatioh for Javonillo. It is well settled that directors of corporations presumptively serve without compensation; so that while the directors, in assigning themselves additional duties, act within their power, they nonetheless act in excess of their authority by voting for themselves compensation for such additional duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> Even then, aside from the claim of petitioners, there is no showing that Javonillo rendered extraordinary or unusual services to ALRAI.<br><br>The lack of legitimate corporate purpose is even more emphasized when Javonillo and Armentano, as a director and an officer of ALRAI, respectively, violated the fiduciary nature<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> of their positions in the corporation.<br><br>Section 32 of the Corporation Code provides, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 32. <i>Dealings of directors, trustees or officers with the corporation.</i> —A contract of the corporation with one or more of its directors or trustees or officers is voidable, at the option of such corporation, unless all of the following conditions are present:<br><br>1.

Petitioners cannot argue that the transfer of the corporate properties to them is valid by virtue of the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> by the general membership of ALRAI confirming the transfer for three reasons.<br><br>First, as cited, Section 32 requires that the contract should be ratified by a vote representing at least two-thirds of the members in a meeting called for the purpose. Records of this case do not show whether the Resolution was indeed voted by the required percentage of membership. In fact, respondents take exception to the credibility of the signatures of the persons who voted in the Resolution. They argue that, "from the alleged 134 signatures, 24 of which are non-members, 4 of which were signed twice under different numbers, and 27 of which are apparently proxies unequipped with the proper authorization.
