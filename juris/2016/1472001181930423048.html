Thus, respondent Southern Philippines Power Corporation's unilateral installation of an additional sixth engine constitutes an amendment of the Energy Conversion Agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The provision of the First Schedule provides:<br><br><blockquote>1.

To unilaterally add a 6 th engine seven (7) years after the execution of the E[nergy] Conversion] Agreement] just to make certain that it can produce 110% of the nominal capacity is definitely not contemplated by the E[nergy] Conversion] Agreement].<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner argues that it is only liable to pay for energy beyond 50 megawatts when the additional five (5) megawatts comes from the five (5) generating units under the Energy Conversion Agreement that has a total capacity of 56.7 megawatts.

Nonetheless, this Court has, in exceptionally meritorious cases, suspended the technical rules of procedure "in order that litigants may have ample opportunity to prove their respective claims, and that a possible denial of substantial justice, due to legal technicalities, may be avoided.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[60]</sup></font><br><br>In <i>Philippine Bank of Communications </i>v. <i>Yeung,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> this Court adopted a liberal approach to procedural rules and considered the petitioner's motion for reconsideration as having been properly filed before the Court of Appeals, though it was filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The seven (7)-day delay in filing the motion for reconsideration was found to be excusable in light of the merits of the case and because the delay was not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The Court cited <i>Sanchez </i>v. <i>Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> among other cases,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> which sets forth a number of reasons to be considered in suspending procedural rules:<br><br><blockquote>Aside from matters of life, liberty, honor or property which would warrant the suspension of the Rules of the most mandatory character and an examination and review by the appellate court of the lower court's findings of fact, the other elements that should be considered are the following: (a) the existence of special or compelling circumstances, (b) the merits of the case, (c) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules, (d) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory, and (e) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></blockquote><br>Here, petitioner has shown a clear and persuasive reason for this Court to relax the rules. The Energy Regulatory Commission previously allowed petitioner to file its other pleadings through a private courier (such as LBC) despite its prescribed mode on the filing of pleadings being either personally or by registered mail.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> This liberality extended by the Commission on petitioner's earlier filings gave it a reasonable ground to believe that its filing of a motion for reconsideration through the same private courier would be considered sufficient compliance with the Energy Regulatory Commission Rules of Practice and Procedure. Unfortunately, the Motion for Reconsideration reached the Commission four (4) days beyond the due date.<br><br>Petitioner's delay in filing the motion for reconsideration was far from being intentional and dilatory. Petitioner simply followed its usual mode of filing its pleadings, which had been previously acceptable to the Commission. The Energy Regulatory Commission itself adopts a liberal policy in the construction of its Rules of Practice and Procedure "to secure the most expeditious and least expensive determination of every proceeding . . . on its merits."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Hence, the Commission should have given due course to petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration, given petitioner's satisfactory explanation for missing the deadline.<br><br>This notwithstanding, we rule for respondent on the substantive issue. &nbsp;<br><br><b><center>II<br></center></b><br>Under the Eighth Schedule of the Energy Conversion Agreement, petitioner is obliged to pay for the amount of contracted capacity, which is determined by the "actual net [kilowatt] capability of the Power Station <i> nominated </i> and <i>demonstrated </i>by [respondent],<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> subject only to the following limitations:<br><br><blockquote>2.1 such Contracted Capacity may not exceed 110% of the nominal capacity unless NPC so agrees at its sole option and terms; and <br><br>2.2 if at the beginning of any Contract Year the Contractor nominates and demonstrates a Contracted Capacity less than ninety-five (95%) of the Nominal Capacity, such Contracted Capacity shall be applied for the Contract Year, unless the Contractor subsequently requests for another test to nominate and demonstrate an increased amount in which case such increased amount shall be the Contracted Capacity for the remainder of such Contract Year.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></blockquote><br>Referred to in the Agreement as the Capital Recovery Fee, it pertains simply to the amount which petitioner pays for the availability of electricity at an agreed level, whether the electricity is actually used or not.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>The dispute in this case arose in 2005 when respondent installed an additional engine in the Power Station.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> From 2005 to 2010, respondent nominated and demonstrated a capacity of 55 megawatts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Petitioner refused to pay for the additional five (5)-megawatt contracted capacity because it allegedly came from the additional sixth engine, which was outside the; coverage of the Energy Conversion Agreement.<br><br>Contrary to petitioner's stance, a reading of the entire Energy Conversion Agreement and its Schedules reveals no express prohibition against respondent's installation of a sixth engine in its Power Station.<br><br>While paragraph 3.1 of the Agreement's First Schedule states that respondent is responsible for the "complete design, development and construction of the Power Station, consisting of 5 x 18V38 Stork-Wartsila engines with Black Start capability,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> nothing in the Agreement restricts respondent from replacing or adding engines after the Completion Date. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Rather, what is clear from the Project Scope and Specifications enumerated in the First Schedule is respondent's obligation to generate a minimum net capacity of 50 megawatts:<br><br><blockquote><blockquote>3.3 Electro-Mechanical Works<br><br>Supply, installation/erection, tests and commissioning to put into operation the required number of generation units and its corresponding minimum net capacity of 50,000 kW.<br>....</blockquote>4.
