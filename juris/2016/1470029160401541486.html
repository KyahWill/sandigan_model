				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Simultaneously pursuing an appeal (or motion for reconsideration) and a petition for annulment of judgment is an act of forum shopping. This act, which heaps vexation upon courts and parties-litigants, is illustrated by the facts of this case in which conflicting decisions have been rendered by different courts upon the same issue. The actions of respondent City of Makati (Makati) through its counsels is at the border of what appears to be a contumacious attempt to obfuscate the resolution of cases through the abuse of legal processes.<br><br>We grant the Petition.<br><br>This resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> praying that the assailed Court of Appeals Resolutions dated April 30, 2013<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and July 25, 2013<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in CA-G.R.

The Petition for Annulment of Judgment related to the validity of the July 8, 2011 Decision, that is, that it was void for having been rendered by a retired judge. On the other hand, the Motion for Reconsideration <i>Ad Cautelam</i> pertained to the merits of the territorial dispute or to the substance of the respective territorial claims of Taguig and Makati.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Makati also emphasized that pages 21 to 22 of its Petition for Annulment of Judgment contained a verification and certification of non-forum shopping duly signed by the Mayor of Makati, Jejomar Erwin S.

In another Order dated February 13, 2012, which acted on a Motion for Clarification filed by Taguig, the Regional Trial Court, also through Judge Suarez, stated that "<i>the findings of fact and conclusions of law in the Decision dated 8 July 2011, are all in order and soundly based</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Makati then filed a Notice of Appeal <i>Ad Cautelam</i> dated January 3, 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> This appeal before the Court of Appeals was docketed as CA-G.R.

It also assailed the jurisprudence cited by Makati as being inapplicable since in those cases, nullity of the subject cases were "obvious and beyond dispute."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> It underscored its claim that Makati engaged in forum shopping as "[t]here is only one cause of action [which] revolves around the alleged rendition of a wrongful decision."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Makati then filed a Rejoinder<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> dated February 2, 2012 reiterating its position that it did not commit forum shopping. It emphasized that the Motion for Reconsideration <i>Ad Cautelam</i> was merely a precautionary measure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It claimed that the Petition for Annulment of Judgment was not rendered <i>functus officio</i> by the Regional Trial Court's December 19, 2011 Order as that Order included an express recognition that the matter of lack of jurisdiction was a matter in which the trial court would have to defer to the Court of Appeals:<br><blockquote>This Court agrees with Makati on this point. This Court cannot state, at this juncture, if the assailed decision is void for lack of jurisdiction since Makati has already filed a Petition for Annulment of Judgment with the Court of Appeals...

Since Makati had recourse to a motion for reconsideration, its Petition for Annulment of Judgment was premature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals likewise ruled that in filing a Motion for Reconsideration and Petition for Annulment of Judgment, Makati effectively split a single cause of action and thereby engaged in forum shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>On January 21, 2013, Makati moved for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> It argued that the Petition for Annulment of Judgment could not have been rendered <i>functus officio</i> or moot by the Regional Trial Court's December 19, 2011 and February 13, 2012 Orders as these Orders did not replace but merely affirmed the July 8, 2011 Decision penned by Judge Ygaña.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> It also insisted that a Petition for Annulment of Judgment was available to it at any time as the ground it invoked was lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> It maintained that the Petition for Annulment of Judgment and Motion for Reconsideration <i>Ad Cautelam</i> were based on distinct causes of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>In the assailed Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> dated April 30, 2013, the Court of Appeals denied Makati's Motion for Reconsideration. It abandoned its conclusions in its December 18, 2012 Resolution that the Petition for Annulment of Judgment had become <i>functus officio</i> and/or moot and that Makati engaged in forum shopping. However, it maintained that the Petition for Annulment of Judgment was premature:<br><blockquote>After considering the arguments raised by both parties, we agree with petitioner [Makati] that the subsequent orders of the trial court did not render its petition moot ox <i>functus officio</i>, as the subsequent orders did not supplant the assailed Decision but actually affirmed the same. We likewise agree with petitioner that it did not commit forum-shopping. We subscribe to our previous ruling in our Resolution dated May 16, 2012, that the issues raised and the remedies sought by petitioner in the appeal <i>ad cautelam</i> and in this petition for annulment are independent and different from each other. Thus, there was no splitting of cause of action and no forum-shopping committed.<br><br>However, the fact remains that petitioner also pursued its appeal <i>ad cautelam</i> before this Court, which remains pending before its Sixth Division and as correctly pointed out by respondent, the availability of the appeal as an ordinary remedy, which in fact petitioner availed of, renders this extraordinary remedy of an action for annulment of judgment unnecessary or, at the very least, premature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br></blockquote>Alleging that the Court of Appeals' pronouncement that the Petition for Annulment of Judgment was premature was "inconsistent with and emasculated by the pronouncements that the instant petition was not mooted by the subsequent orders of the lower court and that petitioner Makati did not commit forum shopping,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Taguig filed before the Court Appeals what it called a Motion for Clarification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The Motion prayed that "the Resolution dated April 30, 2013 be reinforced with clarificatory pronouncements that the instant petition was rendered moot by the subsequent orders of the lower court through Hon.

Paxton Development Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> explained that:<br><blockquote>Forum shopping is committed by a party who institutes two or more suits in different courts, either simultaneously or successively, in order to ask the courts to rule on the same or related causes or to grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition or increase a party's chances of obtaining a favorable decision or action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br></blockquote><i>First Philippine International Bank v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> recounted that forum shopping originated as a concept in private international law:<br><blockquote>To begin with, forum-shopping originated as a concept in private international law, where non-resident litigants are given the option to choose the forum or place wherein to bring their suit for various reasons or excuses, including to secure procedural advantages, to annoy and harass the defendant, to avoid overcrowded dockets, or to select a more friendly venue. To combat these less than honorable excuses, the principle of <i>forum non conveniens</i> was developed whereby a court, in conflicts of law cases, may refuse impositions on its jurisdiction where it is not the most "convenient" or available forum and the parties are not precluded from seeking remedies elsewhere.<br><br>In this light, <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> says that forum-shopping "occurs when a party attempts to have his action tried in a particular court or jurisdiction where he feels he will receive the most favorable judgment or verdict." Hence, according to <i>Words and Phrases</i>, "a litigant is open to the charge of 'forum shopping' whenever he chooses a forum with slight connection to factual circumstances surrounding his suit, and litigants should be encouraged to attempt to settle their differences without imposing undue expense and vexatious situations on the courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Further, <i>Prubankers Association v.

Thereafter, the Court restated the rule in Revised Circular No. 28-91 and Administrative Circular No. 04-94. Ultimately, the rule was embodied in the 1997 amendments to the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br></blockquote>Presently, Rule 7, Section 5 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a Certification against Forum Shopping be appended to every complaint or initiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief. It also provides for the consequences of willful and deliberate forum shopping:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 7<br>PARTS OF A PLEADING<br></center>. . . .<br><br>SEC. 5. <i>Certification against forum shopping</i>. — The plaintiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other initiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief, or in a sworn certification annexed thereto and simultaneously filed therewith: (a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status thereof; and (c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or similar action or claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initiatory pleading has been filed.<br><br>Failure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall not be curable by mere amendment of the complaint or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice, unless otherwise provided, upon motion and after hearing. The submission of a false certification or non-compliance with any of the undertakings therein shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to the corresponding administrative and criminal actions. <i>If the acts of the party or his counsel clearly constitute willful and deliberate forum shopping, the same shall be ground for summary dismissal with prejudice and shall constitute direct contempt, as well as a cause for administrative sanctions.</i> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Though contained in the same provision of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the rule requiring the inclusion of a Certification against Forum Shopping is distinct from the rule against forum shopping. In <i>Korea Exchange Bank v. Gonzales</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><blockquote>The general rule is that compliance with the certificate of forum shopping is separate from and independent of the avoidance of the act of forum shopping itself. Forum shopping is a ground for summary dismissal of both initiatory pleadings without prejudice to the taking of appropriate action against the counsel or party concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br></blockquote><i>Top Rate Construction</i> discussed the rationale for the rule against forum shopping as follows:<br><blockquote>It is an act of malpractice for it trifles with the courts, abuses their processes, degrades the administration of justice and adds to the already congested court dockets. What is critical is the vexation brought upon the courts and the litigants by a party who asks different courts to rule on the same or related causes and grant the same or substantially the same reliefs and in the process creates the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different fora upon the same issues, regardless of whether the court in which one of the suits was brought has no jurisdiction over the action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br></blockquote>Jurisprudence has recognized that forum shopping can be committed in several ways:<br><blockquote>(1) filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action and with the same prayer, the previous case not having been resolved yet (where the ground for dismissal is <i>litis pendentia</i>); (2) filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action and the same prayer, the previous case having been finally resolved (where the ground for dismissal is <i>res judicata</i>); and (3) filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action but with diiferent prayers (splitting of causes of action, where the ground for dismissal is also either <i>litis pendentia</i> or <i>res judicata</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Similarly, it has been recognized that forum shopping exists "where a party attempts to obtain a preliminary injunction in another court after failing to obtain the same from the original court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>The test for determining forum shopping is settled. In <i>Yap v. Chua, et al.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><blockquote>To determine whether a party violated the rule against forum shopping, the most important factor to ask is whether the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> are present, or whether a final judgment in one case will amount to <i>res judicata</i> in another; otherwise stated, the test for determining forum shopping is whether in the two (or more) cases pending, there is identity of parties, rights or causes of action, and reliefs sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br></blockquote>For its part, <i>litis pendentia</i> "refers to that situation wherein another action is pending between the same parties for the same cause of action, such that the second action becomes unnecessary and vexatious."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> For litis pendentia to exist, three (3) requisites must concur:<br><blockquote>The requisites of <i>litis pendentia</i> are: (a) the identity of parties, or at least such as representing the same interests in both actions; (b) the identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and (c) the identity of the two cases such that judgment in one, regardless of which party is successful, would amount to res judicata in the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br></blockquote>On the other hand, res judicata or prior judgment bars a subsequent case when the following requisites are satisfied:<br><blockquote>(1) the former judgment is <i>final</i>; (2) it is rendered by a court having <i>jurisdiction</i> over the subject matter and the parties; (3) it is a judgment or an order <i>on the merits</i>; (4) there is — between the first and the second actions — <i>identity</i> of parties, of subject matter, and of causes of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>These settled tests notwithstanding:<br><blockquote>Ultimately, what is truly important to consider in determining whether forum-shopping exists or not is the vexation caused the courts and parties-litigant by a party who asks different courts and/or administrative agencies to rule on the same or related causes and/or to grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, in the process creating the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different fora upon the same issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>II</b><br></div><br>Respondent City of Makati pursued two (2) simultaneous remedies: a Petition for Annulment of Judgment under Rule 47 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure (docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 120495); and a Motion for Reconsideration (later, an Appeal, docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 98377).<br><br>There is identity of parties in both cases: the cities of Makati and Taguig.<br><br>Nonetheless, respondent City of Makati argues that it could not have engaged in forum shopping as its Petition for Annulment of Judgment and Motion for Reconsideration/Appeal were based on different causes of action, raised different issues, and sought different reliefs. It asserted that the Petition for Annulment of Judgment related to the validity of the July 8, 2011 Decision, i.e., that it was void for having been rendered by a retired judge. It added that, in contrast, the Motion for Reconsideration/Appeal pertained to the merits of the territorial dispute or the substance of the respective territorial claims of petitioner City of Taguig and respondent City of Makati.<br><br>These arguments are specious considering the basic nature of a Rule 47 Petition, and that of an appeal.<br><br>Rule 47 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure "govern[s] the annulment by the Court of Appeals of judgments or final orders and resolutions in civil actions of Regional Trial Courts for which the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for relief or other appropriate remedies are no longer available through no fault of the petitioner."<br><br><i>Alaban v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> discussed the nature, purpose, and availability of petitions for annulment of judgment:<br><blockquote>An action for annulment of judgment is a remedy in law independent of the case where the judgment sought to be annulled was rendered. <i>The purpose of such action is to have the final and executory judgment set aside</i> so that there will be a renewal of litigation. It is resorted to in cases where the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for relief from judgment, or other appropriate remedies are no longer available through no fault of the petitioner, and is based on only two grounds: extrinsic fraud, and lack of jurisdiction or denial of due process. A person need not be a party to the judgment sought to be annulled, and it is only essential that he can prove his allegation that the judgment was obtained by the use of fraud and collusion and he would be adversely affected thereby.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>No stretch of legal imagination can justify as final and executory the Order assailed in the Petition for Annulment of Judgment filed by respondent City of Makati. It was still subject to appeal. Respondent City of Makati's having availed itself of this remedy is, in fact, the entire impetus for this Decision.<br><br>Rule 47, Section 7 specifies the effect of a judgment granting a Petition for Annulment of Judgment:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">RULE 47<br>ANNULMENT OF JUDGMENTS OR FINAL ORDERS AND RESOLUTIONS<br></div><br>. . . .<br><br>SEC. 7. <i>Effect of judgment</i>. — <i>A judgment of annulment shall set aside the questioned judgment or final order or resolution and render the same null and void</i>, without prejudice to the original action being refiled in the proper court. However, where the judgment or final order or resolution is set aside on the ground of extrinsic fraud, the court may on motion order the trial court to try the case as if a timely motion for new trial had been granted therein. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>While petitions for annulment of judgment are governed by Rule 47 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders (as opposed to Motions for Reconsideration of interlocutory orders) are governed by Rule 37 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 37, Section 1 provides:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 37 <br>NEW TRIAL OR RECONSIDERATION<br></center><br>SECTION 1. <i>Grounds of and period for filing motion for new trial or reconsideration</i>. — Within the period for taking an appeal, the aggrieved party may move the trial court to set aside the judgment or final order and grant a new trial for one or more of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of said party:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Within the same period, the aggrieved party may also move for reconsideration upon the grounds that the damages awarded are excessive, that the evidence is insufficient to justify the decision or final order, or that the decision or final order is contrary to law.<br></blockquote>Rule 37, Section 3 specifies the effect of granting a motion for reconsideration: "If the court finds that excessive damages have been awarded or that the judgment or final order is contrary to the evidence or law, it may <b><i>amend</i></b> such judgment or final order accordingly."<br><br><i>Escquivel v. Alegre</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> discussed the nature of amended judgments and contrasting it with supplemental judgments:<br><blockquote>In an amended and clarified judgment, the lower court makes a thorough study of the original judgment and renders the amended and clarified judgment only after considering all the factual and legal issues. <b>The amended and clarified decision is an entirely new decision which supersedes the original decision...</b> [A] supplemental decision does not take the place or extinguish the existence of the original. As its very name denotes, it only serves to bolster or adds something to the primary decision. A supplement exists side by side with the original. It does not replace that which it supplements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In terms of immediacy of relief, there is a difference between motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, on the one hand, and petitions for annulment of judgment, on the other. The grant of a Motion for Reconsideration grants the movant immediate relief, the court's issuance granting the Motion is itself the amended judgment superseding the original Decision. On the other hand, the grant of a Petition for Annulment of Judgment only allows for a "renewal of litigation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> Nevertheless, the purposes of Motions for Reconsideration and Petitions for Annulment of Judgment are fundamentally the same: the setting aside of a judgment in order that a different, favorable, one may take its place. <b><i>They "grant. . . substantially the same reliefs.</i></b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br><i>Ley Construction and Development Corp. V. Hyatt Industrial Manufacturing Corp.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> involved a civil action for specific performance and damages filed by Ley Construction against Hyatt Industrial. During the proceedings, Ley Construction served notices to take several depositions. The trial court initially allowed the taking of these depositions. Subsequently, however, the trial court issued orders through which it cancelled all the depositions set for hearing, supposedly not to delay the disposition of the case. Ley Construction filed before the Court of Appeals a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure assailing the trial court's (interlocutory) order recalling the taking of depositions. During the pendency of this Petition, the trial court issued the Resolution dismissing Ley Construction's action for specific performance and damages. The Court of Appeals also dismissed Ley Construction's Rule 65 Petition. Ley Construction then appealed to this court. Resolving Ley Construction's appeal, this court stated:<br><blockquote>Third, petitioner's submission that the Petition for Certiorari has a practical legal effect is in fact an admission that the two actions are one and the same. Thus, in arguing that the reversal of the two interlocutory Orders "would likely result in the setting aside of the dismissal of petitioner's amended complaint," petitioner effectively contends that its Petition for Certiorari, like the appeal, seeks to set aside the Resolution and the two Orders.<br><br><i>Such argument unwittingly discloses a recourse to forum shopping</i>, which has been held as "the institution of two or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition." Clearly, by its own submission, petitioner seeks to accomplish the same thing in its Petition for Certiorari and in its appeal: both assail the two interlocutory Orders and both seek to set aside the RTC Resolution.<br><br>Hence, even assuming that the Petition for Certiorari has a practical legal effect because it would lead to the reversal of the Resolution dismissing the Complaint, it would still be denied on the ground of forum shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, in <i>Ley Construction</i>, even if the specific relief sought by the petitioner's Rule 65 Petition was the setting aside of the trial court's orders recalling the taking of depositions, it was recognized that granting this relief would result in the "practical legal effect"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> of setting aside the trial court's dismissal of its Complaint for specific performance and damages. Thus, the petitioner would have "accomplish[ed] the same thing in its Petition for Certiorari and in its Appeal," that is, its Rule 65 Petition and its appeal would have granted practically, or "substantially," the same relief.<br><br><i>Ley Construction</i> discredits respondent City of Makati's claim that it could not have engaged in forum shopping as its Rule 47 Petition and its Motion for Reconsideration/Appeal were grounded on different causes of action.<br><br><i>Ley Construction</i> involved two (2) remedies: first, a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65; and second, an Appeal. Rule 65, Section 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure states that a Petition for Certiorari is available "[w]hen any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction." Thus, a petition for certiorari raises questions of jurisdiction. It does not, in the strict sense, delve into the merits or substance of the case or the proceedings, which allegedly occasioned an error in jurisdiction.<br><br>In <i>Ley Construction</i>, one could have dwelt on the fine distinction between, on one hand, Rule 65 petitions as proceedings grounded on errors in jurisdiction, and, on the other, appeals as proceedings that go into the merits or substance of a case. This is not entirely different from respondent City of Makati's invitation to dwell on the difference between, on one hand, its Rule 47 Petition as assailing the issuance of a judgment without jurisdiction, and, on the other, its Motion for Reconsideration (later, Appeal), as focusing on the substance of its and of petitioner City of Taguig's respective territorial claims.<br><br>Besides, a Rule 47 petition was not even opportune. It was not as though respondent City of Makati was left with no other remedy but a Rule 47 petition. Lack of jurisdiction could have just as easily been raised as an error in its Appeal or in its Motion for Reconsideration. <b><i>It is as much a cause for pursuing a motion for reconsideration or an appeal as it is for pursuing a petition for annulment of judgment.</i></b><br><br>A petition for annulment of judgment is based only on two (2) grounds: first, extrinsic fraud; and second, lack of jurisdiction or denial of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> In contrast, a motion for reconsideration of a judgment or final order may cover "grounds that the damages awarded are excessive, that the evidence is insufficient to justify the decision or final order, or that the decision or final order is contrary to law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br>Rule 37, Section 2 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure spells out what a motion for reconsideration must contain:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 37<br>NEW TRIAL OR RECONSIDERATION<br></center>. . . .<br><br>SEC. 2. <i>Contents of motion for new trial or reconsideration and notice thereof</i>. — The motion shall be made in writing stating the ground or grounds therefor, a written notice of which shall be served by the movant on the adverse party.<br><br>A motion for new trial shall be proved in the manner provided for proof of motion.

The Regional Trial Court conflicted with the Court of Appeals.<br><br>In its December 19, 2011 Order, the Regional Trial Court found that respondent City of Makati engaged in forum shopping:<br><blockquote>The Rules of Court, the code governing judicial procedure, prescribes the remedies (actions and special proceedings) that may be availed of for the myriad reliefs that persons may conceivably have need of and seek in this jurisdiction. <b><i><u>But, that the adjective law makes available several remedies does not imply that a party may resort to them simultaneously or at his pleasure or whim.

Its May 16, 2012 Resolution denying petitioner City of Taguig's Motion to Dismiss absolved respondent City of Makati of the charge of forum shopping. Its December 18, 2012 Resolution granted petitioner City Taguig's Motion for Reconsideration and dismissed respondent City of Makati's Petition for Annulment of Judgment for, among other reasons, forum shopping. Its April 30, 2013 Resolution denied respondent City of Makati's Motion for Reconsideration but abandoned its earlier conclusion that respondent City of Makati engaged in forum shopping. Finally, its July 25, 2013 Resolution granted petitioner City of Taguig's prayer that a pronouncement be made to the effect that respondent City of Makati's Petition for Annulment of Judgment was moot. This Resolution, however, was silent on the matter of forum shopping.<br><br>Respondent City of Makati's actions have not only vexed courts and an adverse litigant. They have actually and already given rise to conflicting decisions, not only between different courts—the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals—but even within the Court of Appeals itself. The damage to the administration of justice is not hypothetical; it is a realized harm.<br><br><center><b>V</b><br></center><br>Rule 7, Section 5 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides that, apart from being a ground for summary dismissal, "willful and deliberate forum shopping . . . shall constitute direct contempt, [and is] a cause for administrative sanctions." Thus, it would be inadequate to stop with a mere declaration that respondent City of Makati, which acted through its counsels, engaged in forum shopping.<br><br>It was among the matters prayed for by petitioner City of Taguig that appropriate sanctions be imposed for respondent City of Makati's wilful and deliberate forum shopping. So too, respondent City of Makati's defenses have been duly pleaded and considered in this case. Under Rule 71, Section 1 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, direct contempt committed against a Regional Trial Court or a court of equivalent or higher rank is punishable by imprisonment not exceeding 10 days and/or a fine not exceeding P2,000.00.
