In his Affidavit<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated November 21, 2011, Gatmaitan, NADECOR Corporate Secretary, attested to the presence of a quorum representing 94.81% of NADECOR's outstanding shares of stock, and the election of new set of its Board of Directors, namely, Calalang, Jose G.

The plaintiffs alleged, among others, that "they had no knowledge or prior notice of, and were thus unable to attend, participate in, and vote at, the said [ASM]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> since they received the notice of the ASM only on August 16, 2011, or one day late, in violation of the three-day notice provided in NADECOR's By-Laws; that due to lack of notice, they failed to attend the said ASM and to exercise their right as stocldiolders to participate in the management and control of NADECOR. They further noted that the notice announced a time and venue different from those set forth in the By-Laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Gatmaitan filed his Answer with Application for Hearing on Affirmative Defenses dated November 18, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Calalang, Romulo, Ayala, Engle and Nitorreda filed their Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim dated November 21, 2011;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and NADECOR filed its Answer dated November 23, 2011.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The defendants sought the dismissal of SEC Case No. 11-164 on the following grounds: that the complaint involved an election contest, since in effect it sought to nullify the election of the Board of Directors of NADECOR for FY2011-2012, and under Section 3, Rule 6 of the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies (Interim Rules),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> it should have been filed within 15 days from the date of the election; that the complaint is not only barred by prescription for having been filed more than two months after the ASM complained of, but the plaintiffs have no cause of action because they were duly served with notice of the said meeting, as shown in the affidavit dated October 13, 2011 of the NADECOR messenger, Mario S. San Juan (San Juan), who mailed the notices on August 11, 2011 at the Ortigas Post Office to all stockholders of record of NADECOR, four days prior to the scheduled ASM; that a valid ASM was held on August 15, 2011, the third Monday of August 2011, at which the required quorum was present and successfully conducted business; that the plaintiffs although physically absent were in fact represented by their proxy, JG Ricafort, by virtue of irrevocable proxies which they executed; that JG Ricafort attended and signed the attendance sheet as the plaintiffs' proxy and participated in the ASM for himself as well as in the plaintiffs' behalf; that the true and beneficial owner of the shares of stock issued in the plaintiffs' names is JG Ricafort, not the plaintiffs, as shown in the Nominee Agreements which they executed; that aided by the irrevocable proxies and Nominee Agreements, JG Ricafort won election to the NADECOR Board.<br><br>In its now assailed Order dated December 21, 2011, the RTC ruled that the petitioners were not validly served with notice of the ASM as required in the Amended By-Laws, and moreover, that their complaint did not involve an election contest, and thus, was not subject to the 15-day prescriptive period for filing an election protest under Section 3, Rule 6 of the Interim Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The trial court explained:<br><br><blockquote>Contrary to defendants' claims, none of the [petitioners] is claiming any elective office in NADECOR. Neither are they questioning the manner and validity of the elections, and qualifications of the candidates for directorship. [Petitioners'] prayer is clear that they seek to have the August 15, 2011 [ASM] declared null and void due to fatal defects committed prior to said meeting. The nullification of the proceedings, including the elections is not only incidental or the logical consequence of a declaration of nullity of the [ASM].<br><br>The complaint, not being an election contest, need not comply with the requirements stated in Rule 6, Section 3 of the Interim Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote><br>The RTC thus declared as "void and of no force and effect" the assailed ASM, nullified all acts performed by the new Board of Directors elected thereat, and ordered the holding within 30 days of another ASM for FY2011-2012, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><i><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b></i>, this Court <i><b>GRANTS</b></i>, as it hereby GRANTS, the relief prayed for in the complaint, and <i><b>[DENIES]</b></i> all compulsory counterclaims for lack of merit.

Any other acts, decisions, deeds, incidents, matters taken up arising from and subsequent to the 2011 [ASM] are hereby likewise declared <i><b>VOID and OF NO FORCE and EFFECT.</b></i><br><br>Defendant NADECOR is hereby directed to: (a) issue a new notice to all stockholders for the conduct of an [ASM] corresponding to the year 2011 since the [ASM] held on August 15, 2011 was declared VOID, ensuring their receipt within three (3) days from the intended date of the annual meeting and (b) hold the [ASM] within thirty (30) days from receipt of this Order.<br><br>No pronouncements as to cost.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The RTC refused to apply the case of <i>Yujuico v. Quiambao</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> invoked by the defendants on the issue of whether SEC Case No. 11-164 involves an election contest. It reasoned that the petitioners did not seek to annul the election of NADECOR's Board of Directors for FY2011-2012, but rather to void all the proceedings had at the August 15, 2011 ASM, and to call for the holding of a new stockholders' meeting, whereas in <i>Yujuico</i> the complaint specifically sought to nullify the results of the election for the new members of the Board of Directors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>As for the irrevocable proxies executed by the plaintiffs in favor of JG Ricafort, the trial court held that the proxies were not valid as they were really only intended as "<i>comfort documents to give [JG Ricafort] control of NADECOR</i>,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and moreover, the proxies must be deemed to have been amended by the Special Power of Attorney<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (SPA) which the plaintiffs executed on April 27, 2010 in favor of JG Ricafort pertaining to NADECOR's ongoing negotiations with Russel Mining and Minerals, Inc. and St. Augustine Mining Ltd.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The RTC Order dated December 21, 2011 elicited the filing in the CA of four separate petitions for certiorari by the private respondents against the plaintiffs, with application for temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or a WPI, to wit:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>CA-G.R.

Thus, by declaring as void all "acts, decisions, deeds, incidents, matters taken up arising <i><b>from and subsequent</b></i> to the 2011 [ASM],"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> things which could only be performed by the newly-elected Board, and then by directing the issuance of a three-day notice for the holding of a new ASM corresponding to FY2011-2012, the trial court clearly understood that a new election should be held for Board of Directors of NADECOR for FY2011-2012, notwithstanding its express ruling that SEC Case No. 11-164 did not involve an election contest and therefore the 15-day prescriptive period to file the petitioners' complaint did not apply.<br><br>But more importantly, the defendants did not fail to point out to the trial court, as the appellate court has made copiously clear in its decision, that contrary to the petitioners' feigned lament that they were unlawfully deprived of their right as stockholders to participate in the ASM due to late notice, they were in fact represented by JG Ricafort under an irrevocable proxy which they executed on April 26, 2010. The defendants further noted that the petitioners even shared the same address as JG Ricafort, who is the husband of petitioner Corazon, and the father of petitioners Jose Manuel and Marie Grace. Thus, the defendants insisted that the petitioners deliberately misled the trial court by pretending to be ignorant of the August 15, 2011 ASM.<br><br>Equally significantly, it has never been plausibly debunked that the real and beneficial owner of the shares in their names is JG Ricafort himself, as shown in the Nominee Agreements<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> which they executed back in 2007; hence, the petitioners' non-participation at the hearings in the RTC. The claimed violation of the petitioners' right as owners to vote their shares in the assailed assembly is thus exposed as a complete fabrication. As the private respondents pointed out in their Comment to the petitioners' Supplemental Petition, JG Ricafort appeared at the RTC hearing on December 2, 2011 and spoke for the petitioners, notwithstanding that he was in fact one of the defendants named in the complaint, being a member of the New Board whom the petitioners wanted ousted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br>As subsequent events since the filing of SEC Case No. 11-164 now amply show, the complaint is traced to a tenacious struggle between two contending groups of stockholders of NADECOR, the petitioners' group and the Calalang group, for control of the fabled riches of the King-king Project. The petitioners' group wanted to rescind NADECOR's MOUs with the St. Augustine group and to bring in a new investor, the Villar group, which the Calalang group strongly opposed. It is not for this Court to say which of the contending stockholders' blocs is justified in the direction they want NADECOR to take, but the Calalang group now blames the petitioners for exposing the NADECOR's all too precious MPSA to the threat of cancellation by the DENR by filing SEC Case No. 11-164. Undoubtedly, the complaint was a clear attempt by, or on behalf of, the petitioners' group to oust the New Board for FY2011-2012. In fact, the petitioners are even represented by the very same law firm which the petitioners' group has employed.<br><br>Under Sections 1 to 3 of Rule 6 of the Interim Rules, SEC Case No. 11-164 should have been dismissed for having been filed beyond the 15-day prescriptive period allowed for an election protest.

Both cases put in issue the validity of the ASM and, expressly in Yujuico and indirectly below, the election of the members of the Board of Directors. The ostensible difference is that in SEC Case No. 11-164 the petitioners invoked lack of notice of the August 15, 2011 ASM, while in Yujuico the ground invoked was improper venue.<br><br>In <i>Yujuico</i>, the Articles of Incorporation of the Strategic Alliance Development Corporation (STRADEC), a domestic corporation engaged in financial and investment advisory services were amended on July 27, 1998 to change its principal office from Pasig City to Bayambang, Pangasinan.

It shall not be requisite to the validity of any meeting of Stockholders that notice thereof whether prescribed by law or by these By-laws, shall have been given to any stockholder who attends in person or by proxy, or to any Stockholder who in writing executed and filed with the records of the meeting either before or after the holding thereof, waives such notice. No notice other than verbal announcement need be given of any adjourned meetings of Stockholders.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup> (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>The shorter notice of three days instead of two weeks for stockholders' regular or special meeting is clearly allowed under Section 50 of the Corporation Code, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 50. Regular and Special Meetings of Stockholders or Members. - Regular meetings of stockholders or members shall be held annually on a date fixed in the by-laws, or if not so fixed, on any date in April of every year as determined by the board of directors or trustees: Provided, That written notice of regular meetings shall be sent to all stockholders or members of record at least two (2) weeks prior to the meeting, <b>unless a different period is required by the by-laws.</b><br><br>Special meetings of stockholders or members shall be held at any time deemed necessary or as provided in the by-laws: Provided, however, That at least one (1) week written notice shall be sent to all stockholders or members, <b>unless otherwise provided in the by-laws.</b><br><br><b>Notice of any meeting may be waived, expressly or impliedly, by any stockholder or member,</b> x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>By failing to file their complaint below seasonably, the petitioners must be deemed to have waived their right to notice of the August 15, 2011 ASM. Section 50 provides in effect that failure to give notice of the regular or annual meetings, when the date thereof is fixed in the by-laws, as in Section 1, Article 1 of the Amended By-Laws of NADECOR,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> which is "<b>at twelve thirty P.M., on the THIRD MONDAY OF AUGUST in each year, if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then on the first day following which is not a legal holiday</b>,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> will not affect the validity of the ASM or the proceedings therein. Thus, it is also provided in Section 3, Article 1 of NADECOR's Amended By-Laws that:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 3. x x x. Failure to give notice of annual meeting, or any irregularity in such notice, <i>shall not affect the validity of such annual meeting or of any proceedings at such meeting</i> (other than proceedings of which special notice is required by law or by these By-laws), x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> (Italics ours)<br></blockquote><br>The Court concludes that the RTC undoubtedly erred in nullifying NADECOR's August 15, 2011 ASM and in not dismissing SEC Case No. 11-164.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions in G.R.
