In any case, the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing the Petition for Certiorari. There was no grave abuse of discretion either in the filing of information in court or in the issuance of the arrest warrant against Napoles.<br><br><center><b>I</b></center><br>Even before the filing of this Petition questioning the Review Resolution, an Information for serious illegal detention has been filed against Napoles. Therefore, with the filing of the Information before the trial court, this Petition has become moot and academic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The trial court has then acquired<i> exclusive</i> jurisdiction over the case, and the determination of the accused's guilt or innocence rests within the sole and sound discretion of the trial court. As explained in <i>Crespo v. Mogul</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The filing of a complaint or information in Court initiates a criminal action. The Court thereby acquires jurisdiction over the case, which is the authority to hear and determine the case. When after the filing of the complaint or information a warrant for the arrest of the accused is issued by the trial court and the accused either voluntarily submitted himself to the Court or was duly arrested, the Court thereby acquired jurisdiction over the person of the accused.<br><br>The preliminary investigation conducted by the fiscal for the purpose of determining whether a <i>prima facie</i> case exists warranting the prosecution of the accused is terminated upon the filing of the information in the proper court. In turn, as above stated, the filing of said information sets in motion the criminal action against the accused in Court. Should the fiscal find it proper to conduct a reinvestigation of the case, at such stage, the permission of the Court must be secured. After such reinvestigation the finding and recommendations of the fiscal should be submitted to the Court for appropriate action. While it is true that the fiscal has the <i>quasi-judicial</i> discretion to determine whether or not a criminal case should be filed in court or not, once the case had already been brought to Court whatever disposition the fiscal may feel should be proper in the case thereafter should be addressed for the consideration of the Court. The only qualification is that the action of the Court must not impair the substantial rights of the accused, [sic] or the right of the People to due process of law.<br>....<br>The rule therefore in this jurisdiction is that once a complaint or information is filed in Court any disposition of the case as its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court. Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>It is true that the Constitution allows the exercise of the power of judicial review in cases where grave abuse of discretion exists.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> In this case, however, a petition for certiorari before this Court was not the "plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> because, as discussed, the trial court already acquired jurisdiction over the case. The proper remedy for Napoles was to proceed to trial and allow the exhaustive presentation of evidence by the parties.<br><br>During the pendency of this Petition, the main case from which the Petition for Certiorari stemmed was decided by the trial court. In its April 14, 2015 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Branch 150 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati City found Napoles guilty beyond reasonable doubt of serious illegal detention, punished under Article 267<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code. She was sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and was ordered to pay Benhur Luy P50,000.00 as civil indemnity and P50,000.00 as moral damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>All the more should this Petition be dismissed. Napoles has been found guilty of serious illegal detention with proof beyond reasonable doubt, a quantum of evidence higher than probable cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Resolving whether there was probable cause in the filing of information before the trial court and in the issuance of an arrest warrant would be "of no practical use and value."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>In any case, despite the mootness of this Petition, we proceed with resolving the issues presented by the parties for the guidance of the bench and the bar.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Resolving this Petition requires an examination of the concept of probable cause. During preliminary investigation, the prosecutor determines the existence of probable cause for filing an information in court or dismissing the criminal complaint. As worded in the Rules of Court, the prosecutor determines during preliminary investigation whether "there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and the respondent is probably guilty thereof, and should be held for trial."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> At this stage, the determination of probable cause is an executive function.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Absent grave abuse of discretion, this determination cannot be interfered with by the courts. This is consistent with the doctrine of separation of powers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, if done to issue an arrest warrant, the determination of probable cause is a judicial function.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> No less than the Constitution commands that "no . . . warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> This requirement of personal evaluation by the judge is reaffirmed in Rule 112, Section 5(a) of the Rules on Criminal Procedure:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><blockquote>SEC. 5.<i> When warrant of arrest may issue</i>. —<br><br>(a) <i>By the Regional Trial Court</i>. — Within ten (10) days from the filing of the complaint or information,<i> the judge shall personally evaluate the resolution of the prosecutor and its supporting evidence.</i> He may immediately dismiss the case if the evidence on record clearly fails to establish probable cause. If he finds probable cause, he shall issue a warrant of arrest, or a commitment order when the complaint or information was filed pursuant to section 6 of this Rule. In case of doubt on the existence of probable cause, the judge may order the prosecutor to present additional evidence within five (5) days from notice and the issue must be resolved by the court within thirty (30) days from the filing of the complaint or information. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Therefore, the determination of probable cause for filing an information in court and that for issuance of an arrest warrant are different. Once the information is filed in court, the trial court acquires jurisdiction and "any disposition of the case as to its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br><center><b>II. A.</b><br></center><br>There was no grave abuse of discretion in the filing of Information against Napoles.&nbsp; The Review Resolution sufficiently explained that during the preliminary investigation stage, there was probable cause to believe that Napoles and Lim, her brother, illegally deprived Benhur Luy of his liberty:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he undersigned hereby ^rules that there is probable cause that respondents committed the crime of Serious Illegal Detention and should be held for trial. Relative thereto, it should be noted that the crime of Serious Illegal Detention has the following elements:<br><blockquote>(1) the offender is a private individual;<br><br>(2) he kidnaps or detains another or in any other manner deprives the latter of his liberty;<br><br>(3) the act of detention or kidnapping is illegal; and<br><br>(4) in the commission of the offense, any of the following circumstances are present: (a) the kidnapping or detention lasts more than 3 days; or (b) it is committed by simulating public authority; or (c) any serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained or threats to kill him are made; or (d) the person kidnapped or detained is a minor, female, or a public officer.<br></blockquote>....<br>Relative to the instant case, there is no question regarding the <i>first element</i>, as both respondents are private individuals. There is no allegation to the contrary that respondents [Reynald] Lim and Janet Lim Napoles are private indiv[i]duals.<br><br>The issue in this case actually revolves around the<i> second element</i> of the crime, which is the question of whether complainant Benhur Luy was actually deprived of his liberty....<br>....<br>[I]t appears that there is sufficient evidence to establish that complainant Benhur Luy was actually deprived of his liberty.<br><blockquote><i>First of all</i>, it is an undisputed fact that complainant Benhur Luy executed an affidavit which detailed the deprivation of his liberty. His elaboration of the deprivation of his liberty should be given weight vis-a-vis the allegations of respondents....<br>....<br><i>Second,</i> the undersigned also finds the claim that complainant Benhur Luy went on a "spiritual retreat" at Bahay San Jose as contrary to human nature (to say the least). The records would show that respondent Janet Lim Napoles was extremely mad at complainant Benhur Luy for obtaining unauthorized loans in her behalf. With the anger of respondent Janet Lim Napoles, the undersigned finds it difficult to believe that complainant Benhur Luy would choose to have a spiritual retreat with priests that are closely associated with respondent Janet Lim Napoles. Why would complainant Benhur Luy choose to stay in an establishment that has close ties with respondent Janet Lim Napoles if the latter was already hell bent on filing a criminal case against him?<br>....<br><i>Sixth</i>, an examination of the facts and circumstances of the instant case leads us to conclude that respondents had motive to deprive complainant Benhur Luy of his liberty. Respondent Janet Lim Napoles averred that she discovered that complainant Benhur Luy illegally obtained two (2) loans in her behalf. This, in turn, angered respondent Janet Lim Napoles, and the latter even threatened to file a criminal case against him.<br><br>However, complainant Benhur Luy's alleged knowledge of the anomalous transactions of JLN Group of Companies would place respondent Janet Lim Napoles in a compromising position. If complainant Benhur Luy is sued, then the latter would not have any choice but to reveal his knowledge on the involvement of JLN in the PDAF, Malampaya and the Fertilizer scams. To avoid this, respondents restrained his liberty, thereupon forcing complainant Benhur Luy's silence.<br><br>Obviously, fishing into the motives of the perpetrators of this crime is an ardent task. However, the undersigned finds that the above-captioned proposition makes more sense than the one proferred by respondents. While the undersigned does not deny that there is evidence that complainant Benhur Luy committed the crime of qualified theft, their defense that he went on a spiritual retreat, [i]n a house with close ties with respondent Janet Lim Napoles, is simply unfathomable to believe.<br><br>Moreover, even if the alleged knowledge of complainant Benhur Luy on the anomalies involving JLN group of companies is disregarded, it is still logical to conclude that the qualified theft committed by the latter created a motive on the part of respondents to detain him.</blockquote>....<br>With regard to the <i>third element</i>, and considering our above conclusion, it is crystal clear that the act of depriving Benhur Luy's liberty is illegal. Both respondents had no authority and/or justifiable reason to detain and deprive complainant Benhur Luy of his liberty.<br><br>As to the <i>fourth element,</i> it is undisputed that complainant Benhur Luy was deprived of his liberty for more than three (3) days. In fact, it lasted for months starting December 2012 up to March 2013, when complainant Benhur Luy was rescued by the NBI.<br><br>Lastly, with regard to the participation of respondent Janet Lim Napoles, it is evident that she was greatly involved in the deprivation of liberty of complainant Benhur Luy. The statements made by Merlita Sunas and Maria Flor ViUanueva clearly manifest respondent Janet Lim Napoles' knowledge of the crime.<br><br>Moreover, Benhur Luy's detention at Bahay San Jose, which has close ties with respondent Janet Lim Napoles, is indicative that she had personal knowledge of what was happening. As earlier ruled, it would be highly illogical for Benhur Luy to have his retreat in a house that has very close ties to Janet Napoles^ In our mind, complainant Benhur Luy's confinement at Bahay San Jose was caused by respondent Janet Lim Napoles.<br>....<br>The most damning link between the crime and respondent Janet Lim Napoles is the motive behind complainant Benhur Luy's deprivation of liberty. Consistent with our earlier finding that the deprivation was undertaken in order to prevent complainant Benhur Luy from divulging information on JLN group of companies' involvement in the Fertilizer Fund, Malampaya and PDAF scams, it is clear that respondent Janet Lim Napoles authored and/or orchestrated this unlawful three (3) month detention.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>It is true that the Review Resolution reversed the initial rinding of lack of probable cause against Napoles and Lim. However, this in itself does not show grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>The very purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to give the prosecutor a chance to correct any errors that he or she may have committed in issuing the resolution ordering the filing of an information in court or dismissing the complaint. "Reception of new evidence is not within the office of a Motion for Reconsideration."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> A reversal may result if a piece of evidence that might have yielded a different resolution was inadvertently overlooked.<br><br>In initially dismissing the criminal complaint filed by Benhur Luy's family, the prosecutor disregarded the purported motive behind Benhur Luy's detention. According to the initial Resolution, whether Napoles and Lim detained Benhur Luy to prevent him from exposing the anomalous transactions of the JLN Group of Companies involving the Priority Development Assistance Fund would spawn an entirely different proceeding; hence, the issue is irrelevant in the proceedings involving the serious illegal detention charge.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Although motive is not an element of a crime, it is a "prospectant circumstantial evidence"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> that may help establish intent. In this case, the Review Resolution sufficiently explained why it was "contrary to human nature"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> for Benhur Luy to go on a three (3)-month spiritual retreat with priests that have close ties with Napoles; and, instead, Benhur Luy had been detained at Bahay ni San Jose, transferred from place to place until he was rescued in Pacific Plaza because he knew first-hand of Napoles' involvement in the pork barrel scam.<br><br><center><b>II. B.</b><br></center><br>Neither was there grave abuse of discretion in the issuance of the arrest warrant against Napoles. That Judge Alameda issued the arrest warrant within the day he received the records of the case from the prosecutor does not mean that the warrant was hastily issued. "Speed in the conduct of proceedings by a judicial or quasi-judicial officer cannot <i>per se </i>be instantly attributed to an injudicious performance of functions. For one's prompt dispatch may be another's undue haste."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Judge Alameda was under no obligation to review the entire case record as Napoles insists. All that is required is that a judge personally evaluates the evidence and decides, independent of the finding of the prosecutor, that probable cause exists so as to justify the issuance of an arrest warrant.
