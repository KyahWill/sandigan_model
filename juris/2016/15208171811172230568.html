It declared the <i>Kasulatan</i> as a contract of antichresis binding upon Benjamin's heirs - the Malance heirs - and conferring on the Magtalas sisters the right to retain the subject land until the debt is paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, the Malance heirs appealed to the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated July 23, 2013, the CA upheld the RTC's findings and declared that: (<i>a</i>) the mere allegation of forgery will not suffice to overcome the positive value of the <i>Kasulatan</i>, a notarized document which has in its favor the presumption of regularity and is conclusive as to the truthfulness of its contents;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and (<i>b</i>) the contract between the parties was a contract of antichresis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> However, it ruled that only the amount of P218,106.84 was actually received by Benjamin as expenses for his medical treatment and the cost of his funeral service/memorial lot,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> while the rest was kept in the custody of the Magtalas sisters' father, Fidel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Considering petitioners' evidence that the subject land has an average annual production of 107 cavans of <i>palay</i> valued at P600.00/cavan, with half of the income expended for costs, and that they had been cultivating the subject land for 6.66 years, the CA ruled that the outstanding amount of the loan is only P4,320.84.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Consequently, it directed the Magtalas sisters to surrender and turn-over the physical possession of the subject land to the Malance heirs upon payment by the latter of the outstanding loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, petitioners moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> contending that: (<i>a</i>) the CA should have imposed interest on Benjamin's loan despite the absence of express stipulation, and applied the fruits from the subject land thereto, and thereafter, to the principal;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and (<i>b</i>) the available receipts for Benjamin's hospitalization were adduced for the purpose of proving that he had valid reason to obtain a loan for his personal use, and should not have been considered as the only proceeds received by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The same was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated June 18, 2015; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issues Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The essential issues for the Court's resolution are whether or not: (<i>a</i>) the CA committed reversible error in ruling that the amount of P218,106.84, representing the duly receipted expenses for Benjamin's medical treatment and the cost of the funeral service/memorial lot, was the only proceeds received from the P600,000.00 loan obligation; and (<i>b</i>) legal interest is due despite the absence of express stipulation.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>Prefatorily, it should be mentioned that the remedy of appeal by <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court contemplates only questions of law, not of fact. While it is not the function of the Court to re-examine, winnow and weigh anew the respective sets of evidence of the parties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> there are, however, recognized exceptions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> among which is when the inference drawn from the facts was manifestly mistaken, as in this case.<br><br>Here, the CA upheld the validity of the <i>Kasulatan</i> between Benjamin and the Magtalas sisters for failure of the Malance heirs to prove their challenge against its due execution and authenticity, ruling further that being a notarized document, it has in its favor the presumption of regularity and is conclusive as to the truthfulness of its contents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Generally, a notarized document carries the evidentiary weight conferred upon it with respect to its due execution, and documents acknowledged before a notary public have in their favor the presumption of regularity which may only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. However, the presumptions that attach to notarized documents can be affirmed only so long as it is beyond dispute that the notarization was regular. <u><b>A defective notarization will strip the document of its public character and reduce it to a private document.</b></u> Consequently, when there is a defect in the notarization of a document, the clear and convincing evidentiary standard normally attached to a duly-notarized document is dispensed with, and the measure to test the validity of such document is preponderance of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>In this case, the Court observes that the <i>Kasulatan</i> was irregularly notarized since it did not reflect any competent evidence of Benjamin's identity, such as an identification card (ID) issued by an official agency bearing his photograph and signature, but merely indicated his Community Tax Certificate Number despite the express requirement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Consequently, having failed to sufficiently establish the regularity in the execution of the <i>Kasulatan</i>, the presumption accorded by law to notarized documents does not apply and, therefore, the said document should be examined under the parameters of Section 20, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court which provides that "[b]efore any private document offered as authentic is received in evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be proved either: (<i>a</i>) [by] anyone who saw the document executed or written; or (<i>b</i>) [by] evidence of the genuineness of the signature or handwriting of the maker."<br><br>The burden falls upon petitioners to prove the authenticity and due execution of the <i>Kasulatan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> which they were, nonetheless, able to discharge. Records show that while the notary public, Atty. Cenon Navarro (Atty. Navarro),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> did not require an ID when he notarized the <i>Kasulatan</i>, when confronted with Benjamin's ID issued by the Office of Senior Citizens Affairs of Pulilan, Bulacan (Senior Citizen ID), he identified the person in the picture as the person who signed the <i>Kasulatan</i>, and received money from the Magtalas sisters in his presence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, respondent Bienvenido Malance's self-serving and uncorroborated testimony that Benjamin's signature on the <i>Kasulatan</i> was forged purportedly because he does not know how to write<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> was contradicted by the Malance heirs' own manifestation that Benjamin has a Senior Citizen ID and that the signature affixed thereon is different from his signature appearing on the <i>Kasulatan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The said ID, however, was not offered in evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> as to enable the RTC, the CA, and the Court to make an examination of the signature thereon vis-a-vis that on the <i>Kasulatan</i>. It is important to note that a finding of forgery does not depend exclusively on the testimonies of expert witnesses and that judges must use their own judgment, through an independent examination of the questioned signature, in determining the authenticity of the handwriting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Hence, the evidence as to the genuineness of Benjamin's signature, and the consequent due execution and authenticity of the <i>Kasulatan</i> preponderate in favor of petitioners, who were likewise able to prove Benjamin's receipt of the amount of P600,000.00 reflected in the <i>Kasulatan</i>. Atty. Navarro testified having prepared the <i>Kasulatan</i> according to the agreement of the parties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and that he witnessed the exchange of money between the parties to the <i>Kasulatan</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> As such, it was erroneous for the CA to conclude that the amount of P218,106.84, representing the duly receipted expenses for Benjamin's medical treatment and the cost of the funeral service/memorial lot, was the only proceeds received from the P600,000.00 loan obligation. Notably, the purpose indicated for the Malance heirs' formal offer of the records and receipts of hospitalization, medicines, and burial expenses of Benjamin was merely "to show proof of expenses incurred by x x x Benjamin x x x relative to his sickness and x x x where he spent the loan he obtained"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> from the Magtalas sisters.<br><br>The Court, however, concurs with the RTC's finding, as affirmed by the CA, that the <i>Kasulatan</i> is a contract of antichresis. Article 2132 of the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 2132. By the contract of antichresis the creditor acquires the right to receive the fruits of an immovable of his debtor, with the obligation to apply them to the payment of the interest, if owing, and thereafter to the principal of his credit.<br></blockquote>Thus, antichresis involves an express agreement between parties whereby : (<u><b><i>a</i></b></u>) the <u><b>creditor will have possession of the debtor's real property</b></u> given as security; (<u><b><i>b</i></b></u>) such creditor <u><b>will apply the fruits of the said property to the interest owed by the debtor, <i>if any</i>, then to the principal amount</b></u>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (<b><u><i>c</i></u></b>) <u><b>the creditor retains enjoyment of such property until the debtor has totally paid what he owes</b></u>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and (<b><i><u>d</u></i></b>) <u><b>should the obligation be duly paid, then the contract is automatically extinguished proceeding from the accessory character of the agreement</b></u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Bearing these elements in mind, the evidence on record shows that the parties intended to enter into a contract of antichresis. In the <i>Kasulatan</i>, Benjamin declared:<br><blockquote><i>Na, ako ay tumanggap ng halagang ANIMNARAANG LIBONG PISO</i> (P600,000.00) <i>salaping Pilipino buhat kina</i> CHARITO M. REYES <i>kasal kay</i> Roberto Reyes <i>at</i> VILMA MARAVILLO <i>kasal kay</i> Domingo Maravilla, Jr., <i>pawang mga sapat na gulang</i>, Pilipino <i>at nagsisipanirahan sa Dulong Malabon, Pulilan, Bulacan, bilang UTANG</i>;<br><br><i>Na, ako ay nangangakong babayaran ang halagang aking inutang sa nasabing sina</i> CHARITO M. REYES <i>at</i> VILMA MARAVILLO, <i>sa kanilang tagapagmana, makakahalili at paglilipatan sa loob ng anim (6) na taon</i>;<br><br><i>Na, upang mapanagutan ang matapat na pagbabayad sa aking pagkakautang ay aking IPINANAGOT ang aking ani ng lupa na matatagpuan sa Dulong Malabon, Pulilan, Bulacan, may sukat na 1 ektarya at kalahati (1 1/2) humigi't kumulang</i>;<br><br><i>Na, kung sa loob ng Ianing na panahon na nabanggit ay mabayaran na ang halaga ng aking inutang sa nasabing sina</i> CHARITO M. REYES <i>at</i> VILMA MARAVILLO <i>at sa kanilang mga tagapagmana, makakahalili at paglilipatan, ang kasulatang ito ay kusang mawawalan ng bisa. tibay at lakas, ngunit kung hindi mabayaran ang halaga ng aking inutang ang kasulatang ito ay mananatiling mabisa, matibay at maaaring ipatupad ayon sa umiiral na batas</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>As aptly observed by the CA:<br><blockquote>The language of the <i>Kasulatan</i> leaves no doubt that the [P]600,00.00 was a loan secured by the fruits or <i>ani</i> of the landholding beneficially owned by Benjamin. The document specifically authorizes [the Magtalas sisters] to receive the fruits of the subject landholding with the obligation to apply them as payment to his [P]600,000.00 principal loan for a period of six (6) years. The instrument provides no accessory stipulation as to interest due or owing the creditors, x x x. No mention of interest was ever made by the creditors when they testified in court. This could only be interpreted that the [Magtalas sisters] have no intention whatsoever to charge Benjamin of interest for his loan. We note also that the <i>Kasulatan</i> is silent as to the transfer of possession of the subject property. However, [the Magtalas sisters] admitted taking possession of Benjamin's landholding after his death on September 29, 2006 and that they have been cultivating it since then. They rationalize that their action is in accord with their agreement with Benjamin when the latter was still alive. They assure the return of the subject property upon full payment of Benjamin's loan by [the Malance heirs], the successors-in-interest of Benjamin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></blockquote>While the <i>Kasulatan</i> did not provide for the transfer of possession of the subject land, the contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the parties show that such possession was intended to be transferred. Atty. Navarro testified that while the <i>Kasulatan</i> only shows that the harvest and the fruits shall answer for Benjamin's indebtedness, the parties agreed among themselves that the lenders would be the one to take possession of the subject land in order for them to get the harvest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Indeed, such arrangement would be the most reasonable under the premises since at that time, Benjamin's medical condition necessitated hospitalization, hence, his physical inability to cultivate and harvest the fruits thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>As antichretic creditors, the Magtalas sisters are entitled to retain enjoyment of the subject land until the debt has been totally paid. Article 2136 of the Civil Code reads:<br><blockquote>Art. 2136. The debtor cannot reacquire the enjoyment of the immovable without first having totally paid what he owes the creditor.<br></blockquote>In the present case, the CA deemed the amount of P600.00 as reasonable cost of a cavan of <i>palay</i> from the subject land, which yields an annual harvest of 107 cavans, or a gross income of P64,200.00;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> half of the income is expended for expenses, resulting to an annual net income of P32,100.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> This, both parties failed to refute. Thus, from June 2006 up to the date of this Decision, only the amount of P326,351.07 is deemed to have been paid on Benjamin's loan, leaving an unpaid amount of P273,648.93, computed as follows:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Amount of indebtedness</td><td width="9%"><div align="right"></div></td><td width="9%"><div align="right">P600,000.00</div></td><td width="58%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="3%">&nbsp;</td><td width="21%">Less: Amount deemed paid</td><td><div align="right"></div></td><td><div align="right"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Annual net income</td><td><div align="right">P32,100.00</div></td><td><div align="right"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>From June 2006 to August 2016</td><td><div align="right"><u>x 10.1667</u></div></td><td><div align="right"><u>326,351.07</u></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Outstanding balance</td><td><div align="right"></div></td><td><div align="right"><u>P273,648.93</u></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The debt not having been totally paid, petitioners are entitled to retain enjoyment of the subject land. Consequently, the Malance heirs' complaint for recovery of possession, declaration of nullity of the <i>Kasulatan</i>, and damages against petitioners must be dismissed.<br><br>As a final matter for resolution, the Court likewise dismisses petitioners' counterclaim for the payment of Benjamin's principal debt, including interest, considering that the same was not yet due and demandable at the time the claim therefor was filed. Particularly, petitioners' counterclaim was prematurely filed on January 4, 2007,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> which was well within the six-year payment period under the <i>Kasulatan</i>, and hence, should be dismissed. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the dismissal of petitioners' counterclaim is without prejudice to the proper exercise of the Magtalas sisters' rights under Article 2137 of the Civil Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> now that Benjamin's debt is due and demandable. In the meantime, the Magtalas sisters, as antichretic creditors, are directed to henceforth render an annual accounting<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> to the Malance heirs, as represented by Bienvenido Malance, of the annual net yield from the subject land, until such time that they have completely collected the outstanding balance of said debt.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated July 23, 2013 and the Resolution dated June 18, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
