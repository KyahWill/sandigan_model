Golez reiterated their argument that there is no cause of action for unlawful detainer because Domingo's protest over the Sps.

Golez on Lot 1025, despite the respondents' demand for them to vacate the property and the finality of the Court's decision in the quieting of title case - which declared that the Sps. Golez do not own Lot 1025 - constituted the act of unlawfully detaining the property from its owner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The RTC explained that there was<b> no tolerance or permission</b> on the part of Domingo on the construction of the Sps.

Golez, instead of making representations with the respondents about the matter, filed a civil action for quieting of title which interrupted the one-year prescriptive period for the respondent heirs to file an action for unlawful detainer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The RTC found that the Supreme Court's Order denying the motion for reconsideration on the civil action for quieting of title case was only received by the respondent heirs on March 7, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Since the complaint for unlawful detainer was filed on February 17, 2009, or eleven (11) months and fifteen (15) days from their receipt of the Order, the action for unlawful detainer was filed within the one-year prescriptive period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The Sps.

Golez argued that the prudent way to proceed with the case is for the CA to wait for the resolution of the Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (<i>DENR resolution</i>) on the respondents' free patent application over Lot 1025.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br><u><center><b>The CA Ruling</b></center></u><br>In its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> dated March 18, 2011, the CA dismissed the appeal and affirmed the MCTC and RTC decisions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The CA held that it does not need to wait for the DENR Secretary resolution on the respondents' free patent application over Lot 1025 because the Supreme Court has already ruled that the respondents are the lawful and rightful owners of Lot 1025.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>On April 18, 2011, the Sps.

Golez manifested that the Office of the DENR Secretary rendered a decision, awarding a 400-squre meter portion, out of the 1,484 square meter total area, of Lot 1025 to the Sps. Golez and that the same should be considered by the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> dated March 8, 2012, the CA denied the motions reasoning that the Sps.

Golez raises the following issues before us:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER CASE FILED BY THE RESPONDENTS AGAINST THE PETITIONERS WAS PROPER.<br><br><center>II.</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE APPLICATION FOR FREE PATENT FILED BY THE RESPONDENTS OVER LOT 1025 IS A SUPERVENING EVENT THAT SHOULD HAVE EXPUNGED THE DECISION IN THE QUIETING OF TITLE CASE.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote><br><u><center><b>OUR RULING</b></center></u><br><b>We grant the petition.</b><br><br>The core issue in this case is whether an action for unlawful detainer is the proper remedy.<br><br>Section 1, Rule 70 of the Revised Rules of Court, states that a person deprived of possession of land "by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth," or a person against whom the possession of any land "is unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination of the right to hold possession, by virtue of any contract, express or implied," may at any time "within one (1) year after such unlawful deprivation or withholding of possession, bring an action in the proper Municipal Trial Court against the person or persons unlawfully withholding or depriving of possession."<br><br>The Rule defines two entirely distinct causes of action, to wit: (a) action to recover possession founded on illegal occupation from the beginning — forcible entry; and (b) action founded on unlawful detention by a person who originally acquired possession lawfully — unlawful detainer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The law and jurisprudence leave no doubt that what determines the cause of action is the nature of the defendants' entry into the land. If the entry is illegal, then the cause of action against the intruder is forcible entry. If, on the other hand, the entry is legal but thereafter possession becomes illegal, the cause of action is unlawful detainer. The latter must be filed within one year from the date of the last demand.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><i><b>No cause of action for an<br>unlawful detainer.</b></i><br><br>Unlawful detainer is a summary action for the recovery of possession of real property. This action may be filed by a lessor, vendor, vendee, or other person against whom the possession of any land or building is unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination of the right to hold possession by virtue of any contract, express or implied. A complaint for unlawful detainer must allege that: (a) the possession of the defendant was originally legal, as his possession was permitted by the plaintiff on account of an express or implied contract between them; (b) the defendant's possession became illegal when the plaintiff demanded that the defendant vacate the subject property due to the expiration or termination of the right to possess under the contract; (c) the defendant refused to heed such demand; and (d) the case for unlawful detainer is instituted within one year from the date of last demand.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The allegations in the complaint determine both the nature of the action and the jurisdiction of the court. The complaint must specifically allege the facts constituting unlawful detainer. In the absence of these factual allegations , an action for unlawful detainer is <b>not</b> the proper remedy and the municipal trial court does not have jurisdiction over the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>In the <i>Complaint</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> the respondents presented the following allegations to show unlawful detainer:<br><blockquote><center>x x x</center><br><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">3. </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">During his lifetime, Domingo Bertuldo is the absolute owner and actual possessor of Lot 1025, Pilar Cadastre situated at Barangay Aranguel, Pres.

In an unlawful detainer, the possession of the defendant was originally legal and his possession was permitted by the owner through an express or implied contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>In the present case, paragraph 6 of the complaint clearly characterized the Sps. Golez's possession of Lot 1025 as <b>unlawful from the start</b> and bereft of contractual or legal basis. Domingo <b>did not tolerate</b> the possession of Sps. Golez since he had immediately objected and protested over the construction of Sps. Golez's house on Lot 1025. Notably, the RTC expressly found that there was <b>no tolerance or permission</b> on the part of Domingo on the construction of the Sps. Golez house on Lot 1025.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Since tolerance has not been effectively alleged in the complaint, the complaint fails to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer. Therefore, the MCTC had no jurisdiction over the respondents' complaint.<br><br>Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the complaint sufficiently stated a cause of action, the respondents still failed to prove that they or Domingo tolerated the Sps. Golez's possession on account of an express or implied contract between them.<br><br>In <i>Sps. Valdez v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> the Court ruled that where the complaint did not satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of a valid cause for unlawful detainer, the municipal trial court had no jurisdiction over the case. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>To justify an action for unlawful detainer, it is essential that the plaintiffs supposed acts of tolerance must have been present right from the start of the possession which is later sought to be recovered. Otherwise, if the possession was unlawful from the start, an action for unlawful detainer would be an improper remedy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote><br>To emphasize, the respondents' allegation of "tolerance" in the <i>Complaint</i> is unsubstantiated by the evidence on record and contradicted by the allegation that the Sps. Golez's entry on Lot 1025 was unlawful from the very beginning.<br><br>In <i>Sarona, et al. v. Villegas, et al.</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> the Court cited Prof. Arturo M. Tolentino's definition and characterizes "tolerance" in the following manner:<br><br><blockquote>Professor Arturo M. Tolentino states that acts merely tolerated are "those which by reason of neighborliness or familiarity, the owner of property allows his neighbor or another person to do on the property; they are generally those particular services or benefits which one's property can give to another without material injury or prejudice to the owner, who <i>permits</i> them out of friendship or courtesy." He adds that: "[t]hey are acts of little disturbances which a person, in the interest of neighborliness or friendly relations, <i>permits</i> others to do on his property, such as passing over the land, tying a horse therein, or getting some water from a well." And, Tolentino continues, even though "this is <i>continued</i> for a long time, no right will be acquired by prescription." Further expounding on the concept, Tolentino writes: "There is tacit consent of the possessor to the acts which are merely tolerated. Thus,<i> not every case of knowledge and silence</i> on the part of the possessor <i>can be considered mere tolerance</i>. By virtue of tolerance that is considered as an authorization, permission or license, acts of possession are realized or performed. <b>The question reduces itself to the existence or non-existence of the permission.</b>" [emphasis supplied]</blockquote><br>The Court has consistently adopted the position that tolerance or permission must have been present at the beginning of possession. If the possession was unlawful from the start, an action for unlawful detainer would not be the proper remedy and should be dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Thus in Sarona, the Court explained:<br><br><blockquote>A close assessment of the law and the concept of the word "tolerance" confirms our view heretofore expressed that such tolerance must be present right from the start of possession sought to be recovered, to categorize a cause of action as one of unlawful detainer — not of forcible entry. Indeed, to hold otherwise would espouse a dangerous doctrine. And for two reasons: <i>First</i>. Forcible entry into the land is an open challenge to the right of the possessor. Violation of that right authorizes the speedy redress — in the inferior court — provided for in the rules. If one year from the forcible entry is allowed to lapse before suit is filed, then the remedy ceases to be speedy; and the possessor is deemed to have waived his right to seek relief in the inferior court.<i> Second.</i> If a forcible entry action <i>in the inferior court</i> is allowed after the lapse of a number of years, then the result may well be that no action of forcible entry can really prescribe. No matter how long such defendant is in physical possession, plaintiff will merely make a demand, bring suit in the inferior court — upon a plea of tolerance to prevent prescription to set in — and summarily throw him out of the land. Such a conclusion is unreasonable. Especially if we bear in mind the postulates that proceedings of forcible entry and unlawful detainer are summary in nature, and that the one year time-bar to the suit is but in pursuance of the summary nature of the action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></blockquote><br>It is not the first time that this Court adjudged contradictory statements in a complaint for unlawful detainer as a basis for dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> In <i>Unida v. Heirs of Urban</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the plaintiffs claim that he merely tolerated the defendant's possession was contradicted by the allegation that the entry to the subject property was unlawful from the very beginning. The Court then ruled that the unlawful detainer action should fail.<br><br>In these lights, the Sps. Golez's possession should be deemed <b>illegal from the beginning </b>and the proper action which the respondents should have filed was one for forcible entry. An action for forcible entry, however, prescribes one year reckoned from the date of the defendant's actual entry into the land.<br><br>In the present case, the Sps. Golez entered the property immediately after the sale in 1976. Thus, their action for forcible entry had already prescribed.<br><br>Since the action for forcible entry has already prescribed, one of the remedies for the respondent heirs to recover the possession of Lot 1025 is <i>accion publiciana</i>. <i>Accion publiciana</i> is the plenary action to recover the right of possession which should be brought to the proper Regional Trial Court when dispossession has lasted for more than one year. It is an ordinary civil proceeding to determine the better right of possession of realty independently of title.<br><br>In other words, if at the time of the filing of the complaint more than one year had elapsed since the defendant had turned the plaintiff out of possession or the defendant's possession had become illegal, the action will be not one of forcible entry or unlawful detainer, but an <i>accion publiciana</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>In these lights, we no longer find it necessary to pass upon the other issue raised in the present petition.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> we hereby <b>GRANT</b> the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.
