Adriatico (Adriatico) to adjust and release their monthly retirement pensions based on the salary levels now being received by the Chairman and Members of the ERC, created by Republic Act (R.A.)

No. 172, the Chairman and Members of ERB were entitled to retirement benefits and privileges equal to those received by the Chairman and Members of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC):<br><br><blockquote><b>Sec. 1</b>.<i> Energy Regulatory Board</i>. There is hereby created an independent Energy Regulatory Board, hereinafter referred to as the Board, the nucleus of which shall be the present Board of Energy. The Board shall be composed of a Chairman and four (4) Members to be appointed by the President, with the consent of the Commission on Appointments, x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The Chairman of the Board shall receive a compensation equal to that of a Department Undersecretary while the Board Members shall each receive a compensation equal to that of an official next in rank to a Department Undersecretary.<br><br><b>The Chairman and the Members of the Board, upon completion of their terms or upon becoming eligible for retirement under existing laws shall be entitled to the same retirement benefits and privileges provided for the Chairman and Members of the Commission on Elections</b>. (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>Also, Section 2-A of R.A. No. 1568,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> as amended by R.A. No. 3595,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> provides that in case the salary of the Auditor General or the Chairman or any Member of the COMELEC is increased or decreased, such increased or decreased salary shall, for the purpose of the said Act, be deemed to be the salary or the retirement pension which shall be received by the retired Auditor General or Chairman or any Member of the COMELEC.<br><br>Subsequently, on June 8, 2001, R.A. No. 9136 was passed to reform and restructure the electric power industry and privatize the National Power Corporation (NPC). It abolished the ERB and created the ERC as an independent regulatory body vested with quasi-judicial, quasi-legislative and administrative functions to oversee the electric industry. In addition to ERB's traditional functions to regulate electric rates and services, the ERC focuses on two primary responsibilities: (1) to ensure consumer education and protection; and (2) to promote competitive operations in the electricity market.<br><br>Section 39 of R.A. No. 9136 thereof provides for the retirement benefits of the Chairman and Members of the ERC, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>Sec. 39</b>. <i>Compensation and Other Emoluments for ERC Personnel. </i>- x x x.<br><br>The Chairman and members of the Commission shall initially be entitled to the same salaries, allowances and benefits as those of the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, respectively. <b>The Chairman and the members of the Commission shall, upon completion of their term or upon becoming eligible for retirement under existing laws, be entitled to the same retirement benefits and the privileges provided for the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, respectively</b>. (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>The petitioners filed a petition for <i>mandamus</i> before the CA wherein they sought to compel the ERC and the DBM to adjust their monthly pensions. The petitioners argued-that, as retired members of the ERB, they are entitled to the retirement benefits provided in Section 39 of R.A. No. 9136, in relation to Section 2-A of R.A. No. 1568.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>To bolster their claim, they invoked the Decision dated August 29, 2007 of the CA 13<sup>th</sup> Division in CA-G.R. SP No. 89068, entitled "<i>Edward C. Castaneda, Arnaldo P. Baldonado and Welma T. Sicangco v. Hon. Eduardo R. Ermita, in his capacity as the Executive Secretary of the Office of the President and the [ERC]</i>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In CA-G.R. SP No. 89068, the petitioners therein, retired Members and Commissioners of the ERB, requested an adjustment in their monthly pensions under R.A. No. 9136. Their request, however, was denied on the ground that ERB has been abolished and that it was a completely different entity from the ERC. On appeal to the Office of the President (OP), the same was denied which prompted the petitioners therein to file a petition for review with the CA. On August 29, 2007, the CA 13<sup>th</sup> Division ruled that the petitioners therein were entitled to adjustments in their monthly pensions corresponding to the current levels of salaries and benefits given to the ERC Chairman and Members. There being no appeal, the ruling became final and executory on January 5, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In a subsequent case also before the CA, CA-G.R. SP No. 89095, entitled "<i>Retired Chairmen of the [ERB, et al.] v. The [ERC] and the Department of Justice,"</i> a similar request dated July 16, 2002 for adjustment in their monthly pensions was filed in the ERC by retired ERB Chairmen Ponciano G.A. Mathay (Mathay) and Rex V. Tantiongco (Tantiongco) and retired ERB Members Oscar E. Ala (Ala) and J. Mario Laqui (Laqui). The ERC denied the request in a letter dated August 16, 2002 on the ground that the retirement provisions under E,O. No. 172 were inconsistent with those in R.A. No. 9136. After the ERC denied their motion for reconsideration, the petitioners therein appealed to the OP. The Department of Justice (DOJ), to which the OP endorsed the request, ruled against it, but on motion for reconsideration the DOJ advised the petitioners therein to seek the opinion of the DBM. Instead of heeding the DOJ's advice, the petitioners therein sought the OP's final ruling. In its letter-decision dated February 18, 2005, the OP denied their request, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>We have carefully considered the legal arguments you presented in your letter, together with all the documents attached therewith. After a thorough analysis of the existing laws and jurisprudence on the matter, we concur with the legal opinion of the former [DOJ] Simeon A. Datumanong in his 1<sup>st</sup> Indorsement dated 17 October 2003.<br><br>In this regard, we regret to inform you that we cannot accede to your request.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>Meanwhile, on April 16, 2008, herein petitioners together with Mathay, Tantiongco and Ala wrote then ERC Chairman Rodolfo Albano, Jr. asking anew for the upgrading of their monthly pensions. They contended that they were similarly situated with the petitioners in CA-G.R. SP No. 89068.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Without waiting for the ERC to resolve their request, Mathay, Tantiangco, Ala, and the estate of Laqui filed a petition with the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No." 89095,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> assailing the OP letter-decision dated February 18, 2005. On May 9, 2008, the CA 10<sup>th</sup> Division declared that the petitioners therein were entitled to the same retirement benefits granted to the Chairman and Members of the COMELEC. However, on motion for partial reconsideration, the CA on October 15, 2008 reversed its decision and declared them entitled to monthly pensions corresponding to the current salary levels of the ERC Chairman and Members, citing the expediency of avoiding conflicting decisions between the different divisions of the appellate court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Acting on the letter-request dated April 16, 2008 of the petitioners, former Congresswoman Ducut who took over as Chairman of the ERC referred the matter to Adriatico, Bureau-A Director of the DBM. In her Opinion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> dated June 29, 2009, Adriatico denied their request for pension adjustment, stating that R.A. No. 9136 specifically refers only to the retirement benefits due to members of the ERC, and the ruling in CA-G.R. SP No. 89068 cannot serve as a precedent since only decisions of the Supreme Court (SC), interpreting the laws form part of the country's legal system.<br><br>After the denial of their letter-request for pension adjustment, the petitioners filed the petition for <i>mandamus</i> in the CA to compel the ERC and the DBM to adjust and release their monthly pensions to keep up with the salary levels of the ERC Chairman and Members. On May 13, 2010, the CA Special 2<sup>nd</sup> Division dismissed the petition for lack of legal basis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition interposing the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS NO LAW GRANTING THE PETITIONERS THE RIGHT TO RETIREMENT PENSIONS EQUIVALENT TO THE PRESENT SALARIES OF THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE ERC.<br><br><center>II.</center><br>WHETHER OR NOT<i> MANDAMUS</i> IS THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b></center><br><br>The petition is bereft of merit.<br><br><b><i>Mandamus</i> does not lie since the<br>petitioners failed to invoke a law <br>specifically enjoining the performance<br>of the act demanded.</b><br><br>Central to the resolution of the present controversy is Section 29(1) of Article VI of the 1987 Constitution which commands that "[n]o money shall be paid out of the Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law." The burden of proof thereof, rests upon the petitioners.<br><br>Moreover, Section 3, Rule 65 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Sec. 3</b>. <i>Petition for mandamus</i>. - When any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent, immediately or at some other time to be specified by the court, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights of the petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner by reason of the wrongful acts of the respondent.<br></blockquote><br>Thus, the writ of <i>mandamus</i> shall only issue to command a tribunal, corporation, board or person to do an act that is required to be done, when he or it, unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office, to which such other is entitled, there being no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. The remedy of <i>mandamus</i>, then, is available only to compel the performance of a ministerial duty.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In contrast to a discretionary act, a ministerial act is one in which an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to a mandate of legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of an act done.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Clearly, for <i>mandamus</i> to issue, it is essential that the person petitioning for it has a clear legal right to the claim sought. It will not issue to compel compliance with a duty which is questionable or over which a substantial doubt exists. Unless the right to the relief sought is unclouded, it will be denied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Section 1 of E.O. No. 172, the law under which the petitioners retired, specifically provides that the "<i>[t]he Chairman and the Members of the [ERB], upon completion of their terms or upon becoming eligible for retirement under existing laws shall be entitled to the same retirement benefits and privileges provided for the Chairman and Members of the [COMELEC]</i>." In contrast, Section 39 of R.A. No. 9136 provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Sec. 39</b>. <i>Compensation and Other Emoluments for ERC Personnel.</i> -<br><br>xxx.<br><br>The Chairman and members of the Commission shall initially be entitled to the same salaries, allowances and benefits as those of the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, respectively. The Chairman and the members of the Commission shall, upon completion of their term or <b>upon becoming eligible for retirement under existing laws, be entitled to the same retirement benefits and the privileges provided for the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, respectively</b>.</blockquote><br>Section 3, Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, speaks of a law which specifically enjoins an act to be performed as a duty by a tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person. The petitioners' request requires an interpretation of Section 39 of R.A. No. 9136 as applicable to ERB retirees under E.O. No. 172; yet, nowhere does R.A. No. 9136 extend the benefits of the new law to them, much less impose a duty upon the ERC and the DBM to adjust the retirement pensions of the petitioners to conform to the retirement benefits of the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the SC.<br><br>R.A. No. 9136 has expressly abolished the ERB. Section 38 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 38. <i>Creation of the Energy Regulatory Commission.</i> - There is hereby created an independent, quasi-judicial regulatory body to be named the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). For this purpose, the existing Energy Regulatory Board (ERB) created under Executive Order No. 172, as amended, is hereby abolished.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>The ERC assumed the extant duties and functions of the ERB, but in addition, the ERC also performs <b>new</b> and <b>expanded</b> functions intended to meet the specific needs of a <b>restructured electric power industry</b>. In <i>Kapisanan ng mga Kawani ng ERB v. Commissioner Barin</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the Court compared the functions of the ERB and the ERC and ruled that the overlap in their powers and functions did not mean that there was no valid abolition of the ERB.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Moreover, in <i>National Land Titles and Deeds Registration Administration v. Civil Service Commission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the Court discussed:<br><br><blockquote>[I]f the newly created office has substantially new, different or additional functions, duties or powers, so that it may be said in fact to create an office different from the one abolished, even though it embraces all or some of the duties of the old office it will be considered as an abolition of one office and the creation of a new or different one. The same is true if one office is abolished and its duties, for reasons of economy are given to an existing officer or office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>Incidentally, in <i>Ocampo v. Commission on Audit,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> where a petition was filed by herein petitioner Ocampo, concerning whether she was twice entitled to retirement benefits on account of having sat in the ERB twice, first as a regular Member, and after her retirement, as Chairman; the Court held among others, that Ocampo was entitled to the retirement benefits under R.A. No. 3595.<br><br><b>The petitioners, retired members of<br>the abolished ERB, cannot demand the <br>retirement benefits granted to members<br>of a new entity, the ERC.</b><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), in its Comment in CA-G.R. SP No. 89068, citing <i>Freedom from Debt Coalition v. ERC</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> agreed that this Court has recognized the abolition of the ERB by R.A. No. 9136; that, there is no automatic adjustment in the monthly pensions of the ERB retirees since there was no appropriation for such disbursement; that while the powers of the ERB had been transferred to ERC, new and expanded powers were also granted to the ERC consistent with the revamp and restructuring of the entire system of regulation of the electric power industry. The OSG concluded that concerning their retirement pensions, the petitioners could not equate themselves to the. Commissioners of the ERC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In contrast, in its Comment in the instant petition citing Section 2-A of R.A. No. 1568, as amended by R.A. No. 3595, the OSG noted that "the new compensation package under R.A. No. 9136 resulted in a great disparity between the retirement benefits being received by officials who retired under E.O. No. 172 and those that would be received upon retirement by the current Chairman and Members of the ERC."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It now argues that the petitioners retired under E.O. No. 172, which entitled them to an adjustment in their monthly pensions "<i>in case there would be an increase in the salaries and benefits being received by those presentlyholding the positions they previously held;</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and that since R.A. No. 9136 did not expressly repeal the provisions relating to the retirement benefits of the Chairman and Members of the ERB, the benefits of R.A. No. 9136 should be extended to them.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[28]</sup></font> In CA-G.R. SP No. 89095, the appellate court said:<br><br><blockquote>It must be stressed that, while the provision of <i>R.A. No. 9136</i> abolishing the ERB was declared as valid by the [SC], nonetheless, <b>it did not pronounce that the abolition had the effect of depriving and/or hindering retirees under the already-abolished law from seeking the readjustment of their retirement benefits.</b><br><br>Moreover, while the retirement benefits provided under <i>E.O. No. 172 </i>may appear to be inconsistent with those provided under <i>R.A. No. 9136</i>, emphasis is laid that <b>the inconsistency relates only to what the retirement benefits shall consist of, and not to the grant or readjustment of the same <i>per se</i></b>. In other words, while the retirement benefits granted under <i>R.A. No. 9136</i> are different from those under<i> E.O. No. 172,</i> one undisputable fact remains -<b><i>R.A. No. 9136</i> contains no provision expressly stating that the abolition of the ERB carries with it the abolition, diminution, or curtailment of the right to seek readjustment of the retirement benefits granted under <i>E.O. No. 172</i></b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Citation omitted and emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>Yet, the same CA decision clearly ruled that "the [petitioners' retirement benefits should be based on the salaries of the current COMELEC Chairman and Members, <b>and not on the salaries of the current ERC Chairman and members,</b>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Given the above, it is manifestly clear that Section 80 of R.A. No. 9136 stating that, [<i>T]he applicability provisions of x x x [E.O, No.] 172, as amended, creating the ERB; xxx <b>shall continue to have full force and effect except insofar as they are inconsistent with this Act</b> x x x</i> [It] should be construed to mean that, <b>since there is no express provision in <i>RA. No. 9136</i> pertinent to the retirement benefits granted to retirees under <i>E.O. No. 172</i>, it follows then that <i>E.O. No. 172</i> continues to be the controlling law on the matter</b>. Specifically, the controlling provision respecting the retirement benefits of Chairmen and Members of the ERB is, therefore, Section 1(6) of E.O. No. 172, which states that<i> x x x [t]he Chairman and the Members of the Board, x x x <b>shall be entitled to <u>the same retirement benefits and privileges provided for the Chairman and Members of the [COMELEC]</u></b></i>. Perforce, whether or not Section 2-A of R.A. No. 1568, as amended, is applicable to the Petitioners may already be of no moment because Section 1 (6) of E. O. No. 172 already <b>clearly and literally states</b> that they are entitled to the same retirement benefits granted to the Chairman and Members of the COMELEC.<br><br>All said, Our position that the Petitioners are entitled to have their retirement benefits readjusted is bolstered by the final and executory decision, August 29, 2007, rendered in CA-GR SP No. 89068 by the Thirteenth Division of this Court over which We take judicial notice of, as the same involved the same issue as the one raised at bench. At this juncture, mention must also be made that, during the pendency of the said case, the ERC issued a Resolution reversing its findings that the Petitioners are not entitled to an automatic readjustment and maintaining that it totally supports their cause, as the same is meritorious.<br><br>Stress, however, is laid that the Petitioners' retirement benefits should be based on the salaries of the current COMELEC Chairman and Members, and not on the salaries of the current ERC Chairman and members.<br><br><b><i>To explicate</i></b>. Section 1(6) of E.O. No. 172 clearly states that<i> x x x [t]he Chairman and the Members of the Board, x x x <b>shall be entitled to <u>the same retirement benefits and privileges provided for the Chairman and Members of the [COMELEC]</u></b></i>. Applying the horn-book doctrine that, <i>where the words of the statute are clear, plain, and free from ambiguity, it must he given its literal meaning and applied without attempted interpretation,</i> it is therefore beyond cavil that the retirement benefits of retired ERB Chairmen and Members shall be based on and the same as that granted to Chairman and Members of the COMELEC. In other words, it is the increase in the benefits of the current Chairman and Members of the COMELEC, <u>not those of the ERC</u>, which has the effect of rendering a corresponding increase in the Petitioners' retirement benefits.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31] </sup>(Citations omitted and emphasis, italics and underscoring in the original)</blockquote><br>On motion for partial reconsideration, however, the CA reversed its decision and declared the petitioners therein entitled to monthly pensions corresponding to the current salary levels of the ERC Chairman and Members in order to avoid a conflict with the decision of the CA 13th Division in CA-GR. SP No. 89068.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The OSG further commented that the non-adjustment of the pension of the petitioners violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution after the ERC adjusted the pensions of the petitioners in CA-GR. SP No. 89068 and CA-GR. SP No. 89095.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It also argued that in view of the identity of issues in all the three CA cases, the petitioners may invoke the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment in the first two cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Lastly, the OSG urged that retirement laws being remedial in character must be liberally construed in favor of the retirees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The Court disagrees.<br><br>The Court has seen that the DBM and the ERC cannot be compelled by <i>mandamus</i> to release public funds to the petitioners since the latter failed to establish a clear ministerial duty by the said agencies to recognize their legal entitlement thereto. According to the DBM, the petitioners have been receiving retirement benefits on a level with the salaries of the COMELEC Chairman and Members, pursuant to Section 1 of E.O. No. 172 in relation to Section 2-A of R.A. No. 1568, as amended.<br><br>Clearly, nowhere does R.A. No. 9136 extend to the retired ERB Chairman and Members the retirement benefits it grants to the ERC Chairman and Members. Section 39 of R.A. No. 9136 specifically provides only for the retirement benefits of the ERC Chairman and Members.<br><br>With regard to the legal significance of the first two CA decisions as precedents, the DBM invoked <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Michel J. Lhuillier Pawnshop, Inc</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> which held that courts are not bound by decisions of the CA since only the SC is the final arbiter of any justiciable controversy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Indeed, if the SC can disregard even its own previous rulings to correct an earlier error, and thus prevent a repeat of the misapplication of the law, then surely, this Court can also disregard the aforesaid rulings of the CA to correct what is considered to be an erroneous application of the law. Besides, pursuant to <i>De Leon v. Hon.

It noted the expansion of the ERC's functions and concerns, since while it retains the ERB's traditional rate and service regulation functions, it now also has to promote competitive operations in the electricity market, and its concerns now encompass both the consumers and the utility investors. The Court recognized that the ERC labors under a new thrust, new policy, legal structure and regulatory framework for the electric power industry. The Court, in <i>Freedom from Debt Coalition</i>, said:<br><br><blockquote>One of the landmark pieces of legislation enacted by Congress in recent years is the [Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001]. It established a new policy, legal structure and regulatory framework for the electric power industry.<br><br>The new thrust is to tap private capital for the expansion and improvement of the industry as the large government debt and the highly capital-intensive character of the industry itself have long been acknowledged as the critical constraints to the program. To attract private investment, largely foreign, the jaded structure of the industry had to be addressed. While the generation and transmission sectors were centralized and monopolistic, the distribution side was fragmented with over 130 utilities, mostly small and uneconomic. The pervasive flaws have caused a low utilization of existing generation capacity; extremely high and uncompetitive power rates; poor quality of service to consumers; dismal to forgettable performance of the government power sector; high system losses; and an inability to develop a clear strategy for overcoming these shortcomings.<br><br>Thus, the [Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001] provides a framework for the restructuring of the industry, including the privatization of the assets of the [NPC], the transition to a competitive structure, and the delineation of the roles of various government agencies and the private entities. The law ordains the division of the industry into four (4) distinct sectors, namely: generation, transmission, distribution and supply. Corollarily, the NPC generating plants have to privatized and its transmission business spun off and privatized thereafter.<br><br>In tandem with the restructuring of the industry is the establishment of "a strong and purely independent regulatory body." Thus, the law created the ERC in place of the [ERB].<br><br>To achieve its aforestated goal, the law has reconfigured the organization of the regulatory body, x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>A quick review of significant legislative developments over several decades will help explain the intent of Congress to abolish the ERB in view of the altered landscape of economic regulation which saw the need both to deregulate the oil industry and to restructure the electric power industry.<br><br>On November 7, 1936, Commonwealth Act No. 146, known as the Public Service Law, created the Public Service Commission to exercise jurisdiction, supervision, and control over all public services, including the electric power service.<br><br>On April 30, 1971, R.A.

Electoral Commission</i> <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> discussed the judiciary's role as the only constitutional body with authority to determine proper allocation of powers among governmental bodies:<br><br><blockquote>The separation of powers is a fundamental principle in our system of government. It obtains not through express provision but by actual division in our Constitution. Each department of the government has exclusive cognizance of matters within its jurisdiction, and is supreme within its own sphere. But it does not follow from the fact that the three powers are to be kept separate and distinct that the Constitution intended them to be absolutely unrestrained and independent of each other. The Constitution has provided for an elaborate system of checks and balances to secure coordination in the workings of the various departments of the government.<br>....<br><br>But in the main, the Constitution has blocked out with deft strokes and in bold lines, allotment of power to the executive, the legislative and the judicial departments of the government. The overlapping and interlacing of functions and duties between the several departments, however, sometimes makes it hard to say just where the one leaves off and the other begins. In times of social disquietude or political excitement, the great, landmarks of the Constitution are apt to be forgotten or marred, if not entirely obliterated. <i><b>In cases of conflict, the judicial department is the only constitutional organ which can be called upon to determine the proper allocation of powers between the several departments and among the integral or constituent units thereof</b></i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Preserving the judiciary's independence is both imperative and central in fulfilling this Court's constitutional mandate as final arbiter in upholding the rule of law.
