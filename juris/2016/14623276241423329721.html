No. 106714 became final until its full satisfaction; and<br><br>Lastly, whether Victor S. Limlingan and Emmanuel A. Leyco are entitled to attorney's fees.<br><br>At the outset, we consolidate the Petitions as they involve the same parties and interrelated issues. G.R. No. 220503 is consolidated with G.R. No. 220481 to avoid conflicting decisions and to save time and resources of this court. G.R. No. 220503 is referred to the member-in-charge of G.R. No. 220481, the lower-numbered case.<br><br>As to the first substantive issue, we rule that the Court of Appeals did not commit reversible error when it held that Leyco is entitled to the amount of P44,725.32 for health insurance premiums.<br><br>That Limlingan and Leyco are entitled to the payment of health insurance premiums is not contested. As to the amount due to Leyco, all three tribunals—the Labor Arbiter, the National Labor Relations Commission, and the Court of Appeals—found that Leyco had sufficiently proven that he was entitled to P44,725.32.<br><br>As held by the Court of Appeals:<br><blockquote>We are more convinced with the claims of Leyco (which were contained in the December 27, 2013 Resolution of the NLRC) that, apart from the P39,225.32 he had previously paid, he also spent P5,500.00 for his emergency medical expenses on September 2, 2007. We find more in accord with law his argument that he would not have been forced to pay for the said additional expenses had the petitioner not suspended his coverage without notice. Thusly, We find nothing irregular when the NLRC, after a review of the pertinent documents on Record, allowed the award of P44,725.32 to Leyco.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote>Issues as to the correct computation of monetary awards are questions of fact that is beyond the scope of this court's review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, considering that it "will require a re-examination and calibration of the evidence on record."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> This court does not see any reason to overturn the factual findings of the Labor Arbiter, the National Labor Relations Commission, and the Court of Appeals with regard to this issue. It is settled that:<br><blockquote>the findings of facts and conclusion of the NLRC are generally accorded not only great weight and respect but even clothed with finality and deemed binding on this Court as long as they are supported by substantial evidence. This Court finds no basis for deviating from said doctrine without any clear showing that the findings of the Labor Arbiter, as affirmed by the NLRC, are bereft of substantiation. Particularly when passed upon and upheld by the Court of Appeals, they are binding and conclusive upon the Supreme Court and will not normally be disturbed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>On the second issue, we rule in favor of Limlingan and Leyco and grant their Petition.<br><br>Limlingan and Leyco pray for the modification of the assailed Decision in view of this court's Decision in <i>Nacar</i> v. Gallery Frames.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> In contrast, AIM claims that Limlingan and Leyco are not entitled to legal interest since it has already tendered payment and the delay in the full satisfaction of the award is Limlingan and Leyco's fault. Assuming that this court finds it liable for legal interest, AIM prays that legal interest be collected only from the time of the finality of this court's Decision, which affirmed the Court Appeals' May 4, 2010 Decision, until AIM's tender of payment on April 17, 2013.<br><br>We cannot accept AIM's arguments. The legal interest imposed is but a consequence of AIM's participation in prolonging the proceedings between the parties:<br><blockquote>That the amount respondents shall now pay has greatly increased is a consequence that it cannot avoid as it is the risk that it ran when it continued to seek recourses against the Labor Arbiter's decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br></blockquote>With regard to the proper rate of legal interest, <i>Nacar</i> laid down the guidelines for the imposition of legal interest:<br><blockquote><b>To recapitulate and for future guidance, the guidelines laid down in the case of <i>Eastern Shipping Lines</i> are accordingly modified to embody BSP-MB Circular No. 799, as follows:</b><br><br>I. When an obligation, regardless of its source, <i>i.e.</i>, law, contracts, quasi- contracts, delicts or quasi-delicts is breached, the contravenor can be held liable for damages. The provisions under Title XVIII on "Damages" of the Civil Code govern in determining the measure of recoverable damages.<br><br>II. With regard particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows:<br><ol><li>When the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, <i>i.e.</i>, a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing. Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 6% <i>per annum</i> to be computed from default, <i>i.e.</i>, from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.<br><br></li><li>When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the <i>discretion of the court</i> at the rate of 6% <i>per annum</i>. No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages, except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty. Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code), but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained). The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.<br><br></li><li>When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 6% <i>per annum</i> from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.<br></li></ol>And, in addition to the above, judgments that have become final and executory prior to July 1, 2013, shall not be disturbed and shall continue to be implemented applying the rate of interest fixed therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)<br></blockquote>On July 25, 2011, the Court of Appeals' May 4, 2010 Decision became final and executory and was recorded in the Book of Entries of Judgments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Prior to <i>Nacar</i> and Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Monetary Board Resolution No. 796 dated May 16, 2013, the rate of legal interest was pegged at 12% per annum from finality of judgment until its satisfaction, "this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Similar to this case, <i>Nacar</i> was already in the execution stage and the resolution awarding backwages and separation pay had attained finality prior to the issuance of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Resolution.

Time and again, the doctrine of finality of judgment, which is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice, dictates that at the risk of occasional error, the judgments of the courts must become final and executory at some definite date set by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The issue as to Limlingan and Leyco's entitlement to attorney's fees already attained finality. Issues not raised on appeal cannot be disturbed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Moreover, in <i>Aliling v. Feliciano, et al</i>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> this court explained the reason for awarding attorney's fees:<br><blockquote>Petitioner Aliling is also entitled to attorney's fees in the amount of ten percent (10%) of his total monetary award, <i>having been forced to litigate in order to seek redress of his grievances</i>, pursuant to Article 111 of the Labor Code and following our ruling in <i>Exodus International Construction Corporation v. Biscocho</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote>In <i>Rutaquio v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, this Court held that:<br><blockquote>It is settled that in actions for recovery of wages or where an employee was forced to litigate and, thus, incur expenses to protect his rights and interest, the award of attorney's fees is legally and morally justifiable.<br></blockquote>In <i>Producers Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i> this Court ruled that:<br><blockquote>Attorney's fees may be awarded when a party is compelled to litigate or to incur expenses to protect his interest by reason of an unjustified act of the other party.<br></blockquote>While in <i>Lambert Pawnbrokers and Jewelry Corporation</i>, the Court specifically ruled:<br><blockquote>However, the award of attorney's fee is warranted pursuant to Article 111 of the Labor Code. Ten (10%) percent of the total award is usually the reasonable amount of attorney's fees awarded. It is settled that where an employee was forced to litigate and, thus, incur expenses to protect his rights and interest, the award of attorney's fees is legally and morally justifiable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, G.R.
