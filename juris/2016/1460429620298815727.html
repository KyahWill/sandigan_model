On the other hand, SPO2 Ragadio recalled receiving two (2) plastic sachets from NUP Bilugot. This discrepancy, according to Dimaano, casts doubt as to the identity of the specimen allegedly obtained from her. There was a break in the chain of custody of the seized drugs, which warranted her acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In addition, Dimaano assailed the prosecution's failure to present in court the airline ticket bearing her name.

It stated that "[a]side from [Dimaano's] . . . allegations, [Dimaano] did not present evidence to support her claim. [Worse,] she never bothered to testify in court to refute the evidence of the prosecution."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Relying on the general rule that "the lower court's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses is accorded great respect,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> the Court of Appeals found NUP Bilugot and SPO2 Ragadio to be credible witnesses. That their testimonies differed as to the number of sachets obtained from Dimaano did not destroy NUP Bilugot's and SPO2 Ragadio's credibility because "the chain of events as to the custody of the recovered shabu was never broken."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57] </sup>Moreover, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's finding that the two sachets SPO2 Ragadio obtained from NUP Bilugot were placed inside one bigger plastic sachet.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> According to the Court of Appeals, this explained why NUP Bilugot recalled obtaining only a single plastic sachet from Dimaano.<br><br>With respect to the airline ticket, the Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that it need not be presented in court to prove that Dimaano attempted to transport methamphetamine hydrochloride. According to the Court of Appeals, the "indorsement letter"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> of Police Chief Inspector Roseller N. Fabian to the City Prosecutor of Pasay, which stated that Dimaano was apprehended at the initial check-in departure area of the Manila International Airport, proved that Dimaano was bound for Cebu to transport dangerous drugs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>In the Decision dated May 30, 2006, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's Decision dated March 5, 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The case was brought on appeal before this court through a notice of appeal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> the penalty imposed on Dimaano being life imprisonment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> dated December 4, 2006, this court directed the parties to file their respective supplemental briefs if they so desired.<br><br>In their respective manifestations, the Office of the Solicitor General, representing the People of the Philippines,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and accused-appellant Dimaano<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> requested this court to treat the appeal briefs they filed before the Court of Appeals as their supplemental briefs.

With the inconsistent testimonies of NUP Bilugot and SPO2 Ragadio as to the number of sachets allegedly obtained from her, Dimaano argues that the prosecution "failed to prove the crucial first link in the chain of custody"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> required under Section 21 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Dimaano adds that NUP Bilugot and SPO2 Ragadio only marked the two sachets that contained seven smaller sachets of methamphetamine hydrochloride allegedly obtained from her.

Contrary to Dimaano's claim, the Office of the Solicitor General argues that there were no inconsistencies in NUP Bilugot's and SPO2 Ragadio's testimonies and cites SPO2 Ragadio's testimony that he received from NUP Bilugot two plastic sachets that were further placed inside a bigger plastic.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>As to why the seven (7) smaller sachets were not marked, the Office of the Solicitor General counters that this "relate [s] only to [a] minor, trivial, peripheral and inconsequential [matter] that [does] not detract from the weight of the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses in their entirety as to material and important facts."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>With respect to the prosecution's failure to present the airline ticket bearing Dimaano's name, the Office of the Solicitor General argues that NUP Bilugot's and SPO2 Ragadio's testimonies sufficiently proved that Dimaano was bound for Cebu to transport methamphetamine hydrochloride.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The Office of the Solicitor General thus prays that the Decision convicting Dimaano be affirmed in toto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>The principal issue for this court's resolution is whether accused-appellant Cristy Dimaano y Tipdas is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of attempting to transport dangerous drugs punished under Section 5 in relation to Section 26 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. Subsumed in this issue is whether the prosecution established the unbroken chain of custody of the methamphetamine hydrochloride allegedly seized from accused-appellant.<br><br>This appeal must be dismissed.<br><br>Section 5 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 punishes the transportation of dangerous drugs. The provision states, in part:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 5.<i> Sale, Trading, Administration, Dispensation, Distribution and Transportation of Dangerous Drugs and/or Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals.</i> — The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five hundred thousand pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten million pesos (PI0,000,000.00) shall be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any dangerous drug, including any and all species of opium poppy regardless of the quantity and purity involved, or shall act as a broker in any such transactions.<br></blockquote><br>The attempt to transport dangerous drugs is punished by the same penalty prescribed for its commission:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 26. <i>Attempt or Conspiracy. </i>- Any attempt or conspiracy to commit the following unlawful acts shall be penalized by the same penalty prescribed for the commission of the same as provided under this Act:<br>....<br>(b) Sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution and transportation of any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical[.]<br></blockquote><br>To transport a dangerous drug is to "carry or convey [it] from one place to another."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> For an accused to be convicted of this crime, the prosecution must prove its essential element: the movement of the dangerous drug from one place to another.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>In cases involving violations of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, the prosecution must prove "the existence of the prohibited drug[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> "[T]he prosecution must show that the integrity of the corpus delicti has been preserved,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> because "the evidence involved—the seized chemical—is not readily identifiable by sight or touch and can easily be tampered with or substituted."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>To show that "the drugs examined and presented in court were the very ones seized [from the accused],"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> testimony as to the "chain of custody" of the seized drugs must be presented.

Police Inspector Tecson, the Forensic Chemist who subjected the specimen to chemical analysis, reported that he received two plastic sachets marked with "FSB," "RDR," and "RSA."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> "FSB" are the initials of NUP Bilugot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>Having marked two plastic sachets, NUP Bilugot confirmed that she obtained those two sachets from accused-appellant.

This would have contaminated the specimen.<br><br>Thus, the prosecution successfully established the identity of the corpus delicti. In addition, the chain of custody was unbroken. Both NUP Bilugot and SPO2 Ragadio testified that after NUP Bilugot seized the specimen, she immediately endorsed it to SPO2 Ragadio. SPO2 Ragadio then turned over the two plastic sachets to investigators detailed at the Philippine Center for Aviation and Security.

No. 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.<br><br><u><center><b>The Antecedents</b><br></center></u><br>On November 13, 2002, Non-Uniformed Personnel Florence S. Bilugot (<i>NUP Bilugot</i>), while being detailed as frisker at the initial check-in departure area of the Manila Domestic Airport Terminal 1, frisked Cristy as a standard operating procedure for departing passengers. When NUP Bilugot felt a bulging hard object near Cristy's buttocks, she asked what it was. Cristy replied it was a sanitary napkin. Suspicious, NUP Bilugot requested that they proceed to the ladies' comfort room for a thorough inspection.<br><br>NUP Bilugot then asked Cristy to remove her panties. On the panties' crotch was a panty liner on top of a sanitary napkin, and between these was <u><b>a plastic sachet</b></u> as <u><b>big as a shampoo packet</b></u>. Seeing it contained a white crystalline substance similar to "tawas" inside the packet, NUP Bilugot asked Cristy what it was. Cristy allegedly replied that it was <i>shahu</i>. When NUP Bilugot asked if she owned it, Cristy replied that she was just asked to bring it. NUP Bilugot then secured the plastic sachet and turned it over to Senior Police Officer 2 Reynato Ragadio (<i>SPO2 Ragadio</i>).<br><br>SPO2 Ragadio, however, recalled receiving from NUP Bilugot<b> two (2) transparent plastic sachets</b>, which NUP Bilugot placed inside a plastic bag. Together with NUP Bilugot, SPO2 Ragadio brought Cristy to the Philippine Center for Aviation and Security (<i>PCAS</i>) where the arresting officers wrote their respective initials on the two plastic sachets.<br><br>Investigators detailed at the PCAS examined the contents of the two plastic sachets. One sachet contained three (3) smaller sachets while the other contained four (4) smaller ones. Thirty minutes later, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (<i>PDEA</i>) investigators arrived to collect the confiscated items on which they had placed their initials. Cristy was brought to the PDEA office at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport thereafter.<br><br>The prosecution charged Cristy with violation of Section 5 in relation to Section 26 of R.A. No. 9165 before the Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC</i>), Branch 119, Pasay City, in an Information that provides:<br><br><blockquote>That on or about the 13th day of November, 2002, at the Manila Domestic Airport Terminal I, in Pasay City, Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable court, the above-named accused, being then a departing passenger for Cebu, without authority of law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in her possession and attempt to transport 13.96 grams of Methyllamphetamine (sic) Hydrochloride (shabu), a dangerous drug.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote><br>Cristy pleaded not guilty to the charge during her arraignment.<br><br>Cristy waived her right to present her evidence during trial. Instead, her counsel filed a memorandum and argued that the prosecution failed to establish her guilt beyond reasonable doubt on the following grounds:<br><br>1) The discrepancy in the testimonies of NUP Bilugot and SPO2 Ragadio casts serious doubt in establishing the identity of the dangerous drug. NUP Bilugot testified that he was able to obtain <b>a plastic sachet</b> from Cristy's panty, SPO2 Ragadio, on the other hand, said that he received two <b>(2) plastic sachets</b> from NUP Bilugot after they came out of the ladies' comfort room; and<br><br>2) The element of intent to transport was not established because the prosecution failed to present her airline ticket, which was also confiscated from her, to prove that she was departing from Manila to Cebu.<br><br>In its decision dated March 5, 2005, the RTC found Cristy guilty beyond reasonable doubt of attempting to transport <i>shabu</i>. The trial court explained that, despite the discrepancies in the testimonies of NUP Bilugot and SPO2 Ragadio, the chain of custody, nevertheless, remained unbroken. Immediately after NUP Bilugot seized the <i>shabu</i> from Cristy, she immediately turned over the same to SPO2 Ragadio, who was just outside the door of the ladies' comfort room. <b>The trial court added that SPO2 Ragadio's testimony that he received from NUP Bilugot two (2) plastic sachets, which were further placed inside a bigger plastic packet, explained why NUP Bilugot said that she obtained only one (1) plastic sachet from Cristy.</b><br><br>As to the element of intent to transport, the RTC justified that since Cristy was apprehended prior to her departure at the Domestic Airport, the presentation of the airline ticket was unnecessary.<br><br>Accordingly, the RTC sentenced Cristy to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and ordered her to pay a fine of P500,000.00.<br><br>In its decision of May 30, 2006, the CA affirmed the RTC's ruling. The appellate court was not convinced by Cristy's arguments because aside from her allegations, Cristy did not present any evidence to support her claim.<br><br>The CA upheld the RTC's findings that the difference in the testimonies of NUP Bilugot and SPO2 Ragadio did not destroy the credibility of the prosecution witnesses because the testimony given by the latter proved that the chain of custody over the confiscated items remained unbroken. The CA quoted SPO2 Ragadio's explanation that he and the PCAS investigator examined the drugs in the presence of Cristy.<br><br>With respect to the airline ticket, the CA agreed with the trial court that the prosecution did not need to present it just to prove Cristy's intention to transport illegal drugs. The fact that Cristy was apprehended at the initial check-in departure area of the Manila Domestic Airport already proved that she was bound for Cebu to transport dangerous drugs.<br><br>Before this Court, Cristy maintains that the prosecution failed to establish the identity of the illegal drugs allegedly seized from her because there were material inconsistencies in the crucial first link in the chain of custody.<br><br><u><center><b>The <i>Ponencia'</i>s Ruling</b></center></u><br>Despite the inconsistencies as to the number of plastic sachets confiscated, the <i>ponencia</i> agreed with the lower courts that the chain of custody was not broken because NUP Bilugot immediately turned over whatever she discovered hidden in Cristy's underwear to SPO2 Ragadio right after coming out of the ladies' comfort room. Moreover, the <i>ponencia</i> appreciated the explanation that the two (2) plastic sachets were placed inside a bigger plastic sachet.<br><br>The<i> ponencia</i> ruled that failing to mark all of the seven (7) smaller plastic sachets is a mere nominal deviation from the requirements under Section 21 because the two (2) larger plastic sachets, containing the seven (7) smaller ones, were duly marked with the initials of NUP Bilugot and SPO2 Ragadio.<br><br>In affirming Cristy's conviction, the<i> ponencia</i> held that the prosecution proved the essential element of the crime <i>illegal attempt to transport dangerous drugs</i>; Cristy would have successfully moved 13.96 grams of <i>shabu </i>from Manila to Cebu had she not been apprehended at the initial check-in area at the Manila Domestic Airport.<br><br><u><center><b>The Dissent</b><br></center></u><br>I vote to <i>acquit</i> the accused-appellant on the ground of reasonable doubt.<br><br>It is basic in criminal prosecution that an accused is presumed innocent of a charge unless his guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt. In cases involving dangerous drugs, proof beyond reasonable doubt demands that <b>unwavering exactitude is observed in establishing the <i>corpus delicti</i></b> - the body of the crime whose core is the confiscated illicit drug.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In meeting this quantum of proof, the chain of custody requirement under Section 21 of R.A.

As pointed out by the <i>ponencia</i>, NUP Bilugot could not remember whether this single sachet contained several other sachets. In fact, Bilugot said it contained crystalline substance similar to "tawas," thus, she saw what the transparent sachet contained.<br><br>SPO2 Ragadio, on the other hand, declared on the witness stand that NUP Bilugot handed to him <i>two</i> plastic sachets. SPO2 Ragadio in fact confirmed that he placed his initials on <i>two</i> sachets.<br><br>Taken all together, the inconsistency as to how many plastic sachets were really recovered from Cristy and eventually turned over to SPO2 Ragadio, and the incomplete testimony of NUP Bilugot cast serious doubt as to the identity of the drugs presented in court.<br><br>Minor inconsistencies pertain only to a collateral matter, which does not have anything to do with the essential elements of the offense with which an accused is charged. On the other hand, contradictions and inconsistencies, which are irreconcilable and pertain to substantial matters, cast doubt over the veracity of the charge against the accused. Testimonial inconsistencies are substantial where they have something to do with the essential elements of the crime involving dangerous drugs.<br><br>In the present case, the difference between the quantity of <i>shabu </i>confiscated from Cristy and turned over to SPO2 Ragadio is a substantial inconsistency because it goes into establishing the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime.<br><br>I also cannot share the <i>ponencia</i>'s position that the non-marking of the seven (7) smaller sachets was a mere "nominal deviation" from the requirements under Section 21 of R.A. 9165.<br><br>Marking means the placing by the apprehending officer or the poseur-buyer of his/her initials and signature on the item/s seized.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[10]</sup></font> Crucial in proving the unbroken chain of custody is the marking of the seized drugs or other related items because failure to do so casts reasonable doubt on the authenticity of the <i>corpus delicti</i>. The marking of the evidence serves to separate the marked evidence from the <i>corpus</i> of all other similar or related evidence from the time they are seized from the accused until they are disposed of at the end of the criminal proceedings, thus preventing switching, "planting," or contamination of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Here, what was marked were only the two (2) plastic sachets containing the seven (7) smaller sachets - not the latter, which would be more appropriate given the number of sachets supposedly recovered from Cristy. We cannot accept the <i>ponencia</i>'s explanation that the marking of the seven sachets could contaminate them since it would have required the opening of the two heat-sealed sachets that contained these seven sachets.<br><br>We point out that the 7 smaller sachets were also heat-sealed. The marking procedure would have only required the placing of the initials on these 7 plastic sachets; it would not involve opening of these sachets. To my mind (and contrary to the <i>ponencia</i>'s position), the marking of the other sachets would ensure all the more the preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized specimen.<br><br>Notably, SPO2 Ragadio testified that he and NUP Bilugot wrote their respective initials (<i>i.e</i>., "<i>RBR</i>" and "<i>FSB</i>") on the two sachets. Police Inspector Abraham B. Tecson, however, stated that he received from Police Chief Inspector Roseller Fabian two plastic sachets marked with "FSB," "RDR," and "RSA." It was not clear who owned the initials RDR and RSA.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i>'s narration of facts also stated that three investigators from the PDEA placed their initials on the two plastic sachets. If SPO2 Ragadio and NUP Bilugot placed their initials on the two sachets before the PDEA investigators placed theirs, then there should have been 5 initials on the sachets. We reiterate that P/Insp. Fabian testified that the sachets bore only the initials "FSB," "RDR" and "RSA."<br><br>As a result of the lapses and/or irregularities that attended the marking procedure, we cannot agree with the <i>ponencia</i>'s view that Cristy's guilt of the crime charged had been proven with moral certainty. Simply put, the prosecution failed to establish that the seven sachets were the same sachets confiscated from her.<br><br>The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty applies only when there is no deviation from the regular performance of duty.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[12]</sup></font> The regular performance as to the initial contact with the dangerous drug is outlined in the first paragraph of Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165:<br><br><blockquote>(1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, <u>immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph</u> the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof;<br><br><center>xxxx</center></blockquote>I reiterate that marking is the starting point in the custodial link, thus it is vital that this procedure be properly done because succeeding handlers of the specimens will use the markings as reference. Therefore, any deviation from this vital process requires a justification from the apprehending team for their noncompliance.<br><br>Corollarily, the facts narrated by the <i>ponencia</i> did not show that the seized drugs had been inventoried and photographed in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official by persons who had contact with the confiscated plastic sachets, <i>i.e</i>., NUP Bilugot, SPO2 Ragadio, investigators from the Philippine Center for Aviation and Security, and investigators from the PDEA. Notably, the defense did not offer any justifiable ground why these officials failed to comply with the required vital processes in the safekeeping of drugs. We stress that it is not for this Court to provide the justifiable ground that would excuse the police officers from non-observance of the required procedure in the handling and custody of the seized drugs.<br><br>All told, the prosecution failed to meet the quantum of proof required in establishing that the prohibited drugs identified in court were the same prohibited drugs allegedly found inside Cristy's underwear. In effect, we have in this case a counterpart of the "<i>tanim bala</i>" that has raised a lot of complaints at the airport; here, it is "<i>tanim shahu</i>."<br><br>Under the circumstances, Cristy should be <b>ACQUITTED</b> because the prosecution failed to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence by not proving beyond reasonable doubt the<i> corpus delicti </i>of an illegal attempt to transport dangerous drugs.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> CA <i>rollo</i>, p. 9.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>People v.
