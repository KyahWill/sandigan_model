This characterization requires a determination of the cause of action through which the Marcelino, Jr. Group came to court for relief. It will, thus, clarify the parties who must be included in their action and the procedural and substantive requirements they must satisfy if their action is to prosper.<br><br>A stockholder suing on account of wrongful or fraudulent corporate actions (undertaken through directors, associates, officers, or other persons) may sue in any of three (3) capacities: as an individual; as part of a group or specific class of stockholders; or as a representative of the corporation.<br><br><i>Villamor v. Umale</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> distinguished individual suits from class or representative suits:<br><br><blockquote>Individual suits are filed when the cause of action belongs to the individual stockholder personally, and not to the stockholders as a group or to the corporation, e.g., denial of right to inspection and denial of dividends to a stockholder. If the cause of action belongs to a group of stockholders, such as when the rights violated belong to preferred stockholders, a class or representative suit may be filed to protect the stockholders in the group.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br></blockquote><br><i>Villamor </i>further explained that a derivative suit "is an action filed by stockholders to enforce a corporate action."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> A derivative suit, therefore, concerns "a wrong to the corporation itself."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> The real party in interest is the corporation, not the stockholders filing the suit. The stockholders are technically nominal parties but are nonetheless the active persons who pursue the action for and on behalf of the corporation.<br><br>Remedies through derivative suits are not expressly provided for in our statutes—more specifically, in the Corporation Code and the Securities Regulation Code—but they are "impliedly recognized when the said laws make corporate directors or officers liable for damages suffered by the corporation and its stockholders for violation of their fiduciary duties."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> They are intended to afford reliefs to stockholders in instances where those responsible for running the affairs of a corporation would not otherwise act:<br><br><blockquote>However, in cases of mismanagement where the wrongful acts are committed by the directors or trustees themselves, a stockholder or member may find that he has no redress because the former are vested by law with the right to decide whether or not the corporation should sue, and they will never be willing to sue themselves. The corporation would thus be helpless to seek remedy. Because of the frequent occurrence of such a situation, the common law gradually recognized the right of a stockholder to sue on behalf of a corporation in what eventually became known as a "derivative suit." It has been proven to be an effective remedy of the minority against the abuses of management. Thus, an individual stockholder is permitted to institute a derivative suit on behalf of the corporation wherein he holds stock in order to protect or vindicate corporate rights, whenever officials of the corporation refuse to sue or are the ones to be sued or hold the control of the corporation. In such actions, the suing stockholder is regarded as the nominal party, with the corporation as the party in interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup></blockquote><br>The distinction between individual and class/representative suits on one hand and derivative suits on the other is crucial. These are not discretionary alternatives. <i>The fact that stockholders suffer from a wrong done to or involving a corporation does not vest in them a sweeping license to sue in their own capacity. </i>The recognition of derivative suits as a vehicle for redress distinct from individual and representative suits is an acknowledgment that certain wrongs may be addressed only through acts brought for the corporation:<br><br><blockquote>Although in most every case of wrong to the corporation, each stockholder is necessarily affected because the value of his interest therein would be impaired, this fact of itself is not sufficient to give him an individual cause of action since the corporation is a person distinct and separate from him, and can and should itself sue the wrongdoer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Asset Privatization Trust v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> the reasons for disallowing a direct individual suit were further explained:<br><br><blockquote>The reasons given for not allowing direct individual suit are:<br><br>(1) . . . "the universally recognized doctrine that a stockholder in a corporation has no title legal or equitable to the corporate property; that both of these are in the corporation itself for the benefit of the stockholders." In other words, to allow shareholders to sue separately would conflict with the separate corporate entity principle;<br><br>(2) . . . that the prior rights of the creditors may be prejudiced. Thus, our Supreme Court held in the case of <i>Evangelista v. Santos</i>, that 'the stockholders may not directly claim those damages for themselves for that would result in the appropriation by, and the distribution among them of part of the corporate assets before the dissolution of the corporation and the liquidation of its debts and liabilities, something which cannot be legally done in view of Section 16 of the Corporation Law...";<br><br>(3) the filing of such suits would conflict with the duty of the management to sue for the protection of all concerned;<br><br>(4) it would produce wasteful multiplicity of suits; and<br><br>(5) it would involve confusion in ascertaining the effect of partial recovery by an individual on the damages recoverable by the corporation for the same act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup></blockquote><br>The avenues for relief are, thus, mutually exclusive. <i>The determination of the appropriate remedy hinges on the object of the wrong done. </i>When the object is a specific stockholder or a definite class of stockholders, an individual suit or class/representative suit<i> must</i> be resorted to. When the object of the wrong done is the corporation itself or "the whole body of its stock and property without any severance or distribution among individual holders,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> it is a derivative suit that a stockholder <i>must </i>resort to. In <i>Cua, Jr. v. Tan</i>:<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[92]</sup></font><br><br><blockquote>Indeed, the Court notes American jurisprudence to the effect that a derivative suit, on one hand, and individual and class suits, on the other, are mutually exclusive, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>As the Supreme Court has explained: "A shareholder's derivative suit seeks to recover for the benefit of the corporation and its whole body of shareholders when injury is caused to the corporation that may not otherwise be redressed because of failure of the corporation to act. <i>Thus, 'the action is derivative, i.e., in the corporate right, if the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the corporation, or to the whole body of its stock and property without any severance or distribution among individual holders, </i>or it seeks to recover assets for the corporation or to prevent the dissipation of its assets.'" In contrast, "a direct action [is one] filed by the shareholder individually (or on behalf of a class of shareholders to which he or she belongs) for injury to his or her interest as a shareholder.. . . [T]he two actions are mutually exclusive: i.e., the right of action and recovery belongs to either the shareholders (direct action) or the corporation (derivative action)."<br><br>Thus, in <i>Nelson v. Anderson</i>, the minority shareholder alleged that the other shareholder of the corporation negligently managed the business, resulting in its total failure. The appellate court concluded that the plaintiff could not maintain the suit as a direct action: "<i>Because the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the whole body of its stockholders, it was for the corporation to institute and maintain a remedial action.</i> A derivative action would have been appropriate if its responsible officials had refused or failed to act." The court went on to note that the damages shown at trial were the loss of corporate profits. Since "[shareholders own neither the property nor the earnings of the corporation," any damages that the plaintiff alleged that resulted from such loss of corporate profits "were incidental to the injury to the corporation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote></blockquote><br><i>Villamor </i>recalls the requisites for filing derivative suits:<br><br><blockquote>Rule 8, Section 1 of the Interim Rules of Procedure for Intra Corporate Controversies (Interim Rules) provides the five (5) requisites for filing derivative suits:<br><blockquote><i>SECTION 1.

This requirement has already been settled in jurisprudence.<br><br>Thus, in <i>Western Institute of Technology, Inc., et al. v.

Concluding that the petitioners' action was a derivative suit, this court explained:<br><br><blockquote>The reliefs sought in the Complaint, namely that of enjoining defendants from acting as officers and Board of Directors of the corporation, the appointment of a receiver, and the prayer for damages in the amount of the decrease in the value of the shares of stock, clearly show that the Complaint was filed to curb the alleged mismanagement of [Subic Bay Gold and Country Club]. The causes of action pleaded by petitioners do not accrue to a single shareholder or a class of shareholders but to the corporation itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>We are mindful that in 1979, in <i>Gamboa v. Victoriano,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> this court characterized an action to nullify the sale of 823 unissued shares on the ground of violating the plaintiffs' pre-emptive rights and in violation of the voting requirement for the Board of Directors as <i>not</i> a derivative suit. This court characterized the action as one in which "the plaintiffs are alleging and vindicating their own individual interests or prejudice, and not that of the corporation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>This pronouncement cannot be considered as a binding precedent for holding actions of the sort filed by the plaintiffs therein to not be derivative suit. This point in <i>Gamboa</i> was mere obiter dictum. The main issue in <i>Gamboa</i> was the validity of the trial court's denial of the Motion to Dismiss filed by four of the seven defendants after the plaintiffs entered into a compromise agreement with the three other defendants. The resolution of this issue was contingent on the determination of whether the compromise amounted to the plaintiff's waiver and estoppel for having conceded the validity of the sale. Besides, this court itself acknowledged that the statement it made characterizing the action brought by the plaintiffs was premature. Immediately after saying that "the plaintiffs are alleging and vindicating their own individual interests or prejudice, and not that of the corporation[,]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> this court stated: "At any rate, it is yet too early in the proceedings since the issues have not been joined."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br><center>III<br></center><br>In this case, the Marcelino, Jr. Group anchored their Complaint on violations of and liabilities arising from the Corporation Code, specifically: Section 23<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> (on corporate decision-making being vested in the board of directors), Section 25<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> (quorum requirement for the transaction of corporate business), Sections 39<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> and 102<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup> (both on stockholders' pre­emptive rights), Section 62<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> (stipulating the consideration for which stocks must be issued), Section 63<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[119]</sup> (stipulating that no transfer of shares "shall be valid, except as between the parties, until the transfer is recorded in the books of the corporation"), and Section 65<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup> (on liabilities of directors and officers "to the corporation and its creditors" for the issuance of watered stocks) in relation to provisions in People's Broadcasting's Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws as regards conditions for issuances of and subscription to shares. The Marcelino, Jr. Group ultimately prays that People's Broadcasting's entire capital structure be reconfigured to reflect a status quo ante.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup><br><br>As with <i>Ching and Wellington,</i> the actions being assailed by the Marcelino, Jr. Group pertain to parties that are not extraneous to People's Broadcasting. They assail and seek to nullify acts taken by various iterations of People's Broadcasting's Board of Directors. All these acts and incidents concern the capital structure of People's Broadcasting. These acts reconfigured, through redistribution and enlargement, the structure of People's Broadcasting's equity ownership. These acts also admitted into People's Broadcasting new equity holders such as Consolidated Broadcasting System, Inc. and Newsounds Broadcasting Network, Inc.<br><br>As <i>Ching and Wellington</i> exemplifies, the action should be a proper derivative suit even if the assailed acts do not pertain to a corporation's transactions with third persons. <i>Cua, Jr. </i>established that the pivotal consideration is whether the wrong done as well as the cause of action arising from it accrues to the corporation itself or to the whole body of its stockholders. <i>Ching and Wellington</i> states that if "[t]he causes of action pleaded ... do not accrue to a single shareholder or a class of shareholders but to the corporation itself,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> the action should be deemed a derivative suit. Also, in <i>Go</i>, an action "seeking to nullify and invalidate the duly constituted acts [of a corporation]" entails a cause of action that "rightfully pertains to [the corporation itself and which stockholders] cannot exercise . . . except through a derivative suit."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup><br><br>These are the same conditions in this case. What the Marcelino, Jr. Group asks is the complete reversal of a number of corporate acts undertaken by People' Broadcasting's different boards of directors. These boards supposedly engaged in outright fraud or, at the very least, acted in such a manner that amounts to wanton mismanagement of People's Broadcasting's affairs. The ultimate effect of the remedy they seek is the reconfiguration of People's Broadcasting's capital structure.<br><br>The remedies that the Marcelino, Jr. Group seeks are for People's Broadcasting itself to avail. Ordinarily, these reliefs may be unavailing because objecting stockholders such as those in the Marcelino, Jr. Group do not hold the controlling interest in People's Broadcasting. This is precisely the situation that the rule permitting derivative suits contemplates: minority shareholders having no other recourse "whenever the directors or officers of the corporation refuse to sue to vindicate the rights of the corporation or are the ones to be sued and are in control of the corporation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br><br>The Marcelino, Jr. Group points to violations of specific provisions of the Corporation Code that supposedly attest to how their rights as stockholders have been besmirched. However, this is not enough to sustain a claim that the Marcelino, Jr. Group initiated a valid individual or class suit. To reiterate, whether stockholders suffer from a wrong done to or involving a corporation does not readily vest in them a sweeping license to sue in their own capacity. <br><br>The specific provisions adverted to by the Marcelino, Jr. Group signify alleged wrongdoing committed against the corporation itself and not uniquely to those stockholders who now comprise the Marcelino, Jr. Group. A violation of Sections 23 and 25 of the Corporation Code—on how decision-making is vested in the board of directors and on the board's quorum requirement—implies that a decision was wrongly made for the entire corporation, not just with respect to a handful of stockholders. Section 65 specifically mentions that a director's or officer's liability for the issuance of watered stocks in violation of Section 62 is solidary <i>"to the corporation</i> and its creditors," not to any specific stockholder. Transfers of shares made in violation of the registration requirement in Section 63 are invalid and, thus, enable the corporation to impugn the transfer. Notably, those in the Marcelino, Jr. Group have not shown any specific interest in, or unique entitlement or right to, the shares supposedly transferred in violation of Section 63.<br><br>Also, the damage inflicted upon People's Broadcasting's individual stockholders, if any, was indiscriminate. It was not unique to those in the Marcelino, Jr. Group. It pertained to "the whole body of [People's Broadcasting's] stock."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> Accordingly, it was upon People's Broadcasting itself that the causes of action now claimed by the Marcelino Jr. Group accrued. While stockholders in the Marcelino, Jr. Group were permitted to seek relief, they should have done so not in their unique capacity as individuals or as a group of stockholders but in place of the corporation itself through a derivative suit. As they, instead, sought relief in their individual capacity, they did so bereft of a cause of action. Likewise, they did so without even the slightest averment that the requisites for the filing of a derivative suit, as spelled out in Rule 8, Section 1 of the Interim Rules of Procedure for Intra-Corporate Controversies, have been satisfied. Since the Complaint lacked a cause of action and failed to comply with the requirements of the Marcelino, Jr. Group's vehicle for relief, it was only proper for the Complaint to have been dismissed.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>Erroneously pursuing a derivative suit as a class suit not only meant that the Marcelino, Jr. Group lacked a cause of action; it also meant that they failed to implead an indispensable party.<br><br>In derivative suits, the corporation concerned must be impleaded as a party. As explained in <i>Asset Privatization Trust: </i><br><br><blockquote>Not only is the corporation an indispensible party, but it is also the present rule that it must be served with process. The reason given is that the judgment must be made binding upon the corporation in order that the corporation may get the benefit of the suit and may not bring a subsequent suit against the same defendants for the same cause of action. In other words the corporation must be joined as party because it is its cause of action that is being litigated and because judgment must be a res ajudicata [sic] against it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup><br></blockquote><br>We have already discussed <i>Go</i> where this court concluded that an action brought by three individual stockholders was, in truth, a derivative suit. There, this court further explained that a case cannot prosper when the proper party is not impleaded:<br><br><blockquote>As it is clear that the acts being assailed are those of PHHC, this case cannot prosper for failure to implead the proper party, PHCC.<br><br>An indispensable party is defined as one who has such an interest in the controversy or subject matter that a final adjudication cannot be made, in his absence, without injuring or affecting that interest. In the recent case of <i>Nagkakaisang Lakas ng Manggagawa sa Keihin (NLMK-OLALIA-KMU) v. Keihin Philippines Corporation</i>, the Court had the occasion to state that:<br><blockquote>Under Section 7, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, "parties in interest without whom no final determination can be had of an action shall be joined as plaintiffs or defendants." If there is a failure to implead an indispensable party, any judgment rendered would have no effectiveness. It is "precisely 'when an indispensable party is not before the court (that) an action should be dismissed.' The absence of an indispensable party renders all subsequent actions of the court null and void for want of authority to act, not only as to the absent parties but even to those present." The purpose of the rules on joinder of indispensable parties is a complete determination of all issues not only between the parties themselves, but also as regards other persons who may be affected by the judgment. A decision valid on its face cannot attain real finality where there is want of indispensable parties.</blockquote>Similarly, in the case of <i>Plasabas v. Court of Appeals,</i> the Court held that a final decree would necessarily affect the rights of indispensable parties so that the Court could not proceed without their presence. In support thereof, the Court in <i>Plasabas</i> cited the following authorities, thus:<br><blockquote>The general rule with reference to the making of parties in a civil action requires the joinder of all indispensable parties under any and all conditions, their presence being a sine qua non of the exercise of judicial power. For this reason, our Supreme Court has held that when it appears of record that there are other persons interested in the subject matter of the litigation, who are not made parties to the action, it is the duty of the court to suspend the trial until such parties are made either plaintiffs or defendants, x x x Where the petition failed to join as party defendant the person interested in sustaining the proceeding in the court, the same should be dismissed, x x x When an indispensable party is not before the court, the action should be dismissed.<br><br>Parties in interest without whom no final determination can be had of an action shall be joined either as plaintiffs or defendants. The burden of procuring the presence of all indispensable parties is on the plaintiff. The evident purpose of the rule is to prevent the multiplicity of suits by requiring the person arresting a right against the defendant to include with him, either as co-plaintiffs or as co-defendants, all persons standing in the same position, so that the whole matter in dispute may be determined once and for all in one litigation.</blockquote>From all indications, PHCC is an indispensable party and should have been impleaded, either as a plaintiff or as a defendant, in the complaint filed before the HLURB as it would be directly and adversely affected by any determination therein. To belabor the point, the causes of action, or the acts complained of, were the acts of PHCC as a corporate body[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br><center>V<br></center><br>There are two consequences of a finding on appeal that indispensable parties have not been joined. First, all subsequent actions of the lower courts are null and void for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> Second, the case should be remanded to the trial court for the inclusion of indispensable parties. It is only upon the plaintiff's refusal to comply with an order to join indispensable parties that the case may be dismissed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br><br>All subsequent actions of lower courts are void as to both the absent and present parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> To reiterate, the inclusion of an indispensable party is a<i> jurisdictional </i>requirement:<br><br><blockquote>While the failure to implead an indispensable party is not per se a ground for the dismissal of an action, considering that said party may still be added by order of the court, on motion of the party or on its own initiative at any stage of the action and/or such times as are just, it remains essential — <i>as it is jurisdictional</i> — that any indispensable party be impleaded in the proceedings <i>before the court renders judgment. </i>This is because the absence of such indispensable party renders all subsequent actions of the court null and void for want of authority to act, not only as to the absent parties but even as to those present.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><br>In <i>Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. v.

Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> this court clarified that the courts must first acquire jurisdiction over the person of an indispensable party. Any decision rendered by a court without first obtaining the required jurisdiction over indispensable parties is null and void for want of jurisdiction: "the presence of indispensable parties is necessary to vest the court with jurisdiction, which is 'the authority to hear and determine a cause, the right to act in a case.'"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><br>In <i>Divinagracia v.

While "[njeither misjoinder nor non-joinder of parties is ground for dismissal of an action"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> and is, thus, not fatal to the Marcelino, Jr. Group's action, we have shown that they lack a cause of action. This warrants the dismissal of their Complaint.<br><br>The first consequence, however, is crucial. It determines the validity of the Regional Trial Court's award of damages to Rogelio, Sr.<br><br>Since the Regional Trial Court did not have jurisdiction, the decision awarding damages in favor of Rogelio, Sr. is void.<br><br>Apart from this, there is no basis in jurisprudence for awarding moral and exemplary damages in cases where individual suits that were erroneously filed were dismissed. In the analogous cases that we previously discussed—<i>Hi-Yield Realty, Cua, Jr., Go</i>, and<i> Ching and Wellington</i>—the dismissal alone of the erroneously filed complaints sufficed. This court never saw the need to award moral and exemplary damages. This is in keeping with the Civil Code provisions that stipulate when the award of such damages is proper. We find no reason to conclude that the Marcelino, Jr. Group acted in so malevolent, oppressive, or reckless a manner that moral and exemplary damages must be awarded in such huge amounts as the Regional Trial Court did.<br><br>From the conclusion that the Decision awarding damages is void and unwarranted, it necessarily follows that the Order of the Regional Trial Court to immediately execute its Decision is likewise null and void. In <i>Arcelona</i>, the Decision sought to be annulled was already being executed. However, this court found that the assailed Decision was promulgated without indispensable parties being impleaded. Hence, the Decision was ruled to have been made without jurisdiction. This court nullified the judgment and declared:<br><br><blockquote><i>A void judgment for want of jurisdiction is no judgment at all.<b> It cannot be the source of any right nor the creator of any obligation.</b> </i>All acts performed pursuant to it and all claims emanating from it have no legal effect.<i> Hence, it can never become final and <b>any writ of execution based on it is void</b></i>: x x x it may be said to be a lawless thing which can be treated as an outlaw and slain at sight, or ignored wherever and whenever it exhibits its head.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Accordingly, the subsequent Order of the Decision's immediate execution is also void for lack of jurisdiction. Contrary to Rogelio Sr.'s claim in its Petition, execution cannot ensue. For this reason, the Petition docketed as G.R. No. 177275 must be denied.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition docketed as G.R. No. 174909 is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b> and the Petition docketed as G.R.
