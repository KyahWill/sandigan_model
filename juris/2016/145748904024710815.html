Rule 45 is applicable when the issues raised before this court involved purely questions of law. In <i>Villamor v. Balmores</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[t]here is a question of law "when there is doubt or controversy as to what the law is on a certain [set] of facts." The test is "whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence." Meanwhile, there is a question of fact when there is "doubt ... as to the truth or falsehood of facts." The question must involve the examination of probative value of the evidence presented.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br></blockquote><br>BCDA and Northrail primarily ask us to construe the arbitration clause in the Joint Venture Agreement. They assert that the clause does not bind DMCI-PDI and Northrail. This issue is a question of law. It does not require us to examine the probative value of the evidence presented. The prayer is essentially for this court to determine the scope of an arbitration clause.<br><br>Arbitration is a mode of settling disputes between parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Like many alternative dispute resolution processes, it is a product of the meeting of minds of parties submitting a pre-defined set of disputes. They agree among themselves to a process of dispute resolution that avoids extended litigation.<br><br>The state adopts a policy in favor of arbitration. Republic Act No. 9285<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> expresses this policy:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 2. <i>Declaration of Policy</i>. - It is hereby declared the policy of the State to actively promote party autonomy in the resolution of disputes or the freedom of the parties to make their own arrangements to resolve their disputes. <i>Towards this end, the State shall encourage and actively promote the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as an important means to achieve speedy and impartial justice and declog court dockets. </i>As such, the State shall provide means for the use of ADR as an efficient tool and an alternative procedure for the resolution of appropriate cases. Likewise, the State shall enlist active private sector participation in the settlement of disputes through ADR. This Act shall be without prejudice to the adoption by the Supreme Court of any ADR system, such as mediation, conciliation, arbitration, or any combination thereof as a means of achieving speedy and efficient means of resolving cases pending before all courts in the Philippines which shall be governed by such rules as the Supreme Court may approve from time to time. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Our policy in favor of party autonomy in resolving disputes has been reflected in our laws as early as 1949 when our Civil Code was approved.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> Republic Act No. 876<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> later explicitly recognized the validity and enforceability of parties' decision to submit disputes and related issues to arbitration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Arbitration agreements are liberally construed in favor of proceeding to arbitration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> We adopt the interpretation that would render effective an arbitration clause if the terms of the agreement allow for such interpretation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> In <i>LM Power Engineering Corporation v. Capitol Industrial Construction Groups, Inc.,</i><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[82]</sup></font> this court said:<br><br><blockquote>Consistent with the above-mentioned policy of encouraging alternative dispute resolution methods, courts should liberally construe arbitration clauses. Provided such clause is susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute, an order to arbitrate should be granted. Any doubt should be resolved in favor of arbitration.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[83]</sup></font></blockquote><br>This manner of interpreting arbitration clauses is made explicit in Section 25 of Republic Act No. 9285:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 25. <i>Interpretation of the Act.</i>-In interpreting the Act, the court shall have due regard to the policy of the law in favor of arbitration. Where action is commenced by or against multiple parties, one or more of whom are parties to an arbitration agreement, the court shall refer to arbitration those parties who are bound by the arbitration agreement although the civil action may continue as to those who are not bound by such arbitration agreement.</blockquote><br>Hence, we resolve the issue of whether DMCI-PDI may compel BCDA and Northrail to submit to arbitration proceedings in light of the policy in favor of arbitration.<br><br>BCDA and Northrail assail DMCI-PDI's right to compel them to submit to arbitration based on the assumption that DMCI-PDI was not a party to the agreement containing the arbitration clause.<br><br>Three documents — (a) Joint Venture Agreement, (b) amended Joint Venture Agreement, and (c) Memorandum of Agreement — represent the agreement between BCDA, Northrail, and D.M.

Thus, amendments or supplements to the agreement may be executed by contracting parties to address the circumstances or issues that arise while a contract subsists.<br><br>When an agreement is amended, some provisions are changed. Certain parts or provisions may be added, removed, or corrected. These changes may cause effects that are inconsistent with the wordings of the contract before the changes were applied. In that case, the old provisions shall be deemed to have lost their force and effect, while the changes shall be deemed to have taken effect. Provisions that are not affected by the changes usually remain effective.<br><br>When a contract is supplemented, new provisions that are not inconsistent with the old provisions are added. The nature, scope, and terms and conditions are expanded. In that case, the old and the new provisions form part of the contract.<br><br>A reading of all the documents of agreement shows that they were executed by the same parties. Initially, the Joint Venture Agreement was executed only by BCD A, PNR, and the foreign corporations. When the Joint Venture Agreement was amended to include D.M. Consunji, Inc. <b>and/or its nominee</b>, D.M. Consunji, Inc. and/or its nominee were deemed to have been also a party to the original Joint Venture Agreement executed by BCDA, PNR, and the foreign corporations. D.M. Consunji, Inc. and/or its nominee became bound to the terms of both the Joint Venture Agreement and its amendment.<br><br>Moreover, each document was executed to achieve the single purpose of implementing the railroad project, such that documents of agreement succeeding the original Joint Venture Agreement merely amended or supplemented the provisions of the original Joint Venture Agreement.<br><br>The first agreement — the Joint Venture Agreement — defined the project, its purposes, the parties, the parties' equity participation, and their responsibilities. The second agreement — the amended Joint Venture Agreement —- only changed the equity participation of the parties and included D.M. Consunji, Inc. and/or its nominee as party to the railroad project. The third agreement — the Memorandum of Agreement — raised the seed capitalization of Northrail from P100 million as indicated in the first agreement to P600 million, in order to accelerate the implementation of the same project defined in the first agreement.<br><br>The Memorandum of Agreement is an implementation of the Joint Venture Agreement and the amended Joint Venture Agreement. It could not exist without referring to the provisions of the original and amended Joint Venture Agreements. It assumes a prior knowledge of its terms. Thus, it referred to "North Luzon railway network as defined by the JVA of 10 June 1995[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>In other words, each document of agreement represents a step toward the implementation of the project, such that the three agreements must be read together for a complete understanding of the parties' whole agreement. The Joint Venture Agreement, the amended Joint Venture Agreement, and the Memorandum of Agreement should be treated as one contract because they all form part of a whole agreement.<br><br>Hence, the arbitration clause in the Joint Venture Agreement should not be interpreted as applicable only to the Joint Venture Agreement's original parties. The succeeding agreements are deemed part of or a continuation of the Joint Venture Agreement. The arbitration clause should extend to all the agreements and its parties since it is still consistent with all the terms and conditions of the amendments and supplements.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>BCDA and Northrail argued that they did not consent to D.M. Consunji, Inc.'s assignment of rights to DMCI-PDI. Therefore, DMCI-PDI did not validly become a party to any of the agreement. Section 17.1 of the Joint Venture Agreement provides that rights under the agreement may not be assigned, transferred, or conveyed without the consent of the other party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> Thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>17.1</b> No party to this Agreement may assign, transfer or convey this Agreement, create or incur any encumbrance of its rights or any part of its rights and obligations hereunder or any shares of stocks of NORTHRAIL to any person, firm or corporation without the prior written consent of the other parties or except as provided in the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of NORTHRAIL and the Agreement.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br></blockquote><br>However, Section 17.2 of the Joint Venture Agreement provides that the agreement shall be binding on nominees:<br><br><blockquote><b>17.2</b> This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties . . . and their respective successors and permitted assignees <i>and designees or nominees</i> whenever applicable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The principal parties to the agreement after its amendment include D.M. Consunji, Inc. <u>and/or its nominee</u>:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>AMENDMENT TO THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT</b><br></center><br>This Amendment to the Joint Venture Agreement dated 10<sup>th</sup> of June 1995 (the <i>Agreement</i>) made and executed at _____________ , Metro Manila, on this 8<sup>th</sup> day of February 1996 by and among:<br><br>BASES CONVERSION DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY . . . <br><br><div align="center">with <br></div><br><b>PHILIPPINE NATIONAL RAILWAYS</b> . . .<br><br><center>and</center><br>. . . . <br><br><i><b>D.M.

Consunji, Inc. designated DMCI-PDI as its nominee for the agreements it entered into in relation to the project:<br><br><blockquote>[I]n order to formalize the inclusion of [DMCI Project Developers, Inc.] as a party to the JVA and MOA, DMCI would like to notify all the parties <i>that it is designating PDI as its nominee in both agreements and such other agreements that may be signed by the parties in furtherance of or in connection with the PROJECT. </i>By this nomination, all the rights, obligations, warranties and commitments of DMCI under the JVA and MOA shall henceforth be assumed performed and delivered by PDI.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, lack of consent to the assignment is irrelevant because there was no assignment or transfer of rights to DMCI-PDI. DMCI-PDI was D.M. Consunji, Inc.'s nominee.<br><br>Section 17.2 of the Joint Venture Agreement clearly shows an intent to treat assignment and nomination differently.<br><br><blockquote><b>17.2</b> This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties . . . and their respective successors and permitted <i>assignees and designees or nominees</i> whenever applicable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Assignment involves the transfer of rights after the perfection of a contract. Nomination pertains to the act of naming the party with whom it has a relationship of trust or agency.<br><br>In <i>Philippine Coconut Producers Federation, Inc. (COCOFED) v. Republic,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> this court defined "nominee" as follows:<br><br><blockquote>In its most common signification, the term "<i>nominee</i>'' refers to one who is designated to act for another usually in a limited way; a person in whose name a stock or bond certificate is registered but who is not the actual owner thereof is considered a nominee."<i> Corpus Juris Secundum</i> describes a nominee as one:<br><br><blockquote>". . . designated to act for another as his representative in a rather limited sense. It has no connotation, however, other than that of acting for another, in representation of another or as the grantee of another. In its commonly accepted meaning the term connoted the delegation of authority to the nominee in a representative or nominal capacity only, and does not connote the transfer or assignment to the nominee of any property in, or ownership of, the rights of the person nominating him."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote></blockquote><br>Contrary to BCDA and Northrail's position, therefore, the agreement's prohibition against transfers, conveyance, and assignment of rights without the consent of the other party does not apply to nomination.<br><br>DMCI-PDI is a party to all the agreements, including the arbitration agreement. It may, thus, invoke the arbitration clause against all the parties.<br><br><center>III<br></center><br>Northrail, although not a signatory to the contracts, is also bound by the arbitration agreement.<br><br>In <i>Lanuza v. BF Corporation,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> we recognized that there are instances when non-signatories to a contract may be compelled to submit to arbitration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> Among those instances is when a non-signatory is allowed to invoke rights or obligations based on the contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>The subject of BCDA and D.M. Consunji, Inc.'s agreement was the construction and operation of a railroad system. Northrail was established pursuant to this agreement and its terms, and for the same purpose, thus:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>ARTICLE III<br><br>PURPOSE OF NORTHRAIL</b></center><br><br><b>A. PRIMARY PURPOSE</b><br><br><b>3.1.</b> To construct, operate and manage a railroad system to serve Northern and Central Luzon; and to develop, construct, manage, own, lease, sublease and operate establishments and facilities of all kinds related to the railroad system[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup></blockquote><br>Northrail's capitalization and the composition of its subscribers are also subject to the provisions of the original and amended Joint Venture Agreements, and the subsequent Memorandum of Agreement. It was pursuant to the terms of these agreements that Northrail demanded from D.M. Consunji, Inc. the infusion of its share in subscription.<br><br>Therefore, Northrail cannot deny understanding that its existence, purpose, rights, and obligations are tied to the agreements. When Northrail demanded for the amount of D.M. Consunji, Inc.'s subscription based on the agreements and later accepted the latter's funds, it proved that it was bound by the agreements' terms. It is also deemed to have accepted the term that such funds shall be used for its privatization. It cannot choose to demand the enforcement of some of its provisions if it is in its favor, and then later by whim, deny being bound by its terms.<br><br>Hence, when BCDA and Northrail decided not to proceed with Northrail's privatization and the transfer of subscriptions to D.M. Consunji, Inc., any obligation to return its supposed subscription attached not only to BCDA as party to the agreement but primarily to Northrail as beneficiary that impliedly accepted the terms of the agreement and received D.M. Consunji, Inc.'s funds.<br><br>There is, therefore, merit to DMCI-PDI's argument that if the Civil Code<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> gives third party beneficiaries to a contract the right to demand the contract's fulfillment in its favor, the reverse should also be true.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> A beneficiary who communicated his or her acceptance to the terms of the agreement before its revocation may be compelled to abide by the terms of an agreement, including the arbitration clause. In this case, Northrail is deemed to have communicated its acceptance of the terms of the agreements when it accepted D.M. Consunji, Inc.'s funds.<br><br>Finally, judicial efficiency and economy require a policy to avoid multiplicity of suits. As we said in <i>Lanuza</i>:<br><br><blockquote>Moreover, in <i>Heirs ofAugusto Salas,</i> this court affirmed its policy against multiplicity of suits and unnecessary delay. This court said that "to split the proceeding into arbitration for some parties and trial for other parties would "result in multiplicity of suits, duplicitous procedure and unnecessary delay." This court also intimated that the interest of justice would be best observed if it adjudicated rights in a single proceeding. While the facts of that case prompted this court to direct the trial court to proceed to determine the issues of that case, it did not prohibit courts from allowing the case to proceed to arbitration, when circumstances warrant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup></blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petitions are <b>DENIED</b>.
