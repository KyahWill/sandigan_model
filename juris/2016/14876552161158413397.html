				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The fundamental importance of this case lies in its delineation of the extent of permissible judicial review over arbitral awards. We make this determination from the prism of our existing laws on the subject and the prevailing state policy to uphold the autonomy of arbitration proceedings.<br><br>This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the Court of Appeals' (<i>CA</i>) decision in <b>CA-G.R. SP. No. 112384</b> that reversed an arbitral award and dismissed the arbitral complaint for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The CA breached the bounds of its jurisdiction when it reviewed the substance of the arbitral award outside of the permitted grounds under the Arbitration Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>Brief Factual Antecedents</i></b><br></center><br>In 1978, Fruehauf Electronics Philippines Corp. (<i>Fruehauf</i>) leased several parcels of land in Pasig City to Signetics Filipinas Corporation (Signetics) for a period of 25 years (until May 28, 2003). Signetics constructed a semiconductor assembly factory on the land on its own account.<br><br>In 1983, Signetics ceased its operations after the Board of Investments (<i>BOI</i>) withdrew the investment incentives granted to electronic industries based in Metro Manila.<br><br>In 1986, Team Holdings Limited (THL) bought Signetics. THL later changed its name to Technology Electronics Assembly and Management Pacific Corp. (<i>TEAM</i>).<br><br>In March 1987, Fruehauf filed an unlawful detainer case against TEAM. In an effort to amicably settle the dispute, both parties executed a Memorandum of Agreement (<i>MOA</i>) on June 9, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Under the MOA, TEAM undertook to pay Fruehauf 14.7 million pesos as unpaid rent (for the period of December 1986 to June 1988).<br><br>They also entered a 15-year lease contract<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (expiring on June 9, 2003) that was renewable for another 25 years upon mutual agreement. The contract included an arbitration agreement:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><blockquote>17. <u>ARBITRATION</u><br><br>In the event of any dispute or disagreement between the parties hereto involving the interpretation or implementation of any provision of this Contract of Lease, the dispute or disagreement shall be referred to arbitration by a three (3) member arbitration committee, one member to be appointed by the LESSOR, another member to be appointed by the LESSEE, and the third member to be appointed by these two members. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Law (R.A. No. 876).<br></blockquote>The contract also authorized TEAM to sublease the property. TEAM subleased the property to Capitol Publishing House (<i>Capitol</i>) on December 2, 1996 after notifying Fruehauf.<br><br>On May 2003, TEAM informed Fruehauf that it would not be renewing the lease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On May 31, 2003, the sublease between TEAM and Capitol expired. However, Capitol only vacated the premises on March 5, 2005. In the meantime, the master lease between TEAM and Fruehauf expired on June 9, 2003.<br><br>On March 9, 2004, Fruehauf instituted <b>SP Proc. No. 11449</b> before the Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC</i>) for "<i>Submission of an Existing Controversy for Arbitration</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> It alleged: (1) that when the lease expired, the property suffered from damage that required extensive renovation; (2) that when the lease expired, TEAM failed to turn over the premises and pay rent; and (3) that TEAM did not restore the property to its original condition as required in the contract. Accordingly, the parties are obliged to submit the dispute to arbitration pursuant to the stipulation in the lease contract.<br><br>The RTC granted the petition and directed the parties to comply with the arbitration clause of the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to the arbitration agreement, the dispute was referred to a three-member arbitration tribunal. TEAM and Fruehauf appointed one member each while the Chairman was appointed by the first two members. The tribunal was formally constituted on September 27, 2004 with retired CA Justice Hector L. Hofile√±a, as chairman, retired CA Justice Mariano M. Umali and Atty. Maria Clara B. Tankeh Asuncion as members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The parties initially submitted the following issues to the tribunal for resolution:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><blockquote><ol><li>Whether or not TEAM had complied with its obligation to return the leased premises to Fruehauf after the expiration of the lease on June 9, 2003.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1.1.

If so, how much and for what period?<br><br></li><li>Is TEAM liable for payment of real estate taxes, insurance, and other expenses on the leased premises after June 9, 2003?<br><br></li><li>Who is liable for payment of damages and how much?<br><br></li><li>Who is liable for payment of attorney's fees and how much?</li></ol></blockquote>Subsequently, the following issues were also submitted for resolution after TEAM proposed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> their inclusion:<br><ol><li>Who is liable for the expenses of arbitration, including arbitration fees?<br><br></li><li>Whether or not TEAM has the obligation to return the premises to Fruehauf as a "complete, rentable, and fully facilitized electronic plant."<br></li></ol><b><i><u>The Arbitral Award</u></i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On December 3, 2008, the arbitral tribunal awarded Fruehauf: (1) 8.2 million pesos as (the balance of) unpaid rent from June 9, 2003 until March 5, 2005; and (2) 46.8 million pesos as damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The tribunal found that Fruehauf made several demands for the return of the leased premises before and after the expiration of the lease<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and that there was no express or implied renewal of the lease after June 9, 2003. It recognized that the sub-lessor, Capitol, remained in possession of the lease. However, relying on the commentaries of Arturo Tolentino on the subject, the tribunal held that it was not enough for lessor to simply vacate the leased property; <i>it is necessary that he place the thing at the disposal of the lessor, so that the latter can receive it without any obstacle</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>For failing to return the property to Fruehauf, TEAM remained liable for the payment of rents. However, if it can prove that Fruehauf received rentals from Capitol, TEAM can deduct these from its liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Nevertheless, the award of rent and damages was without prejudice to TEAM's right to seek redress from its sub-lessee, Capitol.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>With respect to the improvements on the land, the tribunal viewed the situation from two perspectives:<br><br><u><i>First</i></u>, while the Contract admitted that Fruehauf was only leasing the land and not the buildings and improvements thereon, it nevertheless obliged TEAM to deliver the buildings, installations and other improvements existing at the inception of the lease upon its expiration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><u><i>The other view</i></u>, is that the MOA and the Contract recognized that TEAM owned the existing improvements on the property and considered them as separate from the land for the initial 15-year term of the lease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> However, Fruehauf had a vested right to become the owner of these improvements at the end of the 15-year term. Consequently, the contract specifically obligated TEAM not to remove, transfer, destroy, or in any way alienate or encumber these improvements without prior written consent from Fruehauf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br><b>Either way</b>, TEAM had the obligation to deliver the existing improvements on the land upon the expiration of the lease. However, there was no obligation under the lease to return the premises as a "<i>complete, rentable, and fully facilitized electronis plant</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Thus, TEAM's obligation was to vacate the leased property and deliver to Fruehauf the buildings, improvements, and installations (including the machineries and equipment existing thereon) in the same condition as when the lease commenced, save for what had been lost or impaired by the lapse of time, ordinary wear and tear, or any other inevitable cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The tribunal found TEAM negligent in the maintenance of the premises, machineries, and equipment it was obliged to deliver to Fruehauf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> For this failure to conduct the necessary repairs or to notify Fruehauf of their necessity, the tribunal held TEAM accountable for damages representing the value of the repairs necessary to restore the premises to a condition "<i>suitable for the use to which it has been devoted</i>" less their depreciation expense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On the other issues, the tribunal held that TEAM had no obligation to pay real estate taxes, insurance, and other expenses on the leased premises considering these obligations can only arise from a renewal of the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Further, the tribunal refused to award attorney's fees, finding no evidence that either party acted in bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> For the same reason, it held both parties equally liable for the expenses of litigation, including the arbitrators' fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>TEAM moved for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> which the tribunal denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Thus, TEAM petitioned the RTC to partially vacate or modify the arbitral award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It argued that the tribunal failed to properly appreciate the facts and the terms of the lease contract.<br><br><b><u><i>The RTC Ruling</i></u></b><br><br>On April 29, 2009, the RTC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> found <b><i>insufficient legal grounds</i></b> under Sections 24 and 25 of the Arbitration Law to modify or vacate the award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It denied the petition and CONFIRMED, the arbitral award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> TEAM filed a Notice of Appeal.<br><br>On July 3, 2009,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the RTC refused to give due course to the Notice of Appeal because according to Section 29<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of the Arbitration Law, an ordinary appeal under Rule 41 is not the proper mode of appeal against an order confirming an arbitral award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>TEAM moved for reconsideration but the RTC denied the motion on November 15, 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Thus, TEAM led a petition for <i>certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> before the CA arguing that the RTC gravely abused its discretion in: (1) denying due course to its notice of appeal; and (2) denying the motion to partially vacate and/or modify the arbitral award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>TEAM argued that an ordinary appeal under Rule 41 was the proper remedy against the RTC's order confirming, modifying, correcting, or vacating an arbitral award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> It argued that Rule 42 was not available because the order denying its motion to vacate was not rendered in the exercise of the RTC's appellate jurisdiction. Further, Rule 43 only applies to decisions of quasi-judicial bodies. Finally, an appeal under Rule 45 to the Supreme Court would preclude it from raising questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>TEAM maintained that it was appealing the RTC's order denying its petition to partially vacate/modify the award, <b>not the arbitral award itself</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Citing Rule 41, Section 13 of the Rules of Court, the RTC's authority to dismiss the appeal is limited to instances when it was filed out of time or when the appellant fails to pay the docket fees within the reglementary period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>TEAM further maintained that the RTC gravely abused its discretion by confirming the Arbitral Tribunal's award when it evidently had legal and factual errors, miscalculations, and ambiguities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The petition was docketed as <b>CA-G.R. SP. No. 112384</b>.<br><br><b><u><i>The CA decision</i></u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The CA initially dismissed the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> As the RTC did, it cited Section 29 of the Arbitration Law:<br><blockquote><b>Section 29.</b> <i>Appeals</i>. - <b>An appeal may be taken</b> from an order made in a proceeding under this Act, or from a judgment entered upon an award through <b><u>certiorari proceedings</u></b>, but such appeals shall be limited to questions of law. The proceedings upon such appeal, including the judgment thereon shall be governed by the Rules of Court in so far as they are applicable.<br></blockquote>It concluded that the appeal contemplated under the law is an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> limited only to questions flaw.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The CA continued that TEAM failed to substantiate its claim as to the "evident miscalculation of figures." It further held that disagreement with the arbitrators' factual determinations and legal conclusions does not empower courts to amend or overrule arbitral judgments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>However, the CA amended its decision on October 25, 2012 upon a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The CA held that Section 29 of the Arbitration Law does not preclude the aggrieved party from resorting to other judicial remedies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Citing <i>Asset Privatization Trust v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the CA held that the aggrieved party may resort to a petition for <i>certiorari</i> when the RTC to which the award was submitted for confirmation has acted without jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy remedy in the course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The CA further held that the mere filing of a notice of appeal is sufficient as the issues raised in the appeal were not purely questions of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It further cited Section 46 of the Alternative Dispute Resolution (<i>ADR</i>) Law:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><blockquote><b>SEC. 46. <i>Appeal from Court Decisions on Arbitral Awards</i>.</b> - A decision of the regional trial court confirming, vacating, setting aside, modifying or correcting an arbitral award may be appealed to the Court of Appeals in accordance with the rules of procedure to be promulgated by the Supreme Court.<br><br>The losing party who appeals from the judgment of the court confirming an arbitral award shall be required by the appellant court to post counterbond executed in favor of the prevailing party equal to the amount of the award in accordance with the rules to be promulgated by the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote>However, the CA made no further reference to A.M. No. 07-11-08-SC, the Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution (<i>Special ADR Rules</i>) which govern the appeal procedure.<br><br>The CA further revisited the merits of the arbitral award and found several errors in law and in fact. It held: (1) that TEAM was not obliged to pay rent because it was Capitol, not TEAM, that remained in possession of the property upon the expiration of the lease;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and (2) that Fruehauf was not entitled to compensation for the repairs on the buildings because it did not become the owner of the building until after the expiration of the lease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>Also citing Tolentino, the CA opined: (1) that a statement by the lessee that he has abandoned the premises should, as a general rule, constitute sufficient compliance with his duty to return the leased premises; and (2) that any new arrangement made by the lessor with another person, such as the sub-lessor, operates as a resumption of his possession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>On the issue of damages, the CA held that TEAM can never be liable for the damages for the repairs of the improvements on the premises because they were owned by TEAM itself (through its predecessor, Signetics) when the lease commenced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>The CA <b>REVERSED AND SET ASIDE</b> the arbitral award and <b>DISMISSED</b> the arbitral complaint for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>This CA action prompted Fruehauf to file the present petition for review.<br><br><center><b><i>The Arguments</i></b><br></center><br>Fruehauf argues that courts do not have the power to substitute their judgment for that of the arbitrators.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> It also insists that an ordinary appeal is not the proper remedy against an RTC's order confirming, vacating, correcting or modifying an arbitral ward but a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, TEAM's petition before the CA went beyond the permissible scope of <i>certiorari</i> the existence of grave abuse of discretion or errors jurisdiction - by including questions of fact and law that challenged the merits of the arbitral award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>However, Fruehauf inconsistently argues that the remedies against an arbitral award are (1) a petition to vacate the award, (2) a petition for review under Rule 43 raising questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law, or (3) a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Fruehauf cites an article from the Philippine Dispute Resolution Center<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and <i>Insular Savings Bank v.

World Interactive Network Systems (WINS) Japan Co., Ltd.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br><center><b><i>The Issues</i></b><br></center><br>This case raises the following questions:<br><ol><li>What are the remedies or the modes of appeal against an unfavorable arbitral award?<br><br></li><li>What are the available remedies from an RTC decision confirming, vacating, modifying, or correcting an arbitral award?<br><br></li><li>Did the arbitral tribunal err in awarding Fruehauf damages for the repairs of the building and rental fees from the expiration of the lease?<br></li></ol><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Our Ruling</b><br></div><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>Arbitration is an alternative mode of dispute resolution <b><i>outside of the regular court system</i></b>. Although adversarial in character, arbitration is technically not litigation. It is a voluntary process in which one or more arbitrators - appointed according to the parties' agreement or according to the applicable rules of the Alternative Dispute Resolution (<i>ADR</i>) Law - resolve a dispute by rendering an award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> While arbitration carries many advantages over court litigation, in many ways these advantages also translate into its disadvantages.<br><br>Resort to arbitration is voluntary. It requires <b><i>consent from both parties</i></b> in the form of an arbitration clause that <b><i>pre-existed the dispute</i></b> <i>or a</i> <b><i>subsequent submission agreement</i></b>. This written arbitration agreement is an independent and legally enforceable contract that must be complied with in good faith. By entering into an arbitration agreement, the parties agree to submit their dispute to an arbitrator (or tribunal) of their own choosing and be bound by the latter's resolution.<br><br>However, this <b>contractual</b> and <b>consensual</b> character means that the parties cannot implead a third-party the proceedings even if the latter's participation is necessary for a complete settlement of the dispute. The tribunal does not have the power to compel a person to participate in the arbitration proceedings without that person's consent. It also has no authority to decide on issues that the parties did not submit (or agree to submit) for its resolution.<br><br>As a <b>purely private mode of dispute resolution</b>, arbitration proceedings, including the records, the evidence, and the arbitral award, are confidential<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> unlike court proceedings which are generally public. This allows the parties to avoid negative publicity and protect their privacy. Our law highly regards the confidentiality of arbitration proceedings that it devised a judicial remedy to prevent or prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information obtained therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>The contractual nature of arbitral proceedings affords the parties substantial <b>autonomy over the proceedings</b>. The parties are free to agree on <i>the procedure to be observed</i> during the proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> This lends considerable flexibility to arbitration proceedings as compared to court litigation governed by the Rules of Court.<br><br>The parties likewise <b>appoint the arbitrators</b> based on agreement. There are no other legal requirements as to the competence or technical qualifications of an arbitrator. Their only legal qualifications are: (1) being of legal age; (2) full-enjoyment of their civil rights; and (3) the ability to read and write.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The parties can tailor-fit the tribunal's composition to the nature of their dispute. Thus, a specialized dispute <i>can</i> be resolved by experts on the subject.<br><br>However, because arbitrators do not necessarily have a background in law, they cannot be expected to have the legal mastery of a magistrate. There is a greater risk that an arbitrator might misapply the law or misappreciate the facts <i>en route</i> to an erroneous decision.<br><br>This <i>risk of error</i> is compounded by the <b>absence of an effective appeal mechanism</b>. The errors of an arbitral tribunal are not subject to correction by the judiciary. As a private alternative to court proceedings, <b>arbitration is meant to be an end, <i>not the beginning</i>, of litigation</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Thus, the arbitral award is final and binding on the parties by reason of their contract the arbitration agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br><u><i>An Arbitral Tribunal does not exercise quasi-judicial powers</i></u><br><br>Quasi-judicial or administrative adjudicatory power is the power: (1) to hear and determine <i>questions of fact</i> to which legislative policy is to apply, and (2) to decide in accordance with the <i>standards laid down by the law itself in enforcing and administering the same law</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Quasi-judicial power is only exercised by administrative agencies - legal organs of the government.<br><br>Quasi-judicial bodies can only exercise such powers and jurisdiction as are expressly or by necessary implication conferred upon them by their enabling statutes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Like courts, a quasi-judicial body's jurisdiction over a subject matter is conferred by law and exists independently from the will of the parties. As government organs necessary for an effective legal system, a quasi-judicial tribunal's legal existence. continues beyond the resolution of a specific dispute. In other words, quasi-judicial bodies are <b><i>creatures of law</i></b>.<br><br>As a contractual and consensual body, the <i>arbitral tribunal does not have any inherent powers over the parties</i>. It has no power to issue coercive writs or compulsory processes. Thus, there is a need to resort to the regular courts for interim measures of protection<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> and for the recognition or enforcement of the arbitral award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>The arbitral tribunal acquires jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter through stipulation. Upon the rendition of the final award, the tribunal becomes <i>functus officio</i> and - save for a few exceptions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> - ceases to have any further jurisdiction over the dispute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> The tribunal's powers (or in the case of <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals, their very existence) stem from the obligatory force of the arbitration agreement and its ancillary stipulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Simply put, <b>an arbitral tribunal</b> is a <b><i>creature of contract</i></b>.<br><br><b><u><i>Deconstructing the view that arbitral tribunals are quasi-judicial agencies</i></u></b><br><br>We are aware of the contrary view expressed by the late Chief Justice Renato Corona in <i>ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation v.

It equated the term "voluntary arbitrator" used in Rule 43, Section 1 and in the cases of <span style="font-style: italic;">Luzon Development Bank v. Association of</span> <i>Luzon Development Bank Employees, Sevilla Trading Company v. Semana, Manila Midtown Hotel v. Borromeo, </i>and<i> Nippon Paint Employees Union-Olalia v.

It is a technical term with a specific definition under the Labor Code:<br><blockquote>Art. 212 <b>Definitions. xxx</b><br><br>14. "Voluntary Arbitrator" means any person accredited by the Board as such or any person named or designated in the Collective Bargaining Agreement by the parties to act as their Voluntary Arbitrator, or one chosen with or without the assistance of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board, pursuant to a selection procedure agreed upon in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, or any official that may be authorized by the Secretary of Labor and Employment to act as Voluntary Arbitrator upon the written request and agreement of the parties to a labor dispute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup></blockquote>Voluntary Arbitrators resolve labor disputes and grievances arising from the interpretation of Collective Bargaining Agreements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> These disputes were specifically excluded from the coverage of both the Arbitration Law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> and the ADR Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>Unlike purely commercial relationships, the relationship between capital and labor are <i>heavily impressed with public interest</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> Because of this, Voluntary Arbitrators authorized to resolve labor disputes have been clothed with quasi-judicial authority.<br><br>On the other hand, commercial relationships covered by our commercial arbitration laws are purely private and contractual in nature. Unlike labor relationships, they do not possess the same compelling state interest that would justify state interference into the autonomy of contracts. Hence, commercial arbitration is a <i>purely private system</i> of adjudication facilitated by <i>private citizens</i> instead of government instrumentalities wielding quasi-judicial powers.<br><br><u><i>Moreover</i></u>, judicial or quasi-judicial jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon a tribunal by the parties alone. The Labor Code itself confers subject-matter jurisdiction to Voluntary Arbitrators.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>Notably, the other arbitration, body listed in Rule 43 the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (<i>CIAC</i>) - is also a government agency<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> attached to the Department of Trade and Industry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Its jurisdiction is likewise conferred by statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> By contrast, the subject¬≠-matter jurisdiction of commercial arbitrators is stipulated by the parties.<br><br>These account for the legal differences between "ordinary" or "commercial" arbitrators under the Arbitration Law and the ADR Law, and "voluntary arbitrators" under the Labor Code. The two terms are not synonymous with each other. Interchanging them with one another results in the logical fallacy of <i>equivocation</i> - using the same word with different meanings.<br><br><u><i>Further</i></u>, Rule 43, Section 1 enumerates quasi-judicial tribunals whose decisions are appealable to the CA instead of the RTC. But where legislation provides for an appeal from decisions of certain <i>administrative</i> bodies to the CA, it means that <i>such bodies are co-equal with the RTC in terms of rank and stature, logically placing them beyond the control of the latter</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br><br>However, arbitral tribunals and the RTC are <i>not co-equal</i> bodies because the RTC is authorized to confirm or to vacate (but not reverse) arbitral awards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> If we were to deem arbitrators as included in the scope of Rule 43, we would effectively place it on equal footing with the RTC and remove arbitral awards from the scope of RTC review.<br><br>All things considered, there is no legal authority supporting the position that commercial arbitrators are quasi-judicial bodies.<br><br><u><i>What are remedies from a final domestic arbitral award?</i></u><br><br>The right to an appeal is neither a natural right nor an indispensable component of due process; it is a mere statutory privilege that cannot be invoked in the absence of an enabling statute. Neither the Arbitration Law nor the ADR Law allows a losing party to appeal from the arbitral award. The statutory absence of an appeal mechanism reflects the State's policy of upholding the autonomy of arbitration proceedings and their corresponding arbitral awards.<br><br>This Court recognized this when we enacted the <i>Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution</i> in 2009:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><blockquote><b>Rule 2.1.</b> <i>General policies</i>. - It is the policy of the State to actively promote the use of various modes of ADR and to respect party autonomy or the freedom of the parties to make their own arrangements in the resolution of disputes with the greatest cooperation of and the least intervention from the courts. xxx<br><br>The Court shall exercise the power of judicial review as provided by these Special ADR Rules. <b>Courts shall intervene only in the cases allowed by law or these Special ADR Rules.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup><br><br><center>xxxx<br></center><br><b>Rule 19.7.</b> <i>No appeal or certiorari on the merits of an arbitral award.</i> - An agreement to refer a dispute to arbitration shall mean that the arbitral award shall be final and binding. Consequently, a party to an arbitration is <b>precluded from filing an appeal or a petition for certiorari questioning the merits of an arbitral award</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold;">(emphasis supplied)</span></blockquote>More than a decade earlier in <b><u><i>Asset Privatization Trust v. Court of Appeals</i></u></b>, we likewise defended the autonomy of arbitral awards through our policy of non-intervention on their substantive merits:<br><blockquote>As a rule, the award of an arbitrator cannot be set aside for mere errors of judgment either as to the law or as to the facts. Courts are <b>without power to amend or overrule merely because of disagreement with matters of law or facts determined by the arbitrators</b>. They will not review the findings of law and fact contained in an award, and <b>will not undertake to substitute their judgment for that of the arbitrators</b>, since any other rule would make an award the commencement, not the end, of litigation. Errors of law and fact, or an erroneous decision of matters submitted to the judgment of the arbitrators, are <b>insufficient to invalidate an award fairly and honestly made</b>. Judicial review of an arbitration is, thus, more limited than judicial review of a trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup></blockquote>Nonetheless, an arbitral award is not absolute. Rule 19.10 of the Special ADR Rules - by referring to Section 24 of the Arbitration Law and Article 34 of the 1985 United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (<i>UNCITRAL</i>) Model Law - recognizes the very limited exceptions to the autonomy of arbitral awards:<br><blockquote><b>Rule 19.10. <i>Rule on judicial review on arbitration in the Philippines.</i></b> - As a general rule, the court can only vacate or set aside the decision of an arbitral tribunal upon a clear showing that the award suffers from any of the infirmities or grounds for vacating an arbitral award <b><u>under Section 24 of Republic Act No. 876</u></b> <b>or under <u>Rule 34 of the Model Law in a domestic arbitration</u></b>, or for setting aside an award in an international arbitration under Article 34 of the Model Law, or for such other grounds provided under these Special Rules.<br><br>If the Regional Trial Court is asked to set aside an arbitral award in a domestic or international arbitration <b>on any ground other than those provided in the Special ADR Rules</b>, the court shall entertain such ground for the setting aside or non-recognition of the arbitral award <b>only if the same amounts to <u>a violation of public policy</u></b>.<br><br>The court <b>shall not set aside or vacate the award of the arbitral tribunal merely on the ground that the arbitral tribunal committed errors of fact, or of law, or of fact and law, as the court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the arbitral tribunal</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup></blockquote>The grounds for <b><u>vacating</u></b> a domestic arbitral award under Section 24 of the Arbitration Law contemplate the following scenarios:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> when the award is procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means; or</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators or any of them; or</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(c) </div></td><td><div align="justify">the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct that materially prejudiced the rights of any party; or</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(d)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[117]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>The award may also be vacated if an arbitrator who was disqualified to act willfully refrained from disclosing his disqualification to the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[118]</sup> Notably, none of these grounds pertain to the correctness of the award but relate to the <i>misconduct of arbitrators</i>.<br><br>The RTC may also set aside the arbitral award based on Article 34 of the UNCITRAL Model Law.

However, the abovementioned grounds taken from the UNCITRAL. Model Law are specifically made applicable to domestic arbitration by the Special ADR Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[120]</sup><br><br>Notably, these grounds are not concerned with the correctness of the award; they go into the validity of the arbitration agreement or the regularity of the arbitration proceedings.<br><br>These grounds for vacating an arbitral award are exclusive. Under the ADR Law, courts are obliged to disregard any other grounds invoked to set aside an award:<br><blockquote><b>SEC. 41. <i>Vacation Award</i>.</b> - A party to a domestic arbitration may question the arbitral award with the appropriate regional trial court in accordance with the rules of procedure to be promulgated by the Supreme Court only on those grounds enumerated in Section 25 of Republic Act No. 876. <b>Any other ground raised against a domestic arbitral award shall be disregarded by the regional trial court.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup></blockquote>Consequently, the winning party can generally expect the enforcement of the award. This is a stricter rule that makes Article 2044<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> of the Civil Code regarding the finality of an arbitral award redundant.<br><br>As established earlier, an arbitral award is not appealable via Rule 43 because: (1) there is no statutory basis for an appeal from the final award of arbitrators; (2) arbitrators are not quasi-judicial bodies; and (3) the Special ADR Rules specifically prohibit the filing of an appeal to question the merits of an arbitral award.<br><br>The Special ADR Rules allow the RTC to correct or modify an arbitral award pursuant to Section 25 of the Arbitration Law. However, this authority cannot be interpreted as jurisdiction to review the merits of the award. The RTC can modify or correct the award only in the following cases:<ol type="a"><li>Where there was an evident miscalculation of figures or an evident mistake in the description of any person, thing or property referred to in the award;<br><br></li><li>Where the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them, not affecting the merits of the decision upon the matter submitted;<br><br></li><li>Where the arbitrators have omitted to resolve an issue submitted to them for resolution; or<br><br></li><li>Where the award is imperfect in a matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy, and if it had been a commissioner's report, the defect could have been amended or disregarded by the Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup></li></ol>A losing party is likewiselrecluded from resorting to <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> <i>Certiorari</i> is a prerogative writ designed to correct errors of jurisdiction committed by a judicial or quasi-judicial body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> Because an arbitral tribunal is <u><b><i>not a government organ</i></b></u> exercising judicial or quasi-judicial powers, it is removed from the ambit of Rule 65.<br><br>Not even the Court's expanded <i>certiorari</i> jurisdiction under the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> can justify judicial intrusion into the merits of arbitral awards. While the Constitution expanded the scope of <i>certiorari</i> proceedings, this power remains limited to a review of the acts of "<i>any branch or instrumentality of the Government</i>." As a purely private creature of contract, an arbitral tribunal remains outside the scope of <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>Lastly, the Special ADR Rules are a self-contained body of rules. The parties cannot invoke remedies and other provisions from the Rules of Court unless they were incorporated in the Special ADR Rules:<br><blockquote>Rule 22.1. <i>Applicability of Rules of Court</i>. - The provisions of the Rules of Court <b>that are applicable</b> to the proceedings enumerated in Rule 1.1 of these Special ADR Rules <b>have either been included and incorporated in these Special ADR Rules or specifically referred to herein</b>.<br><br>In Connection with the above proceedings, the Rules of Evidence shall be liberally construed to achieve the objectives of the Special ADR Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup></blockquote>Contrary to TEAM's position, the Special ADR Rules actually forecloses against other remedies outside of itself. Thus, a losing party cannot assail an arbitral award through, a petition for review under Rule 43 or a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 because these remedies are not specifically permitted in the Special ADR Rules.<br><br>In sum, the only remedy against a final domestic arbitral award is to file petition to vacate or to modify/correct the award not later than thirty (30) days from the receipt of the award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> Unless a ground to vacate has been established, the RTC must confirm the arbitral award as a matter of course.<br><br><u><i>The remedies against an order confirming, vacating, correcting, or modifying an arbitral award</i></u><br><br>Once the RTC orders the confirmation, vacation, or correction/modification of a domestic arbitral award, the aggrieved party may move for reconsideration within a non-extendible period of fifteen (15) days from receipt of the order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> The losing party may also opt to appeal from the RTC's ruling instead.<br><br>Under the Arbitration Law, the mode of appeal was via petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>:<br><blockquote><b>Section 29.</b> <i>Appeals</i>. - <b>An appeal</b> may be taken from an order made in a proceeding under this Act, or from judgment entered upon an award through <b><i>certiorari</i> proceedings</b>, but such appeals <b>shall be limited to questions of law</b>. The proceedings upon such appeal, including the judgment thereon shall be governed by the Rules of Court in so far as they are applicable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup></blockquote>The Arbitration Law did not specify which Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal but left the matter to be governed by the Rules of Court. As the appeal was limited to questions of law and was described as "<i>certiorari</i> proceedings," the mode of appeal can be interpreted as an Appeal By Certiorari to this Court under Rule 45.<br><br>When the <b>ADR Law was enacted in 2004</b>, it specified that the appeal shall be made to the CA in accordance with the rules of procedure to be promulgated by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> The Special ADR Rules provided that the mode of appeal from the RTC's order confirming, vacating, or correcting/modifying a domestic arbitral award was through a petition for review with the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> However, the <b>Special ADR Rules only took effect on October 30, 2009</b>.<br><br>In the present case, the RTC disallowed TEAM's notice of appeal from the former's decision confirming the arbitral award on July 3, 2009. TEAM moved for reconsideration which was likewise denied on November 15, 2009. In the interim, the Special ADR Rules became effective. Notably, the Special ADR Rules apply retroactively in light of its procedural character.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> TEAM filed its petition for <i>certiorari</i> soon after.<br><br>Nevertheless, whether we apply, Section 29 of the Arbitration Law, Section 46 of the ADR Law, or Rule 19.12 of the Special ADR Rules, there is no legal basis that an ordinary appeal (via notice of appeal) is the correct remedy from an order confirming, vacating, or correcting an arbitral award. Thus, there is no merit in the CA's ruling that the RTC gravely abused its discretion when it refused to give due course to the notice of appeal.<br><br><u><i>The correctness or incorrectness of the arbitral award</i></u><br><br>We have deliberately refrained from passing upon the merits of the arbitral award - not because the award was erroneous but because it would be improper. None of the grounds to vacate an arbitral award are present in this case and as already established, the <i>merits</i> of the award cannot be reviewed by the courts.<br><br>Our refusal to review the award is not a simple matter of putting procedural technicalities over the substantive merits of a case; it goes into the very legal substance of the issues. There is no law granting the judiciary authority to review the merits of an arbitral award. If we were to insist on reviewing the correctness of the award (<i>or consent to the CA's doing so</i>), it would be tantamount to expanding our jurisdiction without the benefit of legislation. This translates to judicial legislation - a breach of the fundamental principle of separation of powers.<br><br>The CA <b>reversed</b> the arbitral award - <i>an action that it has no power to do</i> - because it disagreed with the tribunal's factual findings and application of the law. However, the alleged incorrectness of the award is insufficient cause to vacate the award, given the State's policy of upholding the autonomy of arbitral awards.<br><br>The CA passed upon questions such as: (1) whether or not TEAM effectively returned the property upon the expiration of the lease; (2) whether or not TEAM was liable to pay rentals after the expiration of the lease; and (3) whether or not TEAM was liable to pay Fruehauf damages corresponding to the cost of repairs. These were the same questions that were specifically submitted to the arbitral tribunal for its resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup><br><br>The CA disagreed with the tribunal's factual determinations and legal interpretation of TEAM's obligations under the contract - particularly, that TEAM's obligation to turn over the improvements on the land at the end of the lease in the same condition as when the lease commenced translated to an obligation to make ordinary repairs necessary for its preservation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup><br><br>Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the tribunal's interpretation of the contract was incorrect, the errors would have <b>been simple errors of law</b>. It was the tribunal - not the RTC or the CA - that had jurisdiction and authority over the issue by virtue of the parties' submissions; the CA's substitution of its own judgment for the arbitral award cannot be more compelling than the overriding public policy to uphold the autonomy of arbitral awards. Courts are precluded from disturbing an arbitral tribunal's factual findings and interpretations of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> The CA's ruling is an unjustified judicial intrusion in excess of its jurisdiction - a judicial overreach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br><br>Upholding the CA's ruling would weaken our alternative dispute resolution mechanisms by allowing the courts to "throw their weight around" whenever they disagree with the results.

Regardless of the amount, of the sum involved in a case, a simple error of law remains a simple error of law.

World Interactive Network Systems (WINS) Japan Co. Ltd</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In the <i>ABS-CBN</i> case, the Court classified a voluntary arbitrator as a quasi¬≠judicial instrumentality;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> as such "decisions handed down by voluntary arbitrators fall under the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the [Court of Appeals] xxx [under] Rule 43 xxx."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The Court held therein that "the proper remedy from the adverse decision of a voluntary arbitrator if errors of fact and/or law are raised, is a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In the same <i>ABS-CBN</i> casethe Court further declared that the remedy of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> may also be availed in assailing the decision of a voluntary arbitrator, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>As may be gleaned from the above stated provision, it is well within the power and jurisdiction of the Court to inquire whether any instrumentality of the Government, such as a voluntary arbitrator, has gravely abused its discretion in the exercise of its functions and prerogatives. Any agreement stipulating that 'the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and unappealable' and that no further judicial recourse if either party disagrees with the whole or any part of the arbitrator's award may be availed of cannot be held to preclude in proper cases the power of judicial review which is inherent in courts. We will not hesitate to review a voluntary arbitrator's award where there is a showing of grave abuse of authority or discretion and such is properly raised in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy remedy in the course of law.<br><br>Significantly, <i>Insular Savings Bank v.

The <i>ABS-CBN</i> case came out in 2008, or after Republic Act No. 9285 (or the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004; RA 9285) was enacted on April 2, 2004. The <i>ABS-CBN</i> merely interpreted the law, and added to it principles already known, accepted and deemed read into or included in every law passed - it cannot be obsolete or wrong jurisprudence. The pronouncement in the <i>ABS¬≠-CBN</i> case cannot be <i>obiter dicta</i>. The Majority Opinion's view that arbitral awards of "commercial arbitrators" in "commercial arbitrations" are beyond judicial review effectively places these individuals, who are no better than "voluntary arbitrators authorized by law" in a position which is beyond scrutiny by this Court.<br><br>Ialso take the position that the Court did not commit the fallacy of equivocation in the <i>ABS-CBN</i> case. Rule 43 covers decisions of a voluntary arbitrator "<b><u>authorized by Law</u></b>". Under Article 2042 of the Civil Code, arbitration is allowed as a mode of settling controversies, and for this purpose, "[t]he same persons who may enter into a compromise may submit their controversies to one or more arbitrators for decision." Applied well, basic logic should enable one to reach the conclusion that any arbitrator/s appointed by parties by mutual agreement or contract to settle their differences would have to be a voluntary arbitrator "authorized by law" - that is, Article 2042 of the Civil Code. This simple legal tenet should dispel any notion that "commercial arbitration is a <i>purely private system</i> of adjudication facilitated by <i>private citizens</i> instead of government instrumentalities wielding quasi-judicial powers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>A profound examination of RA 9285 which came into effect in 2004, the <i>ABS-CBN</i> case which was promulgated in 2008, and the Special ADR Rules (Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which was issued in 2009, would reveal that there is no conflict. In particular, the Special ADR Rules cannot be said to have superseded the pronouncement in the <i>ABS-CBN</i> case; quite the contrary, the latter merely echo the conclusions arrived at in the former. In fact, the Special ADR Rules tends to support my position on the availability of the remedies of a petition for review and a petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>In particular, Part VI, Rule 19 of the Special ADR Rules, on Motion for Reconsideration Appeal and <i>Certiorari</i>, provides:<br><blockquote>Rule 19.8. <i>Subject matter and governing rules</i>. - The remedy of an appeal through a petition for review or the remedy of special civil action of certiorari from a decision of the Regional Trial Court made under the Special ADR Rules shall be allowed in the instances, and instituted only in the manner, provided under this Rule.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>Rule 19.12. <i>Appeal to the Court of Appeals</i>. - An appeal to the Court of Appeals through a petition for review under this Special Rule shall only be allowed from the following final orders of the Regional Trial Court:<br><br>xxxx<br><br>e. Confirming, vacating or correcting/modifying a domestic arbitral award;<br><br>xxxx<br><br>Rule 19.26. <i>Certiorari to the Court of Appeals</i>. - When the Regional Trial Court, in making a ruling Wider the Special ADR Rules, has acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, and there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a party may file a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> to annul or set aside a ruling of the Regional Trial Court.<br><br>A special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> may be filed against the following orders of the court.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>f. Confirming, vacating or correcting a domestic arbitral award;<br><br>xxxx<br><br>E. APPEAL BY CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT<br><br>Rule 19.36. <i>Review discretionary</i>. - A review by the Supreme Court is not a matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion, which will be granted only for serious and compelling reasons resulting in grave prejudice to the aggrieved party. The following, while neither controlling nor fully measuring the court's discretion, indicate the serious and compelling, and necessarily, restrictive nature of the grounds that will warrant the exercise of the Supreme Court's discretionary powers, when the Court of Appeals:<br><br>a. Failed to apply the applicable standard or test for judicial review prescribed in these Special ADR Rules in arriving at its decision resulting in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party;<br><br>b. Erred in upholding a final order or decision despite the lack of jurisdiction of the court that rendered such final order or decision;<br><br>c. Failed to apply any provision, principle, policy or rule contained in these Special ADR Rules resulting in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party; and<br><br>d. Committed an error so egregious and harmful to a party as to amount to an undeniable excess of jurisdiction.</blockquote>Finally, I am aware that an arbitral award can be assailed based on limited grounds,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> among which is when "the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> This is exactly what happened in this case and this was the ground upon which the vacation of the arbitral award should be anchored on. The Arbitral Tribunal's imperfect execution of powers and "excessive exercise of arbitral power" are valid grounds for vacating the arbitral award.<br><br>At this juncture, it might help to stress that the arbitral award is patently null and void. It failed to distinguish the land which is the object of the lease from the improvements thereon which are owned by the lessee, Technology Electronics Assembly and Management Pacific Corporation (TEAM). The lease contract expressly stated that the buildings and structures on the land were built and owned by the lessee. Fruehauf Electronics Philippines, Corporation's (Fruehauf) President even made an admission that there was no specific provision in the lease contract requiring the lessee to return the structures in their original state, <i>i.e.</i>, as a complete, rentable and fully facilitized electronics plant. The only condition stated in the lease contract was that title to said improvements shall <i>ipso facto</i> transfer to the lessor upon expiration of the lease. There was also no basis in ordering TEAM to pay rent for the period July 9, 2003 to March 5, 2005. Capitol Publishing House, Inc.'s (Capitol) sublease with TEAM expired on May 31, 2003; TEAM properly advised Fruehauf of such termination. Thereafter, Fruehauf negotiated directly with Capitol. When their negotiations bogged down, Fruehauf posted armed guards in the premises; it effectively took control over the facility. Fruehauf also filed an ejectment suit against Capitol, without impleading TEAM. The CA eventually dismissed the ejectment suit; said CA Decision became final and executory. Meanwhile, the Arbitral Tribunal ordered TEAM to pay rent based on the Metropolitan Trial Court's (MeTC) pronouncement in the ejectment case between Capitol and Fruehauf. TEAM was never a party to the case; the MeTC/Regional Trial Court Decision was even reversed by the CA on appeal. More important, the Arbitrators did not properly determine the amount since they were not sure whether Fruehauf already collected from Capitol, for how much, and whether Fruehauf returned said collections to Capitol. In the end, the amount to be paid was ambiguous. Based on the foregoing, the arbitral award clearly has no basis in law, contract, fact, experience, and logic/common sense. It is unjust, and it unduly deprives the respondent of its property without due process of law. It enables unjust enrichment of petitioner at respondent's expense. Plainly, all the foregoing shows that "the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them", a valid ground for vacating the arbitral award.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>DENY</b> the Petition and <b>AFFIRM</b> the October 25, 2012 Amended Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
