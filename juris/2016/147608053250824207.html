No. 7659, and Frustrated Murder as defined in Article 248 in relation to Article 50 of the RPC, respectively.<br><br>Together with two others, appellant was charged with Murder with the use of Unlicensed Firearm and Frustrated Murder in the following Informations:<br><br><center>Criminal Case No. CC-2007-1650</center><blockquote>That on or about the 2nd day of February 2007, at about 11:00 o'clock in the evening more or less, at Brgy.

In this case, appellant only questioned the legality of his arrest for the first time on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, even granting that indeed there has been an irregularity in the arrest of the appellant, it is deemed cured by his voluntary submission to the jurisdiction of the trial court over his person.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Thus, appellant is deemed to have waived his constitutional protection against illegal arrest<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> when he actively participated in the arraignment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and trial of this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><b><i>Elements of Murder and Frustrated<br>Murder were established</i></b><br><br>This Court finds that the circumstance of treachery should be appreciated, qualifying the crime to Murder. According to the Revised Penal Code:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 248. <i>Murder.</i> - Any person who, not falling within the provisions of Article 246 shall kill another, shall be guilty of murder and shall be punished by reclusion temporal in its maximum period to death, if committed with any of the following attendant circumstances:<br><ol type="1"><li> With treachery, taking advantage of superior strength, with the aid of armed men, or employing means to weaken the defense or of means or persons to insure or afford impunity.<br><br></li><li> In consideration of a price, reward or promise.<br><br></li><li> By means of inundation, fire, poison, explosion, shipwreck, stranding of a vessel, derailment or assault upon a street car or locomotive, fall of an airship, by means of motor vehicles, or with the use of any other means involving great waste and ruin.<br><br></li><li> On occasion of any of the calamities enumerated in the preceding paragraph, or of an earthquake, eruption of a volcano, destructive cyclone, epidemic, or any other public calamity.<br><br></li><li> With evident premeditation.<br><br></li><li> With cruelty, by deliberately and inhumanly augmenting the suffering of the victim, or outraging or scoffing at his person or corpse.</li></ol></blockquote>Thus, the elements of murder are: (1) that a person was killed; (2) that the accused killed him or her; (3) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the RPC; and (4) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, there is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof, which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The requisites of treachery are:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">(1) </td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">The employment of means method, or manner of execution which will ensure the safety of the malefactor from defensive or retaliating acts on the part of the victim, no opportunity being given to the latter to defend himself or to retaliate; and</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">(2) </td><td><div align="justify">Deliberate or conscious adoption of such means, method, or manner of execution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In this case, the hapless victims were merely drinking and singing in-front of the <i>videoke</i> machine when shot by the appellant. The firing was so sudden and swift that they had no opportunity to defend themselves or to retaliate. Furthermore, appellant's acts of using a gun and even going out of the <i>videoke</i> bar evidently show that he consciously adopted means to ensure the execution of the crime.<br><br>In addition, the lower courts appropriately found appellant liable for the crime of Frustrated Murder.<br><br>A felony is frustrated when the offender performs all the acts of execution which would produce the felony as a consequence but which, nevertheless, do not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of the perpetrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Dr. Angel Cordero M.D. categorically said that De Luna could have died because of the wounds if the surgery was not conducted timely.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Hence, appellant performed all the acts of execution which could have produced the crime of murder as a consequence, but nevertheless, did not produce it by reason of a cause independent of his will, which is, in this case, the timely and able medical attendance rendered to De Luna.<br><br><b><i>The defense of denial cannot be given<br>more weight over a witness'positive<br>identification</i></b><br><br>Appellant denies the accusations on the ground that he has no motive to kill Elizan and injure De Luna. This alibi is bereft of merit. Intent is not synonymous with motive. Motive alone is not a proof and is hardly ever an essential element of a crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> As a general rule, proof of motive for the commission of the offense charged does not show guilt and absence of proof of such motive does not establish the innocence of accused for the crime charged such as murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In <i>Kummer v. Peopled</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> this Court held that motive is irrelevant when the accused has been positively identified by an eyewitness.<br><br>Evidently, accused-appellant's intent to kill was established beyond reasonable doubt. This can be seen from his act of shooting Elizan and De Luna from behind with a firearm while they were innocently singing and drinking. Intent to kill was also manifest considering the number of gun shot wounds sustained by the victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, Pasana and De Luna positively identified accused-appellant as the person who fired shots during the incident:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><u>Pasana's testimony:</u></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">&nbsp;</td><td width="95%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>Can you recall who among the five (5) went out? </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>Yes, Ma'am.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>Of the two (2) among the five (5) who went out, are these two (2) people or persons here in court right now? </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>Yes, Ma'am.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>And who are these two (2) persons you are referring to, can you point it out to the Honorable Court if they are here in [c]ourt right now?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>That person, Ma'am.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">Interpreter: Witness, Your Honor, is pointing to a person who earlier identified himself as Luisito Gaborne.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">x x x x</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>Point specifically, who among those persons? </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>That person, Ma'am.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">Interpreter: Witness, Your Honor, is pointing to a person who identified himself earlier as Luisito Gaborne.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top"><p><u>De Luna's Testimony:</u></p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>How about the appearance of the guy whom you said holding a gun, can you recall? </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A:</td><td> I can recall him if he is inside the court, ma'am.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>Can you point it out to the court, the other guy whom you saw at the videoke bar? </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td>Yes, ma'am, if I can go with him in a short distance, I can point him.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>Can you point him?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A: </td><td><p>(The witness stood up and approach (sic) the accused' bench and pointed to a person and when asked his name answered to (sic): Luisito Gaborne)</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q: </td><td>You said that there was also another guy by the window?

From its vantage point, the trial court is in the best position to determine the truthfulness of witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>It is doctrinally entrenched in our jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> that the defense of denial is inherently weak because it can easily be fabricated. Such defense becomes unworthy of merit if it is established only by the accused themselves and not by credible persons. Thus, this Court agrees with the lower courts in giving the positive identification of the eyewitnesses more weight than appellant's defense of denial.<br><br><b><i>Paraffin Tests are not conclusive</i></b><br><br>The positive identification made by the prosecution witnesses bears more weight than the negative paraffin test result conducted the day after the incident.<br><br>Paraffin tests, in general-, have been rendered inconclusive by this Court. Scientific experts concur in the view that the paraffin test was extremely unreliable for use. It can only establish the presence or absence of nitrates or nitrites on the hand; however, the test alone cannot determine whether the source of the nitrates or nitrites was the discharge of a firearm; The presence of nitrates should be taken only as an indication of a possibility or even of a probability but not of infallibility that a person has fired a gun, since nitrates are also admittedly found in substances other than gunpowder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In this case, prosecution witness, Pasana<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and the victim himself, De Luna,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> testified in the trial court that it was indeed the appellant who was holding the gun during the incident. It should also be considered that appellant was arrested the day after the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Thus, it is possible for appellant to fire a gun and yet bear no traces of nitrate or gunpowder as when the hands are bathed in perspiration or washed afterwards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br><b><i>Corpus delicti of the crime can be<br>established by testimony</i></b><br><br>With regard to the appreciation of the aggravating circumstance of the use of an unlicensed firearm, we agree with the trial court and the appellate court that the same must be appreciated in the instant case. In <i>People v. Lualhati,</i> this Court ruled that in crimes involving unlicensed firearm, the prosecution has the burden of proving the elements thereof, which are: (1) the existence of the subject firearm and (2) the fact that the accused who owned or possessed the firearm does not have the corresponding license or permit to possess the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Appellant's contention that the <i>corpus delicti</i> was not established for the reason that the firearm used was not presented as evidence is not persuasive. In <i>People v. Orehuela,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> this Court held that the existence of the firearm can be established by testimony, even without the presentation of the said firearm. In the present case, the testimonies of Pasana and De Luna indubitably demonstrated the existence of the firearms. Furthermore, the certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> from the Philippine National Police that appellant is not a firearm license holder of any caliber proves that he is not licensed to possess the same. Thus, the prosecution was able to prove the existence of the firearm and that the appellant is not licensed to possess the same notwithstanding the fact that the firearm used was not presented as evidence.<br><br><b><i>Illegal Possession of Firearm as an<br>aggravating circumstance<br>in the crimes of Murder and<br>Frustrated Murder</i></b><br><br>The CA appropriately appreciated the use of an unlicensed firearm as an aggravating circumstance in the crimes of Murder and Frustrated Murder. Under R.A. No. 1059, use of loose firearm in the commission of a crime, like murder, shall be considered as an aggravating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In view of the amendments introduced by R.A. No. 8294 and R.A. No. 10591, to Presidential Decree No. 1866, separate prosecutions for homicide and illegal possession are no longer in order. Instead, illegal possession of firearm is merely to be taken as an aggravating circumstance in the crime of murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> It is clear from the foregoing that where murder results from the use of an unlicensed firearm, the crime is not qualified illegal possession but, murder. In such a case, the use of the unlicensed firearm is not considered as a separate crime but shall be appreciated as a mere aggravating circumstance. Thus, where murder was committed, the penalty for illegal possession of firearms is no longer imposable since it becomes merely a special aggravating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The intent of Congress is to treat the offense of illegal possession of firearm and the commission of homicide or murder with the use of unlicensed firearm as a single offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>In the case at hand, since it was proven that accused-appellant was not a licensed firearm holder,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> and that he was positively identified by the witnesses as the one who fired shots against the victims, the use of an unlicensed firearm in the commission of the crimes of Murder and Frustrated Murder should be considered as an aggravating circumstance thereof.<br><br>The presence of such aggravating circumstance would have merited<br><br>the imposition of the death penalty for the crime of Murder. However, in view of R.A. No. 9346, we are mandated to impose on appellant the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole.<br><br><b><i>Damages and civil liability</i></b><br><br>This Court resolves to modify the damages awarded by the appellate court in line with the recent jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> Appellant shall pay the Heirs of Sixto Elizan y Herrera P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and PI00,000.00 as exemplary damages for the crime of Murder with the use of Unlicensed Firearm.<br><br>Appellant shall also be liable to pay P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages, and P75,000.00 as exemplary damages for the crime of Frustrated Murder.
