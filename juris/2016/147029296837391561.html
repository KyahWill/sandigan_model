				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Upon execution, this Court's decision cannot be amended by the trial court or the sheriff. Absent an order of remand, we cannot allow attempts to substantially or materially alter the terms of our final and executory judgment.<br><br>This resolves the consolidated Petitions for Review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The Petitions are an offshoot of the Court of Appeals Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 102750.<br><br>On April 24, 1959, Republic Real Estate Corporation (RREC) entered into an agreement with Pasay City for the reclamation of the foreshore lands along Manila Bay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The agreement was made on the strength of Pasay City Council Ordinance No. 121, as amended by Ordinance No. 158, which authorized RREC to reclaim 300 hectares of foreshore lands in the city.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On December 19, 1961, the Republic of the Philippines (Republic) sued for recovery of possession and damages with writ of preliminary injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The Republic questioned the agreement on three (3) grounds. First, the subject of the contract is outside the commerce of man<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> as the reclaimed area is a national park that the Republic owns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Second, Pasay City Ordinance No. 121, as amended, in including the reclaimed area, went beyond<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Republic Act No. 1899,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> which allows municipalities and chartered cities to reclaim only "foreshore lands," not "submerged lands."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Lastly, the agreement was executed without approval from national government and without public bidding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>This case entitled <i>Republic v.

Not even any statement or itemization of works accomplished by contractors or subcontractors or vouchers and other relevant papers were introduced to describe the extent of RRECs accomplishment. Neither was the requisite certification from the City Engineer concerned that portions of the reclamation project not less than 50 hectares in area shall have been accomplished or completed obtained and presented by RREC.<br><br>As a matter of fact, no witness ever testified on any reclamation work done by RREC, and extent thereof, as of April 26, 1962. Not a single contractor, sub-contractor, engineer, surveyor, or any other witness involved in the alleged reclamation work of RREC testified on the 55 hectares supposedly reclaimed by RREC. What work was done, who did the work, where was it commenced, and when was it completed, was never brought to light by any witness before the court. Certainly, <i>onus probandi</i> was on RREC and Pasay City to show and point out the as yet unidentified 55 hectares they allegedly reclaimed. But this burden of proof RREC and Pasay City miserably failed to discharge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup><br></blockquote>Moreover, despite our final and executory judgment in <i>Republic v.

It was not a loan, a forbearance of money, or an obligation arising out of a valid contract.

Providing justice to RREC cannot justify perpetrating injustice against the Republic.<br><br>This Court's November 25, 1998 Decision must be respected. Pursuant to the doctrine of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>, our ruling in <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i> is the settled law of this case. In <i>Salud v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup><br><blockquote>The interest of the judicial system in preventing relitigation of the same dispute recognizes that judicial resources are finite and the number of cases that can be heard by the court is limited. Every dispute that is reheard means that another will be delayed. In modern times when court dockets are filled to overflowing, this concern is of critical importance. <i>Res judicata</i> thus conserves scarce judicial resources and promotes efficiency in the interest of the public at large.<br><br><i>Once a final judgment has been rendered, the prevailing party also has an interest in the stability of that judgment</i>. Parties come to the courts in order to resolve controversies; a judgment would be of little use in resolving disputes if the parties were free to ignore it and to litigate the same claims again and again. Although judicial determinations are not infallible, judicial error should be corrected through appeals procedures, not through repeated suits on the same claim. Further, <i>to allow relitigation creates the risk of inconsistent results and presents the embarrassing problem of determining which of two conflicting decisions is to be preferred</i>. Since there is no reason to suppose that the second or third determination of a claim necessarily is more accurate than the first, the first <i>should be left undisturbed</i>.<br><br>In some cases, the public at large also has an interest in seeing that rights and liabilities once established remain fixed. If a court quiets title to land, for example, everyone should be able to rely on the finality of that determination. Otherwise, many business transactions would be clouded by uncertainty. Thus, the most important purpose of <i>res judicata</i> is to provide repose for both the party litigants and the public.

Camerino, et al.</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup><br><blockquote>A champertous contract is defined as a contract between a stranger and a party to a lawsuit, whereby the stranger pursues the party's claim in consideration of receiving part or any of the proceeds recovered under the judgment; a bargain by a stranger with a party to a suit, by which such third person undertakes to carry on the litigation at his own cost and risk, in consideration of receiving, if successful, a part of the proceeds or subject sought to be recovered. An Agreement whereby the attorney agrees to pay expenses of proceedings to enforce the client's rights is champertous. Such agreements are against public policy especially where as in this case, the attorney has agreed to carry on the action at its own expense in consideration of some bargain to have part of the thing in dispute. The execution of these contracts violates the fiduciary relationship between the lawyer and his client, for which the former must incur administrative sanction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup><br></blockquote>As officers of the court, lawyers should not exploit nor take advantage of their client's weaknesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[219]</sup> Rule 16.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility prohibits a lawyer from "lend[ing] money to a client except, when in the interest of justice, he [or she] has to advance necessary expenses in a legal matter he [or she] is handling for the client." <i>Bautista v. Gonzales</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[220]</sup> has settled that "[a]though a lawyer may, in good faith, advance the expenses of litigation, the same should be subject to reimbursement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup><br><br>Thus, absent a reimbursement agreement, the champertous contract is void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[222]</sup> Lawyers who obtain an interest in the subject-matter of litigation create a conflict-of-interest situation with their clients and thereby directly violate the fiduciary duties they owe their clients.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup> Thus:<br><blockquote>To permit these arrangements is to enable the lawyer to acquire additional stake in the outcome of the action which might lead him to consider his own recovery rather than that of his client or to accept a settlement which might take care of his interest in the verdict to the sacrifice of that of his client in violation of his duty of undivided fidelity to his client's cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>This is precisely what happened here. In his desire to win the reclamation case and take his slice of the pie from the judgment award, Atty. Roxas resorted to prosecuting cases against the Court of Appeals Justices<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup> without RREC's knowledge and authority and against his client's interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup><br><br>Moreover, despite Siguion Reyna's Entry of Appearance dated November 4, 2009 with RREC's conformity, RGR &amp; Associates refused to accept its discharge as counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[227]</sup><br><br>Atty. Roxas is fully aware that RREC's Board of Directors already voted to terminate RGR &amp; Associates' legal services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[228]</sup> The termination of RGR &amp; Associates' services is not subject to this Court's review. A lawyer may be dismissed at any time, with or without cause. In <i>Lim Jr. v. Villarosa</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[229]</sup><br><blockquote>[A client] may discharge his attorney <i>at any time with or without cause</i> and thereafter employ another lawyer who may then enter his appearance. Thus, it has been held that a client is free to change his counsel in a pending case and thereafter retain another lawyer to represent him. That manner of changing a lawyer does not need the consent of the lawyer to be dismissed. Nor does it require approval of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[230]</sup> (Citation omitted, Emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote>An experienced lawyer such as Atty. Roxas is expected know that a counsel's services can be withdrawn at any time.<br><br>There is no such thing as an irrevocable attorney-client relationship. As stated in <i>Busiños v. Ricafort</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[231]</sup> "the relation between an attorney and his client is highly fiduciary in its nature and of a very delicate, exacting and confidential character, requiring high degree of fidelity and good faith."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[232]</sup> Thus, when the client itself no longer wants its attorney's services, the counsel cannot continue to desperately cling on to it.<br><br>What makes RGR &amp; Associates' discharge as counsel even more allowable is that RREC terminated its services for a cause. In RREC's Board Resolution, the dismissal of RGR &amp; Associates' engagement was due to its "breach of trust and confidence and clear abuse of Attorney-Client relationship[.]" Atty. Roxas' act of suing the Court of Appeals Justices without RREC's prior notice and board approval<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[233]</sup> betrayed his client's trust and confidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[234]</sup><br><br>Canon 17 of the Code of Professional Responsibility states that "[a] lawyer owes fidelity to the cause of [one's] client and he [or she] shall always be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in him [or her]."<br><br>In <i>Testate Estate of the Deceased Tan Chiong Pun v. Tan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[235]</sup> this Court has ruled that it is unjust to require a lawyer, whose services have been terminated, to continue serving as counsel after losing his or her client's confidence. RREC's decision to remove Atty. Roxas as its counsel is clearly beyond this Court's power of review.<br><br>Moreover, Atty. Roxas has no legal standing to appeal the case on RREC's behalf. Rule 3 of the Rules of Court provides the following as parties to a civil suit:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 3 <br>PARTIES TO CIVIL ACTIONS<br></center><br>SECTION 1. <i>Who may be parties; plaintiff and defendant</i>. — Only natural or juridical persons, or entities authorized by law may be parties in a civil action. The term "plaintiff may refer to the claiming party, the counter-claimant, the cross-claimant, or the third (fourth, etc.)—party plaintiff. The term "defendant" may refer to the original defending party, the defendant in a counterclaim, the cross-defendant, or the third (fourth, etc.)—party defendant.<br><br>SEC. 2. <i>Parties in interest</i>. — A real party in interest is the party who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit. Unless otherwise authorized by law or these Rules, every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party in interest.<br><br>SEC. 3. <i>Representatives as parties</i>. — Where the action is allowed to be prosecuted and defended by a representative or someone acting in a fiduciary capacity, the beneficiary shall be included in the title of the case and shall be deemed to be the real party in interest. A representative may be a trustee of an express trust, a guardian, an executor or administrator, or a party authorized by law or these Rules. An agent acting in his own name and for the benefit of an undisclosed principal may sue or be sued without joining the principal except when the contract involves things belonging to the principal. (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Atty. Roxas is not a party litigant under Section 1. Only RREC, as the party seeking for the execution of judgment, and the Republic, as the party opposing RREC's claims, stand to be benefited or injured by the pending case. Atty. Roxas is not a party-in-interest under Section 2. He has no valid interest in this case as his contingency-fee agreement with RREC is champertous and, therefore, void. Likewise, Atty. Roxas is not a party representative under Section 3 as he is no longer RREC's lawyer.<br><br>Thus, insofar as RREC and the Republic are concerned, Atty. Roxas is a complete stranger to this case.<br><br>Rule 45, Section 1<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[236]</sup> of the Rules of Court provides that appeals by certiorari before this Court may be had only by the party to the case. Atty. Roxas is neither a party nor a counsel for any of the parties here. He cannot claim legal fees by filing a petition for review on behalf of a non-client, which has moved to dismiss/expunge his petition pro hac vice.<br><br>The action he pursued before this Court is not an available recourse under applicable laws or the Rules of Court.
