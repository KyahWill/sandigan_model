				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">These are consolidated petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> assailing the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated January 31, 2005 and the Amended Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated July 21, 2006 of the Court of Appeals (CA) which denied the appeals of both parties and affirmed with modification the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated May 25, 1999 of Branch 67 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City. The assailed Amended Decision upheld the redemption made by the late Jose Ma. Gepuela of the 36/72 <i>pro indiviso</i> share of the late Basilia Austria Vda. de Cruz over the property covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 95524, except for the two and a half percent (2.5%) share of Hernita Meñez-Andres and her co-heirs.<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></center><br>The controversy arose from the redemption made by the late Jose Ma. Gepuela (Gepuela), petitioner in G.R. No. 173636, and transferee of an aliquot portion of the property covered by TCT No. 95524, of the 36/72 <i>pro indiviso</i> share of Basilia Austria Vda. de Cruz (Basilia). Hernita Meñez-Andres and Nelia Meñez-Cayetano (Hernita, et al.), petitioners in G.R. No. 173770, assailed the redemption on the ground that Gepuela had no legal personality to make the redemption.<br><br>Basilia was the widow of Pedro Cruz, with whom she had five children, namely, Perfecto, Alberto, Luz, Benita and Isagani. Basilia executed a <i>Huling Habilin</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> where she named her daughter Benita's children Hernita, Nelia, Rosemarie, Angel and Gracita as voluntary heirs to ten percent (10%) of the free portion of her estate. Basilia's <i>Huling Habilin</i> was admitted into ante-mortem probate on March 1, 1957.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Her daughter Luz Cruz Salonga (Luz) was appointed Administratrix of Basilia's estate on August 18, 1976.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>When Basilia died, she left behind considerable properties, including a 36/72 <i>pro indiviso</i> share in a 5,492 square meter property in San Juan, then province of Rizal. This property was covered by TCT No. 95524 and co-owned with some of Basilia's children and grandchildren, as follows:<br><blockquote>Basilia Austria Vda. de Cruz, widow—36/72; Perfecto Cruz, married to Flavia Jorge—12/72; Luz Cruz, married to Feliciano Salonga—12/72; Isagani Cruz, married to Milagros Villareal—4/72; Flavia Jorge, married to Perfecto Cruz-2/72; Pedrito Cruz, single-2/72; Perfecto Cruz, Jr., single—2/72; Vito Cruz, 20 years of age, single—2/72.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>Perfecto and Flavia sold their interests (14/72 <i>pro indiviso</i> share) in the property to Severino Etorma (Etorma), who later on sold the same to Gepuela and one Antonio Cinco (Cinco). These transactions were annotated on TCT No. 95524 as Entry Nos. 12640 and 73035, dated November 13, 1964 and November 18, 1971, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> In 1978, Cinco sold his share to Gepuela.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> This was likewise annotated in the title as Entry No. 3904 dated May 20, 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Luz also disposed, by way of a Sale of Rights with Mortgage, her 12/72 <i>pro indiviso</i> share in the property to Gepuela in another transaction registered as Entry No. 8536 dated May 8, 1989 on TCT No. 95524.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On July 29, 1986, Basilia's 36/72 <i>pro indiviso</i> share was sold in a public auction to satisfy the judgment in Civil Case No. 32824, entitled "<i>Benita Me[ñ]ez v. Luz Cruz Salonga as Administratrix of the Estate of Basilia Austria Vda. [d]e Cruz</i>." Benita, as judgment creditor in the case, emerged as the highest bidder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On May 14, 1987, Gepuela redeemed Basilia's 36/72 <i>pro indiviso</i> share from Benita by paying the auction price of Four Hundred Seventy-Four Thousand Nine Hundred Seventy-Seven Pesos (P474,977.00), inclusive of interest and other legal fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> This was inscribed on the title as Entry No. 022 dated May 14, 1987. Accordingly, Basilia's estate, through Administratrix Luz, executed a Deed of Sale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and Waiver of Redemption<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> over the share, subject to the following conditions: 1) Gepuela should obtain court approval of the sale; and 2) Gepuela should inform all heirs of the sale formally in writing.<br><br>After the expiration of the periods to redeem, Gepuela filed an action to consolidate his ownership over the 36/72 <i>pro indiviso</i> share he acquired by way of redemption from Basilia's estate. This was docketed as <b>LRC Case No. R-3855</b> and assigned to Branch 166 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig. The other registered co-owners Isagani, Perfecto, Jr., Pedrito, and Vito (Isagani, et al.) opposed this action, raising Gepuela's lack of standing to redeem given that he is not a co-owner of Basilia's one-half portion. In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated December 6, 1989, the trial court granted Gepuela's petition, declared him the owner of Basilia's 36/72 <i>pro indiviso</i> share in the parcel of land covered by TCT No. 95524 and ordered the issuance of a new certificate of title to reflect this change in ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, oppositors Isagani, Perfecto, Jr., Pedrito, Vito and Alberto appealed the trial court's Decision to the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 25605. In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated January 31, 1992, the CA, however, affirmed the trial court's findings. <b>The CA's Decision in CA GR. CV No. 25605 was not appealed and became final and executory on February 26, 1992.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> TCT No. 5033-R was issued that same year, reflecting Gepuela's ownership of the 36/72 <i>pro indiviso</i> share previously owned by Basilia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The proceedings covering Basilia's estate were, per motion of her heirs, ordered closed on February 15, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> The record also shows that Gepuela filed a case, docketed as <b>SCA No. 302</b> with Branch 159 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig, for the partition of the property covered by TCT No. 5033-R.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The lower court rendered a decision ordering the partition of the property. TCT No. 5033-R was cancelled and several titles were issued covering the respective shares of Gepuela, Isagani, Perfecto and Pedrito, and Vito Cruz in the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, or on October 10, 1995, Basilia's grandchildren Hernita and Nelia filed a Complaint for Redemption and Consignation with Damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and a subsequent Amended Complaint for Declaration of Nullity of Redemption, Cancellation of Notation in Title, and Consignation with Damages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> against Gepuela. This was docketed as <b>Civil Case No. 65327</b> and raffled to Branch 67 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City.<br><br>In their complaint, Hernita and Nelia alleged, among others, that: 1) Gepuela's redemption was null and void as he not being an heir, legatee/devisee, co-owner or creditor) did not have the legal personality to redeem the share;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and 2) Hernita and Nelia sent notices to Gepuela informing him of their intent to recover their interest in Basilia's 36/72 <i>pro indiviso</i> share and to tender payment of the redemption price paid by him, plus interest, which Gepuela refused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In his Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated December 28, 1995, Gepuela denied Hernita and Nelia's allegations and alleged that his redemption had already been adjudicated by the trial court in LRC Case No. R-3855. This ruling has, in turn, been affirmed by the Seventh Division of the CA in CA G.R. CV No. 25605. No further appeal having been made, Gepuela asserts that the CA's Decision became final and executory on February 26, 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</u></b><br></center><br>In its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated May 25, 1999, the trial court upheld Gepuela's redemption of Basilia's 36/72 <i>pro indiviso</i> share. It, however, ruled that because Gepuela failed to formally notify Hernita, Nelia and Rosemarie of the redemption, the same was null and void insofar as it affected the latter's six percent (6%) share in the property. The dispositive portion of the trial court's Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the Court hereby renders judgment in favor of plaintiffs HERNITA ME[Ñ]EZ ANDRES, NELIA ME[Ñ]EZ CAYETANO, ROSEMARIE ME[Ñ]EZ PRONSTROLLER, all represented herein by their duly-appointed Attorney-in-fact, ANGELINO ME[Ñ]EZ and against defendant JOSE MA.

CV No. 25605.</b> Since the Decision in said case had already become final and executory per entry of judgment dated February 26, 1992, the CA declared that Hernita, et al. are barred from assailing it again under the principle of <i><i>res judicata</i></i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Despite this, the CA still proceeded to resolve the case on the merits. Rejecting Hernita, et al.'s claim that Gepuela had no personality to redeem Basilia's 36/72 <i>pro indiviso</i> share, the appellate court held that Gepuela was not a stranger to, but rather a co-owner of, the entire communal property "x x x because the two estates are not separate and distinct properties but actually constitute one and the same property owned in community and covered by the same TCI No. 95524."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Since redemption inures to the benefit of the other co-owners, the CA affirmed the trial court's decision insofar as it nullified the redemption <i>in proportion to Hernita, et al.'s respective shares</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The CA thereafter recomputed the corresponding shares as follows: Hernita, Nelia, and Rosemarie, with their siblings Angel and Granito, are instituted heirs entitled to ten percent (10%) of the free portion of Basilia's estate, equivalent to two and a half percent (2.5%) share in the property. They are likewise entitled to the five percent (5%) share corresponding to the legitime of their deceased mother Benita, to which they are entitled to, by right of representation, as the latter's heirs. The dispositive portion of the CA's Decision dated January 31, 2005 thus reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, both appeals of plaintiffs-appellants and defendant-appellant are dismissed and the trial court's Decision dated May 25, 1999 is affirmed, with certain modification. The award of attorney's fees is deleted and paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the dispositive portion thereof are modified to read as follows:<br><blockquote>"1. [T]he redemption made by defendant GEPUELA of the 36/72 portion of the Estate of Basilia Austria Vda. [d]e Cruz as covered previously by TCT No. 95524 and at present by TCT No. 5033-R is MULE AND VOID only insofar as to the shares of plaintiffs (and their siblings <u>Angel and Gracito Me[ñ]ez</u>) which correspond[] to 7.5% thereof;<br><br>2.

Gepuela.<br></blockquote>The trial court's Decision is affirmed in all other respects.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>Both parties filed their respective motions for reconsideration.<br><br>In denying these motions, the CA held that: (1) under the principle of <i>res judicata</i>, Hernita, et al. are barred from assailing the redemption made by Gepuela, the validity of which had long been settled in LRC Case No. R-3855 and CA GR. CV No. 25605;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (2) the nullification of the redemption over Hernita, et al.'s proportionate share does not serve to disturb the final ruling in LRC Case No. R-3855 and CA G.R. CV No. 25605 because Hernita, et al.'s rights as co-owners were not resolved in said cases;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (3) the one year period provided under the Rules of Court to redeem applies to redemption of properties sold on execution whereas Hernita, et al.'s right to recover their share is premised on the fact that they are co-owners of the subject property;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (4) the lapse of about nine years from the auction sale cannot be equated with laches because of the equitable considerations that Hernita, et al. were neither shown to have been notified of the auction sale in 1986, nor impleaded as parties in the petition for consolidation subsequently filed by defendant Gepuela;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (5) the imposition of 12% interest per annum from finality of Decision until fully paid is consistent with the guidelines laid down in <i>Eastern Shipping Lines</i> case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The CA, however, modified its ruling with respect to the computation of Hernita, et al.'s shares in Basilia's estate. According to the CA, since both parties attested to the fact that Benita Cruz was still alive, Hernita et al.'s right to inherit by representation has not accrued as yet.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Thus, they shall inherit from Basilia's estate only to the extent of their right as devisees or voluntary heirs as per the <i>Huling Habilin</i> executed by the deceased Basilia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> <br><br>The dispositive portion of the CA's Decision, <i>as amended</i>, now reads:<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the motions for reconsideration filed by both parties are denied.

Before these issues can be resolved, however, we must determine whether the issues raised herein are already barred under the principle of <i>res judicata</i>.<br><br><center><b><i>The Court's Ruling</i></b><br></center><br>We rule in favor of the heirs of Gepuela, petitioners in G.R. No. 173636.<br><br>Under the rule of <i>res judicata</i>, a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive as to the rights of the parties or their privies in all later suits, and on all points and matters determined in the former suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In the case of <i>Degayo v. Magbanua-Dinglasan</i>, we held that:<br><blockquote><i>Res judicata</i> literally means "a mailer adjudged; a thing judicially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment." It also refers to the rule that a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies in all later suits on points and matters determined in the former suit. It rests on the principle that parties should not to be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once; that, when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been given, the judgment of the court, so long as it remains unreversed, should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them in law or estate.<br><br>This judicially created doctrine exists as an obvious rule of reason, justice, fairness, expediency, practical necessity, and public tranquility. Moreover, public policy, judicial orderliness, economy of judicial time, and the interest of litigants, as well as the peace and order of society, all require that stability should be accorded judgments, that controversies once decided on their merits shall remain in repose, that inconsistent judicial decision shall not be made on the same set of fads, and that there be an end to litigation which, without the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>, would be endless. (Citations omitted.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br></blockquote>It is embodied in Section 47, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court which provides:<br><blockquote>SEC. 47. <i>Effect of judgments or final orders</i>. — The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:<br><br>(a) In case of a judgment or final order against a specific thing, or in respect to the probate of a will, or the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political, or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration, or the condition, status or relationship of the person; however, the probate of a will or granting of letters of administration shall only be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the death of the testator or intestate;<br><br>(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest, by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and<br><br>(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto.<br></blockquote>There are two distinct concepts of <i>res judicata</i>: (1) bar by former judgment and (2) conclusiveness of judgment:<br><blockquote>The first aspect is the effect of a judgment as a bar to the prosecution of a second action upon the same claim, demand or cause of action. In traditional terminology, this aspect is known as merger or bar; in modern terminology, it is called claim preclusion.<br><br>The second aspect precludes the relitigation of a particular fact of issue in another action between the same parties on a different claim or cause of action. This is traditionally known as collateral estoppel; in modern terminology, it is called issue preclusion.<br><br>Conclusiveness of judgment finds application when a fact or question has been squarely put in issue, judicially passed upon, and adudged in a former suit by a court of competent jurisdiction. The fact or question settled by final judgment or order binds the parties to that action (and persons in privily with them or their successors-in-interest), and continues to bind them while the judgment or order remains standing and unreversed by proper authority on a timely motion or petition; the conclusively settled fact or question furthermore cannot again be litigated in any future or other action between the same parties or their privies and successors-in-interest, in the same or in any other court of concurrent jurisdiction, either for the same or for a different cause of action. Thus, only the identities of <i>parties and issues</i> are required for the operation of the principle of conclusiveness of judgment.<br><br>While <i>conclusiveness of judgment</i> does not have the same barring effect as that of a <i>bar by former judgment</i> that proscribes subsequent actions, the former nonetheless estops the parties from raising in a later case the issues or points that were raised and controverted, and were determinative of the ruling in the earlier case. In other words, the dictum laid down in the earlier final judgment or order becomes conclusive and continues to be binding between the same parties, their privies and successors-in-interest, as long as the facts on which that judgment was predicated continue to be the facts of the case or incident before the court in a later case; the binding effect and enforceability of that earlier dictum can no longer be re-litigated in a later case since the issue has already been resolved and finally laid to rest in the earlier case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (Citations omitted; emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>The former concept of <i>res judicata</i>, that is, bar by prior judgment, applies in this case. The following requisites must concur in order that a prior judgment may bar a subsequent action, <i>viz</i>: (1) the former judgment or order must be final; (2) it must be a judgment or order on the merits, that is, it was rendered after a consideration of the evidence or stipulations submitted by the parties at the trial of the case; (3) it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; and (4) there must be, between the first and second actions, identity of parties, of subject matter and of cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>We find that all of the foregoing elements are present in this case.<br><br>There is no question that the Decision rendered in LRC Case No. R-3855 and affirmed by the CA in CA G.R.

In fact, the issues presented against Gepuela's redemption over the disputed portion had already been thoroughly ventilated in LRC Case No. R-3855. Thus, although ostensibly styled in different forms, the complaints in Civil Case No. 65327 and LRC Case No. R-3855 are really litigating for the same tiling and seeking the same relief, that is, to remove from Gepuela ownership over the disputed 36/72 portion.<br><br>In fact, Civil Case No. 65327 was filed specifically seeking to declare the nullity of Gepuela's redemption of the one-half share previously owned by Basilia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> This issue, however, has already been conclusively settled in LRC Case No. R-3855, where the trial court upheld Gepuela's redemption of the share and declared him absolute owner of the same.<br><br><i>Hernita, et al. are not indispensable parlies to LRC Case No. R-3855; their non-participation does not affect the validity of the decision rendered</i><br><br>Hernita, et al., in their comment to Gepuela's petition, argue that the doctrine oi <i>res judicata</i> "does not at all attach, because the judgment in LRC Case No. [R-3855] is not valid for lack of due process and in the absence of indispensable parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> As indispensable parties who were not made part of the proceedings, Hernita, et al. claim that they cannot be bound by the decision in LRC Case No. R-3855 or the appeal in CA-GR.

The claim all the more fails to persuade especially when one considers that the estate itself, through its Administratrix, and all the other <b>registered</b> co-owners of aliquot portions of the property (namely, Isagani, Perfecto Jr., Pedrito, Vito and Alberto Cruz) appear to have been properly notified of and, in fact, actively participated in, the proceedings in LRC Case No. R-3855.<br><br>We further note from Hernita, et al.'s comment that the decision in LRC Case No. R-3855 was subject of a petition for annulment of judgment (docketed as CA G.R.

The CA therefore erred when, after declaring that the Decision in LRC Case No. R-3855 had become final, executory and unappealable, it still modified the terms of the case and awarded Hernita, et al. with portions of the property allegedly corresponding to their shares as instituted heirs of Basilia's estate.<br><br><i>Hernita, et al. cannot claim a stake over a specific property of the decedent</i>.<br><br>Even assuming that <i>res judicata</i> would not bar Civil Case No. 65327, Hernita, et al.'s claim of a right to redeem Basilia's disputed share would still not prosper.<br><br><i>First</i>.
