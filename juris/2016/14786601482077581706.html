				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Disbarment proceedings based on falsification or forgery of public documents should not be the occasion to establish the falsification or forgery.

Fernandez of the IBP Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD) submitted his report and recommendation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> finding the respondent liable for gross misconduct in relation to the forged the affidavit of waiver/withdrawal, and recommended his two-year suspension from the practice of law. Commissioner Fernandez dismissed the charge of dishonesty in relation to the respondent's age because his birth certificate prevailed over the documents submitted by the complainants.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>On March 20, 2013, the IBP Board of Governors issued Resolution No. XX-2013-278<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> adopting the report and recommendation of Commissioner Fernandez, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>RESOLUTION NO. XX-2013-278<br>CBD Case No. 10-2684<br>Lily Salado, et al. vs.<br>Atty. Roman A. Villanueva, Jr.</b><br></center><br>RESOLVED to ADOPT and APPROVE, as it 1s hereby unanimously ADOPTED and APPROVED the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner in the above-entitled case, herein made part of this Resolution as Annex "A," and finding the recommendation fully supported by the evidence on record and the applicable laws and rules and considering that Respondent was guilty of gross misconduct when he falsified an Affidavit of Waiver/Withdrawal by reason of which TCT Nos. RT-8320 and 8381 in his name were issued, Atty. Roman A. Villanueva, Jr. is hereby <b>SUSPENDED from the practice of law for two (2) years.</b> However, the charge of falsifying his age to qualify as DOJ Prosecutor is hereby Dismissed for lack of merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Bold emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>The pat1ies respectively sought reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> On June 6, 2015, the IBP Board of Governors denied the respondent's motion for reconsideration but granted that of the complainants, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>RESOLUTION NO. XXI-2015-417<br>CBD Case No. 10-2684<br>Lily Salado, et al.<br>Atty. Roman A.

Thus, Resolution No. XX-2013-278, dated March 20, 2013, is hereby <b>AFFIRMED with modification</b>, increasing the penalty imposed on Atty. Roman A. Villanueva, Jr. to <b>Suspension from the practice of law for three (3) years</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Bold emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>Should the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for gross misconduct and gross dishonesty?<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>We reverse the findings and recommendation of the IBP Board of Governors considering that the charges were not competently substantiated.<br><br><center><b>I<br>Falsification must be proved in the <br>appropriate criminal or civil proceeding,<br> not in the disbarment proceeding<br></b></center><br>The complainants support their allegations of falsification by presenting the affidavit of waiver/withdrawal itself and its annotation on TCT No. 7919; and by denying their having signed the same. However, such proof was inadequate to establish that the respondent had been the author of the alleged falsification of the affidavit of waiver/withdrawal.<br><br>We emphasize that allegations of falsification or forgery must be competently proved because falsification or forgery cannot be presumed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> As such, the allegations should first be established and determined in appropriate proceedings,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> like in criminal or civil cases, for it is only by such proceedings that the last word on the falsity or forgery can be uttered by a court of law with the legal competence to do so. A disbarment proceeding is not the occasion to determine the issue of falsification or forgery simply because the sole issue to be addressed and determined therein is whether or not the respondent attorney is still fit to continue to be an officer of the court in the dispensation of justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Accordingly, we decline to rule herein whether or not the respondent had committed the supposed falsification of the affidavit of waiver/withdrawal in the absence of the prior determination thereof in the appropriate proceeding.<br><br>Moreover, the complainants have hereby challenged the due execution and authenticity of the affidavit of waiver/withdrawal, a notarized document.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In view of this, the complainants' mere denial of having signed the affidavit of waiver/withdrawal did not suffice to overcome the positive value of it as a notarized document.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> It is settled that notarization converts a private document into a public document, whereby the document becomes entitled to full faith and credit upon its face.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The notarized document then has in its favor the presumption of regularity, and to overcome the presumed regularity of its execution, whoever alleges the contrary should present evidence that is clear, convincing and more than merely preponderant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><center><b>II<br>The birth certificate is the best evidence<br>of the respondent's date of birth</b><br></center><br>The complainants have also charged the respondent with dishonesty for having concealed his true age in order to secure his appointment as a state prosecutor. They have presented in support of the charge the residence certificate issued in the name of one "Isabelo Villanueva, Jr."; an extrajudicial settlement signed by one "Isabelo Villanueva"; the certificate issued by the Local Civil Registrar of Tupi, South Cotabato showing that the respondent was 26 years old when he got married in 1 961; and the affidavits of the respondent's two siblings.<br><br>In contrast, the respondent submitted his certificate of birth that indicated his birthdate as "November 29, 1943."<br><br>Still, the complainants doubted the veracity of the respondent's bit1h certificate on the ground of its having been belatedly registered at his own instance.<br><br>The Court nonetheless finds for the respondent.<br><br>Firstly, as previously emphasized, the allegation of the falsity of the affidavit of waiver/withdrawal should first be determined in the appropriate criminal or civil proceeding, not in this proceeding for disbarment. Consequently, we desist from definitively ruling on the weight of the evidence presented by the complainants.<br><br>Secondly, a birth certificate consists of entries related to the fact of birth in public records, and is made in the performance of duty by the local civil registrar as a public officer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It is thus treated as the <i>prima facie </i>evidence of the fact of one's birth, and can be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> As such, the birth certificate submitted by the respondent was decisive on the date of his birth in the absence of clearer and more convincing contrary evidence.<br><br>Thirdly, the veracity of the respondent's birth certificate cannot be successfully assailed on the basis alone of its being belatedly entered in the local civil registry. This is because the State expressly allows the late registration of births not only at the instance of the father, mother, or guardian in case the person whose birth is to be registered is under 18 years of age, but also at the instance of the person himself when already of age.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>To accord with such policy of the State, the fact of late registration of the respondent's birth should not adversely affect the validity of the entries made in his birth certificate.<br><br>And, finally, it is fitting to state that the complainants bore the burden of proof in this disbarment proceeding against the respondent. They must establish their charges of falsification and dishonesty by convincing and satisfactory proof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Surmises, suspicion and conjectures are not bases of finding his culpability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The foregoing disquisitions on the falsification show that the complainants did not discharge their burden of proof thereon. They also did not convincingly establish that the respondent had willfully adjusted his true age to secure his appointment as a state prosecutor. Indeed, the appointment happened on February 22, 2006<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> but his late registration of his birth occurred on July 3, 2006.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> If the intention for the late registration was to make it appear that he still met the age requirement for public prosecutors, he should have effected the late registration prior to the appointment, not several months subsequently. In addition, he submitted a "Voter Certification" showing him to be a registered voter of Balagtas (Bigaa), Bulacan on September 20, 2003, and to have been born on November 29, 1943.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Under the circumstances, that he had intentionally adjusted his birthdate to enable himself to meet the age requirement for the position of state prosecutor three years later became plainly improbable.<br><br><center><b>III<br><br>Disbarment or suspension complaints against lawyers <br>in the public service involving their qualifications<br>should be initially investigated by the agencies or offices<br>having administrative supervision over them</b><br></center><br>The Court finds the need to clarify that although it may entertain a disbarment or suspension complaint brought against a lawyer employed in the government service whether or not the complaint pertained to an act or conduct unrelated to the discharge of his official functions,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> the investigation should be carried out by the agency or office having administrative supervision over him or her when the allegations of the complaint relate to the qualifications of the respondent to be appointed to the public office.<br><br>Accordingly, any questions pertaining to the qualifications of the respondent to be appointed as a state prosecutor should be directed to the Secretary of Justice who had administrative supervision over him under the law,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> and not to this Court in the guise of the disbarment complaint. The complaint for disbarment is <i>sui generis</i>, and the proceeding thereon should focus only on the qualification and fitness of the respondent lawyer to continue membership in the Bar.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court DISMISSES the disbarment complaint against Atty.
