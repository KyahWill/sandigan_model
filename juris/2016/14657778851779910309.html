CV No. 94012, which reconsidered its earlier Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> therein dated April 27, 2012, and granted in part the appeal of herein respondent Solidbank Corporation (Solidbank) from the Amended Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated July 7, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Calamba City, Branch 35, in Civil Case No. 2912-2000-C, which annulled the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings instituted by Solidbank against the Spouses Florante E. Jonsay (Florante) and Luzviminda L. Jonsay (Luzviminda) (Spouses Jonsay) and Momarco Import Co., Inc. (Momarco) (petitioners) over the mortgaged properties.<br><br><center><b>Factual Antecedents</b><br></center><br>Momarco, controlled and owned by the Spouses Jonsay, is an importer, manufacturer and distributor of animal health and feedmill products catering to cattle, hog and poultry producers. On November 9, 1995, and again on April 28, 1997, Momarco obtained loans of P40,000,000.00 and f 20,000,000.00, respectively, from Solidbank for which the Spouses Jonsay executed a blanket mortgage over three parcels of land they owned in Calamba City, Laguna registered in their names under Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. T-224751, T-210327 and T-269668 containing a total of 23,733 square meters.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> On November 3, 1997,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the loans were consolidated under one promissory note<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> for the combined amount of P60,000,000.00, signed by Florante as President of Momarco, with his wife Luzviminda also signing as co-maker.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The stipulated rate of interest was 18.75% <i>per annum</i>, along with an escalation clause tied to increases in pertinent Central Bank-declared interest rates, by which Solidbank was eventually able to unilaterally increase the interest charges up to 30% <i>per annum.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Momarco religiously paid the monthly interests charged by Solidbank from November 1995<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> until January 1998, when it paid P1,370,321.09. Claiming business reverses brought on by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Momarco tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a moratorium or suspension in its interest payments. Due to persistent demands by Solidbank, Momarco made its next, and its last, monthly interest payment in April 1998 in the amount of P1,000,000.00. Solidbank applied the said payment to Momarco's accrued interest for February 1998. Momarco sought a loan from Landbank of the Philippines to pay off its aforesaid debt but its application fell through. The anticipated expropriation by the Department of Public Works and Highways of the mortgaged lots for the extension of the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) also did not materialize.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Solidbank proceeded to extrajudicially foreclose on the mortgage, and at the auction sale held on March 5, 1999, it submitted the winning bid of P82,327,249.54,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> representing Momarco's outstanding loans, interests and penalties, plus attorney's fees of P3,600,000.00. But Momarco now claims that on the date of the auction the fair market value of their mortgaged lots had increased sevenfold to P441,750,000.00.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> On March 22, 1999, Sheriff Adelio Perocho (Sheriff Perocho) issued a certificate of sale to Solidbank, duly annotated on April 15, 1999 on the lots' titles.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On March 9, 2000, a month before the expiration of the period to redeem the lots, the petitioners filed a Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> against Solidbank, Sheriff Perocho and the Register of Deeds of Calamba, Laguna, docketed as Civil Case No. 2912-2000-C, for <i>Annulment of the Extrajudicial Foreclosure of Mortgage, Injunction, Accounting and Damages with Prayer for the Immediate Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction</i>. They averred that: (a) the amount claimed by Solidbank as Momarco's total loan indebtedness is bloated; (b) Solidbank's interest charges are illegal for exceeding the legal rate of 12% <i>per annum;</i> (c) the filing fee it charged has no legal and factual basis; (d) the attorney's fees of P3,600,000.00 it billed the petitioners is excessive and unconscionable; (e) their previous payments from 1995 to 1997 were not taken into account in computing their principal indebtedness; (f) Sheriff Perocho's certificate of posting was invalid; and (g) the publication of the notice of the auction sale was defective because the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> which published the said notice was not a newspaper of general circulation in Calamba, Laguna.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[16]</sup></font><br><br>After Solidbank filed its Answer with Counterclaim<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> on April 12, 2000, the RTC heard and granted the petitioners' application for temporary restraining order on April 13, 2000,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> followed on May 2, 2000<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> by issuance of a writ of preliminary prohibitory injunction, thus suspending the consolidation of Solidbank's titles to the subject lots.<br><br>The petitioners' principal witness was Florante, whose testimony was summarized by the RTC in its amended decision, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>[Florante] signed the loan documents in blank and the signing took place at his office in Quezon City; he asserted that they were able to pay more than Twenty-Four Million Pesos but the same were not deducted by the bank to arrive at the correct amount of indebtedness. He said that his accountant prepared statement of payments showing the payments made to the bank. He further claimed that there are still other payments, the receipts of which are being retrieved by his accountant. He also asserted that the newspaper where the notice of foreclosure sale was published is not a newspaper of general circulation.<br><br>The same cannot be found in a newspaper stand in the place where the mortgaged properties are located; he further claimed that [he] suffered moral, emotional and mental injury; he is a graduate of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine; a permanent member of the Philippine Veterinary Medical Association; graduated and passed the Board; he is the President of [Momarco] and the President of Momarco Resort; he has been engaged in this line of business for 31 years now; his wife is a graduate of Dental Medicine and partner of [Momarco]; he has four (4) children three of them had already graduated and one still in college; x x x he is also claiming for exemplary damages of Five Million Pesos to set an example for other banks like Solidbank, to refrain from filing acts which are irregular and affect borrowers like him, he claimed also for attorney[']s fees of Three Million Pesos.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote><br>Solidbank's witnesses, Lela Quijano, head of its collection division, and Benjamin Apan, its senior manager for retail operations, admitted that the monthly interests it collected from 1995 to 1998 ranged from 18.75% to 30%, and that for 1998, Momarco paid P2,370,321.09 in interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the RTC</b><br></center><br>On July 7, 2009, the RTC issued its Amended Decision, the <i>fallo</i> of which reads, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Wherefore, premises considered, judgment is rendered in favor of the [petitioners] and against the defendants] by:<br><br>1) Declaring the extra-judicial foreclosure proceedings NULL and VOID and without any legal effect and the defendants are prohibited to consolidate the titles in the name of [Solidbank] without prejudice to the filing of the action for collection or recovery of the sum of money secured by the real estate mortgage in the proper forum;<br><br>2) Ordering that the interest rates on the [petitioners'] indebtedness be reduced to 12% per annum;<br><br>3) Declaring that the attorney's fees and filing fee being collected by [Solidbank] to be devoid of any legal basis;<br><br>4) Ordering [Solidbank] to pay the [petitioners] the following sums, to wit:<br><blockquote>a) Php20,000,000.00 - moral damages;<br>b) Php2,500,000.00 - exemplary damages;<br>c) Php1,[500],000.00 - for attorney's fees.<br></blockquote>5) Ordering the dismissal of the counterclaim for lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The RTC ruled that the mortgage contract and the promissory notes prepared by Solidbank, which the Spouses Jonsay signed in blank, were contracts of adhesion; that Solidbank failed to take into account Momarco's payments in the two years preceding 1998 totaling P24,277,293.22 (this amount was not disputed by Solidbank); that the interest rates, ranging from 19% to 30%, as well as the penalties, charges and attorney's fees imposed by Solidbank, were excessive, unconscionable and immoral, and that Solidbank has no <i>carte blanche</i> authority under the Usury Law to unilaterally raise the interest rates to levels as to enslave the borrower and hemorrhage its assets; that Solidbank's verification in its application for foreclosure of mortgage was defective because it was signed not by its President but only by a vice-president; that the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, in which the notice of auction was published, was not a newspaper of general circulation because it had no <i>bona fide</i> list of paying subscribers; that Solidbank manipulated the foreclosure sale through a defective publication of the notice of auction and by submitting an unconscionably low bid of P82,327,000.00, whereas the value of the lots had risen sevenfold since the rehabilitation of the SLEX.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[23]</sup></font><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the CA</b><br></center><br>On appeal to the CA, Solidbank interposed the following errors of the RTC, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>THE [RTC] GRAVELY ERRED IN NULLIFYING THE FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS CONDUCTED AGAINST [THE PETITIONERS'] PROPERTIES ON THE GROUND THAT THE REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE EXECUTED BY THE PARTIES WAS A CONTRACT OF ADHESION;<br><br>THE [RTC] GRAVELY ERRED IN NULLIFYING THE FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS CONDUCTED AGAINST [THE PETITIONERS'] PROPERTIES ON THE GROUND THAT THE NEWSPAPER WHERE THE NOTICE OF FORECLOSURE WAS PUBLISHED IS NOT A NEWSPAPER OF GENERAL CIRCULATION;<br><br>THE [RTC] GRAVELY ERRED IN NULLIFYING THE FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS CONDUCTED AGAINST [THE PETITIONERS'] PROPERTIES ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE INTEREST RATES, PENALTIES, ATTORNEY'S FEES CHARGED ARE EXCESSIVE, UNCONSCIONABLE AND IMMORAL AND THAT THE [SOLIDBANK] DID NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT [THE PETITIONERS'] PREVIOUS PAYMENT[S] IN THE AMOUNT OF P24,277,293.27;<br><br>THE [RTC] GRAVELY ERRED IN AWARDING MORAL DAMAGES, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES IN FAVOR OF THE [PETITIONERS];<br><br>THE [RTC] GRAVE[LY] ERRED IN FAILING TO REGARD [THE PETITIONERS] [IN] ESTOPPEL WHEN THE LATTER DID NOT IMPUGN THE VALIDITY OF THE LOAN AND MORTGAGE DOCUMENTS WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>On April 27, 2012, the CA rendered judgment affirming the RTC<i> in toto</i>. It agreed that Solidbank did not comply with the publication requirements under Section 3, Act No. 3135, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 3. Notice shall be given by posting notices of the sale for not less than twenty days in at least three public places of the municipality or city where the property is situated, and if such property is worth more than four hundred pesos, such notice shall also be published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks <b>in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or city</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Emphasis ours)</blockquote><br>According to the CA, the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> was not a newspaper of general circulation, notwithstanding the affidavit of publication issued by its publisher, Turing R. Crisostomo (Crisostomo), to that effect as well as the certification of the Clerk of Court of RTC-Calamba City that it was duly accredited by the court since May 28, 1997 to publish legal notices. The CA ruled that it was not enough for Crisostomo to merely state in his affidavit that the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> was published and edited in the province of Laguna and in San Pablo City without a showing that it was published to disseminate local news and general information, that it had a <i>bona fide</i> list of paying subscribers, that it was published at regular intervals, and that it was in general circulation in Calamba City where the subject properties are located.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>In <i>Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, Inc. v. Peñafiel</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> cited by the CA, the Court explained that: (1) the object of a notice of sale is to achieve a reasonably wide publicity of the auction by informing the public of the nature and condition of the property to be auctioned, and of the time, place and terms of the sale, and thereby secure bidders and prevent a sacrifice of the property; (2) a newspaper to be considered one of general circulation need not have the largest circulation but must be able to appeal to the public in general and thus ensure a wide readership, and must not be devoted solely to entertainment or the interest of a particular class, profession, trade, calling, race, or religious denomination; and (3) Section 3 of Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118, does not only require the newspaper to be of general circulation but also that it is circulated in the municipality or city where the property is located.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The CA held that the accreditation of the <i>Morning Chronicle </i>by the Clerk of Court of the RTC to publish legal notices is not determinative of whether it is a newspaper of general circulation in Calamba City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Concerning the loans due from the petitioners, the CA noted that under the<i> pro forma</i> promissory note which Solidbank prepared and which the Spouses Jonsay signed in blank, Solidbank enjoyed unrestrained freedom to unilaterally increase the interest rate in any month. The note gave it authority to increase or decrease the interest rate from time to time, "without any advance notice" and "in the event the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of the Philippines raises or lowers the interest rates on loans." According to the CA, this provision violated the principle of mutuality of contracts embodied in Article 1308<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> of the Civil Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The CA also held that the herein petitioners were not in estoppel for failing to seasonably question the validity of the mortgage loan since the prescriptive period is reckoned from their notice of the statements of account issued by Solidbank showing the unilateral increases in the interest, for only by then would their cause of action have accrued. Since only three years had elapsed from the execution of the mortgage contract to the filing of the complaint on March 15, 2000, the action was brought within the 10-year prescriptive period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Solidbank moved for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> of the decision, which the CA granted in part on November 26, 2012, <i>via</i> its Amended Decision, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Motion is GRANTED IN PART. Our Decision promulgated on April 27, 2012 is hereby amended. Paragraphs 2 and 5 of the dispositive portion of the July 7, 2009 Decision of the [RTC] of Calamba City, Branch 35 remain affirmed. Paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 thereof are hereby reversed and set aside.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Thus, in a complete reversal of its decision, the CA now not only found the parties' mortgage contract valid, but also declared that Solidbank's extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage enjoyed the presumption of regularity. It took into account the (a) Affidavit of Publication issued by Crisostomo that it duly published the notice of auction sale on February 8, 15, and 22, 1999, (b) the Certification by the Clerk of Court of the RTC-Calamba City that the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> was duly accredited by the court to publish legal notices, and (c) the Raffle of Publication dated February 1, 1999 showing that the said newspaper participated in and won the raffle on February 1, 1999 to publish the subject notice. The CA stressed that since the selection of <i>Morning Chronicle</i> to publish the notice was through a court-supervised raffle, Solidbank was fully justified in relying on the regularity of the publication of its notice in the aforesaid newspaper, in the choice of which it had no hand whatsoever.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>The CA further held that no malice can be imputed on Solidbank's refusal to accept the petitioners' offer of <i>dacion en pago,</i> since it was duly authorized under the parties' mortgage contract to extrajudicially foreclose on the mortgage in the event that Momarco defaulted in its interest payments. Thus, when Solidbank opted to foreclose on the mortgage, it was merely exercising its contractual right to protect its interest, and Solidbank's supposed insensitivity or lack of sympathy toward Momarco's financial plight is irrelevant and is not indemnifiable as bad faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the CA pointed out that other than Florante's bare testimonial allegations, the petitioners failed to adduce evidence to debunk Solidbank's compliance with the publication of its auction notice. They were unable to show that the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> was not a newspaper of general circulation in Calamba City, that it was not published once a week, or that it could not be found in newsstands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Thus, the CA in its amended decision: (a) upheld the validity of the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings, the consolidation of the titles of Solidbank in the foreclosed properties, and the dismissal of Solidbank's counterclaim; (b) ordered the reduction of the interest rates on the petitioners" indebtedness to the legal rate of 12%<i> per annum</i>, thereby affirming that the unilateral increases in the monthly interest rates, which averaged 2.19% per month or 26.25% <i>per annum</i>, "without notice to the mortgagors," are void for being iniquitous, excessive and unconscionable; and (c) upheld the collection by the Solidbank of attorney's fees and filing fee. Nonetheless, the CA invalidated for lack of basis the award by the RTC to the petitioners of P20,000,000.00 as moral damages, P2,500,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P1,500,000.00 as attorney's fees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The petitioners moved for partial reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> of the CA's Amended Decision dated November 26, 2012, but the CA denied the same in its Resolution40 dated March 19, 2013.<br><br><center><b>Petition for Review in the Supreme Court</b><br></center><br>In this petition for review, the petitioners interpose the following assignment of errors, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE [CA] GRAVELY ERRED BY RENDERING TWO (2) CONFLICTING DECISIONS ON THE SAME SET OF FACTS AND EVIDENCE. THE AMENDED DECISION IS NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND EXISTING JURISPRUDENCE[; AND]<br><br></li><li>WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE [CA] GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT CORRECTLY APPLYING THE LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE ON EXTRAJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE, DAMAGES AND CONTRACT OF ADHESION IN THE AMENDED DECISION.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[41]</sup></font></li></ol></blockquote><br>The petitioners decry how, after first declaring that "[a]ll told, we find no reason to disturb, much less reverse, the assailed decision of the RTC," the CA could now be permitted to make a complete turn-around from its previous decision over the same set of facts, and declare that the subject foreclosure is valid, order the consolidation of Solidbank's titles, and delete the award of moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees and costs of suit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b></center><br>There is merit in the petition.<br><br><b>There is no legal proscription against<br>an adjudicating court adopting on motion<br>for reconsideration by a party a position <br>that is completely contrary to one it had<br>previously taken in a case.</b><br><br>The petitioners' dismay over how the same division of the CA could make two opposite and conflicting decisions over exactly the same facts is understandable. Yet, what the CA simply did was to admit that it had committed an error of judgment, one which it was nonetheless fully authorized to correct upon a timely motion for reconsideration. Sections 1, 2 and 3 of Rule 37 of the Rules of Court are pertinent:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 1.<i> Grounds of and period for filing motion for new trial or reconsideration.</i> — x x x.<br><br>Within the same period, the aggrieved party may move for reconsideration upon the grounds that the damages awarded are excessive, that the evidence is insufficient to justify the decision or final order, or that the decision or final order is contrary to law.<br><br>Sec. 2. <i>Contents of motion for new trial or reconsideration and notice thereof.</i> — x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>A motion for reconsideration shall point out specifically the findings or conclusions of the judgment or final order which are not supported by the evidence or which are contrary to law[,] making express reference to the testimonial or documentary evidence or to the provisions of law alleged to be contrary to such findings or conclusions.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Sec. 3. <i>Action upon motion for new trial or reconsideration.</i> — x x x If the court finds that excessive damages have been awarded or that the judgment or final order is contrary to the evidence or law, it may amend such judgment or final order accordingly.</blockquote><br>The rule is that while the decision of a court becomes final upon the lapse of the period to appeal by any party,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> but the filing of a motion for reconsideration or new trial interrupts or suspends the running of the said period, and prevents the finality of the decision or order from setting in.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> A motion for reconsideration allows a party to request the adjudicating court or quasi-judicial body to take a second look at its earlier judgment and correct any errors it may have committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> As explained in<i> Salcedo II v. COMELEC,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> a motion for reconsideration allows the adjudicator or judge to take a second opportunity to review the case and to grapple anew with theissues therein, and to decide again a question previously raised, there being no legal proscription imposed against the deciding body adopting thereby a new position contrary to one it had previously taken.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br><b>Solidbank has sufficiently complied<br>with the requirement of publication <br>under Section 3 of Act No. 3135.</b><br><br>In <i>Philippine Savings Bank v. Spouses Geronimo</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the Court stressed that the right of a bank to extrajudicially foreclose on a real estate mortgage is well-recognized, provided it faithfully complies with the statutory requirements of foreclosure:<br><br><blockquote>While the law recognizes the right of a bank to foreclose a mortgage upon the mortgagor's failure to pay his obligation, it is imperative that such right be exercised according to its clear mandate. Each and every requirement of the law must be complied with, lest, the valid exercise of the right would end. It must be remembered that the exercise of a right ends when the right disappears, and it disappears when it is abused especially to the prejudice of others.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[49]</sup></font></blockquote><br>In <i>Cristobal v. CA,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the Court explicitly held that foreclosure proceedings enjoy the presumption of regularity and the mortgagor who alleges the absence of a requisite has the burden of proving such fact:<br><br><blockquote>Further, as respondent bank asserts, a mortgagor who alleges absence of a requisite has the burden of establishing that fact. Petitioners failed in this regard. Foreclosure proceedings have in their favor the presumption of regularity and the burden of evidence to rebut the same is on the petitioners, x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>The petitioners insist that the CA was correct when it first ruled in its Decision dated April 27, 2012 that there was no valid publication of the notice of auction, since the <i>Morning Chronicle </i>was not shown to be a newspaper of general circulation in Calamba City. The CA disregarded the affidavit of publication executed by its publisher to that effect, as well as the certification by the Clerk of Court of RTC-Calamba City that the said paper was duly accredited by the court to publish legal notices. It ruled that there was no showing by the Solidbank that the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> was published to disseminate local news and general information, that it had a <i>bonafide</i> list of paying subscribers, that it was published at regular intervals, and that it was in circulation in Calamba City where the subject properties are located.<br><br>But in its Amended Decision on November 26, 2012, the CA now ruled that the questioned foreclosure proceedings enjoy the presumption of regularity, and it is the burden of the petitioners to overcome this presumption. The CA stated:<br><br><blockquote>It is an elementary rule that the burden of proof is the duty of a party to present evidence on the facts in issue necessary to establish his claim or defense as required by law. The Court has likewise ruled in previous cases that foreclosure proceedings enjoy the presumption of regularity and that the mortgagor who alleges absence of a requisite has the burden of proving such fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>In <i>Fortune Motors (Phils.) Inc. v. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> it was stressed that in order for publication to serve its intended purpose, the newspaper should be in general circulation in the place where the foreclosed properties to be auctioned are located.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> But in <i>Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. v. Spouses Miranda</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> the Court also clarified that the matter of compliance with the notice and publication requirements is a factual issue which need not be resolved by the high court:<br><br><blockquote>It has been our consistent ruling that the question of compliance or non-compliance with notice and publication requirements of an extrajudicial foreclosure sale is a factual issue, and the resolution thereof by the trial court is generally binding on this Court. The matter of sufficiency of posting and publication of a notice of foreclosure sale need not be resolved by this Court, especially when the findings of the RTC were sustained by the CA. Well-established is the rule that factual findings of the CA are conclusive on the parties and carry even more weight when the said court affirms the factual findings of the trial court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>In<i> Spouses Miranda,</i> the Court ruled that the foreclosing bank could not invoke the presumption of regularity of the publication of the notice of auction absent any proof whatsoever of the fact of publication.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> In the case at bar, there is no dispute that there was publication of the auction notice, which the CA in its amended decision now held to have sufficiently complied with the requirement of publication under Section 3 of Act No. 3135. Unfortunately, against the fact of publication and the presumption of regularity of the foreclosure proceedings, the petitioners' only contrary evidence is Florante's testimonial assertion that the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> was not a newspaper of general circulation in Calamba City and that it could not be found in the local newsstands.<br><br>Admittedly, the records are sparse as to the details of the publication. In his Affidavit of Publication, publisher Crisostomo stated concerning the circulation of his paper, as follows:<br><br><blockquote>I, [CRISOSTOMO], legal age, Filipino, resident of Brgy.

He did not particularly mention, as the CA seemed to demand in its initial decision, that the <i>Morning Chronicle </i>was published and circulated to disseminate local news and general information in Calamba City where the, foreclosed properties are located.<br><br>Nonetheless, when the RTC accredited the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> to publish legal notices in Calamba City, it can be presumed that the RTC had made a prior determination that the said newspaper had met the requisites for valid publication of legal notices in the said locality, guided by the understanding that for the publication of legal notices in Calamba City to serve its intended purpose, it must be in general circulation therein. This presumption lays the burden upon the petitioners to show otherwise, contrary to the CA's first ruling.<br><br>It is true that the Court also held in <i>Peñafiel</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> concerning the evidentiary weight of the publisher's affidavit of publication, that the accreditation by the RTC executive judge is not decisive on the issue of whether a newspaper is of general circulation:<br><br><blockquote>The accreditation of <i>Maharlika Pilipinas </i>by the Presiding Judge of the RTC is not decisive of whether it is a newspaper of general circulation in Mandaluyong City.

The undertaking is really one of sale, that is, the creditor is really buying the thing or property of the debtor, payment for which is to be charged against the debtor's debt. As such, the essential elements of a contract of sale, namely, consent, object certain, and cause or consideration must be present. It is only when the thing offered as an equivalent is accepted by the creditor that novation takes place, thereby, totally extinguishing the debt.<br><br>On the first issue, the Court of Appeals did not err in ruling that Tecnogas has no clear legal right to an injunctive relief because its proposal to pay by way of <i>dacion en pago </i>did not extinguish its obligation. Undeniably, Tecnogas' proposal to pay by way of <i>dacion en pago</i> was not accepted by PNB. Thus, the unaccepted proposal neither novates the parties' mortgage contract nor suspends its execution as there was no meeting of the minds between the parties on whether the loan will be extinguished by way of <i>dacion en pago</i>. Necessarily, upon Tecnogas' default in its obligations, the foreclosure of the REM becomes a matter of right on the part of PNB, for such is the purpose of requiring security for the loans.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br><b>An escalation clause in a loan<br>agreement granting the lending <br>bank authority to unilaterally <br>increase the interest rate without<br>prior notice to and consent of the<br>borrower is void.</b><br><br>After annulling the foreclosure of mortgage, the RTC reduced the interest imposable on the petitioners' loans to 12%, the legal interest allowed for a loan or forbearance of credit, citing <i>Medel v.

In each drawdown, the Promissory Notes specified the interest rate to be charged: 19.5 percent in the first, and 21.5 percent in the second and again in the third. However, a uniform clause therein permitted respondent to increase the rate <b>"within the limits allowed by law at any time depending on whatever policy it may adopt in the future x x x," without even giving prior notice to petitioners.</b> The Court holds that petitioners' accessory duty to pay interest did not give respondent unrestrained freedom to charge any rate other than that which was agreed upon. No interest shall be due, unless expressly stipulated in writing. It would be the zenith of farcicality to specify and agree upon rates that could be subsequently upgraded at whim by only one party to the agreement.<br><br>The "unilateral determination and imposition" of increased rates is "violative of the principle of mutuality of contracts ordained in Article 1308 of the Civil Code." One-sided impositions do not have the force of law between the parties, because such impositions are not based on the parties' essential equality.<br><br>Although escalation clauses are valid in maintaining fiscal stability and retaining the value of money on long-term contracts, giving respondent an unbridled right to adjust the interest independently and upwardly would completely take away from petitioners the "right to assent to an important modification in their agreement" and would also negate the element of mutuality in their contracts. The clause cited earlier made the fulfillment of the contracts "dependent exclusively upon the uncontrolled will" of respondent and was therefore void. Besides, the pro forma promissory notes have the character of a contract d'adhesion, "where the parties do not bargain on equal footing, the weaker party's [the debtor's] participation being reduced to the alternative 'to take it or leave it.'"<br><br>"While the Usury Law ceiling on interest rates was lifted by [Central Bank] Circular No. 905, nothing in the said Circular grants lenders <i>carte blanche</i> authority to raise interest rates to levels which will either enslave their borrowers or lead to a hemorrhaging of their assets." In fact, we have declared nearly ten years ago that neither this Circular nor PD 1684, which further amended the Usury Law, "authorized either party to unilaterally raise the interest rate without the other's consent."<br><br>Moreover, a similar case eight years ago pointed out to the same respondent (PNB) that borrowing signified a capital transfusion from lending institutions to businesses and industries and was done for the purpose of stimulating their growth; yet respondent's continued "unilateral and lopsided policy" of increasing interest rates "without the prior assent" of the borrower not only defeats this purpose, but also deviates from this pronouncement. Although such increases are not usurious, since the "Usury Law is now legally inexistent" — the interest ranging from 26 percent to 35 percent in the statements of account — "must be equitably reduced for being iniquitous, unconscionable and exorbitant." Rates found to be iniquitous or unconscionable are void, as if it there were no express contract thereon.

The executive judge receives the application neither in a judicial capacity nor on behalf of the court; the conduct of extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings is not governed by the rules on ordinary or special civil actions. The executive judge performs therein an administrative function to ensure that all requirements for the extrajudicial foreclosure of a mortgage are satisfied before the clerk of court, as the <i>ex-officio </i>sheriff, goes ahead with the public auction of the mortgaged property.
