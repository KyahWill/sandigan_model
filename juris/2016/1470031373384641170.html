				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before the Court is a Complaint-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for disbarment filed by Myrna M. Deveza (<i>complainant</i>) against respondent Atty. Alexander M. Del Prado (<i>Atty. Del Prado</i>) for dishonesty and for acts unbecoming a lawyer.<br><br>In her complaint-affidavit, complainant alleged, among others, the following:<br><blockquote>2. The charge arose from the following facts:<br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">In February 2003, Atty.

Del Prado to comment on the complaint-affidavit but failed to do so.<br><br>Pursuant to the Court Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated November 18, 2013, the complaint was referred to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.<br><br>On June 18, 2014, the case was set for mandatory conference but only the counsel of complainant appeared. Despite due notice, Atty. Del Prado did not attend the mandatory conference. The parties were then required to submit their respective position papers but Atty. Del Prado again did not heed to the order of the IBP.<br><br>On September 2, 2014, the IBP-CBD, in its Report and Recommendation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> stated that Atty. Del Prado's failure to answer the complaint despite several notices and his continuous absence in the scheduled hearings shows his flouting resistance to the lawful orders of the court and illustrates his despiciency for his oath of office as a lawyer. The IBP-CBD recommended that Atty. Del Prado be meted the penalty of suspension from the practice of law and as a member of the bar for a period of two (2) years.<br><br>In its Notice of Resolution No. XXI-2015-014,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> dated January 30, 2015, the IBP-Board of Governors adopted and approved with modification the report and recommendation of the CBD and suspended Atty. Del Prado from the practice of law for a period of five (5) years.<br><br>The Court agrees with the findings and recommendation of the IBP.<br><br>The practice of law is a privilege bestowed only to those who show that they possess and continue to possess the legal qualifications for it. As vanguards of our legal system, they are expected to maintain not only legal proficiency but also a high standard of morality, honesty, integrity and fair dealing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Because of their important role in the society, the Court shall not hesitate to discipline a lawyer for any conduct that is wanting in morality, honesty, probity and good demeanor, whether such conduct was committed in their professional or in private capacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Canon 7 of the Code of Professional Responsibility specifically mandates all lawyers to uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession. Rule 1.01 of Canon 1 of the same code proscribes a lawyer from engaging in any unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct. They should refrain from doing any act which might lessen in any degree the confidence and trust reposed by the public in the fidelity, honesty and integrity of the legal profession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In the present case, Atty. Del Prado committed an act which fell short of the standard of the norm of conduct required of every lawyer. He deceived the complainant by making her sign the deed of sale and making her believe that he would pay in full the balance of the purchase price after he had the document notarized. Complainant waited for Atty. Del Prado to make good his promise to pay but despite several demands, he continued reneging on his obligation which prompted her to file a case against him.<br><br>Moreover, Atty. Del Prado wantonly disregarded the lawful orders of the Court and IBP-CBD to file his comment and position paper and to appear in the mandatory conference despite due notice. His continued defiance of the orders of the Court and the IBP-CBD is a deliberate and contemptuous affront on the court's authority which cannot be tolerated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Atty. Del Prado should bear in mind that he is a lawyer and an officer of the court who is duty bound to obey and respect the court processes. He must acknowledge, at all times, the orders of the Court and the IBP-CBD in deference to their authority over him as a member of the bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding respondent Atty.
