Accordingly, it ordered the Motion for Extension expunged from the records.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Subsequently, or on March 31, 2015, Bautista, <i>et al.</i> filed a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> before the CA, with appropriate payment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> of the prescribed docket fees, assailing the December 9, 2014 Decision of the RTC, as well as the March 10, 2015 Order denying the motion for reconsideration thereof.

The CA's action was in connection with its earlier Resolution dated March 9, 2015 denying J. Bautista's Motion for Extension and consequently, expunged the case from the records.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, herein petitioners<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> elevated the matter before the Court <i>via</i> the instant petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The issue to be resolved by the Court is whether or not the CA erred in merely <i>noting without action</i> Bautista, <i>et al.</i>'s Petition for Review and other subsequent pleadings, thus, denying them due course.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is partly meritorious.<br><br>Section 1, Rule 42<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>Section 1. <i>How appeal taken; time for filing</i>. - A party desiring to appeal from a decision of the Regional Trial Court rendered in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction may <u>file a verified petition for review with the Court of Appeals,!paying at the same time to the clerk of said court the corresponding docket and other lawful fees</u>, depositing the amount of P500.00 for costs, and furnishing the Regional Trial Court and the adverse party with a copy of the petition. The petition shall be filed and served within fifteen (15) days from notice of the decision sought to be reviewed or of the denial of the petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration filed in due time after judgment. <u>Upon proper motion and the payment of the full amount of the docket and other lawful fees and the deposit for costs before the expiration of the reglementary period</u>, the Court of Appeals may grant an additional period of fifteen (15) days only within which to file the petition for review. No further extension shall be granted except for the most compelling reason and in no case to exceed fifteen (15) days.<br></blockquote>Thus, for appellate jurisdiction to attach, the following requisites must be complied with: (<i>a</i>) the petitioner must have invoked the jurisdiction of the CA within the time for doing so; (<i>b</i>) he must have filed his petition for review within the reglementary period; (<i>c</i>) he must have paid the necessary docket fees; and (<i>d</i>) the other parties must have perfected their appeals in due time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> In this regard, the Rules of Court require that in an appeal by way of a petition for review, the appeal is deemed perfected as to the petitioner upon the timely filing of the petition and the payment of docket and other lawful fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> To perfect the appeal, the party has to file the petition for review and to pay the docket fees within the prescribed period. The law and its intent are clear and unequivocal that the petition is perfected upon its filing and the payment of the docket fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Consequently, without the petition, the CA cannot be said to have acquired jurisdiction over the case.<br><br>Applying the foregoing parameters, the appellate jurisdiction did not attach with the filing of J. Bautista's Motion for Extension. Notably] the pleading filed was a mere motion for extension and not a petition for review, and there was no payment of the required docket fees. Besides, J. Bautista filed the motion ostensibly on behalf of the rest of the petitioners in the courts <i>a quo</i> but records are bereft of evidence to show that they had authorized him to do so. The Court also notes that J. Bautista filed the motion after receipt <i>only</i> of the RTC's December 9, 2014 Decision, from which <i>all</i> of the petitioners (Bautista, <i>et al.</i>) seasonably filed their Motion for Reconsideration: Thus, in <b>CA-G.R. SP No. 139159-UDK</b>, the Ca did not acquire appellate jurisdiction for two (2) reasons: <i>one</i>, it was merely a Motion for Extension and not a proper Petition for Review, and <i>two</i>, there was no payment of the required docket fees.<br><br>However, the same does not hold true with respect to the Petition for Review subsequently filed by Bautista, <i>et al.</i>, which was originally docketed as <b>CA-G.R. 139764</b>. The said petition was filed together with the payment of docket and other lawful fees and assailed not only the December 9, 2014 Decision of the RTC, but also the March 10, 2015 Order denying their Motion for Reconsideration. Records show that Bautista, <i>et al.</i> filed their Petition for Review within the fifteen (15) day period after their receipt of the Order denying their Motion for Reconsideration. Clearly, therefore, the Petition for Review was properly filed, and the CA acquired appellate jurisdiction over the case.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, the CA committed reversible error in merely noting without action the Petition for Review, as well as the subsequent pleadings that Bautista, <i>et al.</i> had filed. The Petition for Review initially docketed as <b>CA-G.R. 139764</b> was an entirely new and distinct pleading assailing the RTC's issuances and did not proceed from the Motion for Extension filed by J. Bautista, which the CA had already ordered expunged from the records. As such, with the expunction of J. Bautista's Motion for Extension, the docket number previously assigned to it should not have been re-assigned to the properly and seasonably-filed Petition for Review. To note, the CA would not have designated the appropriate docket number to the Petition for Review had it not found the same to be in order.<br><br>In fine, considering that Bautista, <i>et al.</i> had duly perfected their appeal upon the timely filing of their Petition for Review together with payment of the prescribed docket and other lawful fees, the CA had already acquired appellate jurisdiction over the case. Consequently, it is only proper that the CA reinstate and re-docket the same.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>. The Court of Appeals is directed to <b>REINSTATE</b> and <b>RE-DOCKET</b> the Petition for Review filed before it by Julius Bautista, Florentina Juan (Arsenio Laranang), Bienvinido Baldemor (Reynaldo Baldemor), Carmelita Manayan, Rufino Flores (Norrna Flores), Elizarde Estigoy (Consuelo Estigoy), Carmelita Valmonte, Gervacio Aregando (Simeon Martin), Dalisay Gadian (Magdalena Gadian), Jose Ginno Dela Merced, Florentina Silan (Joven Silan, Jr.), Julio Diaz, Gideon Acosta, and Wencesla Bautista.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.
