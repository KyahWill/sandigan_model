GAMCA received its copy of the August 23, 2010 letter-order on August 25, 2010.<br><br>On August 26, 2010, GAMCA filed with the RTC of Pasig City a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order (<i>GAMCA's petition</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It assailed: (1) the DOH's August 23, 2010 letter-order on the ground of <b>grave abuse of discretion</b>; and (2) paragraphs c.3 and c.4, Section 16 of RA No. 10022, as well as Section 1 (c) and (d), Rule XI of the IRR, as <b>unconstitutional</b>.<br><br>Meanwhile, the DOH reiterated - through its <b><u>November 2, 2010 order</u></b> - its directive that GAMCA cease and desist from implementing the referral decking system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On November 23, 2010, AMCOW filed an urgent motion for leave to intervene and to file an opposition-in-intervention, attaching its opposition-­in-intervention to its motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the hearing conducted the following day, November 24, 2010, the RTC granted AMCOW's intervention; DOH and GAMCA did not oppose AMCOW's motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> AMCOW subsequently paid the docket fees and submitted its memorandum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In an order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated August 1, 2011, the RTC issued a writ of preliminary injunction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> directing the DOH to cease and desist from implementing its August 23, 2010 and November 2, 2010 orders. The RTC likewise issued an order denying the motion for inhibition/disqualification filed by AMCOW.<br><br>On August 18, 2011, the DOH sought reconsideration of the RTC's August 1, 2011 order.<br><br><b><i>The assailed RTC rulings</i></b><br><br>In its August 10, 2012 decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the RTC granted GAMCA's <i>certiorari</i> petition and declared null and void <i>ab initio</i> the DOH CDO letters. It also issued a writ of prohibition directing "the DOH Secretary and all persons acting on his behalf to cease and desist from implementing the assailed Orders against the [GAMCA]."<br><br><b>The RTC upheld the constitutionality of Section 16 of RA No. 10022</b>, amending Section 23 of RA No. 8042, <b>but ruled that Section 16 of RA No. 10022 does not apply to GAMCA</b>.<br><br>The RTC reasoned out that the prohibition against the referral decking system under Section 16 of RA No. 10022 must be interpreted as applying only to clinics that conduct health examination on migrant workers bound for countries that do not require the referral decking system for the issuance of visas to job applicants.<br><br>It noted that the referral decking system is part of the application procedure in obtaining visas to enter the GCC States, a procedure made in the exercise of the sovereign power of the GCC States to protect their nationals from health hazards, and of their diplomatic power to regulate and screen entrants to their territories. Under the principle of sovereign equality and independence of States, the Philippines cannot interfere with this system and, in fact, must respect the visa-granting procedures of foreign states in the same way that they respect our immigration procedures.<br><br>Moreover, to restrain GAMCA which is a mere adjunct of HMC, the agent of GCC States, is to restrain the GCC States themselves. To the RTC, the Congress was aware of this limitation, pursuant to the generally accepted principles of international law under Article II, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution, when it enacted Section 16 of RA No. 10022.<br><br>The DOH and AMCOW separately sought reconsideration of the RTC's August 10, 2012 decision, which motions the RTC denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The DOH and AMCOW separately filed the present Rule 45 petitions.<br><br>On August 24, 2013, AMCOW filed a motion for consolidation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of the two petitions; the Court granted this motion and ordered the consolidation of the two petitions in a resolution dated September 17, 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In the resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of April 14, 2015, the Court denied: (1) GAMCA's most urgent motion for issuance of temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction/status quo ante order (with request for immediate inclusion in the Honorable Court's agenda of March 3, 2015, its motion dated March 2, 2015);<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and (2) the most urgent reiterating motion for issuance of temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction/status quo ante order dated March 11, 2015.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The Court also suspended the implementation of the permanent injunction issued by the RTC of Pasay City, Branch 108 in its August 10, 2012 decision.<br><br><center><b><u>II. The Issues</u></b><br></center><br>The consolidated cases before us present the following issues:<br><br><b><i>First</i></b>, whether the Regional Trial Court legally erred in giving due course to the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition against the DOH CDO letters;<br><br><b><i>Second</i></b>, whether the DOH CDO letters prohibiting GAMCA from implementing the referral decking system embodied under Section 16 of Republic Act No. 10022 violates Section 3, Article II of the 1987 Constitution for being an undue taking of property;<br><br><b><i>Third</i></b>, whether the application of Section 16 of Republic Act No.10022 to the GAMCA violates the international customary principles of sovereign independence and equality.<br><br><center><b><u>III. Our Ruling</u></b><br></center><br><b><i>A. The RTC legally erred when it gave due course to GAMCA's petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition.</i></b><br><br>The present case reached us through an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> (pursuant to Rule 45) of an RTC ruling, assailing the decision based solely on questions of law. The RTC decision, on the other hand, involves the grant of the petitions for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition (pursuant to Rule 65) assailing the DOH CDO letters for grave abuse of discretion.<br><br><b>The question before us asks whether the RTC made a reversible error of law when it issued writs of <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition against the DOH CDO letters.</b><br><br>AMCOW questions the means by which GAMCA raised the issue of the legality of RA No. 10022 before the RTC. AMCOW posits that GAMCA availed of an improper remedy, as <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition lie only against quasi-judicial acts, and quasi-judicial and ministerial acts, respectively. Since the disputed cease and desist order is neither, the RTC should have dismissed the petition outright for being an improper remedy.<br><br>We <b>agree with the petitioners'</b> assertion that the RTC erred when it gave due course to GAMCA's petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition, but we do so <b>for different reasons</b>.<br><br><b><i>1. Certiorari under Rules of Court and under the courts' expanded jurisdiction under Art VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution, as recognized by jurisprudence.</i></b><br><br><b><i>A.1.a. The Current Certiorari Situation</i></b><br><br>The use of petitions for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition under Rule 65 is a remedy that judiciaries have used long before our Rules of Court existed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> As footnoted below, these writs - now recognized and regulated as remedies under Rule 65 of our Rules of Court - have been characterized a "supervisory writs" used by superior courts to keep lower courts within the confines of their granted jurisdictions, thereby ensuring orderliness in lower courts' rulings.<br><br>We confirmed this characterization in <i>Madrigal Transport v. Lapanday Holdings Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> when we held that a writ is founded on the supervisory jurisdiction of appellate courts over inferior courts, and is issued to keep the latter within the bounds of their jurisdiction. Thus, the writ corrects only errors of jurisdiction of judicial and quasi-judicial bodies, and cannot be used to correct errors of law or fact. For these mistakes of judgment, the appropriate remedy is an appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>This situation changed after 1987 when the new Constitution "expanded" the scope of judicial power by providing that -<br><blockquote>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine <b><i>whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government</i></b>. (italics supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Francisco v. The House of Representatives</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> we recognized that this expanded jurisdiction was meant "to ensure the potency of the power of judicial review to curb grave abuse of discretion by 'any branch or instrumentalities of government.'" Thus, the second paragraph of Article VIII, Section 1 engraves, for the first time in its history, into black letter law the "expanded <i>certiorari</i> jurisdiction" of this Court, whose nature and purpose had been provided in the sponsorship speech of its proponent, former Chief Justice Constitutional Commissioner Roberto Concepcion:<br><blockquote><center>x x x x<br></center><br>The first section starts with a sentence copied from former<br><br>Constitutions. It says:<br><br>The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<br><br>I suppose nobody can question it.<br><br>The next provision is new in our constitutional law. I will read it first and explain.<br><br>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government.<br><br>Fellow Members of this Commission, this is actually a product of our experience during martial law. As a matter of fact, it has some antecedents in the past, but the role of the judiciary during the deposed regime was marred considerably by the circumstance that in a number of cases against the government, which then had no legal defense at all, the solicitor general set up the defense of political question and got away with it. As a consequence, certain principles concerning particularly the writ of habeas corpus, that is, the authority of courts to order the release of political detainees, and other matters related to the operation and effect of martial law failed because the government set up the defense of political question. And the Supreme Court said: "Well, since it is political, we have no authority to pass upon it." The Committee on the Judiciary feels that this was not a proper solution of the questions involved. It did not merely request an encroachment upon the rights of the people, but it, in effect, encouraged further violations thereof during the martial law regime. x x x<br><div style="text-align: left;"><center><br>x x x x<br></center></div><br>Briefly stated, courts of justice determine the limits of power of the agencies and offices of the government as well as those of its officers. In other words, the judiciary is the final arbiter on the question whether or not a branch of government or any of its officials has acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, or so capriciously as to constitute an abuse of discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction or lack of jurisdiction. This is not only a judicial power but a duty to pass judgment on matters of this nature.<br><br>This is the background of paragraph 2 of Section 1, which means that the courts cannot hereafter evade the duty to settle matters of this nature, by claiming that such matters constitute a political question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Meanwhile that no specific procedural rule has been promulgated to enforce this "expanded" constitutional definition of judicial power and because of the commonality of "grave abuse of discretion" as a ground for review under Rule 65 and the courts expanded jurisdiction, the Supreme Court <i>based on its power to relax its rules</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> allowed Rule 65 to be used as the medium for petitions invoking the courts' expanded jurisdiction based on its power to relax its Rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> This is however an <i><i>ad hoc</i></i> approach that does not fully consider the accompanying implications, among them, that Rule 65 is an essentially distinct remedy that cannot simply be bodily lifted for application under the judicial power's expanded mode. The terms of Rule 65, too, are not fully aligned with what the Court's expanded jurisdiction signifies and requires.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On the basis of almost thirty years' experience with the courts' expanded jurisdiction, the Court should now fully recognize the attendant distinctions and should be aware that the continued use of Rule 65 on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as the operational remedy in implementing its expanded jurisdiction may, in the longer term, result in problems of uneven, misguided, or even incorrect application of the courts' expanded mandate.<br><br>The present case is a prime example of the misguided reading that may take place in constitutional litigation: the procedural issues raised apparently spring from the lack of proper understanding of what a petition for <i>certiorari</i> assails under the traditional and expanded modes, and the impact of these distinctions in complying with the procedural requirements for a valid petition.<br><br><b>2. <i>The Basic Distinctions</i></b><br><br><b><i>A.2.a. Actual Case or Controversy</i></b><br><br>Basic in the exercise of judicial power whether under the traditional or in the expanded setting - is the presence of an actual case or controversy. For a dispute to be justiciable, a legally demandable and enforceable right must exist as basis, and must be shown to have been violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Whether a case actually exists depends on the pleaded allegations, as affected by the elements of <b><i>standing (translated in civil actions as the status of being a "real-party-in-interest," in criminal actions as "offended party" and in special proceedings as "interested party"),</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> <b><i>ripeness,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> <b><i>prematurity,</i></b> and the <b><i>moot and academic principle</i></b> that likewise interact with one another. These elements and their interactions are discussed m greater detail below.<br><br>The Court's expanded jurisdiction - <b><i>itself an exercise of judicial power</i></b> - does not do away with the actual case or controversy requirement in presenting a constitutional issue, but effectively simplifies this requirement by merely requiring a <i>prima facie</i> showing of grave abuse of discretion in the assailed governmental act.<br><br><b><i>A.2.b. Actions Correctable by Certiorari</i></b><br><br>A basic feature of the expanded jurisdiction under the constitutional definition of judicial power, is the authority and command for the courts to act on petitions involving the commission by <i>any branch or instrumentality of government of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction</i>.<br><br>This command distinctly contrasts with the terms of Rule 65 which confines court <i>certiorari</i> action solely to the review of <i>judicial</i> and <i>quasi­-judicial</i> acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> These differing features create very basic distinctions that must necessarily result in differences in the application of remedies.<br><br>While actions by lower courts do not pose a significant problem because they are necessarily acting judicially when they adjudicate, a critical question comes up for the court acting on <i>certiorari</i> petitions when governmental agencies are involved - <b><i>under what capacity does the agency act?</i></b><br><br><i>This is a critical question as the circumstances of the present case show.</i> When the government entity acts quasi-judicially, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> challenging the action falls under Rule 65; in other instances, the petition must be filed based on the courts' expanded jurisdiction.<br><br><b><i>A.2.c. Grave Abuse of Discretion</i></b><br><br>Another distinction, a seeming one as explained below, relates to the cited ground of a <i>certiorari</i> petition under Rule 65 which speaks of <i>lack or excess of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction</i>, as against the remedy under the courts' expanded jurisdiction which expressly only mentions <i>grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction</i>.<br><br>This distinction is apparently not legally significant when it is considered that action outside of or in excess of the granted authority necessarily involves action with grave abuse of discretion: no discretion is allowed in areas outside of an agency's granted authority so that any such action would be a gravely abusive exercise of power. The constitutional grant of power, too, pointedly addresses grave abuse of discretion <i>when it amounts to lack or excess of jurisdiction</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> thus establishing that the presence of jurisdiction is the critical element; failure to comply with this requirement necessarily leads to the <i>certiorari</i> petition's immediate dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>As an added observation on a point that our jurisprudence has not fully explored, the result of the action by a governmental entity (<i>e.g.</i>, a law or an executive order) can be distinguished from the perspective of its legality as tested against the terms of the Constitution or of another law (where subordinate action like an executive order is involved), vis-a-vis the legality of the resulting action where grave abuse of discretion attended the governmental action or the exercise of the governmental function.<br><br>In the former, the conclusion may be plain illegality or legal error that characterized the law or exec order (as tested, for example, under the established rules of interpretation); no consideration is made of how the governmental entity exercised its function. In the latter case, on the other hand, it is the governmental entity's exercise of its function that is examined and adjudged independently of the result, with impact on the legality of the result of the gravely abusive action.<br><br>Where the dispute in a case relates to plain legal error, ordinary court action and traditional mode are called for and this must be filed in the lower courts based on rules of jurisdiction while observing the hierarchy of courts.<br><br>Where grave abuse of discretion is alleged to be involved, the expanded jurisdiction is brought into play based on the express wording of the Constitution and constitutional implications may be involved (such as grave abuse of discretion because of plain oppression or discrimination), but this must likewise be filed with the lowest court of concurrent jurisdiction, unless the court highest in the hierarchy grants exemption. Note that in the absence of express rules, it is only the highest court, the Supreme Court, that can only grant exemptions.<br><br>From these perspectives, the use of grave abuse of discretion can spell the difference in deciding whether a case filed <b>directly</b> with the Supreme Court has been properly filed.<br><br><b><i>A.2.d. Exhaustion of Available Remedies</i></b><br><br>A basic requirement under Rule 65 is that there be "<i>no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy found in law</i>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> which requirement the expanded jurisdiction provision does not expressly carry. Nevertheless, this requirement is not a significant distinction in using the remedy of <i>certiorari</i> under the traditional and the expanded modes. The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies applies to a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, regardless of the act of the administrative agency concerned, <i>i.e.</i>, whether the act concerns a quasi-judicial, or quasi-legislative function, or is purely regulatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Consider in this regard that once an administrative agency has been empowered by Congress to undertake a sovereign function, the agency should be allowed to perform its function to the full extent that the law grants. This full extent covers the authority of superior officers in the administrative agencies to correct the actions of subordinates, or for collegial bodies to reconsider their own decisions on a motion for reconsideration. Premature judicial intervention would interfere with this administrative mandate, leaving administrative action incomplete; if allowed, such premature judicial action through a writ of <i>certiorari</i>, would be a usurpation that violates the separation of powers principle that underlies our Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In every case, remedies within the agency's administrative process must be exhausted before external remedies can be applied. Thus, even if a governmental entity may have committed a grave abuse of discretion, litigants should, as a rule, first ask reconsideration from the body itself, or a review thereof before the agency concerned. This step ensures that by the time the grave abuse of discretion issue reaches the court, the administrative agency concerned would have fully exercised its jurisdiction and the court can focus its attention on the questions of law presented before it.<br><br>Additionally, <b><i>the failure to exhaust administrative remedies affects the ripeness to adjudicate the constitutionality of a governmental act, which in turn affects the existence of the need for an actual case or controversy for the courts to exercise their power of judicial review</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The need for ripeness - an aspect of the timing of a case or controversy does not change regardless of whether the issue of constitutionality reaches the Court through the traditional means, or through the Court's expanded jurisdiction. In fact, separately from ripeness, one other concept pertaining to judicial review is intrinsically connected to it; the concept of a case being moot and academic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Both these concepts relate to the timing of the presentation of a controversy before the Court ripeness relates to its prematurity, while mootness relates to a belated or unnecessary judgment on the issues. The Court cannot preempt the actions of the parties, and neither should it (as a rule) render judgment after the issue has already been resolved by or through external developments.<br><br>The importance of timing in the exercise of judicial review highlights and reinforces the need for an actual case or controversy an act that may violate a party's right. Without any completed action or a concrete threat of injury to the petitioning party, the act is not yet ripe for adjudication. It is merely a hypothetical problem. The challenged act must have been accomplished or performed by either branch or instrumentality of government before a court may come into the picture, and the petitioner must allege the existence of an immediate or threatened injury to itself as a result of the challenged action.<br><br>In these lights, a constitutional challenge, whether presented through the traditional route or through the Court's expanded jurisdiction, requires compliance with the ripeness requirement. In the case of administrative acts, ripeness manifests itself through compliance with the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.<br><br>In like manner, an issue that was once ripe for resolution but whose resolution, since then, has been rendered unnecessary, needs no resolution from the Court, as it presents no actual case or controversy and likewise merely presents a hypothetical problem. In simpler terms, a case is moot and academic when an event supervenes to render a judgment over the issues unnecessary and superfluous.<br><br>Without the element of ripeness or a showing that the presented issue is moot and academic, petitions challenging the constitutionality of a law or governmental act are vulnerable to dismissal.<br><br>Not to be forgotten is that jurisprudence also prohibits litigants from immediately seeking judicial relief without first exhausting the available administrative remedies for practical reasons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>From the perspective of practicality, immediate resort to the courts on issues that are within the competence of administrative agencies to resolve, would unnecessarily clog the courts' dockets. These issues, too, usually involve technical considerations that are within the agency's specific competence and which, for the courts, would require additional time and resources to study and consider.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Of course, the Supreme Court cannot really avoid the issues that a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, filed with the lower courts may present; the case may be bound ultimately to reach the Court, albeit as an appeal from the rulings of the lower courts.<br><br><b>3. <i>Situations Where a Petition for Certiorari May Be Used</i></b><br><br>There are two distinct situations where a writ of <i>certiorari</i> or prohibition may be sought. Each situation carries requirements, peculiar to the nature of each situation, that lead to distinctions that should be recognized in the use of <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 and under the courts' expanded jurisdiction.<br><br>The two situations differ in the type of questions raised. The first is the <b>constitutional situation</b> where the constitutionality of acts are questioned. The second is the <b>non-constitutional situation</b> where acts amounting to grave abuse of discretion are challenged without raising constitutional questions or violations.<br><br>The process of questioning the constitutionality of a governmental action provides a notable area of comparison between the use of <i>certiorari</i> in the traditional and the expanded modes.<br><br><b>Under the traditional mode</b>, plaintiffs question the constitutionality of a governmental action through the cases they file before the lower courts; the defendants may likewise do so when they interpose the defense of unconstitutionality of the law under which they are being sued. A petition for declaratory relief may also be used to question the constitutionality or application of a legislative (or quasi-legislative) act before the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>For quasi-judicial actions, on the other hand, <i>certiorari</i> is an available remedy, as acts or exercise of functions that violate the Constitution are necessarily committed with grave abuse of discretion for being acts undertaken outside the contemplation of the Constitution. Under both remedies, the petitioners should comply with the traditional requirements of judicial review, discussed below.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> In both cases, the decisions of these courts reach the Court through an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45.<br><br>In contrast, existing Court rulings in the <b>exercise of its expanded jurisdiction</b> have allowed the direct filing of petitions for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with the Court to question, for grave abuse of discretion, actions or the exercise of a function that violate the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The governmental action may be questioned regardless of whether it is quasi­-judicial, quasi-legislative, or administrative in nature. The Court's expanded jurisdiction does not do away with the actual case or controversy requirement for presenting a constitutional issue, but effectively simplifies this requirement by merely requiring a <i>prima facie</i> showing of grave abuse of discretion in the exercise of the governmental act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>To return to judicial review heretofore mentioned, in constitutional cases where the question of constitutionality of a governmental action is raised, the judicial power the courts exercise is likewise identified as the <b><i>power of judicial review</i></b> - the power to review the constitutionality of the actions of other branches of government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> As a rule, as required by the <b><i>hierarchy of courts principle</i></b>, these cases are filed with the lowest court with jurisdiction over the matter.

In particular, there must be an actual case or controversy and the compliance with requirements of standing, as affected by the hierarchy of courts, exhaustion of remedies, ripeness, prematurity, and the moot and academic principles.<br><br><b><i>A.3.a. The "Standing" Requirement</i></b><br><br>Under both situations, the party bringing suit must have the necessary "standing." This means that this party has, in its favor, the demandable and enforceable right or interest giving rise to a justiciable controversy after the right is violated by the offending party.<br><br>The necessity of a person's standing to sue derives from the very definition of judicial power. Judicial power includes the duty of the courts to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable. <i>Necessarily, the person availing of a judicial remedy must show that he possesses a legal interest or right to it, otherwise, the issue presented would be purely hypothetical and academic.</i> This concept has been translated into the requirement to have "standing" in judicial review,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> or to be considered as a "real-party-in-interest" in civil actions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> as the "offended party" in criminal actions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> and the "interested party" in special proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>While the Court follows these terms closely in both non-constitutional cases and constitutional cases under the traditional mode, it has relaxed the rule in constitutional cases harrdled under the expanded jurisdiction mode. in the latter case, a <i>prima facie</i> showing that the questioned governmental act violated the Constitution, effectively disputably shows an injury to the sovereign Filipino nation who approved the Constitution and endowed it with authority, such that the challenged act may be questioned by any Philippine citizen before the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In this manner, the "standing" requirement is relaxed compared with the standard of personal stake or injury that the traditional petition requires.<br><br>The relaxation of the standing requirement has likewise been achieved through the application of the "transcendental importance doctrine" under the traditional mode for constitutional cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (Under the traditional mode, "transcendental importance" not only relaxes the standing requirement, but also allows immediate access to this Court, thus exempting the petitioner from complying with the hierarchy of courts requirement.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>More importantly perhaps, the <i>prima facie</i> showing of grave abuse of discretion in constitutional cases also implies that the injury alleged is actual or imminent, and not merely hypothetical.<br><br>Through this approach, the Court's attention is directed towards the existence of an actual case or controversy - that is, whether the government indeed violated the Constitution to the detriment of the Filipino people without the distractions of determining the existence of transcendental importance indicators unrelated to the dispute and which do not at all determine whether the Court properly exercises its power of judicial review.<br><br>Parenthetically, in the traditional mode, the determination of the transcendental importance of the issue presented,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> aside from simply relaxing the standing requirement, may result in the dilution of the actual case or controversy element because of the inextricable link between standing and the existence of an actual case or controversy.<br><br>Consider, in this regard, that an actual case or controversy that calls for the exercise of judicial power necessarily requires that the party presenting it possesses the standing to mount a challenge to a governmental act.

At the lowest level of courts are the municipal and the regional trial courts which handle questions of fact and law at the first instance according to the jurisdiction granted to them by law.<br><br>Petitions for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition fall under the concurrent jurisdiction of the regional trial courts and the higher courts, all the way up to the Supreme Court.

While the relaxation may result in greater and closer supervision by the Court over the lower courts and quasi-judicial bodies under Rule 65, the effect may not always be salutary in the long term when it is considered that this may affect the constitutional standards for the exercise of judicial power, particularly the existence of an actual case or controversy.<br><br>The "transcendental importance" standard, in particular, is vague, open-ended and value-laden, and should be limited in its use to exemptions from the application of the hierarchy of courts principle. It should not carry any ripple effect on the constitutional requirement for the presence of an actual case or controversy.<br><br><b>4. <i>The petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition against the DOH Letter was filed before the wrong court.</i></b><br><br>In the present case, the act alleged to be unconstitutional refers to the cease and desist order that the DOH issued against GAMCA's referral decking system.

Thus, the Court held that the <b><i>nature of the act to be performed, rather than of the office, board, or body which performs it</i></b>, should determine whether or not an action is in the discharge of a judicial or a quasi-judicial function.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Generally, the exercise of judicial functions involves the determination of what the law is, and what the legal rights of parties are under this law with respect to a matter in controversy.

In particular, Section 4, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>Section 4. When and where petition filed.

The RTC thus <i>did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the petitions</i> and erred in giving due course to the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition against the DOH CDO letters. In procedural terms, petitions for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition against a government agency are remedies avaiJable to assail its quasi-judicial acts, and should thus have been filed before the CA.<br><br>The provision in Section 4, Rule 65 requiring that <i>certiorari</i> petitions challenging quasi-judicial acts to be filed with the CA is in full accord with Section 9 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> on the same point.

GAMCA then asked for the DOH Secretary's reconsideration, and subsequently appealed the DOH's unfavorable decision with the Office of the President. The OP then reversed Memorandum Order No. 2008-0210 and allowed the referral decking system to continue.<br><br>That GAMCA had earlier taken this course indicates that it was not unaware of the administrative remedies available to it; it simply opted to disregard the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies and the requirement that there be no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in law when it immediately filed its petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the RTC.<br><br>This blatant disregard of the Rule 65 requirements clearly places GAMCA's petition outside the exceptions that we recognized in the past in relaxing strict compliance with the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement.<br><br>Jurisprudence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> shows that this Court never hesitated in the past in relaxing the application of the rules of procedure to accommodate exceptional circumstances when their strict application would result in injustice.

At that point, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition should have been dismissed outright, for failing to comply with Section 1 and Section 4 of Rule 65. <i>When the court instead took cognizance of the petition, it acted on a matter outside its jurisdiction.</i><br><br>Consequently, the RTC's resulting judgment is void and carries no legal effect. The decision exempting GAMCA from the application of the referral decking system should equally have no legal effect.<br><br>Noncompliance with the Section 1, Rule 65 requirement that there be no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in law, on the other hand, is more than just a pro-forma requirement in the present case. Since the petitions for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition challenge a governmental act - <i>i.e.</i> action under the DOH CDO letters, as well as the validity of the instruments under which these letters were issued - compliance with Section 1, Rule 65 and the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies that judicial review requires is also mandatory. To recall a previous discussion, the exhaustion of administrative remedies is also an aspect of ripeness in deciding a constitutional issue.<br><br>Thus, GAMCA's disregard of the Rules of Court not only renders the petition dismissible for failure to first exhaust administrative remedies; the constitutional issues GAMCA posed before the RTC were not also ripe for adjudication.<br><br><b>5. <i>The Regional Trial Court erred in finding grave abuse of discretion on the part of the DOH's issuance of the DOH CDO letters.</i></b><br><br>On the merits, we find that the RTC of Pasay reversibly erred in law when it held that the DOH acted with grave abuse of discretion m prohibiting GAMCA from implementing the referral decking system.<br><br>In exempting GAMCA from the referral decking system that RA No. 10022 prohibits, the RTC of Pasay City noted that the regulation <i>per se</i> was not unconstitutional, but its application to GAMCA would violate the principle of sovereign equality and independence.<br><br>While we agree with the RTC's ultimate conclusion upholding the constitutionality of the prohibition against the referral decking system under RA No. 10022, our agreement proceeds from another reason; we disagree that the prohibition does not apply to GAMCA and with the consequent ruling nullifying the DOH's CDO Letter.<br><br><b><i>A.5.a. The prohibition against the referral decking system under Section 16, RA No. 10022, is a valid exercise of police power.</i></b><br><br>In its comment, GAMCA asserts that implementing the prohibition against the referral decking system would amount to an undue taking of property that violates Article II, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>It submits that the Securities and Exchange Commission had in fact approved its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws that embody the referral decking system; thus, the DOH cannot validly prohibit the implementation of this system.<br><br>GAMCA further claims that its members made substantial investments to upgrade their facilities and equipment. From this perspective, the August 23, 2010 order constitutes taking of property without due process of law as its implementation would deprive GAMCA members of their property.<br><br>AMCOW responded to these claims with the argument that the DOH CDO letters implementing RA No. 10022 are consistent with the State's exercise of the police power to prescribe regulations to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the people. Public interest justifies the State's interference in health matters, since the welfare of migrant workers is a legitimate public concern. The DOH thus merely performed its duty of upholding the migrant workers' freedom to consult their chosen clinics for the conduct of health examinations.<br><br>We agree with AMCOW.<br><br>The State's police power<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> is vast and plenary<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> and the operation of a business,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> especially one that is imbued with public interest (such as healthcare services),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> falls within the scope of governmental exercise of police power through regulation.<br><br>As defined, police power includes (1) the imposition of restraint on liberty or property, (2) in order to foster the common good.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> The exercise of police power involves the "state authority to enact legislation that may interfere with personal liberty or property in order to promote the general welfare."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>By its very nature, the exercise of the State's police power limits individual rights and liberties, and subjects them to the "far more overriding demands and requirements of the greater number."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Though vast and plenary, this State power also carries limitations, specifically, it may not be exercised arbitrarily or unreasonably.

The prohibition against the referral decking system is consistent with the State's exercise of the police power to prescribe regulations to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the people. Public interest demands State interference on health matters, since the welfare of migrant workers is a legitimate public concern.<br><br>We note that RA No. 10022 expressly reflects the declared State policies to "<i>uphold the dignity of its citizens whether in the country or overseas, in general, and Filipino migrant workers,</i>" <i>and to </i>"<i>afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all. Towards this end, the State shall provide adequate and timely social, economic and legal services to Filipino migrant workers</i>." The prohibition against the referral decking system in Section 16 of RA No. 10022 is an expression and implementation of these state policies.<br><br>The guarantee under Section 16 for OFWs to be given the option to choose a quality healthcare service provider as expressed in Section 16 (c)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> of RA No. 10022 is guaranteed by the prohibition against the decking practice and against monopoly practices in OFW health examinations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Section 16 likewise requires employers to accept health examinations from any DOH-accredited health facility; a refusal could lead to their temporary disqualification under pertinent rules to be formulated by the Philippine Overseas Employment Authority (POEA).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>These rules are part of the larger legal framework to ensure the Overseas Filipino Workers' (OFW) access to quality healthcare services, and to curb existing practices that limit their choices to specific clinics and facilities.<br><br>Separately from the Section 16 prohibition against the referral decking system, RA No. 10022 also prohibits and penalizes the imposition of a compulsory exclusive arrangement requiring OFWs to undergo health examinations only from specifically designated medical clinics, institutions, entities or persons. Section 5, in relation to Section 6 of RA No. 10022, penalizes compulsory, exclusive arrangements<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> by imprisonment and fine and by the automatic revocation of the participating medical clinic's license.<br><br>The DOH's role under this framework is to regulate the activities and operations of all clinics conducting health examinations on Filipino migrant workers as a requirement for their overseas employment. The DOH is tasked to ensure that:<br><blockquote>(c.3) No group or groups of medical clinics shall have a monopoly of exclusively conducting health examinations on migrant workers for certain receiving countries;<br><br>(c.4) Every Filipino migrant worker shall have the freedom to choose any of the DOH-accredited or DOH-operated clinics that will conduct his/her health examinations and that his or her rights as a patient are respected. The decking practice, which requires an overseas Filipino worker to go first to an office for registration and then farmed out to a medical clinic located elsewhere, shall not be allowed;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br></blockquote>While Section 16 of RA No. 10022 does not specifically define the consequences of violating the prohibition against the referral decking system, Republic Act No. 4226 (Hospital Licensure Act), which governs the licensure and regulation of hospitals and health facilities, authorizes the DOH to suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew the license of hospitals and clinics violating the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>These consequences cannot but apply to the violation of the prohibition against the referral decking system under RA No. 10022. If, under the law, the DOH can suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew the license of these hospitals upon the finding that they violated any provision of law (whether those found in RA No. 4226 or in RA No. 10022), it follows- as a necessarily included lesser power - that the DOH can likewise order these clinics and their association to cease and desist from practices that the law deems to be undesirable.<br><br><b><i>A.5.b. The DOH did not gravely abuse its discretion in issuing the assailed DOH CDO letters.</i></b><br><br>As discussed above, the letter-order implementing the prohibition against the referral decking system is quasi-judicial in nature. This characteristic requires that procedural due process be observed - that is, that the clinics concerned be given the opportunity to be heard before the standard found in the law can be applied to them.<br><br>Thus, prior to the issuance of the disputed CDO letter, the DOH should have given GAMCA the opportunity to be heard on whether the prohibition applies to it. Lest this opportunity to be heard be misunderstood, this DOH obligation raises an issue different from the question of whether Congress can, under the exercise of police power, prohibit the referral decking system; this latter issue lies outside the scope of the DOH to pass upon. The required hearing before the DOH relates solely to whether it properly implemented, based on the given standards under the law, the prohibition that Congress decreed under RA No. 10022.<br><br>Under normal circumstances, the issuance of a CDO without a prior hearing would violate GAMCA's procedural due process rights, and would amount to more than a legal error, <i>i.e.</i>, an error equivalent to action without jurisdiction. Rendering a decision quasi-judicial in nature without providing the opportunity to be heard amounts to a grave abuse of discretion that divests a quasi-judicial agency of its jurisdiction.<br><br>Factual circumstances unique to the present case, however, lead us to conclude that while it was an error of law for the DOH to issue a CDO without complying with the requirements of procedural due process, its action did not amount to a grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Grave abuse of discretion amounts to more than an error of law; it refers to an act that is so capricious, arbitrary, and whimsical that it amounts to a clear evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner because of passion or hostility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>Prior to the issuance of its CDO Letter, the DOH had more than sufficient basis to determine that GAMCA practices the prohibited referral decking system under RA No. 10022. Notably, the DOH had earlier allowed and recognized the referral decking system that GAMCA practiced through AO 5-01. This recognition was made with GAMCA's practice in mind. The subsequent administrative orders and department memorandum suspending and terminating the referral decking system, respectively, all pertain to the practice that the DOH had authorized under AO 5-01. Even the subject matter of these issuances do not just pertain to any other referral decking system, but to the "GAMCA referral decking system."<br><br>GAMCA likewise had more than several opportunities to contest the suspension and eventual revocation of the referral decking system initially pe1mitted under AO 5-01. Its appeal even reached the Office of the President, which overturned the DOH Memorandum Order terminating the referral decking system.<br><br>That the referral decking system had been subsequently prohibited by law shows the intent of Congress to prevent and prohibit the practice that GAMCA initiated and which the President had allowed. The President's duty under our political system is to implement the law; hence, when Congress subsequently prohibited the practice that GAMCA initiated, the Executive - including the President -has no choice but to implement it.<br><br>Based on these circumstances, while the DOH erred when it issued its CDO letters without first giving GAMCA the opportunity to prove whether the practice conducted by GAMCA is the same practice prohibited under RA No. 10022, the DOH conclusion to so act, in our view, did not constitute grave abuse of discretion that would have divested it of jurisdiction.<br><br>We note that the DOH had sufficient basis when it determined that the referral decking system prohibited under RA No. 10022 was the same decking system practiced by GAMCA. To reiterate, the referral decking system was not something new; it was an old system that GAMCA practiced and was known to all in its scope and operating details. That GAMCA had previously questioned the DOH prohibition and had been given ample opportunity to be heard when it filed an appeal before the OP, negate the conclusion that GAMCA had been aggrieved by precipitate and unfair DOH action.<br><br>To be sure, these factual circumstances do not make the CDO letter compliant with procedural due process. They mitigate, however, the error committed and render it less than the capricious, arbitrary, and patent refusal to comply with a positive legal duty that characterizes an act committed with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>The Court furthermore, in several instances,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> has recognized that an administrative agency may issue an <i>ex parte</i> cease and desist order, where vital public interests outweigh the need for procedural due process." In these instances, the Court noted that the affected establishment may contest the <i>ex parte</i> order, upon which the administrative agency concerned must conduct a hearing and allow the establishment to be heard. While jurisprudence has so far used the "vital public interests" standard to pollution cases, it had not been a grave abuse of discretion on the part of the DOH to consider that GAMCA's referral decking practice falls within this category. The DOH has long made the factual finding that the referral decking system hinders our Filipino seafarers' access to quality and affordable healthcare in its A.O. No. 106, series of 2002.<br><br>These circumstances further mitigate whatever legal error the DOH has committed and render the conclusion that grave abuse of discretion had taken place misplaced.<br><br>Since the writs of <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition do not issue against legal errors, but to acts of grave abuse of discretion, the RTC erred in issuing these writs against the DOH CDO letters.<br><br><b>6. <i>The prohibition against the referral decking system against GAMCA does not violate the principle of sovereign equality and independence.</i></b><br><br>The RTC based its decision to grant the writs of <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition against the DOH letter-order on the principle of sovereign equality and independence; applying the referral decking system prohibition against GAMCA violates this principle.<br><br>The RTC reasoned out that the prohibition against the referral decking system under Section 16 of RA No. 10022 must be interpreted to apply only to clinics conducting health examinations on migrant workers bound for countries that do not require the referral decking system for the issuance of visas to job applicants.<br><br>The RTC observed, too, that the refer al decking system is part of the application procedure in obtaining visas to enter the GCC States, a procedure made in the exercise of the sovereign power of the GCC States to protect their nationals from health hazards, and of their diplomatic power to regulate and screen entrants to their territories.<br><br>It also reasoned out that under the principle of sovereign equality and independence of States, the Philippines cannot interfere with this system and in fact must respect the visa-granting procedures of foreign states in the same way that they respect our immigration procedures. Moreover, to restrain GAMCA which is a mere adjunct of HMC (an agent of GCC States) is to restrain the GCC States themselves.<br><br>AMCOW contests the RTC's conclusion, arguing that the principles of sovereign equality and independence of States do not apply to the present case. According to AMCOW, the subject matter of this case pertains to a domestic concern as the law and the regulations that GAMCA assails relate to the operation of medical clinics in the Philippines.<br><br>It points out that the Philippines gave GAMCA and its members the privilege of conducting their businesses domestically; hence, their operations are governed by Philippine laws, specifically by RA No. 10022 which serves as one of the limitations on the privilege granted to them. GAMCA's right to engage in business should yield to the State's exercise of police power. In legal contemplation, therefore, the DOH CDO letters did not prejudice GAMCA's right to engage in business; nor did they hamper the GAMCA members' business operations.<br><br>AMCOW further insists that the August 23, 2010 and November 2, 2010 orders are consistent with the State's exercise of the police power to prescribe regulations to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the people. Public interest demands State interference on health matters, since the welfare of migrant workers is a legitimate public concern. The DOH thus merely performed its duty of upholding the migrant workers' freedom to choose any of its accredited or operated clinics that will conduct health examinations.<br><br>The DOH, for its part, adds that the implementation of RA No. 10022 cannot be defeated by agreements entered into by GAMCA with the GCC States. The GCC States, the DOH points out, are not empowered to determine the Philippines' courses of action with respect to the operation, within Philippine territory, of medical clinics; the conduct of health examinations; and the freedom of choice of Filipino migrant workers.<br><br>GAMCA responds to these arguments by asserting that the referral decking system is a part of the application procedure for obtaining visas to enter the GCC States. Hence, it is an exercise of the sovereign power of the GCC States to protect their nationals from health hazards, and their diplomatic power to regulate and screen entrants to their territories. To restrain an agent of the GCC States under the control and acting in accordance with the direction of these GCC States, restrains the GCC States.<br><br>GAMCA also points out that the OFWs would suffer grave and irreparable damage and injury if the DOH CDO letters would be implemented as the GCC States would not issue working visas without the GAMCA seal attesting that the OFWs had been medically examined by GAMCA member clinics.<br><br>After considering all these arguments, we find that the RTC's decision misapplied the principle of sovereign independence and equality to the present case. While the principles of sovereign independence and equality have been recognized in Philippine jurisprudence, our recogmtmn of this principle does not extend to the exemption of States and their affiliates from compliance with Philippine regulatory laws.<br><br><b><i>A.6. The principle of sovereign equality and independence of states does not exempt GAMCAfrom the referral decking system prohibition under RA No. 10022.</i></b><br><br>In <i>Republic of Indonesia v. Vinzon</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> we recognized the principle of sovereign independence and equality as part of the law of the land. We used this principle to justify the recognition of the principle of sovereign immunity which exempts the State - both our Government and foreign governments - from suit. We held:<br><blockquote>International law is founded largely upon the principles of reciprocity, comity, independence, and equality of States which were adopted as part of the law of our land under Article II, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution. The rule that a State may not be sued without its consent is a necessary consequence of the principles of independence and equality of States. As enunciated in <i>Sanders v. Veridiano II</i>, the practical justification for the doctrine of sovereign immunity is that there can be no legal right against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends. In the case of foreign States, the rule is derived from the principle of the sovereign equality of States, as expressed in the maxim <i>par in parem non habet imperium</i>. All states are sovereign equals and cannot assert jurisdiction over one another. A contrary attitude would "unduly vex the peace of nations."<br></blockquote>Our recognition of sovereign immunity, however, has never been unqualified. While we recognized the principles of independence and equality of States to justify a State's sovereign immunity from suit, we also restricted state immunity to acts <i>jus imperii</i>, or public acts. We said that once a State enters into commercial transactions (<i>jus gestionis</i>), then it descends to the level of a private individual, and is thus not immune from the resulting liability and consequences of its actions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>By this recognition, we acknowledge that a foreign government acting in its <i>jus imperii</i> function cannot be held liable in a Philippine court. Philippine courts, as part of the Philippine government, cannot and should not take jurisdiction over cases involving the public acts of a foreign government. Taking jurisdiction would amount to authority over a foreign government, and would thus violate the principle of sovereign independence and equality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>This recognition is altogether different from exempting governments whose agents are in the Philippines from complying with our domestic laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> We have yet to declare in a case that the principle of sovereign independence and equality exempts agents of foreign governments from compliance with the application of Philippine domestic law.<br><br>In the present case, GAMCA has not adduced any evidence in the court below, nor has it presented any argument before us showing that the principle of sovereign equality and independence has developed into an international custom shielding state agents from compliance with another state's domestic laws. Under this situation, the Court is in no position to determine whether the practice that GAMCA alleges has indeed crystallized into an international custom.<br><br>GAMCA has never proven in this case, too, that the GCC has extended its sovereign immunity to GAMCA. Sovereign immunity belongs to the State, and it must first be extended to its agents before the latter may be considered to possess sovereign immunity.<br><br>Significantly, the Court has even adopted a restrictive approach in recognizing state immunity, by distinguishing between a State's jus imperii and <i>jus gestionis</i>. It is only when a State acts in its <i>jus imperii</i> function that we recognize state immunity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br><br>We point out furthermore that the prohibition against the referral decking system applies to hospitals and clinics, as well as to OFW employers, and does not seek to interfere with the GCC's visa requirement processes. RA 10022 prohibits hospitals and clinics in the Philippines from practicing the referral decking system, and employers from requiring OFWs to procure their medical examinations from hospitals and clinics practicing the referral decking system.<br><br>The regulation applies to Philippine hospitals and clinics, as well as to employers of OFWs. It does not apply to the GCCs and their visa processes. That the regulation could affect the OFWs' compliance with the visa requirements imposed by GCCs does not place it outside the regulatory powers of the Philippine government.<br><br>In the same manner, GCC states continue to possess the prerogative to apply their visa requirements to any foreign national, including our OFWs, who seeks to enter their territory; they may refuse to grant them entry for failure to comply with the referral decking system, or they may adjust to the prohibition against the referral decking system that we have imposed. These prerogatives lie with the GCC member-states and do not affect at all the legality of the prohibition against the referral decking system.<br><br>Lastly, the effect of the prohibition against the referral decking system is beyond the authority of this Court to consider. The wisdom of this prohibition has been decided by Congress, through the enactment of RA No. 10022. Our role in this case is merely to determine whether our government has the authority to enact the law's prohibition against the referral decking system, and whether this prohibition is being implemented legally. Beyond these lies the realm of policy that, under our Constitution's separation of powers, this Court cannot cross.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in the light of these considerations, we hereby <b>GRANT</b> the petitions.

The Court has merely been using "determinants" of transcendental importance in place of a clear definition of the term. These "determinants" include:<br><br>(1) the character of the funds or other assets involved in the case; (2) the presence of a clear case of disregard of a constitutional or statutory prohibition by the public respondent agency or instrumentality of the government; and (3) the lack of any other party with a more direct and specific interest in raising the questions being raised. <i>Senate of the Philippines v.

The determinant, however, is too vague and does not require that the disregard relate to the issues raised in the petition.<br><br>The standing requirement may seem innocuous at first glance, but it is inextricably linked to the presence of an actual case or controversy so that it should not be relaxed on grounds that are outside of the issues presented before the Court. By relaxing the standing requirement, we also relax the case or controversy requirement. Without a showing of direct injury on the part of the petitioner, his legal right in the dispute is also questionable. How could there be a legal right subject of a dispute, when the party putting it forward failed to show that he has been injured, or is about to be injured by the governmental act? When we use determinants outside of and irrelevant to the existence of an actual case or controversy, we run the risk of deciding cases that may not have a justiciable issue to begin with, and thus go outside the bounds of judicial review.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> <i>Supra</i> note 55.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> <i>Kilosbayan, Inc. v.

Note at this point that an actual case or controversy is present when the issues the case poses are ripe for adjudication, that is, when the act being challenged has had a direct adverse effect on the individual challenging it. Standing, on the other hand, requires a personal and substantial interest manifested through a direct injury that the petitioner has or will sustain as a result of the questioned act.<br><br>Thus, when the standing is relaxed because of the transcendental importance doctrine, the character of the injury presented to fulfill the actual case or controversy requirements likewise tempered.<br><br>When we, for instance, say that the petitioners have no standing as citizens or as taxpayers but we nevertheless give the petition due course, we indirectly acknowledge that the injury that they had or will sustain is not personally directed towards them, but to the more general and abstract Filipino public.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> See, for example, Justice Arturo D.

In these reversals, we significantly noted the paramount importance of resolving the case on appeal and, on this basis, relaxed the requirements of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed in the lower court.<br><br>This kind of approach, to my mind, leads to an absurd situation where we effectively hold that the CA committed an error of law when it applied the rules as provided in the Rules of Court.<br><br>To be sure, when we so act, we send mixed and confusing signals to the lower courts, which cannot be expected to know when a <i>certiorari</i> petition may or should be allowed despite being the improper remedy.<br><br>Additionally, this kind of approach reflects badly on the Court as an institution, as it applies the highly arbitrary standard of 'paramount importance' in place of what is written in the Rules. A suspicious mind may even attribute malicious motives when the Court invokes a highly subjective standard such as "paramount importance."<br><br>The public, no less, is left confused by the Court's uneven approach.

A becoming regard for that judicial hierarchy most certainly indicates that petitions for the issuance of extraordinary writs against first level ("inferior") courts should be filed with the Regional Trial Court, and those against the latter, with the Court of Appeals. <b>A direct invocation of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction to issue these writs should be allowed only when there are special and important reasons therefor, clearly and specifically set out in the petition.</b> This is [an] established policy.

Thus, in the very opening paragraph of the discussion of the Regional Trial Court in question:<br><blockquote>The present Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition seeks: a) the issuance of a writ of prohibition to enjoin and prohibit respondent Secretary from enforcing and implementing Department of Health (DOH) Order dated August 23, 2010 on the ground that it was issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and b) the declaration of Paragraphs c.3 and c.4, Section 16, of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 10022 and Section 1(c) and 1(d), Rule XI of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) as unconstitutional for being contrary to the generally accepted principles of international law, i.e., the principle of sovereign equality and independence of states.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br></blockquote>The dispositive portion of the Regional Trial Court's questioned Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby granted. Accordingly, the writ of CERTIORARI is hereby issued declaring null and void ab initio the August 23, 2010 Order and November 2, 2010 reiterating Order of the respondent DOH secretary. <u>A writ of Prohibition is likewise issued directing the respondent DOH Secretary and all persons acting on his behalf to cease and desist from implementing the assailed Orders against the petitioners.</u> The August 1, 2011 writ of preliminary injunction is hereby made permanent. Civil Case No. 04-0670 is hereby dismissed for being moot and academic.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Section 21 of Batas PambansaNo. 129 provides:<br><blockquote>Section 21. <i>Original jurisdiction in other cases</i>. - Regional Trial Courts <u>shall exercise original jurisdiction</u>:<br><br>(1) In the issuance <u>of writs of certiorari, prohibition</u>, mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus and injunction <u>which may be enforced in any part of their respective regions[.]</u> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The Regional Trial Court of Pasay had jurisdiction over the remedies invoked, which were petitions for a writ of certiorari and a writ of prohibition. However, it did not have jurisdiction to enjoin to issue the writs for its intended scope.<br><br>The Order of the Department of Health dated August 23, 2010<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and its reiterative Order dated November 2, 2010<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> was nationwide in its scope. After all, the Department of Health is a nationwide agency. The respondent GCC Approved Medical Centers Association, Inc. did not clearly and convincingly show that all its members were located only within the territorial jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City.<br><br>For these reasons alone, the decision of the court <i>a quo</i> is null and void for having been issued without jurisdiction. Thus, the Petitions should be granted.<br><br><center><b>II.</b><br></center><br>In my view, it is not necessary to bifurcate the Special Civil Action for certiorari into a "traditional" track and an "expanded" mode. The present rules are already sufficient for this Court to exercise its fundamental power of judicial review described in part in Article VIII, Section 1.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Neither would it be correct to limit any of our certiorari powers, even on an "expanded" basis, to questions, which only raise constitutional issues. An act of any government branch, agency, or instrumentality that violates a statute or a treaty is grave abuse of discretion. The Constitution does not distinguish the cause for grave abuse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Neither should this Court, unless, in the guise of promulgating rules of procedure, we wish to effect an amendment of the Constitution.<br><br>Finally, I express my reservations relating to the absolute necessity for a decision of this Court before any other organ of government can act on its rational belief in the bending nature of any customary international norms or a general principle of international law. Our constitutional adherence to international law is by virtue of incorporation through Article II, Section 2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> or Article VII, Section 21 of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Judicial action is not required for these norms to be binding. Neither of these modes of incorporation require it.<br><br><center><b>III.</b><br></center><br>Fundamental to constitutional litigation is the assurance that judicial review should only happen when there is an actual case or controversy. That is, the judiciary is not an advisory body to the President, Congress, or any other branch, instrumentality, or agency of the government. Thus, absent any actual or sufficiently imminent breach, which will cause an injury to a fundamental right, a provision of law or an administrative regulation cannot be challenged. This Court is co-equal with the other branches of government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The Constitution is a legible, written document capable of being read by all. Its ambiguity may only be clarified through judicial review when it becomes apparent through the existence of an actual situation. The mere existence of subordinate norms - in the form of a statue, treaty or administrative rule - is not enough. There has to be parties who tend to be directly and substantially injured under a specific concrete set of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The confusion with certiorari in my view, is brought about by instances in the recent past where actions, which should have been considered as ones for declaratory relief, were acted upon by this Court as if they were certiorari actions. For example, in <i>James M. Imbong, et al. v. Hon. Paquito N. Ochoa, Jr., et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> or the Reproductive Health (RH) cases, this Court took cognizance of the Petitions even if there were still no Implementing Rules, no doctor or health practitioner threatened with sanctions, no couple or spouse whose prerogatives were to be curtailed. In my dissent, I pointed to the dangers of speculative arguments, mainly, that our imagination substituted for actual facts. Imagination took precedence over actual controversy.<br><br>The same with the case of <i>Jose Jesus M. Disini, et al. v. The Secretary of Justice, et al</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In that case, there was no cybercrime committed. There was no cybercrime threatened to be committed, no social media part removed, no advertising in cyberspace prohibited. Again, although denominated as certiorari actions, the petitions were in actuality actions for declaratory relief.<br><br>Petitions for certiorari as provided in Rule 65 are available only to correct acts done in a judicial or quasi-judicial procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> This ensures that the power of judicial review can only be exercised when there is an actual controversy. No judicial action can happen without interested parties, who suffer injury and therefore ready to plead the facts that give actual rise to their real injury. This is the same with quasi-judicial actions.<br><br>Ministerial or administrative actions, which will cause or threaten to cause injury can be corrected through a <u>Writ of Prohibition</u>, not a <u>Writ of Certiorari</u>. In both cases, the requirement of the absence of a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law conforms with the deferential nature of judicial review in constitutional cases. The requirement in both cases that there be a clear finding of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction is sufficient to meet the scope of all our powers of judicial review.<br><br>The suggestion to expand the present rules on Petitions for Certiorari opens a very dangerous road towards changing our place in the Constitutional order. It will transform this Court to a virtual overload that will review legislative and executive acts, even without the presence of an actual controversy, simply because in our collective and subjective view, there may be some amorphous and undefined but gut feeling transcendental interest involved.<br><br>It is in this respect that I wage this Court to tread with an abundance of all caution even as I respect the erudite observations of Justice Arturo Brion. This Court must clothe itself with humility as it reviews its past cases in the light of a full understanding of our constitutional role if and when we do exercise our power to amend the rules.<br><br>In my view, discussions are thus premature.<br><br><center><b>IV.</b><br></center><br>In <i>Restituto Ynot v. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> this Court called a trial court to task when it hesitated to decide on the constitutionality of an Executive Order in the presence of a clearly pleaded actual case. After all, the plain text of Article VIII, Section 5 (2) (a) states:<br><blockquote>Section 5. The Supreme Court shall have the following powers:<br><br>....<br><br>(2) <u>Review, revise, reverse, modify or affirm</u> an appeal or certiorari, as the law or the Rules of Court may provide, final judgments and orders of lower courts in:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) All cases in which the constitutionality or the validity of any treaty, international or executive agreement, law, presidential decree, proclamation, order instruction, ordinance, or regulation is in question. (Emphasis provided)<br></div></blockquote>To limit constitutional questions only for the determination of this Court at first instance and even in its "expanded" mode is not consistent with this provision. It may also be inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2 of the Constitution:<br><blockquote>Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to define, prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction of various courts but may not deprive the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction over cases enumerated in Section 5 hereof.<br></blockquote>As earlier pointed out, Section 21 of Batas Pambansa Bilang 129 grants jurisdiction to the Regional Trial Court in Petitions for Certiorari and Prohibition. The only qualification is that the writs "... may be enforced in any part of their respective jurisdictions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>For this Court to reduce this jurisdiction further is to amend Batas Pambansa Bilang 129, therefore breaching our solemn commitment to a Constitution that removes from us the power to prescribe jurisdiction.<br><br><center><b>V.</b><br></center><br>I join Justice Lucas Bersamin's observations that the issuance of a Cease and Desist Order does not per se mean that the actions taken by the Department of Health is quasi-judicial in nature. In my view, the executive department in applying and implementing the law does not only do so by mere advice or persuasion to those who do not follow its provisions. The executive is not without its own set of legally mandated coercive powers short of any kind of adjudication. The issuance of an order to cease and desist in the Petitioners' continuing violation of the law is one of them. The type of cease and order in the case was therefore an administrative act. If at all, the proper action to question its constitutionality is a Petition for a Writ of Prohibition not a Writ of Certiorari.
