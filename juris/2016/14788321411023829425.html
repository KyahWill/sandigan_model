This means that an employer is no longer obliged to keep the employee in the actual service or in the payroll. The employee, in tum, is not required to return the wages that he had received prior to the reversal of the LA's decision. <b>Notwithstanding the reversal of the finding of illegal dismissal, an employer, who, despite the LA's order of reinstatement, did not reinstate the employee during the pendency of the appeal up to the reversal by a higher tribunal <u>may still be held liable for the accrued wages of the employee, <i>i.e.</i>, the unpaid salary accruing up to the time of the reversal</u>.</b> By way of <u>exception</u>, an employee may be barred from collecting the accrued wages if shown that the delay in enforcing the reinstatement pending appeal was without fault on the part of the employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioners contend that that they should not be faulted for failing to enforce the December 8, 2010 Decision of LA Amansec which had given respondent the option to receive separation pay in lieu of reinstatement for the reason that it was respondent who failed to choose either relief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> However, as above-discussed, the reinstatement aspect of the LA's Decision is immediately executory and, hence, the active duty to reinstate the employee - either actually or in payroll - devolves upon no other than the employer, even pending appeal. In <i>Pfizer, Inc. v. Velasco</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (<i>Pfizer, Inc.</i>), the Court chastised the employer therein as it "did not immediately admit [the employee] back to work which, according to the law, <b>should have been done as soon as an order or award of reinstatement is handed down by the Labor Arbiter</b> x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Meanwhile, the Court, in <i>Bergonio, Jr., v. South East Asian Airlines</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> remarked that "an order of reinstatement issued by the LA is self-executory, <i>i.e.</i>, the dismissed employee need not even apply for and <b>the LA need not even issue a writ of execution to trigger the employer's duty to reinstate the dismissed employee</b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Thus, while herein respondent may have been given an alternative option to instead receive separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, there is no denying that, based on the provisions of the Labor Code and as attributed in jurisprudence, it is his employer who should have first discharged its duty to reinstate him.<br><br>In any event, petitioners have no one else to blame but themselves for misconstruing LA Amansec's December 8, 2010 Decision, despite its straightforward language of primarily directing MDC, as employer, to reinstate respondent:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby made finding the complainant to have been illegally dismissed from employment. Concomitantly, the respondent school is hereby ordered to reinstate him as faculty member under the same terms and conditions of his employment, without loss of seniority rights but without backwages. However, instead of being reinstated, the complainant is hereby given the option to receive a separation pay equivalent to his full month's pay for every year of service, a fraction of at least six months to be considered a full year or the amount of P100,000.00 (his monthly salary of P20,000.00 multiplied by the equivalent of five years' service[)].<br><br>Other claims are dismissed for lack of merit. <br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>Clearly, the statement of such directive is only secondarily followed by the alternative option given to respondent. This is consistent with the above-stated conclusion that the duty to reinstate is initiated by, as it only devolves upon, the employer from the time the LA renders its Decision directing reinstatement.<br><br>Therefore, the Court cannot subscribe to the theory postulated by petitioners that the aforementioned LA Decision took out from their hands the duty to reinstate respondent, for to do so would be to frustrate the immediate and self-executory nature of the reinstatement aspect of the LA's Decision as provided by law. To emphasize, to the point of repetition, petitioners were duty-bound to reinstate respondent either by admitting him back to work under the same terms and conditions prevailing prior to his dismissal, or by merely reinstating him in the payroll, which alternative options must be exercised in good faith;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> otherwise, they are bound to pay his accrued salaries.<br><br>The Court is not unaware of the peculiarity attending educational institutions where the engagement of faculty members and the assignment of teaching loads are done at the commencement of each semester.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> In the early case of the <i>University of Santo Tomas v. NLRC (UST)</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the Court, while pronouncing that the dismissed faculty members must be actually reinstated during the pendency of the labor dispute between the faculty union and the University, took into account the fact that the return-to-work order was given in the middle of the first semester of the academic year, and that any change of faculty members at such time would adversely affect and prejudice the students. Consequently, the&nbsp; Court ordered that actual reinstatement take effect at the start of the second semester, and adjudged the faculty members as entitled to full wages, backwages and other benefits prior to reinstatement to their actual teaching loads.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>In this case, while petitioners could not actually reinstate respondent at the time of the issuance of LA Amansec's December 8, 2010 Decision, following the ruling in the aforementioned case of <i>UST</i>, as it would be impracticable and detrimental to the students to change teachers in the middle of the semester, petitioners should nonetheless have given respondent his new teaching load assignments and schedules at the beginning of the succeeding semester, whether or not respondent was present during such assignment. After all, it can be gleaned from the arguments presented by petitioners that the presence of respondent during the assignment of teaching loads and schedules is merely for conferment regarding availability and preference,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> and petitioners could always require respondent to report for work on the pre-assigned schedules. Had petitioners done so despite the absence of respondent, it would have indicated their sincere willingness to comply with the reinstatement order. But they did not. There was even no proof that petitioners required respondent to report for assignment of teaching load and schedules. Besides, respondent's alleged failure to secure teaching load assignments did not prevent petitioners from simply reinstating him in the payroll as an alternative. Sadly, petitioners also failed to employ the same.<br><br>Finally, the Court deems inconsequential petitioners' submissions that respondent had claimed separation pay during the execution proceedings at the NLRC level and had also alleged strained relations (and therefore, intimated separation pay) in his pleadings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The Court had previously ruled in <i>Pfizer, Inc.</i> that the circumstance that the employee opted for separation pay in lieu of reinstatement as manifested in her counsel's letter had no legal effect, <b>not only because there was no genuine compliance by the employer of the reinstatement order but also because the employer chose not to act on said claim</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The same observations are made in this case. As aptly pointed out by the CA, there was "apparent apathy"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> on the part of petitioners towards the reinstatement order issued by LA Amansec during the pendency of their appeal therefrom. Hence, for failure of the petitioners to comply with said order, the CA correctly declared respondent to be entitled to the payment of his accrued salaries during the period of the appeal until the reversal of the December 8, 2010 Decision of LA Amansec. The NLRC's Decision dated December 26, 2012, which deleted the said award on the notion that the same had no more basis in view of the eventual ruling declaring respondent's dismissal to be legal, failed to take into account the provisions of the Labor Code and existing jurisprudence on the immediately executory nature of reinstatement, as well as the consequences of non-compliance. Palpably, this smacks of grave abuse of discretion as properly found by the CA. As jurisprudence conveys, there is "grave abuse of discretion x x x when a lower court or tribunal patently violates x x x the law or existing jurisprudence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
