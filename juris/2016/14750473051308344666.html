However, he died in 1991 without transferring the titles to Hernandez's name.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> At that time, Hernandez was already residing in the United States<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and was not aware of the non-registration of the lots. Due to old age, she has also not come back to the Philippines for a long time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Sometime in 2002, Hernandez and her family were surprised to receive a letter from one Atty.

PSB registered Lot 6 on November 9, 2001<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and TCT No. T-518364 was issued in its name.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Metrobank also registered Lot 8 on May 6, 2003<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[17]</sup></font> and TCT No. T-550116 was issued in its name.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[18]</sup></font><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;On January 18, 2002, PSB filed a petition for the issuance of writ of possession, docketed as LRC Case No. B-3071, before the RTC of Hainan, Laguna, Branch 24.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; The RTC granted the writ in an Order dated December 22, 2002.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br>&nbsp;<br>Meanwhile, Hernandez filed a Complaint for Cancellation of Transfer Certificates of Title, which was raffled to the same RTC, Branch 24.

Consequently, a Notice to Vacate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>dated August 9, 2005 was also issued. Both the Writ of Possession and the Notice to Vacate were addressed to Mendoza. Although&nbsp; Metrobank&nbsp; was&nbsp; not&nbsp; originally&nbsp; impleaded&nbsp; in&nbsp; Hernandez's&nbsp; Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, it was later included as party respondent in the Compliance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated October 2, 2008.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;The RTC's Rulin;<br>&nbsp;<br>The RTC denied Hernandez's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order or Preliminary Injunction in an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated November 30, 2004, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote><i>WHEREFORE,</i> premises considered, the petition for issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and/or injunction, for lack of merit is DENIED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> <br></blockquote>The RTC ruled that the allegation of fraudulent registration of the titles in the names of Ocampo and Mendoza were evidentiary in nature and thus, must be proven through trial on the merits. It pointed out that PSB relied on the title of the property mortgaged, which was clean and free from any annotation, encumbrance, lien or any adverse claim. The RTC also agreed that the issuance of writ of possession is ministerial to the court after the lapse of one year to redeem the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Hernandez filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but it was also denied by the RTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> She thereafter filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court with the CA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><div align="center"><b>The Court of Appeals' Ruling</b><br></div><br>The CA dismissed the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> in the now assailed Decision dated September 24, 2007, the relevant dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>In sum, We find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the court a quo in denying the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.<br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition for certiorari is hereby <b>DISMISSED.</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote>The CA ruled that Hernandez was not able to prove a clear and unmistakeable right, which is one of the requisites for the issuance of an injunction. Thus:<br><blockquote>&nbsp;xxx Since the issue of ownership is the crux in this case, as there were transfer certificates of title in the name of Ocampo and Mendoza while on the other hand the adverse possession as owners are alleged to be exercised by petitioner, there is no unmistakable right yet on the part of petitioner. As she still has to prove that she is the owner, it cannot be said that she has an existing right as the owner and is entitled to the writ of injunction, x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA found the TCTs in the names of Ocampo and Mendoza to be superior documents over Hernandez's Deed of Sale executed with An.<br><br>Absent a finding that the TCTs were fraudulently obtained by Ocampo and Mendoza, the right of Hernandez cannot be considered yet as clear and unmistakable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br>&nbsp;<br>The CA also held that while petitioner is correct that there are exceptions to the rule that a writ of possession is ministerial, it cannot nullify the RTC's denial of the writ. The CA pointed out that the principle of non¬interference between concurrent and coordinate courts applies in this case since the petition for issuance of preliminary injunction was filed in the same court that issued the writs of possession in two distinct and separate cases. The CA held:<br><blockquote>xxx [T]he propriety of the writ of possession cannot be questioned by praying for a preliminary injunction in a case for annulment of the TCTs. And if the TCTs were issued in a judicial proceeding, it can neither be nullified by a co-equal body. The better remedy of petitioner is to directly question the writ of possession and to ask for its nullification with the proper court, xxx<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote>Hernandez filed a Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> dated November 20, 2007,&nbsp; which was denied by the CA in its Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> dated January 14, 2008. Hence, this petition.<br><br>The sole issue presented is whether Hernandez is entitled to the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. Hernandez argues that she is not questioning the propriety of the issuance of the writs of possession against Ocampo and Mendoza. She insists that the writs of possession cannot be enforced against her because she was not privy to the foreclosure proceedings; otherwise, her right to due process of law will be violated. Hernandez claims that the writs of possession addressed to specific persons cannot be enforced against her, who is in actual possession of the property, and who has filed a case of annulment of titles based on a right independent of and adverse to the right of those to whom the writs were directed. She cites the settled rule that the issuance of a writ of possession in favor of the purchaser in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale ceases to be ministerial once it appears that there is a third party in possession of the property who is claiming a right adverse to that of the mortgagor.<br><br>Both the respondent banks argue that a preliminary injunction is not the proper remedy because the issuance and enforcement of the writs of possession are ministerial duties of the court. They also argue that the legal requisites that have to be complied with in issuing an injunctive writ were not met since Hernandez does not have any clear and positive right over the properties.<br><br><div align="center"><b>Our Ruling<br></b></div><blockquote>The petition is unmeritorious.<br></blockquote><i>The writs of possession can be<br>issued and implemented.</i><br><br>A writ of possession is generally understood to be an order whereby the sheriff is commanded to place a person in possession of a real or personal property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> It may be issued in: (1) land registration proceedings under Section 17 of Act No. 496;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (2) judicial foreclosure, provided the debtor is in possession of the mortgaged realty and no third person, not a party to the foreclosure suit, had intervened; (3) extrajudicial foreclosure of a real estate mortgage under Section 7 of Act No. 3135,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> as amended by Act No. 4118; and (4) execution sales.<br><br>In cases of extrajudicial foreclosure sales of real estate mortgage under Section 7<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> of Act No. 3135, as amended, the purchaser or the mortgagee who is also the purchaser in the foreclosure sale may apply for a writ of possession either: (1) within the one-year redemption period, upon the filing of a bond; or (2) after the lapse of the redemption period, without need of a bond.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> In <i>Nagtalon v. United Coconut Planters Bank</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>, we explained these two instances when a purchaser can apply for a writ of possession:<br><blockquote>During the one-year redemption period, as contemplated by Section 7 of the above-mentioned law, a purchaser may apply for a writ of possession by filing an <i>ex parte </i>motion under oath in the registration or cadastral proceedings if the property is registered, or in special proceedings in case the property is registered under the Mortgage Law. In this case, a bond is required before the court may issue a writ of possession.<br><br>On the other hand, upon the lapse of the redemption period, a writ of possession may be issued in favor of the purchaser in a foreclosure sale, also upon a proper ex parte motion. This time, no bond is necessary for its issuance; the mortgagor is now considered to have lost any interest over the foreclosed property. The purchaser then becomes the owner of the foreclosed property, and he can demand possession at any time following the consolidation of ownership of the property and the issuance of the corresponding TCT in his/her name. It is at this point that the right of possession of the purchaser can be considered to have ripened into the absolute right of a confirmed owner. The issuance of the writ, upon proper application, is a ministerial function that effectively forbids the exercise by the court of any discretion. This second scenario is governed by Section 6 of Act 3135, in relation to Section 35, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>We have consistently held that the duty of the trial court to grant a writ of possession to a purchaser in a public auction is a ministerial function of the court, which cannot be enjoined or restrained, even by the filing of a civil case for the declaration of nullity of the foreclosure and consequent auction sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Moreover, any question regarding the regularity and validity of the sale, as well as the consequent cancellation of the writ, is to be determined in a subsequent proceeding as outlined in Section 8 of Act No. 3135. Such question cannot be raised to oppose the issuance of the writ, since the proceeding is <i>ex parte.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>However, this rule admits of an exception.<br><br>The provision of Section 33 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court relative to an execution sale applies to extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgages by virtue of Section 6 of Act No. 3135, as amended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Section 33, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><blockquote>Section 33. <i>Deed and possession to be given at expiration of redemption period; </i>by whom executed or given. - If no redemption be made within one (1) year from the date of the registration of the certificate of sale, the purchaser is entitled to a conveyance and possession of the property; or, if so redeemed whenever sixty (60) days have elapsed and no other redemption has been made, and notice thereof given, and the time for redemption has expired, the last redemptioner is entitled to the conveyance and possession; but in all cases the judgment obligor shall have the entire period of one (1) year from the date of registration of the sale to redeem the property. The deed shall be executed by the officer making the sale or his successor in office and in the latter case shall have the same validity as though the officer making the sale had continued in office and executed it.<br><br>Upon the expiration of the right of redemption, the purchaser or redemptioner shall be substituted to and acquire all the rights, title, interest and claim of the judgment obligor to the property as of the time of the levy. <b>The possession of the property shall be given to the purchaser or last redemptioner by the same officer unless a third party is actually holding the property adversely to the judgment obligor.</b> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>From the foregoing, upon the expiration of the right of redemption, the purchaser or redemptioner shall be substituted to and acquire all the rights, title, interest and claim of the judgment debtor to the property, and its possession shall be given to the purchaser or last redemptioner. It is but logical that Section 33, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court be applied also to cases involving extrajudicially foreclosed properties that were bought by a purchaser and later sold to third-party-purchasers after the lapse of the redemption period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The possession of the property, however, will not be given to either the purchaser, redemptioner or third-party-purchaser when a third party is actually holding the property adversely to the judgment debtor. In which case, the issuance of the writ of possession ceases to be <i>ex-parte </i>and non-adversarial.<br><br>Thus, where the property levied upon on execution is occupied by a party other than a judgment debtor, the procedure is for the court to conduct a hearing to determine the nature of said possession, i.e., whether or not he is in possession of the subject property under a claim adverse to that of the judgment debtor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In <i>Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and Royal <i>Savings Bank v. Asia,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> we held that the obligation of a court to issue an <i>ex parte</i> writ of possession in favor of a purchaser in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale ceases to be ministerial once it appears that there is a third party in possession of the property who is claiming a right adverse to that of the debtor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> This is because a third party, who is not privy to the debtor, is protected by law and can only be ejected from the premises after he has been given an opportunity to be heard, to comply with the time-honored principle of due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> We further explained that protecting third party rights finds its basis in the Civil Code, thus:<br><blockquote>Art. 433. Actual possession under claim of ownership raises a disputable presumption of ownership. The true owner must resort to judicial process for the recovery of the property.<br><br>Under the aforequoted provision, one who claims to be the owner of a property possessed by another must bring the appropriate judicial action for its physical recovery. The term "judicial process" could mean no less than an ejectment suit or reinvindicatory action, in which the ownership claims of the contending parties may be properly heard and adjudicated.<br><br>An <i>ex-parte</i> petition for issuance of a possessory writ under Section 7 of Act No. 3135 is not, strictly speaking, a "judicial process" as contemplated above. Even if the same may be considered a judicial proceeding for the enforcement of one's right of possession as purchaser in a foreclosure sale, it is not an ordinary suit filed in court, by which one party "sues another for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the prevention or redress of a wrong."<br></blockquote><blockquote>It should be emphasized that an <i>ex-parte</i> petition for issuance of a writ of possession is a non-litigious proceeding authorized in an extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage pursuant to Act 3135, as amended. Unlike a judicial foreclosure of real estate mortgage under Rule 68 of the Rules of Court, any property brought within the ambit of the act is foreclosed by the filing of a petition, not with any court of justice, but with the office of the sheriff of the province where the sale is to be made.<br><br>As such, a third person in possession of an extrajudicially foreclosed realty, who claims a right superior to that of the original mortgagor, will have no opportunity to be heard on his claim in a proceeding of this nature. It stands to reason, therefore, that such third person may not be dispossessed on the strength of a mere ex-parte possessory writ, since to do so would be tantamount to his summary ejectment, in violation of the basic tenets of due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Citation omitted.)<br></blockquote>As stated, under the law, the third party's possession of the property is legally presumed to be pursuant to a just title, which may only be overcome by the purchaser in a judicial proceeding for recovery of the property. It is only through such a judicial proceeding that the nature of the adverse possession by the third party is determined, according such third party due process and the opportunity to be heard.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The question now is whether Hernandez is a third party in possession of the property claiming a right adverse to that of the debtor/mortgagor. We rule in the negative. Who holds actual possession of the property in this case is uncertain and disputed.<br><br>In <i>Gopiao v. Metropolitan Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> we ruled that there should be <b>certainty</b> of possession before applying the exception to the general rule in issuing writs of possession. Thus:<br><blockquote>xxx<b> The present case cannot be said to be identically analogous to any of the exceptions discussed above. While the facts of the foregoing rulings are similar to that of the instant case, there remains one crucial difference: the certainty of possession. In all three cases cited by the petitioner, the fact that the subject property was actually in the possession of the adverse third party is undisputed,</b> xxx<br><br>In contrast, petitioner's possession of the subject properties in this case is questionable. As correctly observed by the courts below, petitioner failed to substantiate his possession with sufficient evidence, xxx<br></blockquote><blockquote>Equally telling is that the titles covering the subject properties depict no trace of petitioner's claim. The findings of the trial court reveal that the unnotarized Deed of Sale is nowhere to be found on the dorsal side of the titles. There is likewise no notice or adverse claim annotated or inscribed&nbsp; at the back of the&nbsp; same.&nbsp; Upon verification at the Office of the Register of Deeds for the Province of Pampanga, Municipal Assessor and Treasurer's Office, respondent bank found out that the subject titles and latest tax declarations covering the disputed properties were still registered under the names of the Spouses Legaspi without any annotation on the same as to the existence of a sale between said spouses and petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Hernandez claims actual possession of the lots involved since 1985 through her daughter. However, in their comments, both banks alleged that they are mortgagees in good faith. They both alleged that they conducted ocular inspection on the lots and found both lots unoccupied.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> They likewise made verifications with the Registry of Deeds of Calamba, Laguna, Municipal Assessor, and Treasurer's office, and found out that the TCTs and tax declarations were still registered in the name of Ocampo and Mendoza, without any annotations as to the existence of any encumbrances or liens, including adverse claims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Following the case of <i>Gopiao</i>, the exception to the general rule does not apply in this case; hence, the issuance of the writs of possession continues to be ministerial.<br><br>However, we note that Hernandez is not without any remedy. A third person, who is not the judgment debtor, or his agent, can vindicate his claim to a property levied through the remedies of (1) <i>terceria</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> to determine whether the sheriff has rightly or wrongly taken hold of the property not belonging to the judgment debtor or obligor and (2) an independent "separate action."<br><br>By the<i> terceria,</i> the officer shall not be bound to keep the property and could be answerable for damages. A third-party claimant may also resort to an independent "separate action,” the object of which is the recovery of ownership or possession of the property seized by the sheriff, as well as damages arising from wrongful seizure and detention of the property despite the third-party claim. If a "separate action" is the recourse, the third-party claimant must institute in a forum of competent jurisdiction an action, distinct and separate from the action in which the judgment is being enforced, even before or without need of filing a claim in the court that issued the writ. Both remedies are cumulative and may be availed of independently of or separately from the other.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>In this case, Hernandez has already filed a separate action of annulment of title, which was a separate and distinct action from the exparte petitions for issuance of writ of possession filed by PSB and Metrobank. It is in this action of annulment of title that Hernandez filed her urgent motion for issuance of a writ of temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.<br><br>On that issue of injunction, PSB and Metrobank argue that the RTC, Branch 24 cannot enjoin itself from enforcing the writ of possession it earlier issued. The CA agreed with the respondent banks and ruled that if a writ of preliminary injunction is issued to stay the effects of the writ of possession, it would be an interference of a co-equal body. While this may<br>not be technically correct, as there was only one court involved here,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> we uphold the more relevant principle behind an injunctive writ.<br><br>Hernandez's entitlement to the injunctive writ hinges on her <i>prima facie</i> right to the properties subject of Civil Case No. B-6191, However, her claims of possession and ownership are belied by the banks' own claims. From these alone, it is clear that Hernandez failed to discharge the burden of showing a clear and unmistakable right to be protected. Where the complainant's right or title is doubtful or disputed, injunction is not proper. The possibility of irreparable damage without proof of actual existing right is not a ground for an injunction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The RTC is also correct in denying the motion to enjoin the implementation of the writs of possession because equally pertinent is the rule that courts should avoid issuing a writ of preliminary injunction, which in effect, would dispose of the main case without trial <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The ground relied upon by the trial court in not issuing the writ of preliminary injunction in this case is its doubt over petitioner's allegations of bad faith on the part of Mendoza and Ocampo in the acquisition and titling of the properties, and on the part of the banks for allowing the mortgage of the properties. If the RTC were to grant the motion on these grounds, it would be virtually recognizing petitioner's claim that the deeds of conveyances and the titles are a nullity without further proof to the detriment of the doctrine of presumption of validity in favor of these documents. As we have stated in <i>Medina v. Greenfield Development Corporation,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> there would, in effect, be a prejudgment of the main case and a reversal of the rule on the burden of proof since the courts would be assuming propositions, which claimants are inceptively duty bound to prove.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the Petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
