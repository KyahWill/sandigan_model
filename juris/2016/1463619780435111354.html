Startled by the pain she felt in her vagina, AAA pushed Comboy and scampered away from him in order to move closer to BBB. This left Comboy no choice but to leave the room.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10 ]</sup><br><br>The incident was repeated sometime in February 2008, when AAA, while sleeping beside her brother, BBB, was similarly awakened by the presence of her father, Comboy, on top of her with his penis already inside her vagina. During this time, Comboy told AAA not to make any noise so as not to disrupt the sleep of the other members of their family.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Finally, at around 2 o'clock in the morning of May 17, 2009, AAA, while again sleeping beside her brother, BBB, woke up with her father, Comboy, already on top of her and in the process of removing her underwear.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> However, AAA was able to push Comboy away and thereafter, went closer to BBB, who was also awakened by the commotion. This prompted Comboy to simply leave the room. BBB then reported the matter to their stepmother.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On May 28, 2009, AAA finally had the courage to report the foregoing incidents to Barangay <i>Kagawad</i> Donald Andres<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Briobo, who in turn, helped AAA seek police assistance. AAA was then examined by Municipal Health Officer Dr. Sotera C. Copino, who found her to have sustained lacerations in her hymen which could have been caused by the penetration of a hard object, such as an erect penis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>For his part, Comboy interposed the defenses of denial and alibi. He claimed that he was in Manila in February 2006 and February 2008, while AAA was in her mother's house in Albay, hence, he could not have raped her. Comboy, however, revealed that he was actually working in Olongapo City at the time of the incidents, and that on May 17, 2009, he was actually in Bicol but he was staying with his common-law spouse. He further averred that AAA fabricated the accusations against him as she was angry with him and his common-law spouse. He also presented his brother Juan (Juan) who corroborated his claims. Juan maintained that he stayed in Comboy's house to look after the latter's children, and that their mother's house was near Comboy's residence. He disclosed that Comboy occasionally visited Bolo from Manila to visit his children and that the latter would stay for one to two weeks.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Upon his arraignment on October 23, 2009, Comboy pleaded not guilty to each of the charges levelled against him. At the pre-trial conference, the parties stipulated that AAA is a minor, as evidenced by her Birth Certificate, and that Comboy is her father.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> dated February 22, 2013, the RTC found Comboy guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of Statutory Rape (Crim. Case Nos. T-5006 and T-5009) and one (1) count of Attempted Rape (Crim. Case No. T-5010) and, accordingly, sentenced him as follows: (a) in Crim Case No. T-5006, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and was ordered to pay AAA the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral "damages, P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, and to pay the costs; (b) in Crim. Case No. T-5009, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and was ordered to pay AAA the amounts of P50,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, and to pay the costs; and (c) in Crim. Case No. T-5010, he was sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of two (2) years and four (4) months of <i>prision correccional</i>, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor,</i> as maximum and was ordered to pay the amounts of F30,000.00 as moral damages, and to pay the costs. Comboy, was however, acquitted in Crim. Case Nos. T-5007 and T-5008 for insufficiency of evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The RTC found that the prosecution successfully established that Comboy had carnal knowledge of AAA twice, the first time occurring sometime in 2006 and the other time in February 2008 (Crim. Case Nos. T-5006 and T-5009). Anent the incident that happened on May 17, 2009, the RTC found that while Comboy was already on top of AAA and was in the act of removing her underwear, he failed to realize his lustful desires as BBB woke up and exclaimed the word "ate" to AAA, prompting Comboy to leave the room. In this regard, the RTC opined that Comboy commenced the performance of an act which indicated his intent to rape AAA but was stopped by a reason other than his own desistance, <i>i.e.</i>, BBB's intervention. On the other hand, the RTC did not lend credence to Comboy's defenses of denial and alibi in light of AAA's clear and categorical testimony which was corroborated by the medical findings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, Comboy appealed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> his conviction to the CA.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated June 13, 2014, the CA affirmed the RTC's ruling <i>in toto</i>. It held that Comboy's moral ascendancy and influence over AAA as the latter's biological father were sufficient to comply with the force and intimidation required by law for one to have carnal knowledge without her consent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Further, the CA gave scant consideration to Comboy's assertion that AAA merely fabricated the accusations against him as she was angry at him for being too strict, opining that such reason is "too flimsy and insignificant for a daughter to falsely charge her father with so serious a crime and to publicly disclose that she had been raped and then undergo the concomitant humiliation, anxiety, and exposure to public trial."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Hence, the instant appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not Comboy is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of Rape and one (1) count of Attempted Rape.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br>The appeal is bereft of merit.<br><br>At the outset, it must be stressed that in criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors. The appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Proceeding from the foregoing, the Court deems it proper to modify Comboy's conviction from two (2) counts of Statutory Rape and one (1) count of Attempted Rape to <u><b>two (2) counts of Qualified Rape and one (1) count of Attempted Qualified Rape</b></u>, as will be explained hereunder.<br><br>Article 266-A (1) (a) and (d), in relation to Article 266-B (1), of the RPC, read as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Article 266-A. Rape: When and How Committed. - Rape is committed -<br><br>1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>a) Through force, threat, or intimidation; x x x x<br><br>d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Article 266-B. Penalties. - Rape under paragraph 1 of the next preceding article shall be punished by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.<br><br>x x x x <br><br>The death penalty shall also be imposed if the crime of rape is committed with any of the following aggravating/qualifying circumstances:<br><br>1) When the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim;<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>The elements of Rape under Article 266-A (1) (a) are: (a) the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (b) said carnal knowledge was accomplished through force, threat or intimidation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The gravamen of Rape is sexual intercourse with a woman against her will.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> On the other hand, Statutory Rape under Article 266-A (1) (d) is committed by having sexual intercourse with a woman below twelve (12) years of age regardless of her consent, or lack of it, to the sexual act. Proof of force, threat, or intimidation, or consent of the offended party is unnecessary as these are not elements of statutory rape, considering that the absence of free consent is conclusively presumed when the victim is below the age of twelve (12). The law presumes that the offended party does not possess discernment and is incapable of giving intelligent consent to the sexual act. Thus, to sustain a conviction for statutory rape, the prosecution must establish the following: (<i>a</i>) the age of the complainant; (<i>b</i>) the identity of the accused; and (<i>c</i>) the sexual intercourse between the accused and the complainant.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The foregoing acts of Rape shall be qualified pursuant to Article 266-B (1) of the RPC if: (<i>a</i>) the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age; and (b) the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim.<br><br>In the case at bar, the Court agrees with the finding of the courts <i>a quo</i> that the prosecution was able to prove that Comboy: (<i>a</i>) had carnal knowledge of her without her consent on two (2) separate occasions, the first occurring sometime in 2006 and the second in February 2008; and (<i>b</i>) attempted to have carnal knowledge of her on May 17, 2009, but was stopped by a reason other than his own desistance, <i>i.e</i>., BBB's intervention. Suffice it to say that Comboy's flimsy defense of denial and alibi cannot prevail over the positive and categorical testimony of AAA identifying him as the perpetrator of the crimes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> In this regard, it has been long settled that "a young girl would not concoct a sordid tale of a crime as serious as rape at the hands of her very own father, allow the examination of her private part, and subject herself to the stigma and embarrassment of a public trial, if her motive were other than a fervent desire to seek justice. Hence, there is no plausible reason why AAA would testify against her own father, imputing to him the grave crime of rape, if this crime did not happen,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> as in this case. However, since a plain reading of the Informations in Crim. Case Nos. T-5006, T-5009, and T-5010<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> would readily reveal that Comboy was actually charged of raping his own biological minor daughter, AAA, which facts of minority and relationship were already stipulated upon during pre-trial,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> the Court finds it appropriate to modify Comboy's conviction from two (2) counts of Statutory Rape and one (1) count of Attempted Rape to <u><b>two (2) counts of Qualified Rape and one (1) count of Attempted Qualified Rape.</b></u><br><br>Anent the proper penalty to be imposed upon Comboy in Crim. Case Nos. T-5006 and T-5009, it is noted that Section 3 of RA 9346<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> provides that "[p]ersons convicted of offenses punished with <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, or whose sentences will be reduced to <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> by reason of this Act, shall not be eligible for parole under Act No. 4103, otherwise known as the Indeterminate Sentence Law, as amended." Pursuant thereto, and in accordance with Section 2<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of the same law, he must be sentenced to suffer the penalty of <u><b><i>reclusion perpetua</i>, without eligibility for parole</b></u>, for each count of Qualified Rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Furthermore, in view of prevailing jurisprudence, where the penalty for the crime committed is death, which, however, cannot be imposed upon Comboy because of the provisions of RA 9346, the Court hereby increases the damages awarded to AAA as follows: (<i>a</i>) P100,000.00 as civil indemnity, (<i>b</i>) P100,000.00 as moral damages, and (c) P100,000.00 as exemplary damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Finally, since Comboy was convicted for Attempted Qualified Rape in Crim. Case No. T-5010, the courts <i>a quo</i> properly took into consideration the provisions of Article 5138 of the RPC, as well as the Indeterminate Sentence Law, in determining the imposable penalty against him. Hence, it is correct that Comboy be meted the penalty of imprisonment for the indeterminate period of two (2) years and four (4) months of<i> prision correctional</i>, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i>, as maximum. Further, Comboy should also be ordered to pay AAA the amounts of P30,000.00 as civil indemnity, P25,000.00 as moral damages, and PI0,000.00 as exemplary damages.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In addition, the Court imposes interest at the legal rate of six percent (6%) per annum on all monetary awards from the date of finality of judgment until fully paid, for each count of Qualified Rape and Attempted Qualified Rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appeal is <b>DENIED.</b> The Decision dated June 13, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
