Per the said MOA, the parties agreed that the IBC will do the rechanneling for no monetary considerations whatsoever, except that it can get the surplus supply of sand and gravel taken out therefrom after the necessary dike has been established, as what has been provided for in the alleged Resolution No. 30-A, on account of financial constraints since the municipality has already exhausted all its resources due to a series of calamities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Soon thereafter, Criminal Complaints for Falsification under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) and for Violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 were filed before the Office of the Ombudsman-Visayas (OMB-Visayas) against the local officials involved in the project of rechanneling the Tigum River path, including petitioner Tan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The case was docketed as OMB-VIS-CRIM-98-0372.<br><br>The alleged Falsification was committed by Mondejar, Arnaldo Partisala (Partisala),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Tolentino, Espejo, Gumapas, Piolo, and Velasco when they made it appear in the Minutes of the Regular Session of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>of Maasin, Iloilo City, held on 21 June 1996, that Resolution No. 30-A and Resolution No. 30-B were deliberated, approved and/or enacted by the <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>on the said date. Allegedly, no such resolutions were passed and/or enacted by the said body on that date. It was argued that this was done to give Mondejar legal basis or authority to enter into a MOA with the IBC, through petitioner Tan, for the supposed rechanneling of the Tigum River path. In reality, however, such MOA is a grant of an authority for the IBC to engage into massive quarrying activities in the area even without the required permit. As the argument ran, all the local officials involved in the project of rechanneling the Tigum River path, in conspiracy with petitioner Tan, indubitably committed also a Violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 inasmuch as they gave unwarranted benefits, advantage and displayed manifest partiality in favor of the IBC. They entered into a contract that is grossly disadvantageous to the government, particularly to the Municipality of Maasin, Iloilo City, as it has been deprived of the revenues, which could have been collected from the IBC out of the hauling activities of the latter for sand and gravel if there was no such MOA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On 31 May 1999, the OMB-Visayas, through Special Prosecution Officer II Raul V.

This means that accused Mondejar did not have the authority to enter into a MOA with the IBC for the rechanneling of the Tigum River. Knowing this, the accused public officials falsified Exh. "F" [Minutes of the 21 June 1996 <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>Session] thereby making it appear that the SB gave such authority to accused Mondejar. This act was done in evident bad faith as they deliberately covered-up an illegal act thus justifying the extraction of sand and gravel by the IBC at the Tigum River. Without such act by the accused, IBC would not have any right to haul any and all "excess" sand and gravel from the said site x x x<br><br>As to third element, it was shown by the prosecution that the only way for the IBC to legally extract sand and gravel from the Tigum River was if it could secure a quarrying permit from the provincial government of Iloilo. This is stated clearly in Provincial Ordinance No. 11 of the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan </i>of Iloilo dated [14 August 1995] x x x<br><br>The municipality of Maasin, through its Mayor and the SB, did not have the authority to issue quarrying permit. What the accused were able to accomplish through the MOA was to allow IBC to engage in quarrying activities without having to go through the trouble of securing a quarrying permit on the justification that IBC was performing a service for the townspeople by constructing a temporary dike and by rechanneling the Tigum River and that the extraction of sand and gravel as its compensation for services rendered.<br><br>In effect, the accused public officers and the IBC owner [petitioner] Tan effectively bypassed the provincial government and circumvented the requirement for a quarrying permit, with all its conditions and limitations. By so doing, the accused gave unwarranted favor or unwarranted benefit to [petitioner] Tan, the owner of the IBC, in the exercise of their official functions x x x<br><br>x x x Worse the MOA did not put in necessary safeguards to prevent any abuses by the IBC. It did not require the municipality to supervise the construction of the dike and the rechanneling of the river nor did it require monitoring of the sand and gravel being extracted by the IBC thereby giving IBC unfettered discretion in its implementation of the MOA and allowing indiscriminate quarrying in the area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioner Tan moved for its reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> but it was denied for lack of merit in the questioned Resolution dated 30 June 2015.<br><br>The Sandiganbayan held that:<br><br><blockquote>Contrary to [herein petitioner] Tan's argument, <b>the prosecution has proven her complicity by her act of signing the MOA ostensibly dated 28 June 1996 but was actually executed sometime after September 1997 which act indicates a common purpose to make it appear that accused Mondejar had the authority to enter into said MOA with [petitioner] Tan's IBC. <u>While such finding had not been expressly stated in the assailed Decision, such is necessarily implied from the finding that the falsified Minutes was executed only sometime in 1997</u>.</b><br><br><center>x x x x &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;x x x x &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;x x x x</center><br><br>The Information states that unwarranted benefit was given [petitioner] Tan by the act of the accused public officers in making it appear that Resolution No. 30-B series of 1996 was passed authorizing accused Mondejar to exercise his emergency powers and that, in fact, Mondejar did enter into a MOA with [petitioner] Tan of IBC authorizing it to engage in massive quarrying in the guise of rechanneling the Tigum River. These are the ultimate facts that go into the sufficiency of the Information and which the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt. The discussion by the Court that the acts of the accused had the effect of circumventing the rules on securing a quarry permit and that the MOA unduly benefited [petitioner] Tan's IBC are mere details that go into the whys and the hows of the authority granted [petitioner] Tan's IBC. Verily, an Information only needs to state the ultimate facts constituting the offense, not the finer details of why and how the illegal acts alleged amounted to undue injury or damage or unwarranted benefit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br><br>Hence, this Petition by petitioner Tan raising the following grounds: <b>(1)</b> the Sandiganbayan Decision is void on its face for non-compliance with Section 14, Article VTII of the Constitution; <b>(2)</b> the Information in Criminal Case No. 25674, in regard petitioner Tan, is void as it does not conform to the OMB-Visayas Resolution finding no probable cause to charge the latter with Falsification of Resolution No. 30-B of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>of Maasin, Iloilo City; <b>(3)</b> the Information does not allege an offense constitutive of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 with regard to petitioner Tan who is a private individual; <b>(4)</b> The Sandiganbayan Decision imputes to the accused public officials in Criminal Case No. 25674, including petitioner Tan, the grant of unwarranted benefits to the IBC as the latter was able to quarry in the Tigum River without any permit from the provincial government of Iloilo, which fact is not alleged in the Information, much less supported by any evidence, thus, in violation of petitioner Tan's constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusations against her, making the entire proceedings void; <b>(5)</b> the Sandiganbayan Decision violated petitioner Tan's right to due process and even the fundamental rules of evidence as it appreciated the evidence presented in Criminal Case No. 25675 (for Falsification) in convicting the latter in Criminal Case No. 25674 (for Violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019) even though such evidence was never offered in the latter case; <b>(6)</b> both the Sandiganbayan Decision and Resolution contain no finding of the commission of any act by petitioner Tan, either by herself or in conspiracy with her co-accused in Criminal Case No. 25674, that established beyond reasonable doubt the violation of each and every element of the offense punishable under Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 in relation to Section 4(b) of the same law; and <b>(7)</b> the Sandiganbayan Decision and Resolution were rendered in violation of the Constitution, thus, merits reversal and the petitioner deserves an acquittal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>With the foregoing arguments, the main issue to be resolved in the present recourse is whether the Sandiganbayan erred in finding petitioner Tan guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 in conspiracy with the accused public officials of Maasin, Iloilo City.<br><br>The Petition is meritorious.<br><br>Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019, under which petitioner Tan is charged, provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 3.</b> <i>Corrupt practices of public officers. </i>In addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>(e) Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.

This is in consonance with the avowed policy of the anti-graft law to repress certain acts of <b>public officers and private persons alike</b> constituting graft or corrupt practices act or which may lead thereto.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Thus, for a private person to be charged with and convicted of Violation of certain offenses under Section 3 of R.A. 3019, which in this case (e), it must be satisfactorily proven that he/she has acted in conspiracy with the public officers in committing the offense; otherwise, he/she cannot be so charged and convicted thereof.<br><br>In conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all; thus, it is never presumed. Like the physical acts constituting the crime itself, the elements of conspiracy must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> To establish conspiracy, direct proof of an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and the decision to commit it is not necessary. It may be inferred from the acts of the accused before, during or after the commission of the crime which, when taken together, would be enough to reveal a community of criminal design, as the proof of conspiracy is frequently made by evidence of a chain of circumstances.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> <b>While direct proof is not essential to establish conspiracy, it must be established by positive and conclusive evidence. And conviction must be founded on facts, not on mere inferences and presumptions.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner Tan was charged with and convicted of Violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 because of the alleged conspiracy between her and her co-accused public officials of Maasin, Iloilo City, in committing the said offense. But, a perusal of the Sandiganbayan Decision showed no instance how petitioner Tan could have conspired with her co-accused public officials. Petitioner Tan, thus, raised this point in her Motion for Reconsideration. The Sandiganbayan, however, in disposing the same, simply stated:<br><br><blockquote><b>x x x the prosecution has proven her complicity by her act of signing the MOA ostensibly dated 28 June 1996 but was actually executed sometime after September 1997 which act indicates a common purpose to make it appear that accused Mondejar had the authority to enter into said MOA with [petitioner] Tan's IBC.</b> While such finding had not been expressly stated in the assailed Decision, such is necessarily implied from the finding that the falsified Minutes was executed only sometime in 1997.</blockquote><br><br>It can be gleaned from the aforesaid Sandiganbayan disposition that their only basis in declaring that the MOA was actually executed sometime after September 1997 was their finding that the falsified Minutes of the Regular Session of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>of Maasin, Iloilo City, was executed only sometime in 1997. To the mind of this Court, this is a patently erroneous conclusion.<br><br>There was no iota of evidence ever presented by the prosecution in Criminal Case No. 25674 that would prove that the MOA entered into between Mondejar and petitioner Tan was actually executed on a date other than 27 January 1996. There was also nothing on the face of the MOA that would show any irregularity in its execution. To note, the MOA signed by petitioner Tan dated 27 June 1996 was duly notarized on 28 June 1996. Section 30 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 30. <i>Proof of notarial document. - </i>Every instrument duly acknowledged or proved and certified as provided by law, may be presented in evidence without further proof, the certificate of acknowledgement being <i>prima facie </i>evidence of the execution of the instrument or document involved. (Italics supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The notarization of a document carries considerable legal effect. <b>Notarization of a private document converts such document into a public one, and renders it admissible in court without further proof of its authenticity.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> With that notarial act, the MOA became a public document. As such, it is a perfect evidence of the fact which gives rise to its execution and of its date so long as the act which the officer witnessed and certified to or the date written by him is not shown to be false.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> To overcome the presumption, the rules require not just a preponderance of evidence, but evidence that is "clear and convincing" as to exclude all reasonable controversy as to the falsity of the certificate. In the absence of such proof, the document must be upheld.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Further, in the parties' Joint Stipulation of Facts before the Sandiganbayan, one of facts they agreed on was:<br><br><blockquote><ol start="2"><li>That on 27 June 1996 a Memorandum of Agreement was entered into between the Municipality of Maasin, Iloilo represented by Mayor Rene Mondejar as the First Party, International Builders Corporation (IBC) represented by Helen Edith Lee Tan as the Second Party, for the Rechanneling of the Tigum River path at Barangay Naslo, Maasin, Iloilo.</li></ol></blockquote><br><br>As the aforesaid Joint Stipulation of Facts was reduced into writing and signed by the parties and their counsels, thus, they are bound by it and the same becomes judicial admissions of the facts stipulated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Section 4, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court states:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 4.</b><i> Judicial Admissions. </i> An admission, verbal or written, made by a party in the course of the proceedings in the same case, does not require proof. The admission may be contradicted only by showing that, it was made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made.</blockquote><br><br>A party may make judicial admissions in (a) the pleadings, (b) during the trial, either by verbal or written manifestations <b>or stipulations,</b> or (c) in other stages of the judicial proceeding. It is well-settled that judicial admissions cannot be contradicted by the admitter who is the party himself and binds the person who makes the same, and absent any showing that this was made thru palpable mistake, as in this case, no amount of rationalization can offset it.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[63]</sup></font> Also, in <i>Republic of the Philippines v. D Guzman</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><i> </i>citing <i>Alfelor v. Halasan,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> this Court held that "a party who judicially admits a fact cannot later challenge that fact as <b>judicial admissions are a waiver of proof;</b> production of evidence is dispensed with. A <b>judicial admission also removes an admitted fact from the field of controversy."</b><br><br>With the foregoing, the Sandiganbayan is precluded from ruling that the MOA was actually executed sometime in September 1997 as it would run counter to the stipulated fact of the parties that it was entered into on 27 June 1996, which stipulation was not shown to have been made through palpable mistake.<br><br>Having established that the MOA was entered into on 27 June 1996 and not in September 1997 as what the Sandiganbayan would make it appear, petitioner Tan's act of signing the same did not in anyway prove that she had conspired with her co-accused public officials in committing the offense charged. To repeat, there is nothing in the MOA that would apprise petitioner Tan of any irregularity or illegality that led to its execution. More so, the prosecution did not even present evidence in Criminal Case No. 25674 to prove that petitioner Tan (1) has knowledge that Resolution No. 30-B was a product of a falsified document, <i>i.e., </i>Minutes of the Regular Session of the <i>Sangguniang Bayan </i>of Maasin, Iloilo City, and that Mondejar has no authority to enter into a MOA with her; and that (2) despite knowledge thereof, still entered into a MOA with Mondejar. It also bears stressing that none of those who testified for the prosecution ever linked petitioner Tan to the alleged falsification committed by the accused public officials of Maasin, Iloilo City. In fact, petitioner Tan was not among those charged with Falsification.<br><br>Since petitioner Tan's conviction was based on the presence of conspiracy, which the prosecution was not able to prove beyond reasonable doubt, her conviction of the offense charged must be reversed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the present Petition is hereby <b>GRANTED.</b> The Sandiganbayan Decision and Resolution dated 7 November 2013 and 30 June 2015, respectively, in Criminal Case No. 25674 insofar as petitioner Tan is concerned are hereby <b>REVERSED and SET ASIDE.</b> Accordingly, petitioner Tan is <b>ACQUITTED</b> from the charge of Violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Peralta, Reyes,</i> and <i>Jardeleza, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="center" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><br><br><div align="right"><u><b>November 17, 2016</b></u><br></div><br><center><b>N O T I C E&nbsp; O F&nbsp; J U D G M E N T</b></center><br><br>Sirs/Mesdames:<br><br>Please take notice that on <b><u>October 17, 2016</u></b> a Decision, copy attached hereto, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on November 17, 2016 at 10:30 a.m.<br><br><div align="right">Very truly yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>(SGD.)
