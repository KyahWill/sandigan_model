In addition, SPO1 Evasco prepared an inventory of the items seized, but the petitioner refused to sign the inventory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The petitioner and the seized items were then taken to the police station. Thereafter, the seized items were brought to the court and then to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination by SPO1 Calupit and PO2 Lobrin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>At the PNP Crime Laboratory, SPO1 Alejandro Usi, a drug screener/laboratory technician, conducted an initial field test of the drug specimens.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Based on the <b>Certification of Laboratory Examination</b> dated November 19, 2004, the test yielded positive for <i>methamphetamine hydrochloride</i>, also known as "<i>shabu</i>" a dangerous drug.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The following day, P/Inspt.

In its decision dated September 25, 2009, the appellate court ruled that: <i>first</i>, the delegation to the <i>barangay tanods</i> of the task of physically searching for illegal drugs in the petitioner's bedroom did not make the search irregular. Thus, the items seized, including the twelve (12) plastic sachets found by the <i>barangay tanods</i>, cannot be considered as "fruits of the poisonous tree." <i>Second</i>, the prosecution satisfactorily established the required link in the chain of custody of the seized items. <i>Third</i>, the alleged inconsistencies between the prosecution witnesses' testimonies appear to be minor and inconsequential and do not impair their credibility. <i>Fourth</i>, the failure of the police officers to coordinate with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (<i>PDEA</i>) does not render the search illegal nor does it make the evidence seized from the petitioner's house inadmissible. And <i>fifth</i>, the petitioner's defenses of alibi and frame-up cannot overcome the narration of the incident by the prosecution's witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The petitioner moved for reconsideration, but the CA denied his motion in a resolution dated December 8, 2009.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> As a consequence, the petitioner filed the present petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> on January 26, 2010.<br><br><center><b><u>The Present Petition</u></b><br></center><br>The petitioner raises the following issues in the present petition:<br><br><i>First</i>, the petitioner argues that the search became unlawful when SPO1 Evasco delegated the task of searching the bedroom to the <i>barangay tanods</i> for fear of being "branded" as planting evidence. Consequently, any evidence which may have been obtained during the search is absolutely inadmissible for being the "fruit of the poisonous tree."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, the petitioner insists that there are inconsistencies with the prosecution witnesses' testimonies as to who actually found the matchbox containing the twelve (12) plastic sachets and the suspected drug paraphernalia.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>And <i>third</i>, the petitioner claims that the chain of custody over the seized items "appears broken and questionable," considering that the seized items were not marked in his presence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> This puts into question the identity of the drug specimens submitted to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>After due consideration, we resolve to <b>GRANT</b> the petitioner's appeal for the prosecution's failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt in Criminal Case Nos. 04-711 and 04-712.<br><br><center><u>Criminal Case No. 04-711</u><br></center><br>In criminal prosecutions, it is fundamental that the accused is presumed innocent of a charge until his guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In other words, the elemental acts constituting the offense must be established with moral certainty, as this finding and level of proof are the critical requisites to a finding of guilt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>For prosecutions involving dangerous drugs, the dangerous drug itself constitutes the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the offense and the fact of its existence is vital to sustain a judgment of conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It is of paramount importance that the identity of the dangerous drug be so established,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> along with the elements of the offense charged. Proof beyond reasonable doubt in these cases demands an unwavering exactitude that the dangerous drug presented in court as evidence against the accused is the same as that seized from him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In order to meet the quantum of proof required in drug-related prosecutions, the chain of custody requirement under Section 21 of RA No. 9165 ensures that doubts concerning the identity of the seized drugs are removed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> As a method of authenticating evidence, the chain of custody rule requires that the admission of the exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>To show an unbroken link in the chain of custody,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> <b>the prosecution's evidence must include testimony about <u>every link</u> in the chain</b>, from the moment the item was seized to the time it is offered in court as evidence, such that every person who handled the evidence would acknowledge how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness' possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain. The same witness would then describe the precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change in the condition of the item and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have its possession. <b>It is from the testimony of every witness who handled the evidence from which a reliable assurance can be derived that the evidence presented in court is one and the same as that seized from the accused.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Thus, the following links must be established to ensure the preservation of the identity and integrity of the confiscated drug: 1) the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; 2) the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; 3) the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and 4) the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>We stress that the marking of the seized drugs or other related items is crucial in proving the unbroken chain of custody in drug-related prosecutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> As the first link in the chain of custody, the marking is of vital importance because succeeding handlers of the dangerous drugs or related items will use the marking as reference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Also, the marking of the evidence serves to separate the marked evidence from the <i>corpus</i> of all other similar or related evidence from the time they are seized from the accused until they are disposed of at the end of the criminal proceedings, thus preventing switching, "planting," or contamination of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In other words, <b>the marking immediately upon confiscation or recovery of the dangerous drugs or related items is <i>indispensable</i> in the preservation of their integrity and evidentiary value</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>After a critical review of the records, we hold that the prosecution <i>failed</i> to establish that the drug specimens presented in court are those allegedly se ized from the petitioner.<br><br><i>First</i>, the records are bereft of any evidence that would clearly show that the twelve (12) plastic sachets supposedly containing the <i>shabu</i> were ever marked by SPO1 Evasco, whether at the scene or at the police station, and that they were marked in the presence of the petitioner. In fact, based on the evidence on record, there is only one set of markings on the twelve (12) plastic sachets - the markings of "A-1" to "A-12" made by P/Inspt. Clemens <u>a day after the items were seized</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>This finding is further supported by the testimony of P/Inspt.

Clemens, the only markings on the specimens submitted to her only consisted of the ones on the matchbox. <b>She made no mention of any markings (aside from her own) <u>on the plastic sachets</u>.</b><br><br><i>Second</i>, there appears to be unexplained inconsistencies in the drug specimens submitted by the police officers to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination. On one hand, the Certification of Laboratory Examination dated November 19, 2004 states:<br><blockquote>SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:<br><br>One (1) match box labeled "RIZAL" containing twelve (12) small transparent plastic sachets <b>marked "A" through "L,"</b> each containing suspected methamphetamine hydrochloride (<i>shabu</i>), and <b>having a total weight of 0.3485 gram</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>On the other hand, the Chemistry Report dated November 20, 2004 states:<br><blockquote>SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:<br><br>One (1) match box with trade mark "RIZAL" containing twelve (12) small tape-sealed transparent plastic sachets with black and red markings <b>marked as A-1 through A-12</b>, each with white crystalline substance <b>having a total net weight of 0.3133 gram</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]<br></blockquote>These two laboratory reports show inconsistencies with regard to the referenced markings on the twelve (12) plastic sachets and, more importantly, to the weight of the drug specimens - from 0.3485 gram in the first test and only 0.3133 gram in the second test.<br><br>Clearly, the drug specimens that were allegedly seized by the police officers from the petitioner during the search operation <i>differed</i> or, at the very least, <i>were no longer in their original condition</i> when examined by P/Inspt. Clemens on November 20, 2004, a day after they were first subjected to an initial field test by SPO1 Usi.<br><br><i>Third</i>, the prosecution's evidence is seriously lacking in details as to the links in the chain of custody of the seized items from the time they were confiscated up to the time they were presented in court.<br><br>A thorough examination of the records reveals that the following are the <u>only</u> testimonies relating to the chain of custody of the seized items:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify"><strong>PROSECUTOR EMMA S.

The prosecution, therefore, should have asked these persons to testify regarding the circumstances under which they handled the subject items. Strangely, SPO1 Calupit and PO2 Lobrin, who both actually testified in court, were not at all asked by the prosecution to testify on the handling of the seized items in their custody. Rather, SPO1 Calupit's and PO2 Lobrin's testimonies only revolved around the implementation of the search warrant.<br><br>What cannot be ignored is the lack of specific details that would convince the Court that the specimens examined by SPO1 Usi and P/Inspt. Clemens were the same ones confiscated from the petitioner. For one thing, it is unclear who actually brought the plastic sachets to the crime laboratory for examination. It is likewise unclear who received the confiscated plastic sachets at the PNP Crime Laboratory or what happened to the specimens after the initial field test conducted by SPO1 Usi. This is particularly relevant, considering that the confirmatory laboratory examination - the <i>more reliable</i> test compared to the initial field test<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> - was only conducted a day after the alleged seizure of the items.<br><br>Similarly, there is no record of who exercised custody and possession of the drug specimens after they were examined by P/Inspt. Clemens and before they were presented before the court.<br><br>All told, the totality of these circumstances - the failure to mark the plastic sachets, the discrepancy in the weight, and the uncertainty of the individuals who handled the seized items - broke the chain of custody and tainted the integrity of the <i>shabu</i> ultimately presented as evidence before the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> <b>Given that the prosecution failed to prove the indispensable element of <i>corpus delicti</i>, the petitioner must be acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt.</b><br><br><center><u>Criminal Case No. 04-712</u><br></center><br>The elements of illegal possession of equipment, instrument, apparatus and other paraphernalia for dangerous drugs under Section 12 of RA No. 9165 are: (1) possession or control by the accused of any equipment, apparatus or other paraphernalia <i>fit or intended</i> for smoking, consuming, administering, injecting, ingesting, or introducing any dangerous drug into the body; and (2) such possession is not authorized by law.<br><br>In the present case, there is no evidence showing that the aluminum foil, tube, and lighters found in the petitioner's house were fit or intended for introducing any dangerous drug into the body. The prosecution did not bother to show that there were traces of <i>shabu</i> on any of these alleged drug paraphernalia. In fact, it appears that the only evidence that the prosecution offered to prove this charge is the existence of the seized items <u>by themselves</u>.<br><br><b>For the prosecution's failure to prove that the items seized were intended to be used as drug paraphernalia, the petitioner must also be acquitted of the charge under Section 12 of RA No. 9165.</b> Indeed, we cannot convict the petitioner for possession of drug paraphernalia when it was not proven beyond reasonable doubt that these items were used or intended to be used as drug paraphernalia.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, we hereby <b>REVERSE</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b> the September 25, 2009 Decision and the December 8, 2009 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
