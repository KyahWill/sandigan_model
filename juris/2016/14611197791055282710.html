				<H3>RAPPLER, INC., PETITIONER, VS. ANDRES D. BAUTISTA, RESPONDENT. <BR><BR>R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CARPIO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR>Petitioner Rappler, Inc. (petitioner) filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition against Andres D. Bautista (respondent), in his capacity as Chairman of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). The petition seeks to nullify Part VI (C), paragraph 19 and Part VI (D), paragraph 20 of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on the 2016 presidential and vice-presidential debates, for being executed without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction and for violating the fundamental rights of petitioner protected under the Constitution. The MOA, signed on 13 January 2016, was executed by the COMELEC through its Chairman, respondent Bautista, and the <i>Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas</i> (KBP), and the various media networks, namely: ABS-CBN Corporation, GMA Network, Inc., Nine Media Corporation, TV5 Network, Inc., Philstar Daily, Inc., Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc., Manila Bulletin Publishing Corporation, Philippine Business Daily Mirror Publishing, Inc., and petitioner. Under the MOA, the KBP was designated as Debate Coordinator while ABS-CBN, GMA, Nine Media, and TV5, together with their respective print media partners were designated as Lead Networks.<br><div align="JUSTIFY"><br>Petitioner alleged that on 21 September 2015, respondent called for a meeting with various media outlets to discuss the "PiliPinas 2016 Debates," for presidential and vice-presidential candidates, which the COMELEC was organizing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Respondent showed a presentation explaining the framework of the debates, in which there will be three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate. Respondent proposed that petitioner and Google, Inc. be in charge of online and social media engagement. Respondent announced during the meeting that KBP will coordinate with all media entities regarding the organization and conduct of the debates.<br><br>On 22 September 2015, petitioner sent a proposed draft for broadcast pool guidelines to COMELEC and the KBP. A broadcast pool has a common audio and video feed of the debates, and the cost will be apportioned among those needing access to the same. KBP informed petitioner that the proposal will be discussed in the next meeting.<br><br>On 19 October 2015, another meeting was held at the COMELEC office to discuss a draft MOA on the debates. In the draft, petitioner and Google's participation were dropped in favor of the online outlets owned by the Lead Networks. After the meeting, the representatives of the Lead Networks drew lots to determine who will host each leg of the debates. GMA and its partner Philippine Daily Inquirer sponsored the first presidential debate in Mindanao on 21 February 2016; TV5, Philippine Star, and Businessworld sponsored the second phase of presidential debate in the Visayas on 20 March 2016; ABS-CBN and Manila Bulletin will sponsor the presidential debate to be held in Luzon on 24 April 2016; and the lone vice-presidential debate will be sponsored by CNN, Business Mirror, and petitioner on 10 April 2016. Petitioner alleged that the draft MOA permitted online streaming, provided proper attribution is given the Lead Network.<br><br>On 12 January 2016, petitioner was informed that the MOA signing was scheduled the following day. Upon petitioner's request, the draft MOA was emailed to petitioner on the evening of 12 January 2016. Petitioner communicated with respondent its concerns regarding certain provisions of the MOA particularly regarding online streaming and the imposition of a maximum limit of two minutes of debate excerpts for news reporting. Respondent assured petitioner that its concerns will be addressed afterwards, but it has to sign the MOA because time was of the essence. On 13 January 2016, petitioner, along with other media networks and entities, executed the MOA with the KBP and the COMELEC for the conduct of the three presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate. Petitioner alleged that it made several communications with respondent and the COMELEC Commissioners regarding its concerns on some of the MOA provisions, but petitioner received no response. Hence, this petition.<br><br>In this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition, petitioner prays for the Court to render judgment:<br><br><blockquote>a. Declaring null and void, for being unconstitutional, pertinent parts of the Memorandum of Agreement that violate the rights of the Petitioner, specifically Part VI (C), paragraph 19 and Part VI (D), paragraph 20 [of the MOA];<br><br>b. Prohibiting the Respondent from implementing specifically Part VI (C), paragraph 19 and Part VI (D), paragraph 20 of the MOA;<br><br>c. Pending resolution of this case, issuing a Preliminary Injunction enjoining the Respondent from implementing Part VI (C), paragraph 19 and Part VI (D), paragraph 20 of the MOA; and<br><br>d. Pending resolution of this case, issuing a Preliminary Mandatory Injunction requiring the Respondent to ensure an unimpaired and equal access to all mass media, online or traditional, to all the Debates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote><br>Part VI (C), paragraph 19 and Part VI (D), paragraph 20 of the MOA read:<br><br><blockquote><center>VI<br></center><div align="center">ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEAD NETWORKS<br></div><br>x x x x<br><br><b<u><u><b>C.

Allow a maximum of two minutes of excerpt from the debates they have produced to be used for news reporting or fair use by other media or entities as allowed by the copyright law: Provided, that the use of excerpts longer than two minutes shall be subject to the consent of the Lead Network concerned;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></b<u></blockquote><br>Respondent argues that the petition should be dismissed for its procedural defects. In several cases, this Court has acted liberally and set aside procedural lapses in cases involving transcendental issues of public interest,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> especially when time constraint is a factor to be considered, as in this case. As held in <i>GMA Network, Inc. v. Commission on Elections</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Respondent claims that<i> certiorari </i>and prohibition are not the proper remedies that petitioners have taken to question the assailed Resolution of the COMELEC. Technically, respondent may have a point. However, considering the very important and pivotal issues raised, and the limited time, such technicality should not deter the Court from having to make the final and definitive pronouncement that everyone else depends for enlightenment and guidance. "[T]his Court has in the past seen fit to step in and resolve petitions despite their being the subject of an improper remedy, in view of the public importance of the issues raised therein.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>The urgency to resolve this case is apparent considering that the televised debates have already started and only two of the scheduled four national debates remain to be staged.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> And considering the importance of the debates in informing the electorate of the positions of the presidential and vice-presidential candidates on vital issues affecting the nation, this case falls under the exception laid down in <i>GMA Network, Inc. v. Commission on Elections.</i><br><br>Petitioner is a signatory to the MOA. In fact, the sole vice-presidential debate, to be held in Manila on 10 April 2016, will be sponsored by CNN Philippines (owned and operated by Nine Media Corporation) and its partners Business Mirror and petitioner. Petitioner, however, is alleging that it is being discriminated particularly as regards the MOA provisions on live audio broadcast via online streaming. Petitioner argues that the MOA grants radio stations the right to simultaneously broadcast live the audio of the debates, even if the radio stations are not obliged to perform any obligation under the MOA. Yet, this right to broadcast by live streaming online the audio of the debates is denied petitioner and other online media entities, which also have the capacity to live stream the audio of the debates. Petitioner insists that it signed the MOA believing in good faith the issues it has raised will be resolved by the COMELEC.<br><br>The provisions on Live Broadcast and Online Streaming under the MOA read:<br><br><blockquote><center>VI <br>ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEAD NETWORKS<br></center><br>x x x x<br><br><u><b>B1. LIVE BROADCAST</b></u><br><br>10. Broadcast the debates produced by the Lead Networks in their respective television stations and other news media platforms;<br><br>11. Provide a live feed of the debate to other radio stations, other than those of the Lead Network's, for simultaneous broadcast;<br><br>12. Provide a live feed of the debates produced by them to radio stations not belonging to any of the Lead Networks for simultaneous broadcast;<br><br>x x x x<br><br><u><b>C. ONLINE STREAMING</b></u><br><br>17. Live broadcast the debates produced by the Lead Networks on their respective web sites and social media sites for free viewing by the public;<br><br>18. Maintain a copy of the debate produced by the Lead Network on its on-line site(s) for free viewing by the public during the period of elections or longer;<br><br><b>19. Subject to copyright conditions or separate negotiations with the Lead Networks, <u>allow</u> the debates they have produced to be shown or streamed on other websites</b>;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (Boldfacing and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Petitioner's demand to exercise the right to live stream the debates is a contractual right of petitioner under the MOA. Under Part VI (C), paragraph 19 of the MOA, the Lead Networks are expressly mandated to "<b>allow the debates they have produced to be shown or streamed on other websites," but "subject to copyright conditions <i>or</i> separate negotiations with the Lead Networks.</b>" The use of the word "or" means that compliance with the "copyright conditions" is sufficient for petitioner to exercise its right to live stream the debates in its website.<br><br>The "copyright conditions" refer to the limitations on copyright as provided under Section 184.1(c) of the Intellectual Property Code (IPC), thus:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 184. <i>Limitations on Copyright. </i>- 184.1 Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter V, the following acts shall not constitute infringement of copyright:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(c) <b>The reproduction or communication to the public by mass media</b> of articles on current political, social, economic, scientific or religious topic, lectures, <b>addresses and other works of the same nature, which are delivered in public <u>if such use is for information purposes and has not been expressly reserved; <i>Provided, </i>That the source is clearly indicated</u></b>; (Sec. 11, P.D. No. 49) (Boldfacing and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Under this provision, the debates fall under "<b>addresses and other works of the same nature</b>." Thus, the copyright conditions for the debates are: (1) <b>the reproduction or communication to the public by mass media of the debates is for information purposes</b>; (2)<b> the debates have not been expressly reserved by the Lead Networks</b> (copyright holders); and (3) <b>the source is clearly indicated.</b><br><br>Condition 1 is complied because the live streaming by petitioner is obviously for information purposes. Condition 2 is also complied because Part VI (C), paragraph 19 of the MOA expressly <b>"allow[s] the debates x x x to be shown or streamed on other websites</b>," including petitioner's website. This means that the "reproduction or communication (of the debates) to the public by mass media x x x has not been expressly reserved" or withheld. Condition 3 is complied by clearly indicating and acknowledging that the source of the debates is one or more of the Lead Networks.<br><br>Part VI (C), paragraph 19 of the MOA, which expressly allows the debates produced by the Lead Networks to be shown or streamed on other websites, <b>clearly means that the Lead Networks have not "expressly reserved" or withheld the use of the debate audio for online streaming</b>. In short, the MOA expressly allows the live streaming of the debates subject only to compliance with the "copyright conditions." Once petitioner complies with the copyright conditions, petitioner can exercise the right to live stream the audio of the debates as expressly allowed by the MOA.<br><br>Under the MOA, the Lead Networks are mandated to promote the debates for maximum audience.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><b> The MOA recognizes the public function of the debates and the need for the widest possible dissemination of the debates. The MOA has not reserved or withheld the reproduction of the debates to the public but has in fact expressly allowed the reproduction of the debates "subject to copyright conditions."</b> Thus, petitioner may live stream the debate in its entirety by complying with the "copyright conditions," including the condition that "the source is clearly indicated" and that there will be no alteration, which means that the streaming will include the proprietary graphics used by the Lead Networks. If petitioner opts for a clean feed without the proprietary graphics used by the Lead Networks, in order for petitioner to layer its own proprietary graphics and text on the same, then petitioner will have to negotiate separately with the Lead Networks. Similarly, if petitioner wants to alter the debate audio by deleting the advertisements, petitioner will also have to negotiate with the Lead Networks.<br><br>Once the conditions imposed under Section 184.1(c) of the IPC are complied with, the information - in this case the live audio of the debates -now forms part of the public domain. There is now freedom of the press to report or publicly disseminate the live audio of the debates. In fact, the MOA recognizes the right of other mass media entities, not parties to the MOA, to reproduce the debates subject only to the same copyright conditions. The freedom of the press to report and disseminate the live audio of the debates, subject to compliance with Section 184.1(c) of the IPC, can no longer be infringed or subject to prior restraint. Such freedom of the press to report and disseminate the live audio of the debates is now protected and guaranteed under Section 4, Article III of the Constitution, which provides that "[N]o law shall be passed abridging the freedom x x x of the press."<br><br>The presidential and vice-presidential debates are held primarily for the benefit of the electorate to assist the electorate in making informed choices on election day. Through the conduct of the national debates among presidential and vice-presidential candidates, the electorate will have the "opportunity to be informed of the candidates' qualifications and track record, platforms and programs, and their answers to significant issues of national concern."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The political nature of the national debates and the public's interest in the wide availability of the information for the voters' education certainly justify allowing the debates to be shown or streamed in other websites for wider dissemination, in accordance with the MOA.<br><br>Therefore, the debates should be allowed to be live streamed on other websites, including petitioner's, as expressly mandated in Part VI (C), paragraph 19 of the MOA. The respondent, as representative of the COMELEC which provides over-all supervision under the MOA, including the power to "resolve issues that may arise among the parties involved in the organization of the debates,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> should be directed by this Court to implement Part VI (C), paragraph 19 of the MOA, which allows the debates to be shown or live streamed unaltered on petitioner's and other websites subject to the copyright condition that the source is clearly indicated.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we<b> PARTIALLY GRANT</b> the petition. Respondent Andres D. Bautista, as Chairman of the COMELEC, is directed to implement Part VI (C), paragraph 19 of the MOA, which allows the debates to be shown or live streamed unaltered on petitioner's and other websites subject to the copyright condition that the source is clearly indicated.

Technical working groups often involve bringing together a pool of experts and representatives from the relevant interest groups to discuss ideas and proposals.

Commission on Elections</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> has explained the importance of protecting free speech that contributes to the web of information ensuring the meaningful exercise of our right of suffrage:<br><br><blockquote>We have adopted the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide open and that it may well include vehement, caustic and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials. Too many restrictions will deny to people the robust, uninhibited, and wide open debate, the generating of interest essential if our elections will truly be free, clean and honest.<br><br>We have also ruled that the preferred freedom of expression calls all the more for the utmost respect when what may be curtailed is the dissemination of information to make more meaningful the equally vital right of suffrage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Freedom of speech is affected when government grants benefits to some media outlets, i.e. lead networks, while unreasonably denying the same privileges to the others. This has the effect of stifling speech especially when the actions of a government agency such as the Commission on Elections have the effect of endowing a monopoly in the market of free speech. In <i>Diocese of Bacolod v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> we examined free speech in light of equality in opportunity and deliberative democracy:<br><br><blockquote>The scope of the guarantee of free expression takes into consideration the constitutional respect for human potentiality and the effect of speech. It valorizes the ability of human beings to express and their necessity to relate, On the other hand, a complete guarantee must also take into consideration the effects it will have in a deliberative democracy. Skewed distribution of resources as well as the cultural hegemony of the majority may have the effect of drowning out the speech and the messages of those in the minority. In a sense, social inequality does have its effect on the exercise and effect of the guarantee of free speech, Those who have more will have better access to media that reaches a wider audience than those who have less. Those who espouse the more popular ideas will have better reception that the subversive and the dissenters of society.

The Commission may, during the election period, supervise or regulate the enjoyment or utilization of all franchises or permits for the operation of transportation and other public utilities, media of communication or information, all grants, special privileges, or concessions granted by the Government or any subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including any government-owned or -controlled corporation or its subsidiary. Such supervision or regulation shall aim to ensure equal opportunity, time, and space, and the right to reply, including reasonable, equal rates therefor, for public information campaigns and forums among candidates in connection with the objective of holding free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote><br>Article II, Section 24 of the Constitution states that "[t]he State recognizes the vital role of communication and information in nation building." Article III, Section 7 provides that "[t]he right of the people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized." These provisions create a constitutional framework of opening all possible and available channels for expression to ensure that information on public matters have the widest reach. In this age of information technology, media has expanded from traditional print, radio, and television. Internet has sped data gathering and multiplied the types of output produced. The evolution of multimedia introduced packaging data into compact packets such as "infographics" and "memes." Many from this generation no longer listen to the radio or watch television, and instead are more used to live streaming videos online on their cellular phones or laptops. Social media newsfeeds allow for real-time posting of video excerpts or "screen caps," and engaging comments and reactions that stimulate public discussions on important public matters such as elections. Article IX-C, Section 4 on the Commission on Elections' power of supervision or regulation of media, communication, or information during election period is situated within this context. The Commission on Elections' power of supervision and regulation over media during election period should not be exercised in a way that constricts avenues for public discourse.<br><br><center><b>V</b></center><br>Freedom of expression is a fundamental and preferred right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Any governmental act in prior restraint of speech—that is, any "official governmental restrictions on the press or other forms of expression in advance of actual publication or dissemination"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> —carries a heavy burden of unconstitutionality.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Speech restraint regulation may also be either content-based, "based on the subject matter of the utterance or speech," or content-neutral, "merely concerned with the incidents of the speech, or one that merely controls the time, place or manner, and under well defined standards."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The effect of government's mandate empowering lead networks from excluding other media is a prior restraint, albeit indirectly.

A Concurring Opinion discussed free speech scrutiny against any kind of prior restraint:<br><br><blockquote>While the Commission on Elections does have the competence to interpret Section 6, it must do so without running afoul of the fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution, especially of the guarantee of freedom of expression and the right to suffrage. <b><i>Not only must the Commission on Elections have the competence, it must also be cognizant of our doctrines in relation to any kind of prior restraint.</i></b><br>....<br><br>What Resolution No. 9615 does not take into consideration is that television and radio networks are not similarly situated. <i><b>The industry structure consists of network giants with tremendous bargaining powers that dwarf local community networks.</b></i> Thus, a candidate with only a total aggregate of 120/180 minutes of airtime allocation will choose a national network with greater audience coverage to reach more members of the electorate. Consequently, the big networks can dictate the price, which it can logically set at a higher price to translate to more profits. This is true in any setting especially in industries with high barriers to entry and where there are few participants with a high degree of market dominance. <i><b>Reducing the airtime simply results in a reduction of speech and not a reduction of expenses</b></i>.<br><br>Resolution No. 9615 may result in local community television and radio networks not being chosen by candidates running for national offices. Hence, advertisement by those running for national office will generally be tailored for the national audience. This new aggregate time may, therefore, mean that local issues which national candidates should also address may not be the subject of wide-ranging discussions.<br>....<br><br><i><b>Election regulations are not always content neutrul regulations, and even if they were, they do not necessarily carry a mantle of immunity from free speech scrutiny. The question always is whether the regulations are narrowly tailored so as to meet a significant governmental interest and so that there is a lesser risk of excluding ideas for a public dialogue. The scrutiny for regulations which restrict speech during elections should be greater considering that these exercises substantiate the important right to suffrage</b></i>. Reducing airtime to extremely low levels reduce information to slogans and sound bites which may impoverish public dialogue.
