On the other hand, the subject matter of the Batangas injunction case is the 13 importations/shipments of respondent PSPC for the period January to February 2010, which respondent PSPC claims are threatened to be seized by petitioners pursuant to the Memorandum dated February 9, 2010 issued by petitioner District Collector.<br><br>Also, the cause of action in the CTA case is based on the Letter-Decisions of petitioner COC, finding respondent PSPC liable for excise taxes and VAT; while the cause of action in the Batangas injunction case is the Memorandum dated February 9, 2010, ordering the personnel of petitioner BOC in the Port of Batangas to hold the delivery of all import shipments of respondent PSPC.<br><br><b><i>The issues raised are not the same.</i></b><br><br>Furthermore, the issues raised are not the same. Respondent PSPC filed the CTA case to assail the Letter-Decisions of petitioner COC, finding it liable to pay excise taxes and VAT on its importation of CCG and LCCG. Thus, in the Petition for Review, the main issue involved is the validity of the Letter-Decisions; while in the Verified Motion, the issue raised is respondent PSPC's entitlement to a suspension order pending the resolution of the validity of the Letter-Decisions.<br><br>On the other hand, respondent PSPC filed the Batangas injunction case to question the validity of the Memorandum dated February 9, 2010 and to oppose the seizure of the 13 importations/shipments on the ground that petitioners no longer have jurisdiction over the subject importations/shipments as these have been discharged and placed in its Batangas refinery since 90% of the import duties due on the said shipments have been paid. To support its case, respondent PSPC interposed that Section 1508 of the TCCP is available only if petitioner BOC has actual physical custody of the goods sought to be held, a situation not present in the case of the said importations/shipments; that petitioners have no reason to seize the 13 importations/shipments, as only two were CCG and only one was LCCG; and that the Memorandum dated February 9, 2010 deprives respondent PSPC of its property without due process of law. From the arguments interposed by respondent PSPC in the Batangas injunction case, it is clear that the issue to be resolved by the RTC is limited to the validity of the Memorandum dated February 9, 2010.<br><br><b><i>The reliefs prayed for are not the same.</i></b><br><br>Likewise, a comparison of prayers in the CTA case and Batangas injunction case shows that the reliefs prayed for are not the same.<br><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="30%"><div align="center"><strong>PETITION FOR REVIEW <br><br>&nbsp;(CTA)</strong></div></td><td width="40%"><div align="center"><strong>VERIFIED MOTION<br><br>&nbsp;(CTA)</strong></div></td><td width="30%"><div align="center"><strong>COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTION<br> <br>&nbsp;(RTC)</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that the Honorable Court:<br> <br></div> <div align="justify">a.

Pending the resolution of the said case, respondent PSPC filed a Verified Motion praying for the issuance of a suspension order to prevent petitioners from exercising any action pursuant to Section 1508 of the TCCP based on the Letter-Decisions of petitioner COC. While in the Batangas injunction case, respondent PSPC seeks to prevent petitioners from entering its refinery and from seizing its importations pursuant to Section 1508 of the TCCP by virtue of the Memorandum dated February 9, 2010.<br><br>Since the subject matter, the cause of action, the issues raised, and the reliefs prayed for are not the same, respondents are not guilty of forum shopping.
