SP No. 106407 which modified the Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission. (CIAC)<br><br>On 29 May 2007, TG Universal Business Ventures, Inc. (TG) entered into an Owner-Contractor Agreement (Agreement) with Pro Builders, Inc. (Pro Builders) for the construction of a 15-storey building at Asiatown I.T. Park in Lahug, Cebu City. In consideration of the sum of Seventy Million Pesos (P70,000,000.00), Pro Builders undertook to provide the labor, materials and equipment, and to perform all structural works for the project. On the other hand, TG undertook to pay Pro Builders a down payment of Twenty-One Million Pesos (P21,000,000.00), or equivalent to 30% of the amount of contract. Pursuant to the Agreement, the completion of the project is slated on 31 May 2008 but is subject to extension upon request of Pro Builders to TG, through its Project Manager, Prime Edifice, Inc., on the grounds of force majeure or fortuitous event and/or additional work approved by TG, or any other special circumstances as may be determined by TG.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Upon signing of the Agreement, Pro Builders posted a performance bond obtained from Prudential Guarantee and Assurance, Inc.<br><br>The Notice of Award was issued to Pro Builders on 15 May 2007. The project site was turned over to Pro Builders on 22 May 2007. The construction was set to officially begin on 1 June 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On 19 June 2007, Pro Builders received the 30% down payment equivalent to P21,000,000.00.<br><br>Extremely unsatisfied with the progress of the works, TG took over the project, hired another contractor to finish the work, and demanded the balance of its overpayment from Pro Builders. The parties failed to reach an amicable settlement, prompting TG to file a Request for Arbitration with the CIAC praying for the payment of cost to complete the project, amounting to P13,489,807.48.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><center><b>Request for Arbitration filed by TG</b></center><br>According to the Project Manager, Project Manager, Prime Edifice, Inc., Pro Builders missed its target milestone for July 2007. On 28 August 2007, Project Manager, Prime Edifice, Inc. wrote to Pro Builders raising, serious concerns on the latter's ability to complete the project as scheduled. Project Manager, Prime Edifice, Inc. presented a Performance Evaluation for the period ending 28 August 2007 showing that Pro Builders only accomplished 13.37% out of the 19.09% target accomplishment or a variance of 5.72%. Project Manager, Prime Edifice, Inc. attributed Pro Builders' failure to meet the target to its inability to deploy the required manpower and equipment. On 31 August 2007, Project Manager, Prime Edifice, Inc. recommended to TG a full takeover by a more competent contractor to take effect immediately. Pro Builders responded to Project Manager, Prime Edifice, Inc.'s letter and alleged that some of the delays were attributable to TG, such as the delayed release of down payment and delivery of owner-supplied materials, particularly the reinforcing bars (rebars). For September 2007, Project Manager, Prime Edifice, Inc. revealed that Pro Builders again failed to meet its September milestones, accomplishing only 18.11% out of the 33.42% target accomplishment or slippage of 15.32%.<br><br>Due to the dismal performance of Pro Builders, TG invoked Article 9 of the Agreement or the Option to Complete Work Takeover. Pro Builders refused to turn over the works and demanded the payment of its unpaid progress billings.<br><br>On 11 January 2008, TG sent a Statement of Account to Pro Builders demanding payment of the excess cost to complete the project amounting to P13,489,807.48, which is broken down as follows:<br><blockquote>P5,582,921.10 - unconsumed down payment (21,000,000.00-15,417,078.90 assessed value of Pro Builders accomplishment as of 15 October 2007)<br><br>P7,771,553.04 - additional expenses by engaging another contractor<br><br>P135,333.34 - miscellaneous expenses (violation of Asiatown's guidelines, damage to property, lot rental)<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[6]</sup></font><br></blockquote>On 26 February 2008, TG filed a claim against the surety bond and performance bond.<br><br>The summary of TG's claim is as follows:<br><blockquote><table align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="50%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Unliquidated down payment</div></td> <td width="50%"><div align="JUSTIFY">P5,582,921.10</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Cost to complete</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">7,771,553.04</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Miscellaneous expenses</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">135,333.34</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Litigation expenses</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">700,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Attorney's fees</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">300,000.00</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Total Claims</b></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>P14,489,807.48</b><font color="#ff0000"><sup>[7]</sup></font></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><center><b>Pro Builder's Amended Answer with Counterclaims</b></center><br>In its Answer, Pro Builders claimed that TG incurred delay when it only delivered 16% of the total requirement of rebars, an owner-supplied material.

The Arbitral Tribunal expounded that Pro Builders failed to meet its target due to inability to deploy the required resources, i.e. manpower and equipment. Pro Builders also committed violations of concrete protocol. On the other hand, TG made the down payment only on 19 June 2007 and not upon execution of the Agreement as provided therein. TG also did not pay Pro Builders' progress billings and change order and incurred delay in the delivery of the owner-supplied rebars.<br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal denied TG's claim of P5,582,921.10 representing the unliquidated portion of the dawn payment. The Arbitral Tribunal gave credence to Pro Builders' billed amount of P23,104,642.11 as the value of the accomplished works.<br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal did not agree with TG's claim of P7,771,553.04 as the cost to complete the project. The Arbitral Tribunal held that said value can only be determined after the project has been fully completed. The Arbitral Tribunal favored TG's claim of P58,333.34 for the advanced rental of the staging area after finding that TG paid in advance the rental for a property adjacent to the project site used by Pro Builders.<br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal did not find any justification to award cost of litigation and compensatory damages to both parties.<br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal ruled that Pro Builders is entitled to P2,104,642.11 as the amount of unpaid accomplishment by subtracting the P21,000.000.00 down payment from the total accomplishment of P23,104,642.11.<br><br>The Arbitral Tribunal found that Pro Builders is not entitled to its claim for rental deposit for the forms and scaffoldings.<br><br>With respect to the cost of the bonds, the Arbitral Tribunal held that there is no provision in the contract or in the policy issued by Prudential for the reimbursement of the costs of the bonds. But the Arbitral Tribunal held that Prudential and Pro Builders are solidarity liable on its performance and surety bonds upon the total amount thereof. In the event that Prudential would be made to pay any liability by virtue of the surety and performance bonds, the Arbitral Tribunal stressed that it is only the third-party respondents who will be legally obliged to pay or reimburse the bonding company.<br><br>Aggrieved, TG filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals. challenging in part the Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal, specifically on the following points:<br><blockquote><ol><li>TG was remiss in its obligation when it failed to give Pro Builders the down payment on time.<br><br></li><li>TG was not entitled to reimbursement of P5,582,921.10 which was the balance of the unspent 30% down payment.<br><br></li><li>TG was not allowed to charge P7,771,553.04 to Pro Builders representing the cost of what it had spent in completing the construction.<br><br></li><li>TG did not have any right to miscellaneous expenses of P77,200.00.<br><br></li><li>TG was not entitled to attorney's fees and expenses for litigation, cost of rectification and exemplary damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>The Court of Appeals Decision</b><br></div><br>On 13 October 2010, the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed Decision favoring TG, the decretal portion reads:<br><blockquote><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED IN PART</b>.

P5,582,921.10 as balance of the unspent 30% down payment; P7,771,553.04 as petitioner's cost in completing the subject construction; P77,200.00 as additional miscellaneous expenses; and P500,000.00 as attorney's fees and expenses of litigation.<br><br>b) declaring that petitioner is <b>NOT ENTITLED</b> to cost of rectification and exemplary damages.<br><br>c) deleting the award of P2,104,642.11 to Pro Builders Inc.<br><br>The Decision is <b>AFFIRMED IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals found that all inadequate performance was attributable to Pro Builders alone.<br><br>The appellate court found no delay in the down payment of P21,000,000.00 as its release on 19 June 2007 coincided with Pro Builder's posting of the surety bond. The Court of Appeals found merit in the claim for P5,582,921.10 by subtracting the down payment of P21,000,000.00 by Pro Builder's accomplishments worth P15,417,078.90. The appellate court sustained TG's estimate of Pro Builder's accomplishment to P15,417,078.90 because it was supported by documentary evidence. The appellate court added that TG's receipt of Pro Builder's progress billings did not estop the former from disputing the real amount of the latter's undertakings in the project. As the cost to complete the balance of the construction, the Court of Appeals held that TG is entitled to payment of P7,771,553.04 when it took over the project. Said amount is supported by documents presented by TG but which were disregarded by the Arbitral Tribunal. The appellate court also awarded P77,200.00 to TG, which is the total cost of damages that Pro Builders caused upon the properties of Asiatown I.T. Park where the project was built. Attorney's fees and expenses of litigation were also awarded to TG by the appellate court because it found that TG was compelled to initiate the proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal.<br><br>Pro Builders sought a reconsideration of the unfavorable Decision but it was denied by the Court of Appeals in its Resolution<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[13]</sup></font> dated 16 December 2010.<br><br><center><b>Petition</b><br></center><br>At the outset, Pro Builders implores us to delve into the facts as an exception to the rule that this Court is not a trier of facts. Pro Builders cites as ground the conflicting findings of the Arbitral Tribunal and the Court of Appeals.<br><br>Pro Builders asserts that the Court of Appeals erred in declaring that its accomplishments is worth only P15,417,078.90. Pro Builders refuted the joint evaluation used as basis by the Court of Appeals in denying its valuation on the ground that said joint evaluation was done solely by Project Manager, Prime Edifice, Inc. while Pro Builders' engineers had no participation in the evaluation. Moreover, said evaluation was submitted only on 11 January 2008, long after the contract was terminated. Pro Builders also defend the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal that its progress billings are more accurate and reliable than TG's valuation. Consequently, Pro Builders asserts that it still has a collectible of P2,104,642.11 and from that amount, the sum of P58,333.34 representing the rental of the staging area, should be deducted. TG then is obliged to pay P2,046,308.77 to Pro Builders.<br><br>Pro Builders echoes the Arbitral Tribunal's ruling that the cost overrun cannot be computed because at the time the case was submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal, the project was still not finished.<br><br>Pro Builders questions the award of attorney's fees and expenses of litigation for lack of basis. <br><br>Finally, Pro Builders avers that TG availed of the wrong remedy when it filed a petition for partial review before the Court of Appeals. Pro Builders maintains that the arbitral award of the CIAC is appealable on. questions of law to this Court.<br><br><center><b>OUR RULING <br><br>Procedural Issue</b><br></center><br>Executive Order (EO) No. 1008 vests upon the CIAC original and exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising from, or connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines, whether the dispute arises before or after the completion of the contract, or after the abandonment or breach thereof. Section 19 thereof declares the arbitral award of the CIAC as final and unappealable, except on questions of law, which are appealable to the Supreme Court. By virtue of the amendments introduced by R.A. No. 7902 and promulgation of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, the CIAC was included in the. enumeration of quasi-judicial agencies whose decisions or awards may be appealed to the Court of Appeals in a petition for review under Rule 43. Such review of the CIAC award may involve either questions of fact, of law, or of fact and law.<br><br>The CIAC Revised Rules of Procedure Governing Construction Arbitration provide for the manner and mode of appeal from CIAC decisions or awards in Section 18 thereof, which reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 18.2 Petition for review. - A petition for review from a final award may be taken by any of the parties within fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof in accordance with the provisions of Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>Applying the aforestated rules, the Court of Appeals is correct in taking cognizance of TG's appeal filed via petiti6n for review.<br><br><center><b>Substantive Issues</b><br></center><br>The issues raised by Pro Builders involve a question of fact. A question of fact exists when the issue raised on appeal pertains to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts.

Morgia demanding the settlement of P13,489,807.48 and inadvertently admitted that assessment of Pro Builders' accomplishment was done only by Project Manager, Prime Edifice, Inc., thus:<br><blockquote>We have completed the assessment of your accomplishment for the above project as of October 15, 2007 as well as updated the cost of the project given your original scope of work as quoted by the new contractor, ALCCON pursuant to Article 9, "OPTION TO COMPLETE WORK TAKEOVER" of your contract with TG Universal Business Ventures which states:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>We have attached our computation for your review.

We agree that:<br><br>The documents on cost overrun (official receipts, check disbursement vouchers, billings, etc.) mentioned by the CLAIMANT in its Memorandum/Draft Decision were not participated in by the CONTRACTOR, nor had been confronted by the'CLAIMANT during the hearing for the CONTRACTOR to deny, comment or admit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the progress billings prepared by Pro Builders provide an accurate summary of Pro Builders' accomplishments. Article 5.03 of the Agreement states:<br><blockquote>5.03 The CONTRACTOR shall submit to the OWNER through the PROJECT MANAGER progress billing based on actual accomplishment of the various phases of the PROJECT. The PROJECT MANAGER shall process, certify to the correctness of, and make appropriate recommendations, and based on the recommendations, the OWNER shall make the actual payments. The appropriate recommendation shall be completed within fifteen (15) calendar days from receipt of complete billing documents. Final Payment shall be made in accordance with Article 17 of this Agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Clearly, it is the Project Manager's responsibility to evaluate, certify and recommend the payment of the progress billings. Pursuant to the Agreement, the appropriate recommendation should be completed within fifteen (15) calendar days from receipt of complete billing documents. Pro Builders sent four (4) progress billings to TG from August to October 2007. None of these progress billings were acted upon, paid or contested by TG in violation of the Agreement. On account of TG's failure to act upon the progress billings, it had effectively waived its right to question the accuracy and veracity of Pro Builders' computation, thus the amounts stated in the progress billings are deemed valid and binding on TG, thus:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: center;" width="35%"><b>Progress Billing Date</b></td> <td style="text-align: center;" width="32%"><b>% of Accomplishment</b></td> <td style="text-align: center;" width="33%"><b>Amount</b></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: center;">1 August 2007</td> <td style="text-align: center;">10.27%</td> <td style="text-align: center;">P4,312,616.49<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[24]</sup></font></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: center;">13 September 2007</td> <td style="text-align: center;">19.04%</td> <td style="text-align: center;">P7,997,881.41<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[25]</sup></font></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: center;">1 October 2007</td> <td style="text-align: center;">29.21%</td> <td style="text-align: center;">P12,104,449.63<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[26]</sup></font></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td style="text-align: center;">30 October 2007</td> <td style="text-align: center;">32.65%</td> <td style="text-align: center;"> P2,104,642.11<font color="#ff0000"><sup>[27]</sup></font></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>In <i>F.F. Cruz &amp; Co., Inc. v. HR Construction Corp</i>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Court held that the owner is barred from contesting the contractor's valuation of the completed works when it waived its right to demand the joint measurement requirement. In the same vein, truly with more reason should it be concluded that TG had effectively waived its right to contest the computations in the progress billings since it failed to even act, one way or the other, on the progress billings within the time allowed under the Agreement.<br><br>As shown by the numbers, Pro Builders is entitled to payment of P2,104,642.11 for unpaid accomplishment of works, which amount is arrived at by subtracting the 30% down payment from the total unpaid billings and adding the change order.<br><br>Necessarily, TG's claim for cost to complete project is denied in view of its own failure to comply with its obligations under the Agreement.<br><br><center><b>Both Parties were in Breach of the Agreement</b></center><br>We likewise affirm the Arbitral Tribunal's finding that both parties failed to comply with their obligations under the Agreement. Records reveal that in the Notice of Award, Pro Builders was instructed "to mobilize within 7 days upon receipt of the 30% down payment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> TG Universal however failed to pay the down payment during the signing, as provided for in the Agreement. Pro Builders received the down payment only on 19 June 2007.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Thereafter, Pro Builders sought a clarification from TG as to the exact date of Day 1 of the construction citing as grounds the delay in the receipt of down payment, delay in the delivery of rebars and cement, rebar testing and heavy rainfall causing soil erosion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Pro Builders was asked to support its claims with documents. Upon submission by Pro Builders, TG found these submitted documents lacking in particulars. It was also proven during the proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal that Pro Builders had failed to provide sufficient manpower and equipment which caused further delay to the project. As culled from the circumstances cited above, it is clear that both parties had been remiss in their respective obligations. The respective violations of the parties were encapsulated in the Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>[Pro Builders'] failure to comply with its Obligations/Responsibilities<br><br></b>Violations of concrete protocol as shown in the Concrete Pouring permits and Pouring Logs (Exhibit "C-26").<br><br>The [Pro Builders'] Technical and Financial Annexes (TFIA) showing the equipment it will provide, but was not able to do so for the project (Exhibit "C-5").<br><br>As testified by Engr.

(Annex B, Supplemental Complaint).<br><br>On 09 July 2007, [Pro Builders] asked for time extension without specifying the number of days, but was required by the project Manager to submit additional documents (Exhibit "R-8").<br><br>On 16 July 2007, [Pro Builders] complied with the submittal of the required documents and asked for the start of Day 1 of the construction to be 15 July 2007 (instead of June 26 as provided for in the Notice of Award). [Pro Builders] contends that this was never acted by the Project Manager of the [TG] (Exhibit "R-9").<br><br>What the [Pro Builders] submitted was a Revised Work Schedule, but did not take into account a lot of factors, most especially, the time allocation for each activity. (Annex K, Complaint).<br><br>There was no S-Curve or PERT/CPM Network diagram submitted by the [Pro Builders] from where the corresponding monthly accomplishment can be assessed.<br><br>On 02 August 2007, the [Pro Builders] submitted Progress Billing No. 1 covering the period from June 1 to July 31, 2007. (Exhibit "R-25B" &amp; "R-29").<br><br>On 28 August 2007, the project Manager wrote the [Pro Builders] raising serious concerns on the latter's ability to complete the project as scheduled (No. 14, Complaint).<br><br><b>[Pro Builders'] failure to meet its target could be accounted by its inability to deploy the required resources, i.e. manpower and equipment</b> both of which are major factors in the concrete production output of the [Pro Builders] (Exhibits "C-6" to "C-10").<br><br>[TG] assessed the [Pro Builders'], monthly accomplishment to be behind schedule. The slippage as of 28 August 2007 was (-) 5.72% (Annex "G", Complaint) and (-) 15.32% on 30 September 2007 (Annex "M", Complaint).<br><br>On the delivery of owner-supplied reinforcing bars, the fact that as of 13 August 2007, 967,954.38 kilograms or approximately 968 tons had been delivered is undisputed.

During the hearing, Arch. Morgia alleged that the rebar requirements in the letter of PRO Builders dated 25 September 2007 was due to changes in design. However, there was no evidence presented to establish the [Pro Builders'] contention that there were indeed design changes approved by the [TG].<br><br>As to the alleged delay in the delivery of concrete, [TG's] Summary of concrete Pouring Activities (Exhibit "C-25") indicates the dates of delivery, volume of concrete delivered and location in the project of the concrete pouring activities.
