Landicho, Juris P. Landicho, and Ivy P. Landicho, on the other hand, contended that sometime in June 1994, they were asked by respondent and Romeo Landicho to sign certain documents which turned out to be contracts of sale and lease involving their properties covered by the CLOAs; that by reason of such sale, the owner's duplicate copies of their TCTs were delivered to respondent; and that in affixing their signatures, they did not receive any consideration and the legal implications of the said contracts were not explained to them.<br><br>Petitioners Darwin Landicho, Juris Landicho and Ivy Landicho further stated that they had entrusted their owner's duplicate copies of their TCTs and the CLOAs to their father, Romeo Landicho. In June 1994, however, they came to know that respondent and their father entered into a contract of sale and/or lease involving their properties and by virtue thereof, the TCTs were given to respondent.<br><br>Hence, the petitioners claimed that the transfers of lands covered by their individual CLOAs by Romeo Landicho to respondent were made in violation of Republic Act <i>(R.A.) </i> No. 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988 <i>(CARL), </i>which prohibited the sale, transfer or conveyance of land for a period of ten (10) years;<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[7]</sup></font> and that their consent to such transactions was vitiated by fraud, undue influence and mistake. For said reason, they filed the cases before the PARAD to recover their lands.<br><br>Respondent opposed the petitions. He asserted that he was a purchaser in good faith and for value and that the PARAD had no jurisdiction over the subject petitions because no agrarian dispute was involved.<br><br>In its March 5, 2001 Decision,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the PARAD ruled in favor of the petitioners. On the procedural aspect, it held that it had jurisdiction as the cases involved an agrarian dispute or the <i>"rights and obligations of persons, whether natural or juridical, engaged in the management, cultivation and use of all agricultural lands covered by the CARP and other agrarian laws."</i> It further declared that respondent was already estopped from questioning the jurisdiction over the subject matter because his motion to dismiss was filed seven (7) months after he had submitted his answer. On the merits, the PARAD ordered respondent to surrender the subject CLOAs and TCTs over the properties. The dispositive portion of the PARAD decision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the petitioners as follows:<br><br>A ORDERING respondent, Atty.

They averred that the DARAB gravely erred in ruling that it had jurisdiction over the cases despite the absence of an agrarian issue. This appeal was, however, dismissed due to the failure of Hai to sign the certification of non-forum shopping. Respondent moved for reconsideration and prayed for the admittance of his amended petition with him as the sole petitioner.

In other words, the question posed before the CA pertained to jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case. In <i>Sevilleno v.

Empleo,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Court has categorically stated that when the certification against forum shopping was not signed by all the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case, the effect would be that only those who did not sign would be dropped as parties in the case.<br><br>Accordingly, the failure of respondent's co-appellant to affix her signature should not prejudice his rights. As far as respondent is concerned, he complied with the rules on certification of non-forum shopping to the extent of correcting the apparent lack of Hai's signature by asking the CA to admit the amended petition with him as the sole petitioner.<br><br><i>On Jurisdiction</i><br><br>The CA was of the view that the claims of the petitioners should have been filed with the DAR Secretary following DAR Administrative Order No. 6, Series of 2000, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 2. <i>Cases Covered</i> — These Rules shall govern cases falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the DAR Secretary which shall include the following:<br><br>(a) xxx<br><br>(q) <u>Such other matters not mentioned above but strictly involving the administrative implementation of RA 6657 and other agrarian laws, rules and regulations as determined by the Secretary.</u> (Emphasis supplied).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br><br><i>First,</i> DAR Administrative Order No. 6, Series of 2000 has already been repealed by DAR Administrative Order No. 3, Series of 2003.

(Emphases supplied.)</blockquote><br><br>Specifically, the PARAD and the DARAB have primary and exclusive jurisdiction, both original and appellate, to determine and adjudicate all agrarian disputes involving the implementation of the CARP under R.A. No. 6657, as amended by R.A. No. 9700, E.O. Nos. 228, 229, and 129-A, R.A. No. 3844, as amended by R.A. No. 6389, P.D. No. 27 and other agrarian laws and their Implementing Rules and Regulations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The question here boils down to whether this case falls under the DARAB's jurisdiction as contemplated under the CARL and the 1994 DARAB Rules. Consequently, the question as to what an agrarian dispute is and whether sufficient allegations were indeed made in the petitioners' complaints showing to establish an agrarian dispute must first be resolved.<br><br><i>Agrarian Dispute</i><br><br>Section 3(d) of the CARL defines an agrarian dispute as:<br><br><blockquote>xxx, any controversy relating to tenurial arrangements, whether leasehold, tenancy, stewardship, or otherwise, over lands devoted to agriculture, including disputes concerning farmworkers' associations or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of such tenurial arrangements.</blockquote><br><br>In this case, the petitions filed before the PARAD asking for the nullification of the contracts of sale and recovery of the CLOAs did not contain any allegation of tenurial relations constitutive of an agrarian dispute as the parties were not subjects of a landowner and tenant relationship, or an allegation that they were lessors and lessees of each other as reinforced by the categorical admission of the parties in their pleadings that no such contract exists.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> These circumstances, however, do not mean that the controversy is no longer agrarian in nature.<br><br>The second sentence of Section 3(d) of the CARL clearly provides that an agrarian dispute also includes "any controversy relating to compensation of lands acquired under the CARP law and other terms and conditions of transfer of ownership from landowner to farmworkers, tenants, and other agrarian reform beneficiaries, whether the disputants stand in the proximate relation of farm operator and beneficiary, landowner and tenant, or lessor and lessee."<br><br>Here, the controversy pertains to respondent's act of selling to a third person the lands acquired by the petitioners under the CARP. Hence, the case is still an agrarian dispute and within the jurisdiction of the DARAB and PARAD.<br><br><i>Allegations in the complaints</i><br><br>In order for the DARAB and PARAD to exercise jurisdiction over such controversies, sufficient allegations establishing the existence of an agrarian dispute must be made in the complaint following the rule that the jurisdiction of a tribunal, including a quasi-judicial officer or government agency, over the nature and subject matter of a petition or complaint is determined by the material allegations therein and the character of the relief prayed for, irrespective of whether the petitioner or complainant is entitled to any or all such reliefs.<br><br>In the case at bench, the subject properties, which originally formed part originally of Romeo Landicho's property covered by OCT No. P-29365, were subjected to voluntary land transfer, thereby placing it under the coverage of the CARL. The petitioners became the beneficiaries of the subdivided properties by operation of Section 6 and Section 22 of the CARL,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> commonly referred to as the retention limits of a landowner, who in this case was Romeo Landicho.<br><br>The petitioners made the following allegations m their complaints/petitions:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br><blockquote>(8) Sometime in June 1994, petitioner was asked by respondent (now petitioner) Limqueco and Romeo Landicho to sign certain documents which turned out to be contracts of sale and lease involving petitioner's aforesaid property covered by TCT No. T-4007. Having utmost trust in confidence in his father and respondent Limqueco that they were supposedly protecting petitioner's interest, petitioner without examining said contracts which are undated and which do not indicate the names of the buyer or the lessee, had affixed his signature to said contracts of sales and lease of TCT No. T-4007. Respondent Limqueco and Romeo Landicho did not furnish or give petitioner a copy of said contract which are being used by respondent Limqueco with DAR to harass petitioner.<br><br>(9) In affixing his signature as aforesaid, petitioner did not receive any consideration and was not told the legal implications of said contracts. He came to learn later that by reason of said contracts, the owner's copy of petitioner's TCT No. T-4007 was delivered by his father Romeo Landicho to respondent Limqueco who, by his own admission, has custody and physical possession of said title up to the present.<br><br>(10) Petitioner learned thereafter that the contracts involving the sale and/or lease of his TCT No. T-4007, which is a CLOA title, are null and void as they are prohibited and violates R.A. No. 6657 because under the express restriction incorporated in the CLOA title, the parcel of land subject thereof "shall not be sold transferred or conveyed except through hereditary succession, or to the Government, or to the Land Bank of the Philippines, or to the other qualified beneficiaries for a period often (10) years. x x x x:"<br><br>(11) Petitioner should not be penalized by way of cancellation of his TCT No. T-4007 because he acted in good faith and is not guilty of any fraud considering that his consent to the contracts of sale was vitiated by fraud, undue influence and mistake when he affixed his signature thereto and hence he should be protected under Articles 1412(2) and 1416 of the New Civil Code and other pertinent provisions of law.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[38]</sup></font><br><br><center>xxx</center></blockquote><br><br>These allegations plainly show that the petitioners are invoking their rights as beneficiaries of the CARL; that they consider the conveyance of their properties as having been made in violation of the terms and conditions of the CARL; and that all of the transfers should be nullified because they were procured through fraud, undue influence and mistake. All these constitute an agrarian dispute in the context of a controversy relating to terms and conditions of transfer of ownership from landowner to agrarian reform beneficiaries. This is because the main contention of the parties was clearly couched on the alleged denial by the respondent of their established rights as beneficiaries over the subject properties under agrarian reform laws.<br><br>Accordingly, it is undeniable that the DARAB and PARAD have jurisdiction over this controversy. It was, therefore, an error on the part of the CA to have overturned the rulings of the concerned quasi-judicial bodies on the ground that they had no jurisdiction over the controversy.<br><br><i>Question on Vitiation of Consent</i><br><br>Settled is the rule that this Court is not a trier of facts. In that regard, the Court notes that the CA failed to pass upon the question on whether fraud, undue influence and mistake occasioned the procurement by respondent of the titles to the properties and whether there was indeed a violation of the CARL.<br><br>As there were none, the Court finds it necessary to remand this case to the CA for the proper review of the substantive issues as raised by the parties concerning the legality of the transfer of the properties to the respondent.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED.</b> The June 28, 2010 Decision and November 23, 2010 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 75482 are hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE.</b> The case is <b>REMANDED</b> to the Court of Appeals to determine the merits of the alleged violation of the CARP Law as well as the allegations of fraud in respondent's procurement of the CLOAs and titles over the subject properties.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, J., (Chairperson), Brion, Del Castillo,</i> and <i>Leonen, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i> (G.R.
