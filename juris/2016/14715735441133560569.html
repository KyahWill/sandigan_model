Moreover, the NLRC observed that Toyota failed to comply with the due process requirements as: <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>, the written notice served on the employee did not categorically indicate the specific ground for dismissal sufficient to have given Puncia a reasonable opportunity to explain his side, since the Intra-Company Communication<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> providing the company rules failed to explain in detail that Puncia's deficiency merited the penalty of dismissal;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and <i>second</i>, Puncia's dismissal was not based on the same grounds cited in the Notice to Explain, since the ground indicated was Puncia's failure to meet the sales quota, which is different from the ground stated in the Notice of Termination, which is his unjustified absence during the scheduled hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Both parties filed their separate motions for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> which were denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated August 30, 2013.<br><br>Aggrieved, Toyota filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> before the CA, which was docketed as CA-G.R.

SP No. 132615 annulling and setting aside the NLRC ruling and reinstating that of the LA. It held that Toyota was able to present substantial evidence in support of its contention that there was just cause in Puncia's dismissal from employment and that it was done in compliance with due process, considering that: (<span style="font-style: italic;">a</span>) Puncia's repeated failure to meet his sales quota constitutes gross inefficiency and gross neglect of duties; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">b</span>) Puncia was afforded due process as he was able to submit a written explanation within the period given to him by Toyota.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, Puncia filed a motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which the CA-First Division denied in the assailed Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> dated September 23, 2014 (September 23, 2014 Resolution).<br><br>Meanwhile, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> dated July 22, 2014, the CA-Eleventh Division reconsidered its dismissal of CA-G.R.

SP No. 132615, <i>i.e.</i>, the assailed June 9, 2014 Decision and September 23, 2014 Resolution, should be set aside and the case be remanded back to the CA for consolidation with CA-G.R.

SP No. 132615, considering that at the time of promulgation, there was no other pending case before the CA involving the same issues and parties as CA-G.R. SP No. 132674 was dismissed by the CA-Eleventh Division on November 29, 2013, and was only reinstated on July 22, 2014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issues Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The issues for the Court's resolution are (<i>a</i>) whether or not the CA-First Division correctly promulgated its June 9, 2014 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 132615 without consolidating the same with CA-G.R. SP No. 132674; and (<i>b</i>) whether or not Puncia was dismissed from employment for just cause.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is denied.<br><br>At the outset, the Court notes that consolidation of cases is a procedure sanctioned by the Rules of Court for actions which involve a common question of law or fact before the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It is a procedural device granted to the court as an aid in deciding how cases in its docket are to be tried so that the business of the court may be dispatched expeditiously and with economy while providing justice to the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The rationale for consolidation is to have all cases, which are intimately related, acted upon by one branch of the court to avoid the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and in effect, prevent confusion, unnecessary costs,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It is an action sought to avoid multiplicity of suits; guard against oppression and abuse; clear congested dockets; and to simplify the work of the trial court in order to attain justice with the least expense and vexation to the parties-litigants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In order to determine whether consolidation is proper, the test is to check whether the cases involve the <b>resolution</b> of common questions of law, related facts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> or the same parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Consolidation is proper whenever the subject matter involved and the relief demanded in the different suits make it expedient for the court to determine all of the issues involved and adjudicate the rights of the parties by hearing the suits together.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> <b><u>However, it must be stressed that an essential requisite of consolidation is that the several actions which should be pending before the court, arise from the same act, event or transaction, involve the same or like issues, and depend largely or substantially on the same evidence.</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> As succinctly stated in the rules, consolidation is allowed when there are <b><u>similar actions which are pending before the court</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> - for there is nothing to consolidate when a matter has already been resolved and the very purpose of consolidation, to avoid conflicting decisions and multiplicity of suits, rendered futile. The Court's pronouncement in <i>Honoridez v. Mahinay</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> is instructive on this matter, to wit:<br><blockquote>Petitioners attempt to revive the issues in Civil Case No. CEB-16335 by moving for the consolidation of the same with Civil Case No. CEB-23653. <b><u>Under Section 1, Rule 31 of the Rules of Court, only pending actions involving a common question of law or fact may be consolidated.</u></b> Obviously, petitioners cannot make out a case for consolidation in this case since Civil Case No. CEB-16335, the case which petitioners seek to consolidate with the case <i>a quo</i>, has long become final and executory; as such, it cannot be re-litigated in the instant proceedings without virtually impeaching the correctness of the decision in the other case. Public policy abhors such eventuality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In the instant case, while there were indeed two (2) separate petitions filed before the CA assailing the Decision dated February 14, 2013 and the Resolution dated August 30, 2013 of the NLRC in NLRC NCR CN. 10-15949-11/NLRC LAC No. 07-001991-12, <i>i.e.</i>, CA-G.R. SP No. 132615 and CA-G.R. SP No. 132674, it must nevertheless be stressed that CA-G.R. SP No. 132674 was dismissed by the CA-Eleventh Division as early as November 29, 2013 due to procedural grounds. This fact was even pointed out by the CA-First Division in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> dated January 24, 2014 when it held that CA-G.R. SP No. 132674 could no longer be consolidated with CA-G.R. SP No. 132615 since the former case had already been dismissed. From that point until the CA-First Division's promulgation of the assailed June 9, 2014 Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 132615, no consolidation between CA-G.R. SP No. 132615 and CA-G.R. SP No. 132674 could take place mainly because the latter case remained dismissed during that time. In other words, when the CA-First Division promulgated its ruling in CA-G.R. SP No. 132615, it was the <b><u>one and only</u></b> case pending before the CA assailing the aforesaid NLRC rulings. Therefore, the CA-First Division acted within the scope of its jurisdiction when it promulgated its ruling in CA-G.R. SP No. 132615 without having the case consolidated with CA-G.R. SP No. 132674, notwithstanding the latter case's reinstatement <b><u>after</u></b> said promulgation.<br><br>It should be emphasized that the consolidation of cases is aimed to simplify the proceedings as it contributes to the swift dispensation of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> As such, it is addressed to the sound discretion of the court and the latter's action in consolidation will not be disturbed in the absence of manifest abuse of discretion tantamount to an evasion of a positive duty or a refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> which is absent in this case.<br><br>The foregoing notwithstanding, the Court deems it appropriate to look into the issue of the validity of Puncia's dismissal so as to finally resolve the main controversy at hand.<br><br>In his petition, Puncia insists that the CA gravely erred in upholding his dismissal, considering that the administrative proceeding against him was due to his failure to meet his monthly sales quota, but he was dismissed on the ground of gross insubordination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> On the other hand, Toyota maintains that the CA correctly declared Puncia's termination to be valid and in compliance with due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>It is settled that "for a dismissal to be valid, the rule is that the employer must comply with both substantive and procedural due process requirements. Substantive due process requires that the dismissal must be pursuant to either a just or an authorized cause under Articles 297, 298 or 299 (formerly Articles 282, 283, and 284)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> of the Labor Code. Procedural due process, on the other hand, mandates that the employer must observe the twin requirements of notice and hearing before a dismissal can be effected."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Thus, to determine the validity of Puncia's dismissal, there is a need to discuss whether there was indeed just cause for his termination.<br><br>In the instant case, records reveal that as a Marketing Professional for Toyota, Puncia had a monthly sales quota of seven (7) vehicles from March 2011 to June 2011. As he was having trouble complying with said quota, Toyota even extended him a modicum of leniency by lowering his monthly sales quota to just three (3) vehicles for the months of July and August 2011; but even then, he still failed to comply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> In that six (6)-month span, Puncia miserably failed in satisfying his monthly sales quota, only selling a measly five (5) vehicles out of the 34 he was required to sell over the course of said period. Verily, Puncia's repeated failure to perform his duties - <i>i.e.</i>, reaching his monthly sales quota - for such a period of time falls under the concept of gross inefficiency. In this regard, case law instructs that "gross inefficiency" is analogous to "gross neglect of duty," a just cause of dismissal under Article 297 of the Labor Code, for both involve specific acts of omission on the part of the employee resulting in damage to the employer or to his business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> In <i>Aliling v. Feliciano</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the Court held that an employer is entitled to impose productivity standards for its employees, and the latter's non-compliance therewith can lead to his termination from work, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>[T]he practice of a company in laying off workers because they failed to make the work quota has been recognized in this jurisdiction, x x x. In the case at bar, <b><u>the petitioners' failure to meet the sales quota assigned to each of them constitute a just cause of their dismissal</u></b>, regardless of the permanent or probationary status of their employment. <b><u>Failure to observe prescribed standards of work, or to fulfill reasonable work assignments due to inefficiency may constitute just cause for dismissal. Such inefficiency is understood to mean failure to attain work goals or work quotas, either by failing to complete the same within the allotted reasonable period, or by producing unsatisfactory results.</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Indisputably, Toyota complied with the substantive due process requirement as there was indeed just cause for Puncia's termination.<br><br>Anent the issue of procedural due process, Section 2 (I), Rule XXIII, Book V of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> provides for the required standard of procedural due process accorded to employees who stand to be terminated from work, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 2. <i>Standards of due process; requirements of notice</i>. - In all cases of termination of employment, the following standards of due process shall be substantially observed:<br><br>I. For termination of employment based on just causes as defined in Article 282 [now Article 297] of the Labor Code:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) A written notice served on the employee specifying the ground or grounds for termination, and giving to said employee reasonable opportunity within which to explain his side;<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(b) A hearing or conference during which the employee concerned, with the assistance of counsel if the employee so desires, is given opportunity to respond to the charge, present his evidence, or rebut the evidence presented against him; and<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(c) A written notice of termination served on the employee indicating that upon due consideration of all the circumstances, grounds have been established to justify his termination.<br></div></blockquote>The foregoing standards were then further refined in <i>Unilever Philippines, Inc. v. Rivera</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>To clarify, the following should be considered in terminating the services of employees:<br><br>(1) <b><u>The first written notice to be served on the employees should contain the specific causes or grounds for termination against them,</u></b> and a directive that the employees are given the opportunity to submit their written explanation within a reasonable period. "Reasonable opportunity" under the Omnibus Rules means every kind of assistance that management must accord to the employees to enable them to prepare adequately for their defense. This should be construed as a period of at least five (5) calendar days from receipt of the notice to give the employees an opportunity to study the accusation against them, consult a union official or lawyer, gather data and evidence, and decide on the defenses they will raise against the complaint. <b><u>Moreover, in order to enable the employees to intelligently prepare their explanation and defenses, the notice should contain a detailed narration of the facts and circumstances that will serve as basis for the charge against the employees. A general description of the charge will not suffice.</u></b> Lastly, the notice should specifically mention which company rules, if any, are violated and/or which among the grounds under Art. 282 is being charged against the employees.<br><br>(2) After serving the first notice, the employers should schedule and conduct a hearing or conference wherein the employees will be given the opportunity to: (1) explain and clarify their defenses to the charge against them; (2) present evidence in support of their defenses; and (3) rebut the evidence presented against them by the management. During the hearing or conference, the employees are given the chance to defend themselves personally, with the assistance of a representative or counsel of their choice. Moreover, this conference or hearing could be used by the parties as an opportunity to come to an amicable settlement.<br><br>(3) <b><u>After determining that termination of employment is justified, the employers shall serve the employees a written notice of termination indicating that: (1) all circumstances involving the charge against the employees have been considered; and (2) grounds have been established to justify the severance of their employment.</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In this case, at first glance it seemed like Toyota afforded Puncia procedural due process, considering that: (<i>a</i>) Puncia was given a Notice to Explain;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (<i>b</i>) Toyota scheduled a hearing on October 17, 2011 regarding the charge stated in the Notice to Explain;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (<i>c</i>) on the date of the hearing, Puncia was able to submit a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> addressed to Toyota's vehicle sales manager explaining his side, albeit he failed to attend said hearing; and (<i>d</i>) Toyota served a written Notice of Termination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> informing Puncia of his dismissal from work. However, a closer look at the records reveals that in the Notice to Explain, Puncia was being made to explain why no disciplinary action should be imposed upon him for repeatedly failing to reach his monthly sales quota, which act, as already adverted to earlier, constitutes gross inefficiency. On the other hand, a reading of the Notice of Termination shows that Puncia was dismissed not for the ground stated in the Notice to Explain, but for gross insubordination on account of his non-appearance in the scheduled October 17, 2011 hearing without justifiable reason. In other words, while Toyota afforded Puncia the opportunity to refute the charge of gross inefficiency against him, the latter was completely deprived of the same when he was dismissed for gross insubordination - a completely different ground from what was stated in the Notice to Explain. As such, Puncia's right to procedural due process was violated.<br><br>Hence, considering that Toyota had dismissed Puncia for a just cause, albeit failed to comply with the proper procedural requirements, the former should pay the latter nominal damages in the amount of P30,000.00 in accordance with recent jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
