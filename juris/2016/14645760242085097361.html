				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The opportunities for the Court to revisit its ruling in <i>Mendoza vs. COMELEC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><i> (Mendoza)</i> are sparse. It is a rarity for us to be presented a case assailing the COMELEC <i>en banc's</i> reversal of its division's ruling notwithstanding the former's failure to muster the four (4) votes required under our Constitution to do so. In fact, the September 1, 2015 Decision in the case at bench is only second to the seminal case of <i>Mendoza</i> to have resolved such an issue. The Court must, therefore, take advantage of this rare opportunity, on reconsideration, to modify the <i>Mendoza </i>doctrine before it further takes root, deeply entrenched in our jurisprudence.<br><br>The facts of this case are simple and undisputed.<br><br>To recapitulate, petitioner Feliciano Legaspi (Legaspi) and private respondent Alfredo D. Germar (Germar) both ran as mayoralty candidates in Norzagaray, Bulacan while private respondent Rogelio Santos (Santos) was a candidate for councilor in the May 13, 2013 elections.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> On May 14, 2013 Legaspi filed a Petition for Disqualification against private respondents, docketed as SPA No. 13-353 (DC). There, petitioner averred that from May 11, 2013 until election day, private respondents engaged in massive vote-buying, using their political leaders as conduits. As per witness accounts, said political leaders, while camped inside the North Hills Village Homeowners Association Office in Brgy. Bitungol, Norzagaray, Bulacan, were distributing to voters envelopes containing Php 500.00 each and a sample ballot bearing the names of private respondents. Through military efforts, the vote-buying was foiled and the office, which served as the venue for distribution, padlocked. The newly-minted Chief of Police, P/Supt. Dale Soliba, and his subordinates then attempted to force open the office and retrieve from inside four (4) boxes containing the remaining undistributed envelopes with an estimated aggregate amount of Php800,000.00, but a group of concerned citizens were able to thwart their plan in <i>flagrante delicto</i> and intercept the said evidence of vote-buying.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>In answer, private respondents denied the allegations and raised the alibi that from 3:00 o'clock to 11:00 o'clock in the evening of May 11, 2013, they attended the Liberal Party's meeting <i>de avance</i> at the San Andres Parish church grounds, and that they did not go to nor visit the office of the Homeowner's Association of North Hills Village at the time the election offenses were allegedly committed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Giving due credence and consideration to the evidence adduced by petitioner,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the COMELEC Special First Division, by a 2-1 vote on October 3, 2013, disqualified private respondents from the 2013 electoral race. The dispositive portion of the COMELEC resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the Commission <b>RESOLVED</b> as it hereby RESOLVES to:<br><br>(1) <b>DISQUALIFY</b> Respondents Alfredo M. Gesmar (sic) and Rogelio C. Santos, Jr. for the positions of Mayor and Councilor of Norzagaray, Bulacan;<br><br>(2) <b>REFER</b> the criminal aspect of this case against Germar (sic), Roberto Esquivel, Rogelio Santos, Jr., Dale Soliba, Dominador Rayo, Marivic Nunez, Adelaida Auza, Amelia Cruz, and Leonardo Ignacio to the Law Department for preliminary investigation; and<br><br>(3) <b>ORDER</b> the Regional Election Director of COMELEC Region III to implement this Resolution, following the rules on succession as provided in R.A. 7160.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b></blockquote>Thereafter, private respondents moved for reconsideration before the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> but the latter, through its July 10, 2014 Resolution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> resolved to deny private respondents' motion thusly:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the Commission <b>RESOLVED</b>, as it hereby <b>RESOLVES</b> to <u><b>DENY</b></u> this Motion for Reconsideration for LACK OF MERIT. Consequently, the October 3, 2013 Resolution of the Special First Division (1) disqualifying respondents Alfredo M. Germar and Rogelio C. Santos, Jr. for the positions of Mayor and Councilor of Norzagaray, Bulacan; (2) referring the criminal aspect of this case against Alfredo M. Germar, Roberto Esquivel, Rogelio Santos, Jr., Dale Soliba, Dominador Rayo, Marivic Nunez, Adelaida Auza, Amelia Cruz and Leonardo Ignacio to the Law Department for preliminary investigation and (3) ordering the Regional Election Director of COMELEC Region III to implement this Resolution, following the Rules on Succession as provided under R.A. 7160 is hereby <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.</blockquote><br>The adverted Resolution had a vote of<b> 3-2-1-1</b>, as follows: three (3) commissioners, namely Chairman Sixto S. Brillantes, Jr. and commissioners Lucenito N. Tagle and Elias R. Yusoph, voted for the denial of the motion, while two (2) commissioners, Christian Robert S. Lim and Luie Tito F. Guia, dissented. Commissioner Al A. Parreno took no part in the deliberations and Commissioner Maria Grace Cielo M. Padaca did not vote as her <i>ad interim</i> appointment had already expired, vacating a seat in the electoral tribunal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Since the Resolution was not concurred in by four (4) votes or a majority of all the members of the COMELEC, a re-deliberation of the administrative aspect of the case was conducted pursuant to Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure. The re-deliberation resulted in the issuance of the assailed Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> dated January 28, 2015 with a 3-2-2 vote: the previously voting commissioners maintained their respective positions while then newly-appointed commissioner Arthur D. Lim took no part in the deliberations and abstained from voting.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Citing the same procedural rule, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> dismissed the original Petition for Disqualification filed by Legaspi in the following wise:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the Commission <b>RESOLVED</b>, as it hereby <b>RESOLVES</b> to <b>DISMISS</b> the administrative aspect of this Petition for Disqualification for<b> FAILURE TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY MAJORITY VOTES AFTER RE-DELIBERATION/REHEARING</b> by the members of the Commission <i>en banc.</i><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br></blockquote><br>Perplexed as to how he who prevailed before the COMELEC Special First Division can face defeat before the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> when three (3) commissioners voted to deny private respondents' motion for reconsideration and only two (2) commissioners voted to reverse the judgment in his favor, Legaspi launched a Rule 64 petition assailing the January 28, 2015 COMELEC <i>en banc</i> Order before this Court. Regrettably, the Court, on September 1, 2015, voted to dismiss the petition.<br><br>From the September 1, 2015 Decision, petitioner Legaspi interposed the instant motion for reconsideration. Hence, the Court is faced once again with the issue on how to treat the rulings of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> when less than four (4) votes were cast to either grant or deny the motion for reconsideration pending before it.<br><br><b><center>The Court's Ruling<br></center></b><br>The Court <b>GRANTS</b> petitioner's motion for reconsideration. The September 1, 2015 Decision in the case at bar is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>, and the instant petition is <b>GRANTED.</b><br><br>Primarily, the Court is called to interpret Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules on Procedure. The provision reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 6. Procedure if Opinion is Equally Divided.</b> - When the Commission <i>en banc </i>is equally divided in opinion, or the necessary majority cannot be had, the case shall be reheard, and if on rehearing no decision is reached, the action or proceeding shall be dismissed if originally commenced in the Commission; in appealed cases, the judgment or order appealed from shall stand affirmed; <u><b>and all incidental matters, the petition or motion shall be denied</b></u>." (emphasis added)</blockquote><br>As framed in the September 1, 2015 Decision, the afore-cited provision outlines the effects of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>'s failure to decide:<br><br><ol><li>If the action or proceeding is <i>originally commenced</i> in the COMELEC, <b>such action or proceeding shall be dismissed;</b><br></li><li> In <i>appealed cases</i>,<b> the judgment or order appealed from shall stand affirmed;</b> or<br></li><li> In <i>incidental matters</i>, <b>the petition or motion shall be denied.</b></li></ol><br>In dismissing Legaspi's petition on September 1, 2015, the Court first categorized SPA No. 13-353 (DC) as an action "<i>originally commenced with the Commissio</i>n" warranting the entire case's dismissal should the <i>en banc</i> fail to reach the required majority vote, regardless of the COMELEC division's ruling. This, according to the <i>ponencia,</i> is the first effect of Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, as previously applied in <i>Mendoza</i>.<br><br>To summarize <i>Mendoza, </i>therein petitioner Joselito R. Mendoza (Mendoza) was proclaimed winner of the 2007 gubernatorial election for the province of Bulacan, besting respondent Roberto M. Pagdanganan (Pagdanganan). On June 1, 2007, Pagdanganan filed an election protest that the COMELEC Second Division eventually granted, thereby annulling Mendoza's proclamation. Aggrieved, Mendoza moved for reconsideration with the <i>en banc</i>, but the COMELEC failed to reach a majority vote to either grant or deny the motion. Pursuant to its rules, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> reheard the case but was, nevertheless, unsuccessful in obtaining the required majority vote to render a valid ruling. Thus, in a <b>3-1</b> vote, with three votes denying the motion, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> sustained the ruling of its Second Division.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On petition with the Court, Mendoza pointed out that because the necessary majority vote of four (4) was not obtained by the COMELEC<i> en banc</i>, Pagdanganan's election protest ought to be dismissed. Agreeing, the Court, on March 25, 2010, ruled for Mendoza and explained that as an original action before the Commission, failure to muster the required majority vote on reconsideration would lead to the election protest's dismissal, not just of the motion for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Aside from relying on the <i>Mendoza </i>ruling, the September 1, 2015 Decision discussed that a motion for reconsideration lodged with the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>is not an "<i>action or proceeding</i>" within the contemplation of the rules; that the phrase ought to be construed as pertaining to Part V of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, denominated as "<i>Particular Actions or Proceedings</i>" and covering Rules 20-34. Thus, the Court applied the first effect and ordered that Legaspi's Petition for Disqualification, the alleged "<i>action or proceeding</i>" in this case, be dismissed in its entirety.<br><br><i><b>The interpretation of Sec. 6, Rule 18<br>of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure in Mendoza<br>and in the September 1, 2015 Decision <br>renders the rule unconstitutional</b></i><br><br>The <i>Mendoza</i> doctrine, as reiterated in the September 1, 2015 Decision, deviated from the 1987 Constitution. Not only does it circumvent the four-vote requirement under Sec. 7, Art. IX-A of the Constitution, it likewise diminishes the adjudicatory powers of the COMELEC Divisions under Sec. 3, Article IX-C.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Under Sec. 3, Article IX-C of the 1987 Constitution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the COMELEC Divisions are granted adjudicatory powers to decide election cases, provided that the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> shall resolve motions for reconsideration of the division rulings. Further, under Sec. 7, Article IX-A of the Constitution,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> four (4) votes are necessary for the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to decide a case. Naturally, the party moving for reconsideration, as the party seeking affirmative relief, carries the burden of proving that the division committed reversible error. The movant then shoulders the obligation of convincing four (4) Commissioners to grant his or her plea.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><b>This voting threshold, however, is easily rendered illusory by the application of the <i>Mendoza</i> ruling, which virtually allows the grant of a motion for reconsideration even though the movant fails to secure four votes in his or her favor, in blatant violation of Sec. 7, Art. IX-A of the Constitution</b>. In this case, in spite of securing only two (2) votes to grant their motion for reconsideration, private respondents were nevertheless declared the victors in the January 28, 2015 COMELEC <i>en banc</i> Resolution.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[18]</sup></font><br><br>To exacerbate the situation, the circumvention of the four-vote requirement, in turn, trivializes the proceedings before the COMELEC divisions and presents rather paradoxical scenarios, to wit:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br><ol type="i"><li> The failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to muster the required majority vote only means that it could not have validly decided the case. Yet curiously, it managed to reverse the ruling of a body that has properly exercised its adjudicatory powers; and<br><br></li><li>A motion for reconsideration may be filed on the ground that the evidence is insufficient to justify the decision, order or ruling; or that the said decision, order or ruling is contrary to law. If the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> does not find that either ground exists, there would be no cogent reason to disturb the ruling of the COMELEC division. Otherwise stated, failure to muster four votes to sustain the motion for reconsideration should be understood as tantamount to the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> finding no reversible error attributable to its division's ruling. Said decision, therefore, ought to be affirmed, not reversed nor vacated.</li></ol><br>These resultant paradoxes have to be avoided. Under the prevailing interpretation of Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, a movant, in situations such as this, need not even rely on the strength of his or her arguments and evidence to win a case, and may, instead, choose to rest on inhibitions and abstentions of COMELEC members to produce the same result. To demonstrate herein, it is as though the two (2) abstention votes were counted in favor of the private respondents to reach the majority vote of four (4). This impedes and undermines the adjudicatory powers of the COMELEC divisions by allowing their rulings to be overruled by the <i>en banc</i> without the latter securing the necessary number to decide the case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>From the foregoing disquisitions, it is then difficult to see how the <i>Mendoza</i> doctrine "<i>complements our Constitution.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Far from it, the prevailing interpretation of Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure severely suffers from constitutional infirmities and calls for the nullification of the rule itself.<br><br><i><b>The motion for reconsideration<br>before the COMELEC en banc<br> is an "incidental matter"</b></i><br><br>Proceeding to the core of the controversy, we now apply Sec. 6, Rule 18 in the case at bar. As discussed in the September 1, 2015 <i>ponencia</i>:<br><br><blockquote>xxx [T]he effects of the COMELEC <i>en banc's</i> failure to decide vary <b>depending on the <i>type of case or <u>matter</u></i><u> that is before the commission</u></b>. Thus, under the provision, the first effect (<i>i.e</i>., the dismissal of the action or proceeding) only applies when the type of case before the COMELEC is an action or proceeding "<i>originally commenced in the commission</i>"; the <b>second effect</b> (<i>i.e.</i>, the affirmance of a judgment or order) only applies when the type of case before the COMELEC is an "appealed case"; and the <b>third effect (<i>i.e.</i>, the denial of the petition or motion) only applies when the case or matter before the COMELEC is an "<i>incidental matter</i>.</b>" (emphasis added)</blockquote><br>Verily, <b>classifying the pending case or matter before the COMELEC is a prerequisite to identifying the applicable effect</b>. Here, while the case originated from Legaspi's filing of a Petition for Disqualification, said petition has already been passed upon and decided by the COMELEC Special First Division on October 3, 2013. Instead, what was under consideration when Sec. 6, Rule 18 was invoked was no longer Legaspi's petition for disqualification itself but his <b>motion for reconsideration</b> before the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>. The pending issue at the time was not directly private respondents' qualification or disqualification to run for or hold office, but, more precisely, whether or not the COMELEC division committed reversible error in its October 3, 2013 ruling.<br><br><b>For the first effect to apply, the pending case or matter must be an original action or proceeding originally commenced before the COMELEC</b>. This could take either of two forms: those originally commenced with the COMELEC Division or those originally commenced with the COMELEC <i>en banc.</i><br><br>Under Article IX-C, Sec. 2(2) of the Constitution, actions originally commenced before the COMELEC Division consist of all contests relating to the elections, returns, and qualifications of all elective regional, provincial, and city officials.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> On the other hand, the cases directly filed with the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> are those specifically provided in the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, such as petitions for postponement of elections under Sec. 1, Rule 26, petitions for failure of election under Sec. 2, Rule 26, complaints or charges for indirect contempt under Sec. 2, Rule 29, preliminary investigation of election offenses under Sec. 1, Rule 34, and all other cases where the COMELEC division is not authorized to act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In this case, while the motion for reconsideration was filed with the COMELEC en banc in the first instance, it cannot strictly be considered as an "<i>action or proceeding"</i> originally commenced with the commission as contemplated by the rules. As held in the September 1, 2015 Decision, the coverage of the phrase is limited to those itemized in Part V of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, viz:<br><br><blockquote><div align="center"><b>COMELEC RULES OF PROCEDURE - PART V</b><br><b>PARTICULAR ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS</b><br></div><br><center>A. ORDINARY ACTIONS</center><br>• Rule 20 - Election Protests<br>• Rule 21 - Quo Warranto<br>•&nbsp; Rule 22 - Appeals from Decisions of Courts in Election Protest Cases<br><br><center>B. SPECIAL ACTIONS</center><br>• Rule 23 - Petition to Deny Due Course To or Cancel Certificates of Candidacy<br>•Rule 24 - Proceedings Against Nuisance Candidates<br>•Rule 25 - Disqualification of Candidates<br>• Rule 26 - Postponement of Suspension of Elections<br><br><center>C. IN SPECIAL CASES</center><br>• Rule 27 - Pre-proclamation Controversies<br><br><center>D. SPECIAL RELIEFS</center><br>• Rule 28 - <i>Certiorari</i>, Prohibition and Mandamus<br>• Rule 29 - Contempt<br><br><center>E.

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS</center><br><br>•&nbsp; Rule 31 - Annulment of Permanent List of Voters<br>•&nbsp; Rule 32 — Registration of Political Parties or Organization<br>•&nbsp; Rule 33 - Accreditation of Citizens' Arms of the Commission<br><br><center>G. ELECTION OFFENSES<br></center><br>• Rule 34 - Prosecution of Election Offenses<br></blockquote><br>It bears stressing that the first effect would only apply if the tie vote was in the resolution of the "<i>action or proceeding</i>" originally commenced before the COMELEC. But given that the pending matter when the vote was cast was the resolution of the motion for reconsideration, which is neither an action nor a proceeding within the ambit of Part V of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, the first effect cannot therefore be applied in this case.<br><br><b>The second effect cannot likewise be applied herein for it requires that the pending case or matter be an appeal.</b> Worth maintaining is this doctrine in<i> Mendoza</i>: a motion for reconsideration is a constitutionally guaranteed remedial mechanism for parties aggrieved by a division decision or resolution, but not an appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> In the same vein, it was held in <i>Apo Fruits Corporation v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> that "<i>[t]he Supreme Court sitting en banc is not an appellate court vis-a-vis its Divisions, and it exercises no appellate jurisdiction over the latter. Each division of the Court is considered not a body inferior to the Court en banc, and sits veritably as the Court en banc itself</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>This leaves the court with the<b> third effect</b>: that<b> the petition <u>or motion</u> will be dismissed in incidental matters.</b><br><br>The Court now determines whether the motion for reconsideration of private respondents is an "<i>incidental matter</i>" to which the third effect will apply. Without doubt, the answer is in the affirmative.<br><br>In the August 24, 2010 ruling in <i>League of Cities vs. COMELEC</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> the Court applied Sec.7, Rule 56 of the Rules of Court, which reads:<br><br><blockquote><center><b>Rule 56 <br>Procedure in the Supreme Court</b></center><br>x x x x <br><br><b>SEC. 7. <i>Procedure if opinion is equally divided</i></b>. - Where the court en banc is equally divided in opinion, or the necessary majority cannot be had, the case shall again be deliberated on, and if after such deliberation no decision is reached, the original action commenced in the court shall be dismissed; in appealed cases, the judgment or order appealed from shall stand affirmed; and <b>on all incidental matters, the petition or motion shall be denied.</b> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>As can be gleaned, the afore-quoted rule bears striking similarity with Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure. In the adverted ruling, Senior Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio (Justice Carpio) explained that<b> a motion for reconsideration is an incidental matter</b>, and that application of Sec. 7, Rule 56 thereto has been clarified in A.M. No. 99-1-09-SC<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> wherein the Court resolved as follows:<br><br><i><blockquote>A MOTION FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF A DECISION OR RESOLUTION OF THE COURT EN BANG OR OF A DIVISION MAY BE GRANTED UPON A VOTE OF A MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE EN BANC OR OF A DIVISION, AS THE CASE MAY BE, WHO ACTUALLY TOOK PART IN THE DELIBERATION OF THE MOTION.<br><br><b>IF THE VOTING RESULTS IN A TIE, THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION IS DEEMED DENIED.</b> (emphasis added)</blockquote></i><br>Free from ambiguity, the plain meaning of the clarificatory resolution is that the motion for reconsideration, being an incidental matter, is deemed denied if no majority vote is reached. Consequently, the Court's prior majority action in such cases stands affirmed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><i>Defensor-Santiago vs. COMELEC</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> served as jurisprudential basis for the pronouncement in the August 24, 2010 <i>League of Cities</i> ruling. In the cited case, eight (8) Justices of the Supreme Court, as against five (5), voted to declare Republic Act No. 6735<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> insufficient to cover the system of initiative on amendments to the Constitution, and to nullify the COMELEC rules and regulations prescribing the conduct thereof. On reconsideration, the Court was equally-divided, 6-6, yet the prior Decision was never deemed overturned. The deadlock was interpreted to mean that the opposite view failed to muster enough votes to modify or reverse the majority ruling. Therefore, the motion for reconsideration was denied and the original Decision, upheld.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Noticeably, <i>Mendoza</i>, which was decided by the Court on March 25, 2010, preceded the August 24, 2010 <i>League of Cities</i> ruling. In the latter <i>en banc </i>case, the Court set the precedent that the failure to reach the majority vote on reconsideration would only result in the denial of the motion alone.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[33]</sup></font><br><br>There is no reason why the same procedural principle in<i> League of Cities,</i> as embodied in A.M. No. 99-1-09-SC, cannot find application in election cases. <b>With Sec. 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure couched in terms that are almost identical with Sec. 7, Rule 56 of the Rules of Court, the interpretation of one ought not deviate from the other.</b> <i>Interpretare et cocordare leges legibus est optimus interpretandi modus</i>. The rule is that a statute must be construed not only to be consistent with itself but also to harmonize with other laws so as to form a complete, coherent and intelligible system.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> A.M. No. 99-1-09-SC on Sec. 7, Rule 56 of the Rules of Court should then be given suppletory application"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> to election cases for a singular interpretation of the similarly phrased rules, more particularly to the treatment of less than majority votes on motions for reconsideration before the COMELEC <i>en banc.</i><br><br>In conclusion, Sec. 3, Article IX-C of the Constitution bestows on the COMELEC divisions the authority to decide election cases. Their decisions are capable of attaining finality, without need of any affirmative or confirmatory action on the part of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>. And while the Constitution requires that the motions for reconsideration be resolved by the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>, it likewise requires that four votes must be reached for it to render a valid ruling and, consequently, to GRANT the motion for reconsideration of private respondents. Hence, when the private respondents failed to get the four-vote requirement on their motion for reconsideration, their motion is defeated and lost as there was NO valid ruling to sustain the plea for reconsideration. The prior valid action - the COMELEC Special First Division's October 3, 2013 Resolution in this case - therefore subsists and is affirmed by the denial of the motion for reconsideration.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the motion for reconsideration is hereby <b>GRANTED</b> and the September 1, 2015 Decision of the Court is <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.

Hence, I must dissent.<br><br>I stand by the reasonings of the original decision and the <i>Mendoza</i> case. In addition to them, however, I submit this opinion to fully articulate my position against the majority resolution.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>At the heart of this case is Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The provision reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 6. <i>Procedure if Opinion is Equally Divided. </i>- When the Commission <i>en banc</i> is equally divided in opinion, or the necessary majority cannot be had, the case shall be reheard, and if on rehearing no decision is reached, the action or proceeding shall be dismissed if originally commenced in the Commission; in appealed cases, the judgment or order appealed from shall stand affirmed; and in all incidental matters, the petition or motion shall be denied.</blockquote><br>The above provision was intended to fill the procedural void left when the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> is unable to reach the constitutionally-required majority vote<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> in deciding or resolving any case or matter before it. It does this in two ways: <i>one, </i>by providing a mechanism by which the COMELEC<i> en banc </i>can try and achieve a majority consensus; and <i>two,</i> when such mechanism fails, by providing for the effects of the COMELEC <i>en banc's</i> failure to decide.<br><br>Hence, under the subject provision, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> is first required to rehear the case or matter that it cannot decide or resolve by the necessary majority. When a majority still cannot be had after the rehearing, however, there results a failure to decide on the part of the COMELEC<i> en banc</i>; the provision then steps in and specifies the <b>effects</b> of such failure to decide:<br><br><ol><li>If the action or proceeding is <i>originally commenced </i>in the COMELEC, <b>such action or proceeding shall be dismissed;</b><br><br></li><li>In <i>appealed </i>cases, <b>the judgment or order appealed from shall stand affirmed;</b> or<br><br></li><li>In <i>incidental matters,</i> <b>the petition or motion shall be denied.</b><br></li></ol><br>Verily, the effects of the COMELEC <i>en banc's</i> failure to decide vary depending on the <i>type of case or matter</i> that is before the commission. Under the provision, the <b>first effect</b> (<i>i.e.</i>, the dismissal of the action or proceeding) only applies when the type of case before the COMELEC is an action or proceeding "<i>originally commenced in the commission"</i>; the <b>second effect</b> (<i>i.e</i>., the affirmance of a judgment or order) only applies when the type of case before the COMELEC is an "<i>appealed case</i>"; and the<b> third effect </b>(<i>i.e</i>., the denial of the petition or motion) only applies when the case or matter before the COMELEC is an "<i>incidental matter</i>:"<br><br><i>Mendoza</i> was the leading pronouncement of the Court regarding the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules. It defined the bounds of the first effect <i>and </i>it gave us a clear illustration of the application of the first effect.<br><br>In <i>Mendoza</i>, we proclaimed that the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules applies when the COMELEC en banc failed to reach a majority consensus on a motion for reconsideration from a decision of the division in an original election case (in <i>Mendoza</i>, the case was an electoral protest originally filed before the division). <u><b>This was so because, in such event, the case or matter before the CQMELEC <i>en banc</i> is actually still the same election case that was decided by the division</b></u>. We explained that while the election case may have reached the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> through the motion for reconsideration of the decision of a division, the same did not change the <i>original</i> nature of the election case; such motion not being an appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Thus, we held that the failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to decide the motion for reconsideration would result—not in the denial of the said motion or the affirmance of the division's decision—but in the dismissal of the election case itself, pursuant to the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>The present case would have served us with the perfect factual context to apply the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules as interpreted by <i>Mendoza.</i> Its facts are essentially parallel with that of <i>Mendoza.</i><br><br>Like <i>Mendoza, </i>the present case involved an election case that was originally filed in and decided by a COMELEC division (in here, the election case was a petition for disqualification). Like in <i>Mendoza</i>, the election case herein was afterwards elevated to the <i>en banc </i>on motion for reconsideration. Like in <i>Mendoza</i>, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> in the present case likewise failed to come up with a majority vote, even after rehearing, on the motion for reconsideration. By all indications, and pursuant the principle of stare decisis, the present case should have been decided like<i> Mendoza</i>.<br><br>Faulty legal reasoning, however, led the new majority astray. As I will attempt to demonstrate, the arguments relied upon by the new majority rests on less than solid foundations.<br><br><center><b>III</b></center><br>At this juncture, I will venture into the arguments relied upon by the new majority in support of their resolution. For purposes of this discussion, I have categorized such arguments into two:<br><br><ol><li>The <b>incidental matter argument</b> <i>i.e</i>., it is the third effect, not the first effect, under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules that ought to apply in cases where the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>fails to reach majority consensus on a motion for reconsideration. This is because, in such event, the matter before the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> is only a motion for reconsideration which falls under the category of an "<i>incidental matter</i>" under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules.<br><br></li><li>The <b>unconstitutionally arguments</b> <i>i.e.</i>, pursuing <i>Mendoza'</i>s interpretation of the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules would diminish the constitutional power of COMELEC divisions to decide election cases as well as circumvent the minimum voting threshold for constitutional commissions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></li></ol><br>I shall address these arguments <i>in seriatim.</i><br><br><i><b>RE: Incidental Matter Argument</b></i><br><br>The new majority advanced the argument that it is the third effect, not the first effect, under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules that ought to apply in cases where the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> fails to reach majority consensus on a motion for reconsideration. They insist that, in such event, the matter before the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>is only a motion for reconsideration, which is a mere <i>"incidental matter."</i><br><br>To bolster their position that a motion for reconsideration to the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> from a decision of the division is a mere incidental matter, the new majority cites the case of the <i>League of Cities v. COMELEC</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Like the argument advanced by the petitioner to counter the application of first effect to this case, the incidental matter argument proceeds from the assumption that the proceedings in election cases before the COMELEC division are separate from those before the <i>en banc</i>; that there is a difference between what the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> decides on motion for reconsideration with what the division initially decides. Such assumption is admittedly appealing at first blush; but, as all should have known by now, that assumption was already rejected and proven wrong in <i>Mendoza.</i><br><br>In <i>Mendoza</i>, we held that the COMELEC acts on election cases under a single and integrated process, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>[H]owever the jurisdiction of the COMELEC is involved, x x x, the COMELEC will act on the case in <b>one whole and single process: to repeat, in division, and if impelled by a motion for reconsideration, <i>en banc</i></b>.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[9]</sup></font></blockquote><br>It is to be minded that the above pronouncement in <i>Mendoza</i> is not one that was merely grasped from thin air. The same, in fact, has firm roots in Section 3, Article IX-C of the Constitution, which provides for the interplay between COMELEC divisions and the <i>en banc</i> in deciding election cases:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 3. The Commission on Elections may sit en banc or in two divisions, and shall promulgate its rules of procedure in order to expedite disposition of election cases, including pre-proclamation controversies. All such election cases shall be heard and decided in division, provided that motions for reconsideration of decisions shall be decided by the Commission<i> en banc.</i></blockquote><br>Drawing from the discussion in <i>Mendoza</i> and the underlying edict of the Constitution, we are then able to reach the inescapable conclusion—a basic principle—that a<i> motion for reconsideration from the decision of a COMELEC division in an election case is only a means of elevating such case to the <i>en banc</i>.</i> This the original decision stated:<br><br><blockquote>x x x when an election case originally filed with the COMELEC is first decided by a division, the subsequent filing of a motion for reconsideration from that decision before the <i>en banc</i> does not signify the initiation of a new action or case, but rather a mere continuation of an existing process. <b>The motion for reconsideration—not being an appeal from the decision of the division to the en banc—only thus serves as a means of elevating an election case to the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>.</b> Under this view, therefore, the nature of the election case as it was before the division remains the same even after it is forwarded to the <i>en banc</i> through a motion for reconsideration, x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Recognition of this basic principle readily discredits the incidental matter argument of the new majority. It was erroneous for the new majority to consider the motion for reconsideration from the decision of a COMELEC division as the very matter that is brought before the <i>en banc</i>. A motion for reconsideration from the decision of a COMELEC division in an election case is only a means of elevating such case to the <i>en banc</i>. <b>Thus, when a motion for reconsideration in an election case is filed, the case or matter that is actually brought before the COMELEC is the very election case that was decided initially by the division</b>. Hence, in such event, the failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to muster a majority consensus would only and rightly bring to the fore the application of the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules.<br><br><i><b>RE: Unconstitutionality Arguments</b></i><br><br>To justify their avoidance of<i> Mendoza</i>'s interpretation of the first effect under Section 6, Rule 18 of the COMELEC Rules, the new majority played the unconstitutional card. According to the new majority, <i>Mendoza'</i>s interpretation of the first effect is unconstitutional for it diminishes the constitutional power of COMELEC divisions to decide election cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and circumvents the minimum voting threshold for constitutional commissions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> This was apparently so because the interpretation would allow the <i>"paradoxical"</i> scenario wherein a valid decision of a COMELEC division in an election case can be simply overturned by the COMELEC en banc even though the latter is not able to reach a majority vote on the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The <i>"paradoxical"</i> scenario complained of by the new majority is more apparent than real. No constitutional provision is actually violated by the application of the first effect in situations where the COMELEC en banc fails to reach a majority vote on a motion for reconsideration:<br><br><i>First</i>. The constitutional power of the COMELEC division to decide election cases is not diminished by the mere possibility that it may be overturned as a consequence of the failure of the en banc to reach a majority consensus on a motion for reconsideration. Under the Constitution, in its proper understanding, the power of a COMELEC division to decide election cases is subject to the concomitant power of the en banc to decide the same cases as <i>may be elevated to it on motion for reconsideration.</i><br><br>The failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> to reach a majority vote on a motion for reconsideration, therefore, only means that it is not able to come up with a valid decision in an election case. The only acceptable legal consequence of this is what the first effect precisely prescribes.<br><br><i>Second</i>. On the same note, the minimum voting threshold for constitutional commissions is not circumvented when the failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>to reach a majority vote on a motion for reconsideration results in the dismissal of the very election case. As earlier intimated, the case or matter that is actually brought before the COMELEC on motion for reconsideration is the very election case that was decided initially by the division.<br><br>Hence, we come back to the same conclusion: that the failure of the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>to reach a majority vote on a motion for reconsideration only means that it is not able to come up with a valid decision in an election case; and that the only acceptable legal consequence of this is what the first effect prescribes.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><br>All told, I absolutely find no valid reason why the Court should depart from the original decision and the legal teachings of <i>Mendoza</i>. I beg the indulgence of the majority if I cannot join them in their resolution.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, I vote to <b>DENY</b> the motion for reconsideration of petitioners.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.
