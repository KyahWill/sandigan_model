A party who disagrees with the decision of the DAR adjudicator may bring the matter to the RTC designated as a Special Agrarian Court for final determination of just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Note that in case of rejection, RA 6657 entitles the landowner to withdraw the initial valuation of the landholding pending the determination of just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> In this case, however, the LBP, citing DAR AO No. 2, Series of 2005, posited that the release of such amount is conditioned on the submission of <u>all</u> the documentary requirements listed therein, and that the RTC's failure to require Santos to comply therewith constitutes grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>The Court is not persuaded.<br><br>Grave abuse of discretion connotes an arbitrary or despotic exercise of power due to passion, prejudice or personal hostility; or the whimsical, arbitrary, or capricious exercise of power that amounts to an evasion or refusal to perform a positive duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law. For an act to be struck down as having been done with grave abuse of discretion, the abuse must be patent and gross.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>Contrary to the LBP's assertion in <b>G.R. No. 213863</b>, nowhere from the said administrative guideline can it be inferred that the submission of the complete documents is a pre-condition for the release of the initial valuation to a landowner. To hold otherwise would effectively protract payment of the amount which RA 6657 guarantees to be immediately due the landowner even pending the determination of just compensation. As elucidated in <i>LBP v. CA:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br><blockquote>As an exercise of police power, the expropriation of private property under the CARP puts the landowner, and not the government, in a situation where the odds are already stacked against his favor. He has no recourse but to allow it. His only consolation is that he can negotiate for the amount of compensation to be paid for the expropriated property. As expected, the landowner will exercise this right to the hilt, but subject however to the limitation that he can only be entitled to a "just compensation." Clearly therefore, by rejecting and disputing the valuation of the DAR, the landowner is merely exercising his right to seek just compensation. <b>If we are to x x x [withhold] the release of the offered compensation despite depriving the landowner of the possession and use of his property, we are in effect penalizing the latter for simply exercising a right afforded to him by law.</b><br><br>Obviously, this would render the right to seek a fair and just compensation illusory as it would discourage owners of private lands from contesting the offered valuation of the DAR even if they find it unacceptable, for fear of the hardships that could result from long delays in the resolution of1 their cases. This is contrary to the rules of fair play because the concept of just compensation embraces not only the correct determination of the amount to be paid to the owners of the land, but also the payment of the land within a reasonable time from its taking. Without prompt payment, compensation cannot be considered "just" for the property owner is made to suffer the consequence of being immediately deprived of his land while being made to wait for a decade or more before actually receiving the amount necessary to cope with his loss.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Thus, the leniency accorded by the RTC cannot be construed as a capricious exercise of power as it merely expedited the procedure for payment which is inherently fairer under the circumstances considering that:<br><br>(a) Santos has been "deprived of his right to enjoy his properties as early as 1983, and has not yet received any compensation therefor since then;"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>(b) the existence of the certificates of title over Lands 1 and 2 which the LBP insists to be submitted had not been sufficiently established;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (c) the LBP had judicially admitted that Santos is the owner of Lands 1 and 2 which were identified as covered by tax declarations;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> and (d) compliance with the required documents may still be directed before the full payment of the correct just compensation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> which, up to this time, has not yet been finally determined. Moreover, as aptly pointed out by the CA, Santos' failure to produce the titles to Lands 1 and 2 was not motivated by any obstinate refusal to abide by the requirements but due to impediments beyond his control.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Perforce, no reversible error or grave abuse of discretion can be imputed on the CA in sustaining the RTC Orders dated July 9, 2009 and August 24, 2009 which allowed the withdrawal of the initial valuation upon Santos' (<i>a</i>) submission of two (2) valid ID cards, two (2) latest ID pictures, and his current CTC, and (<i>b</i>) execution of a Deed of Assignment, Warranties and Undertaking in favor of the LBP.<br><br>Neither can the Court subscribe to the LBP's contention that the RTC was barred by <i>res judicata </i>from conducting further proceedings to determine just compensation for Lands 2 and 3 since the final and executory Decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 75010 merely called for a remand of the case for computation purposes only.<br><br><i>Res judicata</i> means a matter adjudged, a thing judicially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment. The doctrine of<i> res judicata</i> provides that a final judgment, on the merits rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive as to the rights of the parties and their privies and constitutes an absolute bar to subsequent actions involving the same claim, demand, or cause of action. The elements of <i>res judicata</i> are (a) identity of parties or at least such as representing the same interest in both actions; <b>(<i>b</i>) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts;</b> and (c) the identity in the two (2) particulars is such that any judgment which may be rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the action under consideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>As correctly observed by the CA, the decision in CA-G.R. CV No. 75010 did not preclude the RTC from proceeding with the determination of just compensation of the subject lands since the issue raised in the said case merely pertained to the LBP's legal standing to institute the complaints for just compensation and not the valuation of the subject lands.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> The pronouncement in the said decision on the matter of computation of just compensation was a mere obiter dictum, an opinion expressed upon some question of law that was not necessary in the determination of the case before it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> As succinctly pointed out in the case of <i>LBP v.

It has been repeatedly stressed by this Court that the true measure is not the taker's gain but the owner's loss. The word "just" is used to modify the meaning of the word "compensation" to convey the idea <b>that the equivalent to be given for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full, and ample.</b><br><br>The concept of just compensation embraces not only the correct determination of the amount to be paid to the owners of the land, but also payment within a reasonable time from its taking. Without prompt payment, compensation cannot be considered "just" inasmuch as the property owner is made to suffer the consequences of being immediately deprived of his land while being made to wait for a decade or more before actually receiving the amount necessary to cope with his loss.<br><br>Put differently,<b> while prompt payment of just compensation requires the immediate deposit and release to the landowner of the provisional compensation as determined by the DAR, it does not end there. Verily, it also encompasses the <u>payment in full</u> of the just compensation to the landholders as finally determined by the courts.
