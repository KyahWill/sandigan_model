From the foregoing, this Court believes that there exists a prejudicial question since the determination of who is really the lawful or registered user of the trademark "CATERPILLAR" will ultimately determine whether or not the instant criminal action shall proceed. Clearly, the issues raised in Civil Case No. Q-00-41446 is similar or intimately related to the issue in the case at bar for if the civil case will be resolved sustaining the trademark registration of the accused for the trademark CATERPILLAR, then the latter would have all the authority to continue the use of the said trademark as a consequence of a valid registration, and by reason of which there may be no more basis to proceed with the instant criminal action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></blockquote><br><br>After the RTC denied its motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> on December 5, 2002,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Caterpillar elevated the matter to the CA by petition for <i>certiorari </i>on February 14, 2003,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> docketed as C.A.-G.R.

Grave abuse of discretion means such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction, or, in other words where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility and it must be so patent and gross as<i> </i> to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law. (Benito vs. Comelec, 349 SCRA 705).<br><br>Petitioner in this case failed to overcome the burden of showing how public respondent acted with grave abuse of discretion in granting private respondent's motion and denying his own motion for reconsideration. What is clear is that public respondent court acted judiciously. A petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court will prosper only if there is showing of grave abuse of discretion or an act without or in excess of jurisdiction on the part of respondent tribunal (Garcia vs. HRET, 312 SCRA 353).<br><br>Granting arguendo that public respondent court erred in its ruling, still a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 cannot be justified. Where the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter, the orders or decision upon all questions pertaining to the cause are orders or decisions within its jurisdiction and however erroneous they may be, they cannot be corrected by certiorari (De Baron vs. Court of Appeals, 368 SCRA 407).<br><br>WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, the Petition having no merit in fact and in law is hereby DENIED DUE COURSE and ordered DISMISSED.

Subsequently, after the investigation, the RIID-NCRPO applied for and was granted 16 search warrants against various outlets owned or operated by Samson in Mandaluyong, Quezon City, Manila, Caloocan, Makati, Parañaque, Las Piñas, Pampanga and Cavite.

Q-02-108043-44 were the criminal prosecution of Samson for unfair competition. A common element of all such cases for unfair competition – civil and criminal – was <i>fraud.</i> Under Article 33 of the <i> Civil Code, </i> a civil action entirely separate and distinct from the criminal action may be brought by the injured party in cases of fraud, and such civil action shall proceed independently of the criminal prosecution. In view of its being an independent civil action, Civil Case No. Q-00-41446 did not operate as a prejudicial question that justified the suspension of the proceedings in Criminal Cases Nos. Q-02-108043-44.<br><br>In fact, this issue has already been raised in relation to the suspension of the arraignment of Samson in Criminal Cases Nos. Q-02-108043-44 in <i>Samson v.

In his petition, he prayed for the reversal of the March 26, 2003 order which sustained the denial of his motion to suspend arraignment and other proceedings in Criminal Case Nos. Q-02-108043-44. For unknown reasons, however, he made no discussion in support of said prayer in his petition and reply to comment. Neither did he attach a copy of the complaint in Civil Case No. Q-00-41446 nor quote the pertinent portion thereof to prove the existence of a prejudicial question.<br><br>At any rate, there is no prejudicial question if the civil and the criminal action can, according to law, proceed independently of each other. Under Rule 111, Section 3 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure, in the cases provided in Articles 32, 33, 34 and 2176 of the Civil Code, the independent civil action may be brought by the offended party. It shall proceed independently of the criminal action and shall require only a preponderance of evidence.<br><br>In the case at bar, the common element in the acts constituting unfair competition under Section 168 of R.A. No. 8293 is fraud. Pursuant to Article 33 of the Civil Code, in cases of defamation, <i>fraud, </i>and physical injuries, a civil action for damages, entirely separate and distinct from the criminal action, may be brought by the injured party. <b>Hence, Civil Case No. Q-00-41446, which as admitted by private respondent also relate to unfair competition, is an independent civil action under Article 33 of the Civil Code.

The petition for review under Rule 43 applied to all appeals to the CA from quasi-judicial agencies or bodies, particularly those listed in Section 1 of Rule 43. However, the Secretary of Justice, in the review of the findings of probable cause by the investigating public prosecutor, was not exercising a quasi-judicial function, but performing an executive function.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the courts could intervene in the determination of probable cause only through the special civil action for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65 of the <i>Rules of Court, </i>not by appeal through the petition for review under Rule 43. Thus, the CA could not reverse or undo the findings and conclusions on probable cause by the Secretary of Justice except upon clear demonstration of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction committed by the Secretary of Justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Caterpillar did not so demonstrate.<br><br>And, secondly, even discounting the technicalities as to consider Caterpillar's petition for review as one brought under Rule 65, the recourse must still fail.<br><br>Probable cause for the purpose of filing an information in court consists in such facts and circumstances as would engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and the accused may probably be guilty thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> The determination of probable cause lies solely within the sound discretion of the investigating public prosecutor after the conduct of a preliminary investigation. It is a sound judicial policy to refrain from interfering with the determination of what constitutes sufficient and convincing evidence to establish probable cause for the prosecution of the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Thus, it is imperative that by the nature of his office, the public prosecutor cannot be compelled to file a criminal information in court if he is not convinced of the sufficiency of the evidence adduced for a finding of probable cause.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[70]</sup></font> Neither can he be precluded from filing an information if he is convinced of the merits of the case.<br><br>In not finding probable cause to indict Samson for unfair competition, State Prosecutor Abad as the investigating public prosecutor discharged the discretion given to him by the law. Specifically, he resolved as follows:<br><br><blockquote>It appears from the records that respondent started marketing his (class 25) products bearing the trademark Caterpillar as early as 1992. In 1994, respondent caused the registration of the trademark "Caterpillar With A Triangle Device Beneath The Letter [A]" with the Intellectual Property Office. Sometime on June 16, 1997, the IPO issued Certificate of Registration No. 64705 which appears to be valid for twenty (20) years, or up to June 16, 2017. Upon the strength of this registration, respondent continued with his business of marketing shoes, slippers, sandals, boots and similar Class 25 items bearing his registered trademark "Caterpillar". Under the law, respondent's operative act of registering his Caterpillar trademark and the concomitant approval/issuance by the governmental entity concerned, conferred upon him the exclusive right to use said trademark unless otherwise declared illegal. There being no evidence to controvert the fact that respondent's Certificate of Registration No. 64705 covering Caterpillar trademark was fraudulently or illegally obtained, it necessarily follows that its subsequent use and/or being passed on to the public militates malice or fraudulent intent on the part of respondent. Otherwise stated and from the facts obtaining, presumption of regularity lies, both from the standpoint of registration and use/passing on of the assailed Caterpillar products.<br><br>Complainant's argument that respondent may still be held liable for unfair competition by reason of his having passed on five (5) other Caterpillar products like "Cat", "Caterpillar", "Cat and Design", "Walking Machines" and "Track-Type Tractor Design" is equally difficult to sustain. As may be gleaned from the records, respondent has been engaged in the sale and distribution of Caterpillar products since 1992 leading to the establishment of numerous marketing outlets. As such, it would be difficult to assail the presumption that respondent has already established goodwill insofar as his registered Caterpillar products are concerned. On the other hand, complainant's registration of the other Caterpillar products appears to have been caused only in 1995. In this premise, respondent may be considered as prior user, while the latter, a subsequent one. Jurisprudence dictates that prior user of the trademark by one, will controvert the claim by a subsequent one.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></blockquote><br><br>We reiterate that the full discretionary authority to determine the existence of probable cause is lodged in the Executive Branch of the Government, through the public prosecutor, in the first instance, and the Secretary of Justice, on review. Such authority is exclusive, and the courts are prohibited from encroaching on the executive function, unless there is a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the public prosecutor or the Secretary of Justice. As declared in <i>Callo-Claridad v. Esteban:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br><blockquote>A public prosecutor alone determines the sufficiency of evidence that establishes the probable cause justifying the filing of a criminal information against the respondent because the determination of existence of a probable cause is the function of the public prosecutor. Generally, the public prosecutor is afforded a wide latitude of discretion in the conduct of a preliminary investigation. Consequently, it is a sound judicial policy to refrain from interfering in the conduct of preliminary investigations, and to just leave to the Department of Justice the ample latitude of discretion in the determination of what constitutes sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for the prosecution of supposed offenders. Consistent with this policy, courts do not reverse the Secretary of Justice's findings and conclusions on the matter of probable cause except in clear cases of grave abuse of discretion. By way of exception, however, judicial review is permitted where the respondent in the preliminary investigation clearly establishes that the public prosecutor committed grave abuse of discretion, that is, when the public prosecutor has exercised his discretion in an arbitrary, capricious, whimsical or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, patent and gross enough as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law. Moreover, the trial court may ultimately resolve the existence or non-existence of probable cause by examining the records of the preliminary investigation when necessary for the orderly administration of justice. Although policy considerations call for the widest latitude of deference to the public prosecutor's findings, the courts should never shirk from exercising their power, when the circumstances warrant, to determine whether the public prosecutor's findings are supported by the facts, and by the law.</blockquote><br><br>Relevantly, <i>grave abuse of discretion </i>means such capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment that is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. The abuse of discretion must be grave, as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and it must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined, or to act at all, in contemplation of law, as to be equivalent to having acted without jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Herein, Caterpillar did not show the grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Secretary of Justice.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Court <b>GRANTS</b> the petition for review in G.R.
