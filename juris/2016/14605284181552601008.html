It pronounced that there were sufficient justifications to terminate the petitioner's services for disloyalty and willful breach of trust, <i>viz.</i>:<br><br><blockquote>In the present case, it is clear that Lagahit deliberately committed successive acts which translated to blatant disloyalty and willful breach of the trust reposed upon her by Pacific, and acts which, in the final reckoning are obviously detrimental to the material interest of the company under which she is employed. From January 2002, Lagahit was found to have committed a series of willful acts which may reasonably and expectedly arouse Pacific's distrust and a consequent finding of Lagahit's unfitness to continue her employment, thus: (a) Lagahit has been persistent in applying for employment in other competing cargo-forwarding companies; (b) Lagahit even enticed her Marketing Assistant to join her quest to find another job outside Pacific and at a competing company at that; (c) Lagahit rendered actual services at competing companies for a fee and commission while she was still under the employee of Pacific and was regularly receiving salary therefrom; and (d) Lagahit brought and referred prospective shipping clients to other cargo-forwarding corporations. Verily, the commission of the foregoing acts vividly demonstrated, not only, Lagahit's disloyalty and unfaithfulness to her employer, but likewise her blatant ingratitude to the company from which she derives her regular source of livelihood, considering that, incidentally, the performance of these disloyal and inimical acts commenced when Lagahit was just newly promoted to the higher post of Sales Manager at Pacific.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Lagahit is not an ordinary rank-and-file employee of Pacific, but contrarily, is by far an employee authorized to formulate significant company plans and policies, and whose designation and basic functions, on its face, betrays the fact that too much trust and confidence was indeed reposed upon her. As borne by the records, Lagahit occupies the responsible post of Sales Manager, and as such her basic functions, <i>inter alia</i>, consists [sic] of the following: (1) formulation of strategic action and marketing plans to make the Pacific Sales Department successful, (2) implementation of marketing strategies to help Pacific Sales team achieve its periodic target, (3) direct transaction with various shipping clients, and (4) in having a free hand in dealing with various shipping lines. Quite significantly, Lagahit was given sensitive and responsible functions that goes deep into the financial success, or otherwise ruin, of Pacific, which is more than a clear testament to the fact her position is accorded with trust and confidence.<br><br>Such being the case, Lagahit owes it to herself and to Pacific to work religiously and with undivided time and attention to promote the hitter's business interests. Unfortunately, such was not the case. As it turned out, Lagahit made a consistent attempt to seek employment at other cargo forwarding companies that directly compete with the business of Pacific, obviously, constituting a willful breach of trust consequentially resulting to Pacific's loss of confidence in Lagahit's loyalty and efficacy. Worse, Lagahit conducted her job applications during office hours when she should have been rendering her services for Pacific. Furthermore, the height of her disloyalty exhibited its face when Lagahit begun to actually render services and refer prospective shipping clients to other competing cargo-forwarding companies for a fee and commission, at the same time employed with Pacific and receiving regular salary therefrom.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[28]</sup></font></blockquote><br>Nonetheless, the CA held that despite the existence of a valid cause to terminate her employment Pacific Concord was liable for nominal damages of P25,000.00 for denying the petitioner's right to due process.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The CA denied the petitioner's motion for reconsideration on March 30, 2007.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Hence, this appeal.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>The petitioner imputes the following errors to the CA, namely:<br><br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN GIVING UNDUE WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE RESPONDENTS' LATEST DEFENSE, THEREBY DISTURBING THE FINDINGS OF FACT OF THE LABOR ARBITER AND NLRC WHO SHARE THE SAME FINDINGS;<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN FINDING MS.

Did Pacific Concord have sufficient grounds to terminate her for breach of trust and confidence under Article 282<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of the <i>Labor Code</i>?<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b></center><br>We find merit in the appeal.<br><br><center><b>I<br>Lagahit did not resign from her employment</b></center><br>On the first issue, we find in favor of the petitioner.<br><br>In cases of unlawful dismissal, the employer bears the burden of proving that the termination was for a valid or authorized cause, but before the employer is expected to discharge its burden of proving that the dismissal was legal, the employee must first establish by substantial evidence the fact of her dismissal from employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In this case, the petitioner proved the overt acts committed by the respondents in abruptly terminating her employment through the text messages sent by Cuenca to the petitioner and her husband, as well as the notices distributed to the clients and published in the <i>Sun Star.</i> It is notable that the respondents did not deny or controvert her evidence on the matter. Thereby, she showed Pacific Concord's resolve to terminate her employment effective November 8, 2002.<br><br>On the other hand, the respondents' insistence that the petitioner had resigned was bereft of factual support. As a rule, the employer who interposes the resignation of the employee as a defense should prove that the employee voluntarily resigned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> A valid resignation is the voluntary act of an employee who finds herself in a situation where she believes that personal reasons cannot be sacrificed in favor of the exigency of the service and that she has no other choice but to disassociate herself from employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> The resignation must be unconditional and with a clear intention to relinquish the position.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Consequently, the circumstances surrounding the alleged resignation must be consistent with the employee's intent to give up the employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> In this connection, the acts of the employee before and after the resignation are considered to determine whether or not she intended, in fact, to relinquish the employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The facts and circumstances before and after the petitioner's severance from her employment on November 8, 2002 did not show her resolute intention to relinquish her job. Indeed, it would be unfounded to infer the intention to relinquish from her November 13, 2002 letter, which, to us, was not a resignation letter due to the absence therefrom of anything evincing her desire to sever the employer-employee relationship. The letter instead presented her as a defenseless employee unjustly terminated for unknown reasons who had been made the subject of notices and flyers informing the public of her unexpected termination. It also depicted her as an employee meekly accepting her unexpected fate and requesting the payment of her backwages and accrued benefits just to be done with the employer.<br><br>For sure, to conclude that the petitioner resigned because of her letter of November 13, 2002 is absurd in light of the respondents having insisted that she had been terminated from her employment earlier on November 8, 2002. In that regard, every resignation presupposes the existence of the employer-employee relationship; hence, there can be no valid resignation after the fact of termination of the employment simply because the employee had no employer-employee relationship to relinquish.<br><br><center><b>II<br>Lagahit did not breach her employer's trust; <br>her dismissal was, therefore, illegal</b></center><br>Having settled the issue of the dismissal in the petitioner's favor, we next resolve whether or not the CA correctly ruled the petitioner's dismissal as justified on the ground of breach of trust and confidence.<br><br>The petitioner assails the CA for upholding her termination based on speculations and hearsay, and for entirely disregarding the factual findings in her favor of the LA and the NLRC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In contrast, the respondents maintain that the allegation of disloyalty against her was substantiated by the affidavits they had submitted that the CA relied on to sustain the validity of her dismissal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>We agree with the petitioner.<br><br>To justify the dismissal of an employee, the employer must, as a rule, prove that the dismissal was for a just cause, and that the employee was afforded due process prior to dismissal. As a complementary principle, the employer has the onus of proving the validity of the dismissal with clear, accurate, consistent, and convincing evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The employer's case succeeds or fails on the strength of its evidence, not on the weakness of that adduced by the employee, in keeping with the principle that the scales of justice should be tilted in favor of the latter in case of doubt in the evidence presented by them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>In its decision, the CA recognized the wide latitude of discretion given to the management in terminating managers for breach of trust and confidence. It declared Pacific Concord to have justifiably resorted to terminating the petitioner's employment as a measure of self-preservation in view of her repeated acts of disloyalty that were prejudicial to its interest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The CA was thereby gravely mistaken.<br><br>Article 282(c)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of the <i>Labor Code</i> authorizes an employer to dismiss an employee for committing fraud, or for willful breach of the trust reposed by the employer. However, loss of confidence is never intended to provide the employer with a blank check for terminating its employee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> For this to be a valid ground for the termination of the employee, the employer must establish that: (1) the employee must be holding a position of trust and confidence; and (2) the act complained against would justify the loss of trust and confidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>There are two classes of employees vested with trust and confidence. To the first class belong the managerial employees or those vested with the powers or prerogatives to lay down management policies and to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, assign or discipline employees or effectively recommend such managerial actions. The second class includes those who in the normal and routine exercise of their functions regularly handle significant amounts of money or property. Cashiers, auditors, and property custodians are some of the employees in the second class.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The petitioner discharged the following duties and responsibilities as sales manager, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>SALES MANAGER<br><br>Job Description<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" align="CENTER"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Promotes services being offered by the company</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Must generate new accounts for the company</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Responsible for motivating the Sales Team to hit their respective QUOTA and TARGET</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Responsible for the Strategic Planning and Action Plan for the Sales Department</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Should submit Production Report on a weekly basis for the Sales Department specifying each sales contribution for the week</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Responsible in inspiring and developing confidence of the Sales Team</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Responsible in promoting, formulating, implementing market strategy that will help achieve the target of the Sales Department</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Coordinates regularly with the Sales people on their day to day activities regarding rates and operational matters</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Keeps track all sales transactions, assist the sales people in their problem regarding rates and operational matters</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Gathers and provides sales leads, replied to agents' inquiries regarding sales matters</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Transacts rates and other related cargo needs with the shipping lines</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Promotes and maintains good relations with clients</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Prepares quotation to the clients for intended shipments</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Performs other tasks, duties and responsibilities as may be assigned from time to time</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">-</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Reports directly to the Branch Manager<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><br>Her position as sales manager did not immediately make the petitioner a managerial employee. The actual work that she performed, not her job title, determined whether she was a managerial employee vested with trust and confidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Her employment as sales manager was directly related with the sales of cargo forwarding services of Pacific Concord, and had nothing to do with the implementation of the management's rules and policies. As such, the position of sales manager came under the second class of employees vested with trust and confidence. Therein was the flaw in the CA's assailed decision. Although the mere existence of the basis for believing that the managerial employee breached the trust reposed by the employer would normally suffice to justify a dismissal,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> we should desist from applying this norm against the petitioner who was not a managerial employee.<br><br>At any rate, the employer must present clear and convincing proof of an actual breach of duty committed by the employee by establishing the facts and incidents upon which the loss of confidence in the employee may fairly be made to rest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The required amount of evidence for doing so is substantial proof. With these guidelines in mind, we cannot hold that the evidence submitted by the respondents (consisting of the three affidavits) sufficiently established the disloyalty of the petitioner. The affidavits did not show how she had betrayed her employer's trust. Specifically, the affidavit of Russell B. Noel<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> only stated that she and her husband Roy had met over lunch with Garcia Imports and a certain Wilbur of Sea-Jet International Forwarder in the first week of November 2002. To conclude that such lunch caused Pacific Concord to lose its trust in the petitioner would be arbitrary. Similarly, the affidavit of Mark Anthony G. Lim<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> was inconclusive. Therein affiant Lim deposed:<br><br><blockquote><ol><li>That I was present when Ms. Vivian Veloso, former Branch Manager of Westport Line Inc., disclosed to Ms. Monette Cuenca and Ms. Mitzie Ibona on November 11, 2002 at the office of Admiral Overseas Shipping Corp., where she is presently employed with, that Ms. Jennifer C. Lagahit received a personal commission or rebate for the full container shipments moved via Westport Line Inc. in the amount of USD 50.00 per container.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></li></ol></blockquote><br>The foregoing statement was bereft of the particulars about how the petitioner had entered into the transaction, as well as about the prejudice that Pacific Concord had suffered from her receipt of the commission. Also, that this information was made known to Cuenca three days after she had already terminated the petitioner belied the relevance of the information to the termination.<br><br>In her affidavit,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Jo Ann Otrera declared that the petitioner had called other forwarding companies to inquire about any vacant positions, and that the petitioner had enticed her to transfer to another company. However, such declarations did not provide the sufficient basis to warrant the respondents' loss of confidence in the petitioner. We stress that although her supposedly frantic search for gainful employment opportunities elsewhere should be considered as inappropriate for being made during office hours, the same did not constitute willful breach of trust and confidence of the employer. The loss of trust and confidence contemplated under Article 282(c) of the <i>Labor Code</i> is not ordinary but willful breach of trust. Verily, the breach of trust is willful if it is intentional, knowing, deliberate and without justifiable excuse, as distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly or inadvertently.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Most importantly, the cause of the loss of trust must be work-related as to expose the employee as unfit to continue working for the employer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Considering that the petitioner's duties related to the sales of forwarding services offered by Pacific Concord, her calling other forwarding companies to inquire for vacant positions did not breach the trust reposed in her as sales manager. Such act, being at worst a simple act of indiscretion, did not constitute the betrayal of trust that merited the extreme penalty of dismissal from employment. We remind that dismissal is a penalty of last resort, to be meted only after having appreciated and evaluated all the relevant circumstances with the goal of ensuring that the ground for dismissal was not only serious but true.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the <b>Court GRANTS</b> the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>; <b>REVERSES</b> and <b>SETS ASIDE</b> the decision promulgated on May 10, 2006 by the Court of Appeals;<b> REINSTATES </b>the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission rendered on December 15, 2004 subject to the <b>MODIFICATION</b> that the total monetary awards shall earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the finality of this decision until full satisfaction; and ORDERS the respondents to pay the costs of suit.<br><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.J., Leonardo-De Castro, Bersamin, Perez,</i> and<i> Bernabe, JJ</i>., concur.<br><br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade="" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 33-44; penned by Associate Justice Enrico A.
