The <i>abuse of discretion</i> that warrants the issuance of the writ of <i>certiorari</i> must be <i>grave</i>, which means that the judicial or quasi-judicial power was exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner, or that the respondent tribunal refused to perform the duty enjoined or to act in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Finally, the COA submits that the right to the speedy disposition of cases is a flexible concept such that a mere mathematical counting of the time involved is not sufficient; the right is deemed violated only when the proceedings are attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue</b><br></center><br>The issue is whether the COA gravely abused its discretion when it disallowed the payments for the questioned MOAs and held Verceles<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> liable for the amount disallowed.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br><b>We partly grant the petition.</b><br><br>Notwithstanding the number of arguments raised by the parties, the Court focuses its attention on two concepts decisive in the resolution of the present case: (1) the authority of the governor as the local chief executive to enter into contracts on behalf of the province; and (2) the power of the governor to augment items in the provincial budget.<br><br><b><i>The authority of the governor to enter into contracts on behalf of the province</i></b><br><br>Section 16 of the LGC, also known as the <i>general welfare clause</i>, empowers the local government units (LGUs) to act for the benefit of their constituents. The LGUs exercise powers that are: (1) expressly granted; (2) necessarily implied from the power that is expressly granted; (3) necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance; and (4) essential to the promotion of the general welfare of the inhabitants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>As the chief executive of the province, the governor exercises powers and performs duties and functions that the LGC and other pertinent laws provide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> These include the power to enter into contracts on behalf of the province.<br><br>In support of their competing claims, it is notable that both Verceles and the COA invoke the same provisions of the LGC: <i>Section 22 (c)</i> and <i>Section 465 (b) (1) (vi)</i>.<br><br>Section 22 (c) of the LGC provides that "<i>[u]nless otherwise provided in this Code, no contract may be entered into by the local chief executive in behalf of the local government unit without prior authorization by the <i>sanggunian</i> concerned</i>."<br><br>Section 465 (b) (1) (vi) of the LGC, on the other hand, states that "<i>. . . the Chief Executive . . .

The COA refutes this claim on the grounds that: (1) the ordinances did not specifically authorize Verceles to execute the MOAs with the PENRO; and (2) the CY 2003 appropriation ordinance, which supposedly ratified the augmentations made by Verceles in 2001 and 2002, could not have retroactive application.<br><br>We partly agree with Verceles.<br><br>The prior authorization for the local chief executive to enter into contracts on behalf of the local government unit may be in the form of an <i>appropriation ordinance</i> passed for the year which <i>specifically covers</i> the project, cost, or contract to be entered into by the local government unit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The case of <i>Quisumbing v. Garcia</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> on this point is instructive.<br><br>In 2004, then Governor Gwendolyn F. Garcia entered into infrastructure contracts on behalf of the Province of Cebu. After audit, the COA reported that Garcia had entered into several contracts on behalf of the Province of Cebu without authority from the SP as required under Section 22 (c) of the LGC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Garcia, alleging that the infrastructure contracts were entered into pursuant to the general and supplemental appropriation ordinances passed by the SP, argued that a separate authority to enter into such contracts was no longer necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> She admitted that the appropriation ordinances pertained to the CY 2003 budget which was merely reenacted in CY 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>The Court found that Garcia failed to point out the specific provisions in the general and supplemental appropriation ordinances in 2003 that supposedly authorized her to enter into the questioned contracts in 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Highlighting the need to closely examine the ordinances that supposedly funded the contracts entered into by Garcia, we explained in <i>Quisumbing</i> that<br><blockquote>[r]esort to the appropriation ordinance is necessary in order to determine if there is a provision therein which <b><u>specifically covers</u></b> the expense to be incurred or the contract to be entered into. <b>Should the appropriation ordinance, for instance, already contain in sufficient detail the project and cost of a capital outlay such that all that the local chief executive needs to do after undergoing the requisite public bidding is to execute the contract, no further authorization is required, <u>the appropriation ordinance already being sufficient</u>.</b><br><br>On the other hand, <b>should the appropriation ordinance describe the projects in <u>generic terms</u></b> such as "infrastructure projects," "inter-municipal waterworks, drainage and sewerage, flood control, and irrigation systems projects," "reclamation projects" or "roads and bridges," <b>there is an obvious need for a covering contract for <u>every specific project</u> that in turn requires approval by the <i>sanggunian</i></b>. Specific <i>sanggunian</i> approval may also be required for the purchase of goods and services which are neither specified in the appropriation ordinance nor encompassed within the regular personal services and maintenance operating expenses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> [emphasis and underscoring supplied]<br></blockquote>Explained simply, the LGC requires the local chief executive to secure prior authorization from the <i>sanggunian</i> before he can enter into contracts on behalf of the LGU.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> A separate prior authorization is no longer required if the specific projects are covered by appropriations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> in the annual budget<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> of the LGU. The appropriation ordinance passed by the <i>sanggunian</i> is the local chief executive's authority to enter into a contract implementing the project.<br><br>As required in <i>Quisumbing</i>, the local chief executive must inquire if the provisions in the appropriation ordinance specifically cover the expense to be incurred or the contract to be entered into.<br><br>If the project or program is identified in the appropriation ordinance in sufficient detail, then there is no more need to obtain a separate or additional authority from the <i>sanggunian</i>. In such case, the project and the cost are already identified and approved by the <i>sanggunian</i> through the appropriation ordinance. To require the local chief executive to secure another authorization for a project that has been specifically identified and approved by the <i>sanggunian</i> is antithetical to a responsive local government envisioned in the Constitution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> and in the LGC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the need for a covering contract arises when the project is identified in <i>generic terms</i>. The covering contract must also be approved by the <i>sanggunian</i>. We will discuss this requirement below.<br><br>In summary and to harmonize the two provisions: Section 22 (c) of the LGC requires the local chief executive to obtain prior authorization from the <i>sanggunian</i> before he can enter into contracts in behalf of the LGU. Section 465 (b) (1) (vi), on the other hand, allows the local chief executive to implement specific or specified projects with corresponding appropriations without securing a separate authority from the <i>sanggunian</i>. In the latter provision, the appropriation ordinance is the authority from the <i>sanggunian</i> required in the former provision.<br><br>We now apply these parameters to the present case.<br><br>Verceles claims that the <i>first</i> and <i>third</i> MOAs were funded by the EDF allocation of the province in CYs 2001 and 2002. We agree but only with respect to the third MOA.<br><br><i>First MOA (2001 EDF)</i><br><br>The appropriation ordinance of the province for CY 2001 indeed contained a provision on the EDF. Section 6 of Appropriations Ordinance No. 1-2001 provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 6. The Lump-Sum Appropriation for the 20% Economic Development Fund (EDF) is Forty-Five Million Four Hundred Five Thousand Six Hundred Thirty-Three and 0.20/100 Pesos (P45,405,633.20).<br><br>Special Provision:<br><br>1. USE AND RELEASE OF FUNDS - The amount herein appropriated shall strictly adhere to the policies and guidelines provided under DILG Memorandum Circular No. 95-216, dated December 14, 1995, in conjunction with Section 106 of RA 7160 and the CY 1999 Multi-Sectoral Development Plan of the Province as may be approved by the Catanduanes Development Council, <b><u>PROVIDED, that appropriations under the 20% EDF shall be approved by the Sanggunian Panlalawigan</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> [emphasis and underscoring ours]<br></blockquote>Notably, Section 6 did not list the specific projects that would be funded by the EDF. In other words, the SP has not yet determined how the lump-sum EDF (in the amount of P45,405,633.20) would be spent at the time it approved the annual budget. The SP, however, required that appropriations under the 20% EDF shall need its approval.<br><br>Otherwise stated, while there was an available fund for the economic development projects of the province, the specific projects had not yet been identified. The corresponding costs for the projects had also not been set aside. Contrary to Verceles' assertion, the CY 2001 appropriation ordinance did not specifically authorize him to enter into the <i>first</i> MOA to implement the tree seedlings production project.<br><br>Thus as held in <i>Quisumbing</i>, we need to determine whether there was a specific prior approval from the SP before Verceles could enter into the <i>first</i> MOA.<br><br>There was none.<br><br>Verceles claims that SP Resolution No. 67-2001 (affirmed in SP Resolution Nos. 68-2001 and 69-2001) all dated June 11, 2001 authorized him to enter into the <i>first</i> MOA dated September 27, 2001. We do not find this position persuasive.<br><br>The relevant portions of these resolutions were similarly worded, thus:<br><blockquote>BE IT RESOLVED, as it is hereby-resolved, to authorize, as it is hereby authorized, the Provincial Governor to enter into, for and in behalf of Catanduanes, and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan approving herein, all memoranda of agreement, contracts or other undertakings with national government agencies, other local government units and other public and private entities, as may be allowable by law, granting them the authority to undertake for and on behalf of the provincial government of Catanduanes activities, such as, but not limited to, bidding and implementation of projects and programs, acquisition of supplies and other undertakings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote>Undeniably, these SP resolutions gave the provincial governor the blanket authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the Province. The question is whether a blanket authority is a sufficient authority for the governor to implement projects that have no definite appropriations.<br><br>We answer in the negative.<br><br>While a <i>blanket authority</i> is not <i>per se</i> ineffective, it does not suffice for purposes of implementing projects funded by lump-sum appropriations. The nature of lump-sum appropriations <i>vis-a-vis</i> the <i>power of the purse</i> of the SP (as the legislative organ of the LGU) requires the local chief executive to obtain definite and specific authorizations before he can enter into contracts funded by lump-sum appropriations. The exception is when the appropriation ordinance already identifies the specific projects and the costs of the projects to be funded by lump-sum appropriations.<br><br>We elaborate on these points below.<br><br><i>First</i>, the nature of a lump-sum appropriation requires specific authorization from the SP before projects funded by it can be implemented.<br><br>The LGC defines <i>appropriation</i> as the authorization made by ordinance, directing the payment of goods and services from local government funds under specified conditions or for specific purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> The power of appropriation involves (a) the <i>setting apart</i> by law (in the case of LGUs, by ordinance) of <i>a certain sum</i> from the public revenue for (b) a <i>specified purpose</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Lump-sum, on the other hand, means 'consisting of a single sum of money.'<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Lump-sum appropriation is thus a single sum of money set aside by the legislature for a specified purpose.<br><br>Relevant in the present case is the EDF, a lump-sum fund intended for the <i>economic development</i> projects of the Province. The description '<i>economic development</i>,' by itself, is a generic term as it does not readily specify the projects that may be covered by the lump-sum appropriation. To stress, the CY 2001 appropriation ordinance did not at all identify the projects to be funded by the EDF. On this basis, Verceles should have clearly obtained prior approval from the SP before he entered into the <i>first</i> MOA.<br><br><i>Quisumbing</i> instructs us that should the appropriation ordinance describe the projects in generic terms, there is a need for a covering contract <i>for every specific project</i> that in turn <i>requires approval by the sanggunian</i>. Thus, the blanket authority, even granting that Verceles vetoed its revocation, was not a sufficient authority for him to enter into the <i>first</i> MOA as he was not specifically authorized to do so.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the <i>power of the purse</i> of the SP requires the governor to obtain prior authority before he can implement projects funded by lump-sum appropriations.<br><br>The SP, as the legislative organ of the province, exercises the power of the purse in much the same way as the Congress does at the national level.<br><br>The SP decides how the provincial budget will be spent; what projects, activities and programs to fund; and the amounts of money to be spent for each project, activity or program. On the other hand, the governor, as the local chief executive tasked to enforce ordinances, is expected to faithfully execute the appropriation ordinance and to spend the budget in accordance with its provisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>In the landmark case of <i>Belgica v. Secretary Ochoa</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> the Court had the opportunity to discuss the characteristics of the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) as a lump-sum amount of money given to individual legislators. We held that -<br><blockquote>[w]hat beckons constitutional infirmity are appropriations which merely provide for a <b>singular lump-sum amount</b> to be tapped as a source of funding for multiple purposes. Since such appropriation type necessitates the further determination of both <b><u>the actual amount to be expended</u></b> and <b><u>the actual purpose of the appropriation</u></b> which must still be chosen from the multiple purposes stated in the law, <b>it <u>cannot</u> be said that the appropriation law already indicates a "specific appropriation of money"</b> and hence, without a proper line-item which the President may veto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> [emphasis and underscoring supplied]<br></blockquote>Using this as parameter, we note that the CY 2001 EDF is akin to the PDAF as they are both singular lump-sum amounts to be tapped as a funding source for multiple purposes. They are both described in generic terms ("economic development fund" and "priority development assistance fund"), which requires the further determination of the actual amount to be spent and the actual purpose of the appropriation.<br><br>We employ the above analogy to emphasize that the 2001 EDF was not a specific appropriation of money as Verceles would want the Court to believe in his attempt to justify the <i>first</i> MOA. At the time the SP enacted the 2001 appropriation ordinance, it had not yet set apart certain sums of money from the EDF for specified purposes. In other words, the SP had not yet completely exercised its <i>power of the purse</i> such that all the governor had to do was to implement the projects identified in the appropriation ordinance. On the contrary, the 2001 EDF did not specify the projects to be funded.<br><br>Further, Section 6 of the 2001 appropriation ordinance stated that "appropriations under the 20% EDF shall be approved by the Sanggunian Panlalawigan." Obviously, the SP wanted to ensure that the projects to be funded by the EDF still go through the deliberations of the SP members precisely because these projects had not been previously identified and approved by the SP.<br><br>Since the 2001 EDF was a lump-sum amount not yet apportioned to specified development projects, Verceles needed to secure prior authority from the SP. Having failed to secure prior authority, the <i>first</i> MOA was unauthorized and properly disallowed.<br><br><i>Third MOA (2002 EDF)</i><br><br>Applying the standards discussed above, we find that the <i>third</i> MOA was duly funded and authorized by the CY 2002 appropriation ordinance of the province.<br><br>Section 3 of Appropriation Ordinance No. 2002-001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> provides<br><blockquote>Section 3.

Use and release of fund - The amount herein appropriated shall strictly adhere to the policies and guidelines provided under DILG Memo Circular No. 95-216 dated December 14, 1995 in conjunction with Section 106 of RA 7160 and the CY 2002 Multi-Sectoral Development Plan of the Province as initiated by the Catanduanes Development Council (CDC) and approved by the Sanggunian Panlalawigan and hereto incorporated in this Ordinance, to wit:<br><blockquote>xxxx<br><br>ENVIRONMENTAL SECTOR<br><br>1. <b><i>Tree Seedlings Production for Environmental Safeguard</i> - Amount: P3,000,000.00</b><br><br>xxxx [emphasis ours]<br></blockquote></blockquote>In stark contrast to the previous year's EDF, the CY 2002 appropriation ordinance clearly, specifically and expressly set aside P3,000,000.00 to fund the tree seedlings production project of the Province. This served as sufficient authority for Verceles to execute the <i>third</i> MOA.<br><br>Thus, <i>the COA gravely abused its discretion when it disallowed the third MOA and insisted that Verceles should have secured a separate and additional authority from the SP</i>. The COA ignored Section 3 of the CY 2002 appropriation ordinance, which specifically identified the tree seedlings production project with a P3,000,000.00 allocation.<br><br><b><i>The power of the governor to augment items or realign funds in the approved annual budget of the province</i></b><br><br>Verceles maintains that the <i>second, fourth, and fifth</i> MOAs were funded by augmentations from the other items under the EDF for CY 2001 and 2002. He points to Section 8 of the appropriation ordinance for CY 2003, which ratified all augmentations made in the previous budgets. The COA rejects Verceles' claim on the ground that an appropriation ordinance for a given year cannot retroactively approve realignments made in previous years.<br><br>We sustain, with qualifications, the argument of the COA. <br><br>The relevant provision is Section 336 of the LGC:<br><blockquote>Section 336. <i>Use of Appropriated Funds and Savings</i>. - <b>Funds shall be available <u>exclusively</u> for the specific purpose for which they have been appropriated. No ordinance shall be passed authorizing any transfer of appropriations from one item to another.</b> However, <b>the local chief executive or the presiding officer of the <i>sanggunian</i> concerned may, <u>by ordinance</u>, be <u>authorized to augment</u> any item in the <u>approved annual budget</u> for their respective offices from savings in other items within the same expense class of their respective appropriations</b>. [emphasis and underscoring ours]<br></blockquote>Under Section 336, the general rule is that funds shall be available exclusively for the specific purpose for which they have been appropriated. The exception is when the local chief executive is <i>authorized by ordinance</i> to augment any item in the approved annual budget from savings in other items within the same expense class.<br><br>Article 454<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the LGC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> states that augmentation implies the existence in the budget of an item, project, activity, or purpose with an appropriation which upon implementation or subsequent evaluation of needed resources is determined to be deficient.<br><br>The question is whether the grant of authority to the local chief executive to augment items in the annual budget can be belatedly granted. To answer this, we review the case of <i>Araullo v. Sec. Aquino III</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Construing Section 25(5),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, the Court laid down the requisites for a valid transfer of appropriated funds at the national level, namely:<br><br>(1) There is a law authorizing the President, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the heads of the Constitutional Commissions to transfer funds within their respective offices;<br><br>(2) The funds to be transferred are savings generated from the appropriations for their respective offices; and<br><br>(3) The purpose of the transfer is to augment an item in the general appropriations law for their respective offices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>The crucial requisite as far as the <i>fourth and fifth MOAs</i> are concerned is the first requisite, <i>i.e.</i>, the existence of a law (in this case, ordinance) authorizing the governor to augment items in approved budget. As to the <i>second</i> MOA, the crucial requisite is the third requisite, <i>i.e.</i>, the existence of an actual item to be augmented.<br><br><i>Second MOA (2001 EDF)</i><br><br>There was no valid augmentation made in CY 2001 that could have covered the cost of the <i>second</i> MOA.<br><br>As discussed above, the CY 2001 appropriation ordinance did not identify the specific projects or <u>items</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> to be funded by the EDF. How could Verceles transfer savings from nonexistent items (in the EDF) to augment the tree seedlings propagation project? The project that was supposed to be augmented was also not identified in the CY 2001 appropriation ordinance.<br><br>The augmentation was legally impossible as there were no items from which savings could have been generated from and there was no item to which such savings could have been transferred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> The <i>second</i> MOA was thus correctly disallowed.<br><br><i>Fourth and Fifth MOAs (2002 EDF)</i><br><br>Still in <i>Araullo</i>, we ruled that Section 25(5) Article VI of the 1987 Constitution, not being a self-executing provision of the Constitution, must have an implementing law for it to be operative. That law, generally, is the general appropriation act (GAA) of a given fiscal year. To comply with the first requisite, the GAA should expressly authorize the transfer of funds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br><i>Araullo</i> suggests that for augmentations to be valid, the GAA of a given fiscal year must expressly authorize the transfer of funds in the same year. At the very least, a law must first be passed authorizing the transfer of savings in the year that realignments are to be made.<br><br>On the local level, Section 336 of the LGC requires an implementing ordinance so that the local chief executive can augment items in the annual budget of the LGU. Applying <i>Araullo</i>, the appropriation ordinance of a given fiscal year must expressly authorize the local chief executive before he can make augmentations in that particular year, or at the very least, he must be authorized by ordinance before he can make augmentations.<br><br>Verceles posits that the authority to augment items in the approved annual budget may be given retroactively, that is, after the augmentations have been made. He cites Section 8 of the CY 2003 appropriation ordinance of the province, which states,<br><blockquote>Section 8. <i>Authority to Augment Items and Figures in the Budget and Ratification of Previous Acts of the Provincial Governor</i>. — <b>The Provincial Governor is hereby authorized to effect</b> and is hereby <b>considered to have been authorized</b>, and <b>the Sangguniang Panlalawigan hereby approves and ratifies all augmentations of items and figures in the CY 2003 Budget that includes the 20% Economic Development Fund (EDF) for CY 2003, and <u>previous budgets and 20% [EDFs]</u></b>, and all modifications, revisions, thereof that may be considered as augmentations, all which may be or have been warranted due to, but not limited to, actual or possible shortfall in the revenue collections of the province and the IRA due it xxx.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> [emphasis and underscoring supplied]<br></blockquote>Verceles also cites <i>Ocampo v. People</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> where the Court held that a loan agreement entered into by the provincial governor without prior authorization from the SP is unenforceable. The Court ruled in that case that the SP's failure to impugn the contract's validity despite knowledge of its infirmity is an implied ratification that validates the contract.<br><br>In essence, Verceles argues that if jurisprudence has allowed the implied ratification of a contract entered into without prior authority, then there is no reason why express ratification through &amp; <i>post facto</i> authorization would not be valid.<br><br>Before we rule on this issue, we note that the COA disallowed the <i>fourth</i> and <i>fifth</i> MOAs on the sole ground that the CY 2003 appropriation ordinance could not ratify the augmentations made in CY 2002. The COA did not comment on whether there were actual savings generated from the other items under the 2002 EDF that could be realigned to the tree seedlings production project. We thus limit our discussion on whether the ratification by the SP of the augmentations made by Verceles was effective.<br><br>We affirm the COA's disallowance of the <i>fourth</i> and <i>fifth</i> MOAs on the following grounds:<br><br><i>First</i>, the power of the local chief executive to augment items under Section 336 of the LGC is a mere exception to the general rale that funds shall be available exclusively for the specific purpose for which they have been appropriated.<br><br>Exceptions are strictly construed and apply only so far as their language fairly warrants, with all doubts being resolved in favor of the general <i>proviso</i> rather than the exception.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> As an exception to the general rule, all the requirements for a valid augmentation must be strictly complied with. One such requirement is that the local chief executive must be authorized by an ordinance.<br><br>Consistent with the strict construction approach, we rale that the requisite "authorized by ordinance" does not necessarily and automatically include "ratified by ordinance."<br><br>The exception clause of Section 336 states: "<i>the local chief executive . . . may, by ordinance, be authorized to augment any item in the approved annual budget . . . .</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> The key phrase is "<i>by ordinance, be authorized to augment</i>." We must therefore interpret this phrase in a manner that does not easily erode the basic principle that funds shall be available exclusively for the specific purpose for which they have been appropriated.<br><br>To "authorize" means "to empower; to give a right or authority to act." It means "to endow with authority or effective legal power, warrant or right; <i>to permit a thing to be done in the future</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Thus, strictly speaking, the governor must be duly authorized before he can make augmentations. We highlight the words "<i>to augment</i>" suggesting that what is being authorized is an act that has yet to happen.<br><br>Nevertheless, our ruling in the present case should not be taken to mean that the LGC prohibits the ratification of previously unauthorized augmentations. We only want to underscore the necessity of an <i>existing</i> authority before the local chief executive can make augmentations. The Court recognizes that there may be narrow instances where past augmentations can be shown to have <i>fully complied with all the requisites</i> (except for the <i>authority by ordinance</i> requisite) for a valid augmentation, in which cases, ratification is allowed. Such is not the case here as will be explained next.<br><br><i>Second</i>, the all-encompassing nature of the blanket ratification by the SP of all the augmentations made in the past budgets rendered such ratification ineffective.<br><br>We note the very broad wording of Section 8 of CY 2003 appropriation ordinance. Without qualification, it approved <i>all</i> past augmentations regardless of whether such augmentations could have been legally permissible. By the expedient passing of the CY 2003 appropriation ordinance, the SP presumed that all requisites for augmentation were complied with, effectively bypassing the said requisites. This cannot be allowed as there are strict requirements before augmentations can be made; the existence of <i>actual</i> savings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> is just one example.<br><br>To cite a case in point, the 2001 augmentation of the EDF that purportedly funded the <i>second</i> MOA could not have been validly ratified by the SP because there were no identified items under the 2001 EDF from which savings could have been generated; there were also no items to which such savings could have been realigned.<br><br><i>Third</i>, Section 26 of the CY 2002 appropriation ordinance of the province provides that "[a]ll realignments of fund shall be approved by the <i>Sangguniang Panlalawigan</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>In contrast to the CYs 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> and 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> appropriation ordinances, which expressly authorized the governor to realign, revise, modify, or change items in the annual budget, Section 26 of the CY 2002 appropriation ordinance is couched in a markedly different language. The SP effectively withheld from Verceles the authority to make augmentations by requiring its approval for all realignments of funds.<br><br><i>Finally</i>, the <i>Ocampo</i> case does not squarely apply here.<br><br>What was impliedly ratified in <i>Ocampo</i> was the MOA entered into by the governor without prior authority. The issue here is more nuanced. The present case involves unauthorized augmentations, which became the bases for unauthorized MOAs. Verceles not only entered into unauthorized MOAs, he was able to enter into these MOAs because he made augmentations that had no prior authorizations.<br><br>Further, <i>Ocampo</i> was decided under the old LGC where the counterpart provision on appropriation of funds did not contain the authority of the local chief executive to make augmentations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br><b><i>The personal liability of Verceles, et al., for the disallowed amount</i></b><br><br>Section 103 of the Government Auditing Code declares that expenditures of government funds or uses of government property in violation of law or regulations shall be a personal liability of the official or employee found to be directly responsible therefor.<br><br>The public official's personal liability arises only if the expenditure of government funds was made in violation of law.
