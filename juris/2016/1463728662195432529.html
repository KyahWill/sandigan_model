Consequently, following the rulings in <i>Pantranco North Express, Inc. vs. NLRC, et al.</i>, G.R. No. 106654, December 16, 1994, the decisive determinant in term of employment should not be the activities that the employee is called upon to perform, but the day certain agreed upon by the parties for the commencement and termination of their employment relationship, a day certain being understood to be "that which must necessarily come, although it may not be known when." Further, Article 280 of the Labor Code does not prescribe or prohibit an employment contract with a fixed period provided, the same is entered into by the parties, without any force, duress or improper pressure being brought to bear upon the employee and absent any other circumstance vitiating consent. It does not necessarily follow that where the duties of the employee consist of activities usually necessary or desirable in the usual business of the employer, the parties are forbidden from agreeing on a period of time for the performance of such activities. There is thus nothing essentially contradictory between a definite period of employment and the nature of the employee's duties. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Judgment of the CA</b><br></div><br>As earlier mentioned, the CA upheld the NLRC.

COURT OF APPEALS PALPABLY ERRED IN LAW IN RULING THAT THE STIPULATION IN CONTRACT IS GOVERNING AND NOT THE NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT AS DEFINED BY LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioners maintain that the nature of employment in Innodata had been settled in <i>Villanueva v. National Labor Relations Commission (Second Division)</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and <i>Servidad v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> whereby the Court accorded regular status to the employees because the work they performed were necessary and desirable to the business of data encoding, processing and conversion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> They insist that the CA consequently committed serious error in not applying the pronouncement in said rulings, thereby ignoring the principle of <i>stare decisis</i> in declaring their employment as governed by the contract of employment; that the CA also erroneously found that the engagement of the petitioners was coterminous with the project that was nonexistent; that Innodata engaged in "semantic interplay of words" by introducing the concept of "fixed term employment" or "project employment" that were not founded in law;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and that Article 280 of the <i>Labor Code</i> guarantees the right of workers to security of tenure, which rendered the contracts between the petitioners and Innodata meaningless.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In refutation, Innodata insists that the contracts dealt with in <i>Villanueva</i> and <i>Servidad</i> were different from those entered into by the petitioners herein,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> in that the former contained stipulations that violated the provisions of the <i>Labor Code</i> on probationary employment and security of tenure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> while the latter contained terms known and explained to the petitioners who then willingly signed the same;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> that as a mere service provider, it did not create jobs because its operations depended on the availability of job orders or undertakings from its client;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> that Article 280 of the <i>Labor Code</i> allowed "term employment" as an exception to security of tenure; and that the decisive determinant was the day certain agreed upon by the parties, not the activities that the employees were called upon to perform.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Were the petitioners regular or project employees of Innodata?<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>We deny the petition for review on <i><i>certiorari</i></i>.<br><br><center><b>I<br><br><i>Stare decisis</i> does not apply where the facts are essentially different</b><br></center><br>Contrary to the petitioners' insistence, the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i>, by which the pronouncements in <i>Villanueva</i> and <i>Servidad</i> would control the resolution of this case, had no application herein.<br><br>The doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> enjoins adherence to judicial precedents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> When a court has laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle and apply it to all future cases in which the facts are substantially the same; but when the facts are essentially different, <i>stare decisis</i> does not apply because a perfectly sound principle as applied to one set of facts might be entirely inappropriate when a factual variance is introduced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><i>Servidad</i> and <i>Villanueva</i> involved contracts that contained stipulations not found in the contracts entered by the petitioners. The cogent observations in this regard by the CA are worth reiterating:<br><blockquote>A cursory examination of the facts would reveal that while all the cases abovementioned involved employment contracts with a fixed term, the employment contract subject of contention in the <i>Servidad</i> and <i>Villanueva</i> cases provided for <i>double probation</i>, meaning, that the employees concerned, by virtue of a clause incorporated in their contracts, were made to remain as probationary employees even if they continue to work beyond the six month probation period set by law. Indeed, such stipulation militates against Constitutional policy of guaranteeing the tenurial security of the workingman. To Our mind, the provision alluded to is what prodded the Supreme Court to disregard and nullify altogether the terms of the written entente. Nonetheless, it does not appear to be the intendment of the High Tribunal to sweepingly invalidate or declare as unlawful all employment contracts with a fixed period. To phrase it differently, the said agreements providing for a one year term would have been declared valid and, consequently, the separation from work of the employees concerned would have been sustained had their contracts not included any unlawful and circumventive condition.<br><br>It ought to be underscored that unlike in the <i>Servidad</i> and <i>Villanueva</i> cases, the written contracts governing the relations of the respondent company and the petitioners herein do not embody such illicit stipulation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br></blockquote>We also disagree with the petitioners' manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> that the Court struck down in <i>Innodata Philippines, Inc. v. Quejada-Lopez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> a contract of employment that was similarly worded as their contracts with Innodata. What the Court invalidated in <i>Innodata Philippines, Inc. v. Quejada-Lopez</i> was the purported fixed-term contract that provided for two periods - a fixed term of one year under paragraph 1 of the contract, and a three-month period under paragraph 7.4 of the contract - that in reality placed the employees under probation. In contrast, the petitioners' contracts did not contain similar stipulations, but stipulations to the effect that their engagement was for the fixed period of 12 months, to wit:<br><blockquote>1. The EMPLOYER shall employ the EMPLOYEE and the EMPLOYEE shall serve the EMPLOYER in the EMPLOYER'S business as a MANUAL EDITOR on a fixed term only and for a fixed and definite period of twelve months, commencing on August 7, 1995 and terminating on August 7, 1996, x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>In other words, the terms of the petitioners' contracts did not subject them to a probationary period similar to that indicated in the contracts struck down in <i>Innodata, Villanueva</i> and <i>Servidad</i>.<br><br><center><b>II<br><br>A fixed period in a contract of employment does not by itself signify an intention to circumvent Article 280 of the <i>Labor Code</i></b><br></center><br>The petitioners argue that Innodata circumvented the security of tenure protected under Article 280 of the <i>Labor Code</i> by providing a fixed term; and that they were regular employees because the work they performed were necessary and desirable to the business of Innodata.<br><br>The arguments of the petitioners lack merit and substance. <br><br>Article 280 of the <i>Labor Code</i> provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 280. Regular and Casual Employment. - The provisions of written agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless of the oral agreements of the parties, an employment shall be deemed to be regular where the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer except where the employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking the completion or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of the employee or where the work or service to be performed is seasonal in nature and the employment is for the duration of the season.<br><br>An employment shall be deemed casual if it is not covered by the preceding paragraph: Provided, That, any employee who has rendered at least one year of service, whether such service is continuous or broken, shall be considered a regular employee with respect to the activity in which he is employed and his employment shall continue while such actually exists.<br></blockquote>The provision contemplates three kinds of employees, namely: (a) regular employees; (b) project employees; and (c) casuals who are neither regular nor project employees. The nature of employment of a worker is determined by the factors provided in Article 280 of the <i>Labor Code</i>, regardless of any stipulation in the contract to the contrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Thus, in <i>Brent School, Inc. v. Zamora</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> we explained that the clause referring to written contracts should be construed to refer to agreements entered into for the purpose of circumventing the security of tenure. Obviously, Article 280 does not preclude an agreement providing for a fixed term of employment knowingly and voluntarily executed by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>A fixed term agreement, to be valid, must strictly conform with the requirements and conditions provided in Article 280 of the <i>Labor Code</i>. The test to determine whether a particular employee is engaged as a project or regular employee is whether or not the employee is assigned to carry out a specific project or undertaking, the duration or scope of which was specified at the time of his engagement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> There must be a determination of, or a clear agreement on, the completion or termination of the project at the time the employee is engaged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Otherwise put, the fixed period of employment must be knowingly and voluntarily agreed upon by the parties, without any force, duress or improper pressure being brought to bear upon the employee and absent any other circumstances vitiating his consent, or it must satisfactorily appear that the employer and employee dealt with each other on more or less equal terms with no moral dominance whatsoever being exercised by the former on the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The contracts of the petitioners indicated the one-year duration of their engagement as well as their respective project assignments (<i>i.e.</i>, Jamias being assigned to the CD-ROM project; Cruz and Matuguinas to the TSET project).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> There is no indication that the petitioners were made to sign the contracts against their will. Neither did they refute Innodata's assertion that it did not employ force, intimidate or fraudulently manipulate the petitioners into signing their contracts, and that the terms thereof had been explained and made known to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Hence, the petitioners knowingly agreed to the terms of and voluntarily signed their respective contracts.<br><br>That Innodata drafted the contracts with its business interest as the overriding consideration did not necessarily warrant the holding that the contracts were prejudicial against the petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The fixing by Innodata of the period specified in the contracts of employment did not also indicate its ill-motive to circumvent the petitioners' security of tenure. Indeed, the petitioners could not presume that the fixing of the one-year term was intended to evade or avoid the protection to tenure under Article 280 of the <i>Labor Code</i> in the absence of other evidence establishing such intention. This presumption must ordinarily be based on some aspect of the agreement other than the mere specification of the fixed term of the employment agreement, or on evidence aliunde of the intent to evade.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Lastly, the petitioners posit that they should be accorded regular status because their work as editors and proofreaders were usually necessary to Innodata's business of data processing.<br><br>We reject this position. For one, it would be unusual for a company like Innodata to undertake a project that had no relationship to its usual business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Also, the necessity and desirability of the work performed by the employees are not the determinants in term employment, but rather the "day certain" voluntarily agreed upon by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> As the CA cogently observed in this respect:<br><blockquote>There is proof to establish that Innodata's operations indeed rests upon job orders or undertakings coming from its foreign clients. Apparently, its employees are assigned to projects - one batch may be given a fixed period of one year, others, a slightly shorter duration, depending on the estimated time of completion of the particular job or undertaking farmed out by the client to the company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>In fine, the employment of the petitioners who were engaged as project employees for a fixed term legally ended upon the expiration of their contract. Their complaint for illegal dismissal was plainly lacking in merit.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DENY</b> the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>; <b>AFFIRM</b> the decision promulgated on July 31, 2002; and <b>ORDER</b> the petitioners to pay the costs of suit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.
