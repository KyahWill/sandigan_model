Section 1 of Rule 43 provides:<br><blockquote><b>Section 1.</b> <i>Scope</i>. — This Rule shall apply to appeals from judgments or final orders of the Court of Tax Appeals and from awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized <b>by any quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions</b>. Among these agencies are the Civil Service Commission, Central Board of Assessment Appeals, Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the President, Land Registration Authority, Social Security Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, <b>Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer</b>, National Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory Board, National Telecommunications Commission, Department of Agrarian Reform under Republic Act No. 6657, Government Service Insurance System, Employees Compensation Commission, Agricultural Invention Board, Insurance Commission, Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, Board of Investments, Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, and voluntary arbitrators authorized by law. (emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>Section 4, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court provides for the period to appeal to the CA from the judgments or orders of quasi-judicial agencies:<br><blockquote><b>Section 4.</b> <i>Period of appeal</i>. — The appeal shall be taken within fifteen (15) days from notice of the award, judgment, final order or resolution, or from the date of its last publication, if publication is required by law for its effectivity, or of the denial of petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration duly filed in accordance with the governing law of the court or agency <i>a quo</i>. Only one (1) motion for reconsideration shall be allowed. Upon proper motion and the payment of the full amount of the docket fee before the expiration of the reglementary period, <b>the Court of Appeals may grant an additional period of fifteen (15) days only within which to file the petition for review. No further extension shall be granted <u>except for the most compelling reason</u> and in no case to exceed fifteen (15) days</b>. (emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>The rule is clear that an appeal to the CA must be filed within a period of fifteen (15) days. While an extension of fifteen (15) days and a further extension of another fifteen (15) days may be requested, the second extension may be granted at the CA's discretion and only for the most compelling reason.<br><br>Motions for extensions are not granted as a matter of right but in the sound discretion of the court, and lawyers should never presume that their motions for extensions or postponement will be granted or that they will be granted the length of time they pray for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Further, the general rule is that a second motion for extension is not granted, except when the CA finds a compelling reason to grant the extension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The CA correctly held that Levi's failed to present a compelling reason to grant the second motion for extension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Levi's, by its own admission, only decided to proceed with the filing of the CA petition for review after the lapse of the first fifteen-day period for filing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Levi's late decision necessarily delayed the execution and notarization of the SPA and, consequently, the Philippine Consulate Offices' authentication of the SPA. Levi's cannot excuse its delay by citing its failure to anticipate the Philippine Consulate Office's closure due to the observance of the Philippine holidays. Certainly, Levi's own delay is not a compelling reason for the grant of a second extension to file a CA petition for review.<br><br>Levi's cannot also assume that its second motion for extension would be granted since the CA did not immediately act on the first and second motions for extension.<br><br>In <i>Go v. BPI Finance Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> we held that a party cannot use the CA's delayed action on a motion for extension as an excuse to delay the filing of the pleading as a party cannot make any assumption on how his motion would be resolved. "In fact, faced with the failure to act, the conclusion is that no favorable action had taken place and the motion had been denied."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>While the CA's late action on Levi's motions for extension is a response that this Court does not approve of, Levi's cannot use the CA's delay as an excuse to assume that the CA granted its second motion for extension and delay the filing of the CA petition for review.<br><br>To stress, the right to appeal is a statutory right, not a natural nor a constitutional right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The party who intends to appeal must comply with the procedures and rules governing appeals; otherwise, the right of appeal may be lost or squandered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The perfection of an appeal in the manner and within the period permitted by law is not only mandatory, but jurisdictional, and the failure to perfect that appeal renders the judgment of the court final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>It is true that in a number of instances, the Court has relaxed the governing periods of appeal in order to serve substantial justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The instant case, however, does not present itself to be an exceptional case to warrant the relaxation of the Rules on procedure. The following pronouncement is applicable to the present case:<br><blockquote>While petitioner pleads that a liberal, not literal, interpretation of the rules should be our policy guidance, nevertheless procedural rules are not to be disdained as mere technicalities. They may not be ignored to suit the convenience of a party. Adjective law ensures the effective enforcement of substantive rights through the orderly and speedy administration of justice. Rules are not intended to hamper litigants or complicate litigation. But they help provide for a vital system of justice where suitors may be heard in the correct form and manner, at the prescribed time in a peaceful though adversarial confrontation before a judge whose authority litigants acknowledge. Public order and our system of justice are well served by a conscientious observance of the rules of procedure x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote>Levi's request for the Court to review its case on the merits should be denied as well. The ruling of the IPO became final and executory after the period to appeal expired without the perfection of Levi's' appeal. The Court, therefore, may no longer review it.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we hereby <b>DENY</b> the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.
