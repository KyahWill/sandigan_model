				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In the same manner that this Court is cautioned to be circumspect because one party is the son of a sitting Justice of this Court, so too must we avoid abjuring what ought to be.done as dictated by law and justice solely for that reason.<br><br>Before this Court is a Petition for <i>Mandamus</i> filed under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, as amended, by Lord Allan Jay Q. Velasco (Velasco) against Hon. Feliciano R. Belmonte, Jr. (Speaker Belmonte, Jr.), Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Marilyn B. Barua-Yap (Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap), <i>Secretary General</i>, House of Representatives, and Hon. Regina Ongsiako Reyes (Reyes), <i>Representative,</i> Lone District of the Province of Marinduque.<br><br>Velasco principally alleges that he is the <i>"legal and rightful winner during the May 13, 2013 elections in accordance with final and executory resolutions of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) and [this] Honorable Court;"</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> thus, he seeks the following reliefs:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>that a WRIT OF MANDAMUS against the HON.

This Court explained that to be considered a Member of the House of Representatives, there must be a concurrence of the following requisites: (<i><b>i</b></i>) a valid proclamation, (<i><b>ii</b></i>) a proper oath, and (<b><i>iii</i></b>) assumption of office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On June 28, 2013, Tan filed a <i>Motion for Execution</i> (of the March 27, 2013 Resolution of the COMELEC First Division and the May 14, 2013 Resolution of the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>) in <u><b>SPA No. 13-053 (DC)</b></u>, wherein he prayed that:<br><br><blockquote>[A]n Order be issued granting the instant motion; and cause the immediate EXECUTION of this Honorable Commission's Resolutions dated March 27, 2013 and May 14, 2013; CAUSE the PROCLAMATION of LORD ALLAN JAY Q.

The dispositive part reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the instant motion for reconsideration is hereby GRANTED.

On the same day, Reyes, as the recognized elected Representative for the Lone District of Marinduque, along with the rest of the Members of the House of Representatives, took their oaths in open session before Speaker Belmonte, Jr.<br><br>On July 23, 2013, Reyes filed a <i>Manifestation and Notice of Withdrawal of Petition </i>"without waiver of her arguments, positions, defenses/causes of action as will be articulated in the HRET which is now the proper forum."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On October 22, 2013, Reyes's motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> (of this Court's June 25, 2013 Resolution in G.R.

No. 207264.<br><br>On December 3, 2013, said motion was treated as a second motion for reconsideration and was denied by this Court.<br><br>On December 5, 2013 and January 20, 2014, respectively, Velasco sent two letters to Reyes essentially demanding that she vacate the office of Representative of the Lone District of Marinduque and to relinquish the same in his favor.<br><br>On December 10, 2013, Velasco wrote a letter to Speaker Belmonte, Jr. requesting, among others, that he be allowed to assume the position of Representative of the Lone District of Marinduque.<br><br>On December 11, 2013, in <u><b>SPC No. 13-010</b></u>, acting on the Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Execution filed by Velasco on November 29, 2013, praying that:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that a writ of execution be ISSUED to implement and enforce the May 14, 2013 Resolution in SPA No. 13-053, the July 9, 2013 Resolution in SPC No. 13-010 and the July 16, 2013 Certificate of Proclamation of Petitioner Lord Allan Jay Q. Velasco as Representative of Marinduque. It is further prayed that a certified true copy of the writ of execution be personally served and delivered by the Commission's bailiff to Speaker Feliciano Belmonte for the latter's implementation and enforcement of the aforementioned May 14, 2013 Resolution and July 9, 2013 Resolution and the July 16, 2013 Certificate of Proclamation issued by the Special Board of Canvassers of the Honorable Commission.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote><br>the COMELEC issued an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated December 11, 2013 directing, inter alia, that all copies of its Resolutions in SPA No. 13-053 (DC) and SPC No. 13-010, the Certificate of Finality dated June 5, 2013, the Order dated July 10, 2013, and the Certificate of Proclamation dated July 16, 2013 be forwarded and furnished to Speaker Belmonte, Jr. for the latter's information and guidance.<br><br>On February 4, 2014, Velasco wrote another letter to Speaker Belmonte, Jr. reiterating the above-mentioned request but to no avail.<br><br>On February 6, 2014, Velasco also wrote a letter to Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap reiterating his earlier requests (July 12 and 18, 2013) to delete the name of Reyes from the Roll of Members and register his name in her place as the duly elected Representative of the Lone District of Marinduque.<br><br>However, Velasco relates that his efforts proved futile. He alleges that despite all the letters and requests to Speaker Belmonte, Jr. and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap, they refused to recognize him as the duly elected Representative of the Lone District of Marinduque. Likewise, in the face of numerous written demands for Reyes to vacate the position and office of the Representative of the Lone District of Marinduque, she continues to discharge the duties of said position.<br><br>Hence, the instant Petition for <i>Mandamus</i> with prayer for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or injunction anchored on the following issues:<br><br><blockquote>A. Whether or not Speaker Belmonte, Jr. can be COMPELLED, DIRECTED and ORDERED by a Writ of Mandamus to administer the oath in favor of petitioner as duly elected Marinduque Representative and allow him to assume said position and exercise the prerogatives of said office.<br><br>B. Whether or not respondent SG Barua-Yap can be COMPELLED, DIRECTED and ORDERED by a Writ of Mandamus to delete the name of respondent Reyes from the Roll of Members of the House and include the name of the Petitioner in the Roll of Members of the House of Representatives.<br><br>C. Whether or not a TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER (TRO) and a Writ of PERMANENT. INJUNCTION can be issued to prevent, restrain and prohibit respondent Reyes from exercising the prerogatives and performing the functions as Marinduque Representative, and to order her to VACATE the said office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>As to the first and second issues, Velasco contends that he "<i>has a well-defined and clear legal right and basis to warrant the grant of the writ of mandamus.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> He insists that the final and executory decisions of the COMELEC in SPA No. 13-053 (DC), and this Court in G.R. No. 207264, as well as the nullification of respondent Reyes's proclamation and his subsequent proclamation as the duly elected Representative of the Lone District of Marinduque, collectively give him the legal right to claim the congressional seat.<br><br>Thus, he contends that it is the ministerial duty of (z) respondent Speaker Belmonte, Jr. <i>"to administer the oath to [him] and to allow him to assume and exercise the prerogatives of the congressional seat for Marinduque representative;</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and (<i>ii</i>) respondent Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap <i>"to register [his] name xxxas the duly elected member of the House and delete the name of respondent Reyes from the Roll of Members."</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Velasco anchors his position on <i>Codilla, Sr. v. De Venecia,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> citing a statement of this Court to the effect that the Speaker of the House of Representatives has the ministerial duty to recognize the petitioner therein (Codilla) as the duly elected Representative of the Fourth District of Leyte.<br><br>Despite the foregoing, Velasco asserts that both respondents Speaker Belmonte, Jr. and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap are unlawfully neglecting the performance of their alleged ministerial duties; thus, illegally excluding him (Velasco) from the enjoyment of his right as the duly elected Representative of the Lone District of Marinduque.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>With respect to the third issue, Velasco posits that the "<i>continued usurpation and unlawful holding of such position by respondent Reyes has worked injustice and serious prejudice to [him] in that she has already received the salaries, allowances, bonuses and emoluments that pertain to the position of Marinduque Representative since June 30, 2013 up to the present in the amount of around several hundreds of thousands of pesos."</i> Therefore, he prays for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and a writ of permanent injunction against respondent Reyes to <i>"restrain, prevent and prohibit [her] from usurping the position.</i>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In her Comment, Reyes contends that the petition is actually one for <i>quo warranto </i>and not mandamus given that it essentially seeks a declaration that she usurped the subject office; and the installation of Velasco in her place by Speaker Belmonte, Jr. when the latter administers his oath of office and enters his name in the Roll of Members. She argues that, being a collateral attack on a title to public office, the petition must be dismissed as enunciated by the Court in several cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>As to the issues presented for resolution, Reyes questions the jurisdiction of the Court over <i>Quo Warranto</i> cases involving Members of the House of Representatives. She posits that <i>"even if the Petition for Mandamus be treated as one of Quo Warranto, it is still dismissible for lack of jurisdiction and absence of a clear legal right on the part of [Velasco]</i> "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> She argues that numerous jurisprudence have already ruled that it is the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal that has the sole and exclusive jurisdiction over all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of Members of the House of Representatives. Moreover, she insists that there is also an abundance of case law that categorically states that the COMELEC is divested of jurisdiction upon her proclamation as the winning candidate, as, in fact, the HRET had already assumed jurisdiction over<i> quo warranto </i>cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> filed against Reyes by several individuals.<br><br>Given the foregoing, Reyes concludes that this Court is "<i>devoid of original jurisdiction to annul [her] proclamation"</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> But she hastens to point out that (<i><b>i</b></i>) "<i>[e]ven granting for the sake of argument that the proclamation was validly nullified, [Velasco] as second placer cannot be declared the winner x x x"</i> as he was not the choice of the people of the Province of Marinduque; and (<i><b>ii</b></i>) Velasco is estopped from asserting the jurisdiction of this Court over her (Reyes) election because he (Velasco) filed an Election Protest <i>Ad Cautelam</i> in the HRET on May 31, 2014.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), arguing for Speaker Belmonte, Jr. and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap, opposed Velasco's petition on the following grounds:<br><br><blockquote><center>I.</center><br>UPON RESPONDENT REYES' PROCLAMATION ON MAY 18, 2013, EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION TO RESOLVE ELECTION CONTESTS INVOLVING RESPONDENT REYES, INCLUDING THE VALIDITY OF HER PROCLAMATION AND HER ELIGIBILITY FOR OFFICE, VESTED IN THE HRET.<br><br><i>Hence, until and unless the HRET grants any quo warranto petition or election protest filed against respondent Reyes, and such HRET resolution or resolutions become final and executory, respondent Reyes may not be restrained from exercising the prerogatives of Marinduque Representative, and respondent Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap may not be compelled by mandamus to remove respondent Reyes's name from the Roll of Members of the House.</i><br><br><center>II.</center><br>CODILLA v. COMELEC IS NOT APPLICABLE TO THIS CASE, GIVEN THAT PETITIONER, BEING MERELY THE SECOND PLACER IN THE MAY 13, 2013 ELECTIONS, CANNOT VALIDLY ASSUME THE POST OF MARINDUQUE REPRESENTATIVE.<br><br><i>Hence, respondents Speaker Belmonte and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap may not be compelled by mandamus to, respectively, administer the proper oath to petitioner and register the latter's name in the Roll of Members of the House.</i><br><br><center>III.</center><br>PETITIONER IS NOT ENTITLED TO THE INJUNCTIVE RELIEFS PRAYED FOR.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></blockquote><br>The OSG presents the foregoing arguments on the premise that there is a need for this Court to <i>revisit</i> its twin Resolutions dated June 25, 2013 and October 22, 2013 both in G.R. No. 207264, given that (<i>i</i>) this Court was "divided" when it issued the same; and (<i>ii</i>) there were strong dissents to the majority opinion. It argues that this Court has in the past revisited decisions already final and executory; there is no hindrance for this Court to do the same in G.R. No. 207264.<br><br>Moreover, the OSG contends that:<br><br><blockquote>Despite the finality of the June 25, 2013 Resolution and the October 22, 2013 Resolution, upholding the cancellation of respondent Reyes's CoC, there has been no compelling reason for the House to withdraw its recognition of respondent Reyes as Marinduque Representative, in the absence of any specific order or directive to the House. To be sure, there was nothing in the Honorable Court's disposition in <i>Reyes v. COMELEC</i> that required any action from the House. Again, it bears emphasis that neither petitioner nor respondents Speaker Belmonte and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap were parties in <i>Reyes v. COMELEC</i>.<br><br>Further, records with the HRET show that the following cases have been filed against respondent Reyes:<br><br>(i) Case No. 13-036 (Quo Warranto), entitled <i>Noeme Mayores Tan &amp; Jeasseca L. Mapacpac v. Regina Ongsiako Reyes</i>;<br><br>(ii) Case No. 13-037 (Quo Warranto), entitled<i> Eric D. Junio v. Regina Ongsiako Reyes</i>;<br><br>(iii) Case No. 13-027 (Quo Warranto), entitled C<i>hristopher Matienzo v. Regina Ongsiako Reyes;</i> and<br><br>(iv) Case No. 13-028 (Election Protest), entitled <i>Lord Allan Jay Velasco v. Regina Ongsiako Reyes</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>And in view of the cases filed in the HRET, the OSG insists that:<br><br><blockquote>If the jurisdiction of the COMELEC were to be retained until the assumption of office of the winner, at noon on the thirtieth day of June next following the election, then there would obviously be a clash of jurisdiction between the HRET and the COMELEC, given that the 2011 HRET Rules provide that the appropriate cases should be filed before it within 15 days from the date of proclamation of the winner. If, as the June 25, 2013 Resolution provides, the HRET's jurisdiction begins only after assumption of office, at noon of June 30 following the election, then <i>quo warranto</i> petitions and election protests filed on or after said date would be dismissed outright by the HRET under its own rules for having been filed out of time, where the winners have already been proclaimed within the period after the May elections and up to June 14.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br>In recent development, however, the HRET promulgated a Resolution on December 14, 2015 dismissing HRET Case Nos. 13-036 and 13-037,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the twin petitions for <i>quo warranto</i> filed against Reyes, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the September 23, 2014 Motion for Reconsideration of Victor Vela Sioco is hereby <b>GRANTED.</b> The September 11, 2014 Resolution of [the] Tribunal is hereby <b>REVERSED and SET ASIDE</b>. Accordingly, the present <i>Petitions for Quo Warranto</i> are hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></blockquote><br>In the said Resolution, the HRET held that <i>"the final Supreme Court ruling in G.R.

Further, the HRET directed "<i>the hearing and reception of evidence of the two Petitions for Quo Warranto against x x x Respondent [Reyes]</i> to proceed"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Sioco, however, moved for the reconsideration of the said September 11, 2014 HRET <i>Resolution</i> based on the argument that the latter was contrary to law and jurisprudence given the Supreme Court ruling in G.R. No. 207264.<br><br>Subsequently, the December 14, 2015 <i>Resolution</i> of the HRET held that-<br><br><blockquote><center><i>The Tribunal's Jurisdiction</i><br></center><br>It is necessary to clarify the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the present petitions for <i>quo warranto</i>, considering the parties' divergent postures on how the Tribunal should resolve the same <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Supreme Court ruling in G.R. No. 207264.<br><br>The petitioners believe that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over their petitions. They pray that "after due proceedings," the Tribunal "declare Respondent REGINA ONGSIAKO REYES DISQUALIFIED/INELIGIBLE to sit as Member of the House of Representatives, representing the Province of Marinduque." In addition, the petitioner Eric Del Mundo Junio urges the Tribunal to follow the Supreme Court pronouncement in G.R. No. 207264.<br><br>On the other hand, Victor Vela Sioco, in his <i>Petition-In-Intervention</i>, pleads for the outright dismissal of the present petitions considering the Supreme Court final ruling in G.R. No. 207264. For her part, respondent Regina Reyes prays too for the dismissal of the present petitions, albeit after reception of evidence by the contending parties.<br><br>The constitutional mandate of the Tribunal is clear: It is "the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of [House] Members." Such power or authority of the Tribunal is echoed in its 2011 Rules of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal: "The Tribunal is the sole judge of all contests relating to the elections, returns, and qualifications of the Members of the House of Representatives."<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In the present cases, before respondent Regina Reyes was proclaimed on May 18, 2013, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>, in its Resolution of May 14, 2013 in SPA No. 13-053 (DC), had already resolved that the COMELEC First Division correctly cancelled her COC on the ground that she lacked the Filipino citizenship and residency requirements. Thus, the COMELEC nullified her proclamation. When Regina Reyes challenged the COMELEC actions, the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i>, in its Resolution of June 25, 2013 in G.R. No. 207246, upheld the same.<br><br>With the COMELEC's cancellation of respondent Regina Reyes' COC, resulting in the nullification of her proclamation, the Tribunal, much as we would want to, cannot assume jurisdiction over the present petitions. The jurisdiction of the HRET begins only after the candidate is considered a Member of the House of Representatives. And to be considered a <u>Member</u> of the House of Representatives, there must be a concurrence of the following requisites: (1) a valid proclamation, (2) a proper oath, and (3) assumption of office, so the Supreme Court pronounced in its Resolution of June 25, 2013 in G.R. No. 207264, thus:<br><blockquote>x x x, the jurisdiction of the HRET begins only after the candidate is considered a <u>Member</u> of the House of Representatives, as stated in Section 17, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As held in <i>Marcos v. COMELEC,</i> the HRET does not have jurisdiction over a candidate who is not a member of the House of Representatives x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The next inquiry, then, is when is a candidate considered a Member of the House of Representatives?<br><br>In <i>Vinzons-Chato v. COMELEC,</i> citing<i> Aggabao v. COMELEC</i> and<i> Guerrero v. COMELEC,</i> the Court ruled that:<br><blockquote>The Court has invariably held that once a winning candidate has been proclaimed, taken his oath, and assumed office as a Member of the House of Representatives, the COMELEC's jurisdiction over election contests relating to his election, returns, and qualifications ends, and the HRET's own jurisdiction begins, x x x</blockquote>From the foregoing, it is then clear that to be considered a Member of the House of Representatives, there must be a concurrence of the following requisites: (1) a <u>valid proclamation</u>, (2) a proper oath, and (3) assumption of office xxx.</blockquote>Based on the above-quoted ruling of the Supreme Court, a <i>valid proclamation</i> is the first essential element before a candidate can be considered a <u>Member</u> of the House of Representatives over which the Tribunal could assume jurisdiction. Such element is obviously absent in the present cases as Regina Reyes' proclamation was nullified by the COMELEC, which nullification was upheld by the Supreme Court. On this ground alone, the Tribunal is without power to assume jurisdiction over the present petitions since Regina Reyes "cannot be considered a Member of the House of Representatives," as declared by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> in G.R. No. 207264. It further stresses:<br><blockquote>"x x x there was no basis for the proclamation of petitioner [Regina Reyes] on 18 May 2013. Without the proclamation, the petitioner's oath of office is likewise baseless, and without a precedent oath of office, there can be no valid and effective assumption of office."</blockquote>The Supreme Court has spoken. Its pronouncements must be respected. Being the ultimate guardian of the Constitution, and by constitutional design, the Supreme Court is "supreme in its task of adjudication; x x x. As a rule, all decisions and determinations in the exercise of judicial power ultimately go to and stop at the Supreme Court whose judgment is <u>final</u>." This Tribunal, as all other courts, must take their bearings from the decisions and rulings of the Supreme Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></blockquote><br>Incidentally, it appears that an Information against Reyes for violation of Article 177 (Usurpation of Official Functions) of the Revised Penal Code, dated August 3, 2015, has been filed in court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> entitled "<i>People of the Philippines v.

Gen. Barua-Yap to perform the specific acts sought by Velasco in this petition.<br><br><u><center><b>The Ruling</b></center></u><br>The petition has merit.<br><br>At the outset, this Court observes that the respondents have taken advantage of this petition to re-litigate what has been settled in G.R. No. 207264. Respondents are reminded to respect the <i>Entry of Judgment </i>that has been issued therein on October 22, 2013.<br><br>After a painstaking evaluation of the allegations in this petition, it is readily apparent that this special civil action is really one for <i>mandamus</i> and not a <i>quo warranto </i>case, contrary to the asseverations of the respondents.<br><br>A petition for <i>quo warranto</i> is a proceeding to determine the right of a person to the use or exercise of a franchise or office and to oust the holder from its enjoyment, if his claim is not well-founded, or if he has forfeited his right to enjoy the privilege. Where the action is filed by a private person, he must prove that he is entitled to the controverted position; otherwise, respondent has a right to the undisturbed possession of the office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In this case, given the present factual milieu, <i>i.e</i>., (<i>i</i>) the final and executory resolutions of this Court in G.R. No. 207264; (<i>ii</i>) the final and executory resolutions of the COMELEC in SPA No. 13-053 (DC) cancelling Reyes's Certificate of Candidacy; and (<i>iii</i>) the final and executory resolution of the COMELEC in SPC No. 13-010 declaring null and void the proclamation of Reyes and proclaiming Velasco as the winning candidate for the position of Representative for the Lone District of the Province of Marinduque - it cannot be claimed that the present petition is one for the determination of the right of Velasco to the claimed office.<br><br>To be sure, what is prayed for herein is merely the enforcement of clear legal duties and not to try disputed title. That the respondents make it appear so will not convert this petition to one for <i>quo warranto.</i><br><br>Section 3, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, as amended, provides that any person may file a verified petition for <i>mandamus</i> "when any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law." A petition for <i>mandamus</i> will prosper if it is shown that the subject thereof is a <i>ministerial</i> act or duty, and <i>not purely discretionary</i> on the part of the board, officer or person, and that the petitioner has a well-defined, clear and certain right to warrant the grant thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>The difference between a ministerial and discretionary act has long been established. A purely ministerial act or duty is one which an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. If the law imposes a duty upon a public officer and gives him the right to decide how or when the duty shall be performed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministerial only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of official discretion or judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>As the facts stand in this case, Speaker Belmonte, Jr. and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap have no discretion whether or not to administer the oath of office to Velasco and to register the latter's name in the Roll of Members of the House of Representatives, respectively. It is beyond cavil that there is in existence final and executory resolutions of this Court in G.R. No. 207264 affirming the final and executory resolutions of the COMELEC in SPA No. 13-053 (DC) cancelling Reyes's Certificate of Candidacy. There is likewise a final and executory resolution of the COMELEC in SPC No. 13-010 declaring null and void the proclamation of Reyes, and proclaiming Velasco as the winning candidate for the position of Representative for the Lone District of the Province of Marinduque.<br><br>The foregoing state of affairs collectively lead this Court to consider the facts as settled and beyond dispute - <b>Velasco is the proclaimed winning candidate for the Representative of the Lone District of the Province of Marinduque.</b><br><br>Reyes argues in essence that this Court is devoid of original jurisdiction to annul her proclamation. Instead, it is the HRET that is constitutionally mandated to resolve any questions regarding her election, the returns of such election, and her qualifications as a Member of the House of Representatives especially so that she has already been proclaimed, taken her oath, and started to discharge her duties as a Member of the House of Representatives representing the Lone District of the Province of Marinduque. But the confluence of the three acts in this case - <b>her proclamation, oath and assumption of office</b> - has not altered the legal situation between Velasco and Reyes.<br><br>The important point of reference should be the date the COMELEC finally decided to cancel the Certificate of Candidacy (COC) of Reyes which was on May 14, 2013. The <b>most crucial time</b> is when Reyes's COC was cancelled due to her non-eligibility to run as Representative of the Lone District of the Province of Marinduque - <b>for without a valid COC, Reyes could not be treated as a candidate in the election and much less as a duly proclaimed winner</b>. That particular decision of the COMELEC was promulgated even before Reyes's proclamation, and which was affirmed by this Court's final and executory <i>Resolutions </i>dated June 25, 2013 and October 22, 2013.<br><br>This Court will not give premium to the illegal actions of a subordinate entity of the COMELEC, the PBOC who, despite knowledge of the May 14, 2013 resolution of the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> cancelling Reyes's COC, still proclaimed her as the winning candidate on May 18, 2013. Note must also be made that as early as May 16, 2013, a couple of days before she was proclaimed, Reyes had already received the said decision cancelling her COC. These points clearly show that the much argued proclamation was made in clear defiance of the said COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> Resolution.<br><br>That Velasco now has a well-defined, clear and certain right to warrant the grant of the present petition for <i>mandamus</i> is supported by the following undisputed facts that should be taken into consideration:<br><br><u><b>First.</b></u> At the time of Reyes's proclamation, her COC was already cancelled by the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> in its final finding in its resolution dated May 14, 2013, the effectivity of which was not enjoined by this Court, as Reyes did not avail of the prescribed remedy which is to seek a restraining order within a period of five (5) days as required by Section 13(b), Rule 18 of COMELEC Rules. Since no restraining order was forthcoming, the PBOC should have refrained from proclaiming Reyes.<br><br><u><b>Second</b></u>. This Court upheld the COMELEC decision cancelling respondent Reyes's COC in its Resolutions of June 25, 2013 and October 22, 2013 and these Resolutions are already final and executory.<br><br><u><b>Third</b></u>. As a consequence of the above events, the COMELEC in SPC No. 13-010 cancelled respondent Reyes's proclamation and, in turn, proclaimed Velasco as the duly elected Member of the House of Representatives in representation of the Lone District of the Province of Marinduque. <b>The said proclamation has not been challenged or questioned by Reyes in any proceeding.</b><br><br><u><b>Fourth</b></u>. When Reyes took her oath of office before respondent Speaker Belmonte, Jr. in open session, Reyes had <b>NO</b> valid COC <b>NOR</b> a valid proclamation.<br><br>Thus, to consider Reyes's proclamation and treating it as a material fact in deciding this case will paradoxically alter the well-established legal milieu between her and Velasco.<br><br><u><b>Fifth.</b></u> In view of the foregoing, Reyes <b>HAS ABSOLUTELY NO LEGAL BASIS</b> to serve as a Member of the House of Representatives for the Lone District of the Province of Marinduque, and therefore, she <b>HAS NO LEGAL PERSONALITY</b> to be recognized as a party-respondent at <i>a quo warranto</i> proceeding before the HRET.<br><br>And this is precisely the basis for the HRET's December 14, 2015 Resolution acknowledging and ruling that it has no jurisdiction over the twin petitions for <i>quo warranto</i> filed against Reyes. Its finding was based on the existence of a final and executory ruling of this Court in G.R. No. 207264 that Reyes is not a <i>bona fide</i> member of the House of Representatives for lack of a valid proclamation. To reiterate this Court's pronouncement in its Resolution, entitled <i>Reyes v. Commission on Elections </i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>-<br><br><blockquote>The averred proclamation is the critical pointer to the correctness of petitioner's submission. The crucial question is whether or not petitioner [Reyes] could be proclaimed on 18 May 2013. Differently stated, was there basis for the proclamation of petitioner on 18 May 2013?<br><br>Dates and events indicate that there was no basis for the proclamation of petitioner on 18 May 2013.

After 14 May 2013, there was, before the COMELEC, no longer any pending case on petitioner's qualifications to run for the position of Member of the House of Representatives, x x x."<br></blockquote>As the point has obviously been missed by the petitioner [Reyes] who continues to argue on the basis of her "due proclamation," the instant motion gives us the opportunity to highlight the undeniable fact we here repeat that <b>the proclamation which petitioner secured on 18 May 2013 was WITHOUT ANY BASIS.</b>" (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote><br>Put in another way, contrary to the view that the resort to the jurisdiction of the HRET is a plain, speedy and adequate remedy, such recourse is not a legally available remedy to any party, specially to Velasco, who should be the sitting Member of the House of Representatives if it were not for the disregard by the leadership of the latter of the binding decisions of a constitutional body, the COMELEC, and the Supreme Court<br><br>Though the earlier existence of the twin<i> quo warranto</i> petitions filed against Reyes before the HRET had actually no bearing on the status of finality of the decision of the COMELEC in SPC No. 13-010. Nonetheless, their dismissal pursuant to the HRET's December 14, 2015 Resolution sustained Velasco's well-defined, clear and certain right to the subject office.<br><br>The present Petition for <i>Mandamus </i>seeks the issuance of a writ of <i>mandamus</i> to compel respondents Speaker Belmonte, Jr. and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap to <b>acknowledge</b> and <b>recognize</b> the final and executory Decisions and Resolution of this Court and of the COMELEC by administering the oath of office to Velasco and entering the latter's name in the Roll of Members of the House of Representatives. In other words, the Court is called upon to determine whether or not the prayed for acts, <i>i.e</i>., (<i>i</i>) the administration of the oath of office to Velasco; and (if) the inclusion of his name in the Roll of Members, are ministerial in character vis-a-vis the factual and legal milieu of this case. As we have previously stated, the administration of oath and the registration of Velasco in the Roll of Members of the House of Representatives for the Lone District of the Province of Marinduque <b>are no longer a matter of discretion or judgment</b> on the part of Speaker Belmonte, Jr. and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap. They are legally duty-bound to recognize Velasco as the duly elected Member of the House of Representatives for the Lone District of Marinduque in view of the ruling rendered by this Court and the COMELEC'S compliance with the said ruling, now both final and executory.<br><br>It will not be the first time that the Court will grant Mandamus to compel the Speaker of the House of Representatives to administer the oath to the rightful Representative of a legislative district and the Secretary-General to enter said Representative's name in the Roll of Members of the House of Representatives. In <i>Codilla, Sr. v. De Venecia</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the Court decreed:<br><br><blockquote>Under Rule 65, Section 3 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, any person may file a verified petition for <i>mandamus</i> "when any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law." For a petition for <i>mandamus</i> to prosper, it must be shown that the subject of the petition for <i>mandamus</i> is a <i>ministerial</i> act or duty, and <i>not purely discretionary</i> on the part of the board, officer or person, and that the petitioner has a well-defined, clear and certain right to warrant the grant thereof.<br><br>The distinction between a ministerial and discretionary act is well delineated. A purely ministerial act or duty is one which an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. If the law imposes a duty upon a public officer and gives him the right to decide how or when the duty shall be performed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministerial only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of official discretion or judgment.<br><br>In the case at bar, the administration of oath and the registration of the petitioner in the Roll of Members of the House of Representatives representing the 4th legislative district of Leyte is no longer a matter of discretion on the part of the public respondents. The facts are settled and beyond dispute: petitioner garnered 71,350 votes as against respondent Locsin who only got 53,447 votes in the May 14, 2001 elections. The COMELEC Second Division initially ordered the proclamation of respondent Locsin; on Motion for Reconsideration the COMELEC <i>en banc </i>set aside the order of its Second Division and ordered the proclamation of the petitioner. The Decision of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> has not been challenged before this Court by respondent Locsin and said Decision has become final and executory.<br><br>In sum, the issue of who is the rightful Representative of the 4th legislative district of Leyte has been finally settled by the COMELEC <i>en banc,</i> the constitutional body with jurisdiction on the matter. <i>The rule of law demands that its Decision be obeyed by all officials of the land. There is no alternative to the rule of law except the reign of chaos and confusion.</i><br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, the Petition for <i>Mandamus </i>is granted. Public Speaker of the House of Representatives shall administer the oath of petitioner EUFROCINO M. CODILLA, SR., as the duly-elected Representative of the 4th legislative district of Leyte.

No. 207264, Velasco can neither ask for the enforcement of the Decision rendered therein nor argue that the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> by conclusiveness of judgment applies to him and the public respondents, this Court maintains that such contention is incorrect. Velasco, along with public respondents Speaker Belmonte, Jr. and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap, are all legally bound by this Court's judgment in G.R. No. 207264,<i> i.e.,</i> essentially, that the COMELEC correctly cancelled Reyes's COC for Member of the House of Representatives for the Lone District of the Province of Marinduque on the ground that the latter was ineligible for the subject position due to her failure to prove her Filipino citizenship and the requisite one-year residency in the Province of Marinduque. A contrary view would have our dockets unnecessarily clogged with petitions to be filed in every direction by any and all registered voters not a party to a case to question the final decision of this Court. Such restricted interpretation of <i>res judicata </i>is intolerable for it will defeat this Court's ruling in G.R. No. 207264. To be sure, Velasco who was duly proclaimed by COMELEC is a proper party to invoke the Court's final judgment that Reyes was ineligible for the subject position.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>It is well past the time for everyone concerned to accept what has been adjudicated and take judicial notice of the fact that Reyes's ineligibility to run for and be elected to the subject position had already been long affirmed by this Court.

Barua-Yap (Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap), and Representative Regina Ongsiako-Reyes (Reyes).<br><br><center><b>I. <u>THE PETITION</u></b></center><br>The petition seeks to compel: Speaker Belmonte to administer the proper oath in favor of Velasco and allow him to assume office as Representative for Marinduque and exercise the powers and prerogatives attached to the office; and Sec. Gen Barua-Yap to remove the name of Reyes, and register his name in her place, in the Roll of Members of the House of Representatives <i>(HOR)</i>. It also seeks to restrain Reyes from further exercising the powers and prerogatives attached to the position and to direct her to immediately vacate it.<br><br>Velasco asserts that <i><b>"he has a well-defined and clear legal right and basis to warrant the grant of the writ of mandamus.</b></i>" He argues that the final and executory resolutions of <b>the Commission on Elections</b> ("<i>Comelec"</i>) <b>in SPA No. 13-053 and SPC No. 13-010 and of the Court in GR No. 207264</b>, with his proclamation as Representative of Marinduque, grant him this clear legal right to claim and assume the congressional seat.<br><br>Because of this clear legal right, Velasco reasons out that <b>Speaker Belmonte has the ministerial duty to "<i>administer the oath to [him] and allow him to assume and exercise the prerogatives of the congressional seat</i></b><i>x x x.</i> " <b>Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap, on the hand, has the ministerial duty to "<i>register [his] name xxx as the duly elected member of the [HOR] and delete the name of respondent Reyes from the Roll of Members."</i></b> Velasco cites <i>Codilla v. De Venecia</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> to support his claim.<br><br>He claims that Speaker Belmonte and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap are unlawfully neglecting the performance of these ministerial duties, thus, illegally excluding him from the enjoyment of his right as the duly elected Marinduque Representative.<br><br>As regards <b>Reyes</b>, Velasco asserts that the<i><b> "continued usurpation and unlawful holding of such position by respondent Reyes has worked injustice and serious prejudice to [him] in that she has already received the salaries, allowances, bonuses and emoluments that pertain to the [office] since June 30, 2013 up to the present xxx."</b></i><br><br>For these reasons, he argues that a writ of <i>mandamus</i> should be issued to compel Speaker Belmonte and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap to perform their ministerial duties; and that a TRO and a writ of permanent injunction should also be issued to restrain, prevent, and prohibit Reyes from usurping the position that rightfully belongs to him.<br><br><center><b>II. <u>THE <i>PONENCIA'S</i> RULING</u></b></center><br>The <i>ponencia</i> grants the petition; it views the petition merely as a plea to the Court for the enforcement of what it perceives as clear legal duties on the part of the respondents.<br><br>To the <i>ponencia</i>, any issue on who is the rightful Representative of the Lone District of Marinduque has been settled with the finality of the rulings in GR No. 207264, SPA No. 13-035, and SPC No. 13-010.<br><br>Recognizing it settled that Velasco is the proclaimed winning candidate for the Marinduque Representative position, the <i>ponencia</i> concludes that the administration of oath and the registration of Velasco in the Roll of Members of the HOR are no longer matters of discretion on the part of Speaker Belmonte and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap. Hence, the writ of <i>mandamus</i> must issue.<br><br><center><b>III. <u>MY DISSENT</u></b></center><br>I submit this <b>Dissenting Opinion</b> to object to the <i>ponencia's</i> GRANT of the petition, as I disagree with the <i>ponencia's</i> premises and conclusion that Velasco is entitled to the issuance of a writ of <i>mandamus</i>. I likewise believe that Velasco's petition should be dismissed because:<br><br>(1) he failed to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of the writ of <i>mandamus</i>; and<br><br>(2) the grant of the writ is a patent violation of the principle of the separation of powers that will disturb, not only the Court's relations with the HOR, a co-equal branch of government. As well, it will result in upsetting the established lines of jurisdiction among the Comelec, the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal <i>(HRET)</i>, and the Court.<br><br>Needless to state, the HOR may very well have its own views about the admission of its Members and can conceivably prefer its own views to those of the Court on matters that it believes are within its competence and jurisdiction to decide as an equal and separate branch of government.<br><br>Additionally, as I reminded the Court in my writings on the cases affecting Velasco, the Court should be keenly aware of the sensitivity involved in handling the case. <i><b>Velasco is the son of a colleague, <u>Associate Justice Presbitero Velasco, who is also the Chair of the HRET</u></b></i>. Thus, we should be very clear and certain if we are to issue the writ in order to avoid any charge that the Court favors its own.<br><br><b><center>IV. <u>DISCUSSION</u> </center><br>IV.A. Mandamus: Nature and Concept</b><br><br><i>Mandamus</i> is a command issuing from a court of law of competent jurisdiction, in the name of the state or sovereign, <u><i>directed to some <b>inferior</b> court, tribunal, or board, or to some corporation or person,</i></u> requiring the performance of a particular duty therein specified, which duty results from the official station of the party to whom the writ is directed, or from operation of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The writ of <i>mandamus</i> is an <u><i><b>extraordinary remedy</b></i></u><i> issued only in cases of extreme necessity where the ordinary course of procedure is powerless to afford an adequate and speedy relief</i> to one who has a <i>clear legal right to the performance of the act </i>to be compelled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>As a peremptory writ,<i> mandamus</i> must be issued with utmost circumspection, and should always take into consideration existing laws, rules and jurisprudence on the matter, particularly the principles underlying our Constitution.<br><br>Moreover, the remedy of <i>mandamus</i> is employed to compel the performance of a <i><b>ministerial duty</b></i> after performance of the duty has been refused. As a rule, it cannot be used to direct the exercise of judgment or discretion; if at all, the obligated official carrying the duty can only be directed by <i>mandamus</i> to act, but not to act in a particular way. The courts can only interfere when the refusal to act already constitutes inaction amounting to grave abuse of discretion, manifest injustice, palpable excess of authority, or other causes affecting jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><i><b>IV.A.l. Mandamus as a remedy <br>under Rule 65 of the<br> Rules of Court</b></i><br><br>In this jurisdiction, the remedy of <i>mandamus</i> is governed by Section 3, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. Under Section 3, <i>mandamus</i> is the remedy available when <i>"a tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, [<b>and</b>], there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law."</i><br><br>The person aggrieved by the unlawful neglect or unlawful exclusion of the tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person may file the petition for <i>mandamus</i> with the proper court.<br><br><i><b>IV.A.L Ministerial v. discretionary acts</b></i><br><br><b>"Discretion,"</b> when applied to public functionaries, means the power or right conferred upon them by law of acting officially, under certain circumstances, uncontrolled by the judgment or sense of propriety of others. If the law imposes a duty upon a public officer and gives him the right to decide how and when the duty shall be performed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In contrast, a purely ministerial act or duty is one which an officer or tribunal performs under a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment on the propriety or impropriety of the act done.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The duty is ministerial only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of official discretion or judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>A ministerial act is one as to which nothing is left to the discretion of the person who must perform. <b>It is a simple, definite duty arising under conditions admitted or proved to exist and imposed by law. </b>It is a precise act accurately marked out, enjoined upon particular officers for a particular purpose.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><b>IV.B. Requirements for the<br> issuance of the writ of <i>mandamus</i></b><br><br>In the light of its nature, the writ of <i>mandamus</i> will issue only if the following requirements are complied with:<br><br><i><b><u>First</u>,</b></i> the petitioner has a <u><i><b>clear and unmistakable lesal right</b></i></u><i> to the act demanded.</i><br><br>The clear and unmistakable right that the writ of <i>mandamus</i> requires pertains to those rights that are well-defined, clear and certain. The writ contemplates only those <b>rights</b> which are <b>founded in law, are specific, certain, clear, established, complete, undisputed or unquestioned, and are without any semblance or color of doubt.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In situations where the right claimed, or the petitioner's entitlement to it, is unclear, the writ of <i>mandamus</i> will not lie. The writ of <i>mandamus</i> will not issue to establish a right or to compel an official to give to the applicant anything to which he is not clearly entitled. <b><i>Mandamus </i>never issues in doubtful cases, or to enforce a right which is in substantial dispute or to which substantial doubt exists.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><i><b>Second</b>, it must be the duty of the respondent to perform the act because it is mandated by law.</i><br><br>The act must be clearly and peremptorily enjoined by law or by reason of the respondent's official station. It must be the imperative duty of the respondent to perform the act required.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><i><b>Third</b>, the respondent unlawfully neglects the performance of the duty enjoined by law or unlawfully excludes the petitioner from the use or enjoyment of the right or office.</i><br><br><i><b>Fourth</b>, the act to be performed is ministerial, not discretionary.</i><br><br><i><b>Fifth</b></i><b> and last,</b> <i>there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.</i><br><br><b>IV.C. Velasco's petition and the<br>requirements for the issuance <br>of the writ of<i> mandamus</i></b><br><br>Velasco failed to comply <b>with all five requirements</b> for the issuance of a writ of <i>mandamus.</i><br><br><i><b>IV.C.1. No showing of any clear <br>and unmistakable right</b></i><br><br>Velasco failed to show that he has a clear, established, and unmistakable right to the position of Representative of Marinduque. Any right that Velasco may claim to hold is, at most, substantially doubtful or is in substantial dispute; in either case, the existence of doubt renders the Court unjustified in issuing a writ in Velasco's favor.<br><br>Velasco's cited legal grounds for the issuance of the writ of mandamus in his favor are the final rulings in the following cases: <u><b>SPA No. 13-053</b></u> and <u><i><b>Reyes v. Comelec</b></i></u>, and <u><b>SPC No. 13-010.</b></u> Thus, a look into what these cases really are and what they say is in order.<br><br><center><b>IV.C.l.a. SPA No. 13-053 <br>(<i>Socorro B. Tan v. Regina Ongsiako-Reyes</i>) <br>and <i>Reyes v. Comelec,</i> GR No. 207264</b><br></center><br><u><b>SPA No. 13-053</b></u> involved the petition filed by Socorro B. Tan <u><i><b>before the Comelec</b></i></u> to deny due course to or cancel Reyes' CoC on the ground of the alleged material misrepresentations Reyes made. <u><i><b>Velasco was not a party to this case.</b></i></u><br><br>The Comelec cancelled Reyes' CoC in its May 14, 2013 resolution (in SPA No. 13-053). Note should be taken of the fact that <u>this May 14, 2013 Comelec ruling became final and executory only on <b>May 19, 2013</b></u> or <i>"five (5) days after its promulgation"</i> per Section 13, Rule 18 of the 1993 Comelec Rules of Procedure, in relation with Paragraph 2, Section 8 of Resolution No. 9523; and that the Comelec itself did not enjoin Reyes' proclamation. As a result, the Comelec, itself, proclaimed Reyes on <b>May 18, 2013.</b><br><br>I point out that in the June 25, 2013 resolution in <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i>, this Court <i>expressly</i> characterized <i><b>SPA No. 13-053</b></i> to be <i><b>summary in nature</b></i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Reyes assailed the Comelec rulings in SPA No. 13-053 before this Court via a petition for <i>certiorari,</i> docketed as <u><b>GR No. 207264 (<i>Reyes v. Comelec or "Reyes"</i>)</b></u>. The Court's majority, in this June 25, 2013 resolution, <u><i><b>dismissed</b></i></u> respondent Reyes' petition <u><i><b>outright</b></i></u> based solely on the face of the petition and its annexes.<br><br><i>Reyes</i> carries several features that the Court should be aware of:<br><br><u><b>First.</b></u> <i>Reyes</i> was a petition that respondent Reyes filed to question the Comelec's cancellation of her CoC in SPA No. 13-053. Respondent Reyes cited the violation of her right to due process and the Comelec's grave abuse of discretion as grounds for her petition.<br><br><u><b>Second</b></u>. Only Tan (the petitioner before the Comelec) was the party respondent before the Court in <i>Reyes;</i> Velasco was not a party to the case as he was not a party to the challenged Comelec ruling.<br><br><u><b>Third.</b></u> The Court did not see it fit to hear the respondent Tan (let alone Velasco who was not a party) before issuing its outright dismissal, although the Court subsequently heard Tan's arguments in her comment to herein respondent Reyes' motion for reconsideration (compelled perhaps by the vigorous dissent issued against the outright dismissal).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Under the circumstances of the outright dismissal of the petition, the belated attempt at hearing Tan on the motion for reconsideration, however, does not change the character of the Court's rulings and proceedings as summary.<br><br><u><b>Fourth</b></u>. In <i><b>dismissing the petition outright</b></i> the Court only considered the Reyes petition itself, the assailed Comelec rulings (SPA No. 13-053), and the petition's other annexes. The outright dismissal was made <i><b>despite</b></i> the plea from the Dissent that <i><b>the case be fully heard because it would benefit the son of a sitting Justice of the Court.</b></i><br><br><u><b>Fifth</b></u>. The Court's majority also chose not to hear anymore the<b> HRET</b>, the <b>Comelec</b>, or the <b>Office of the Solicitor General</b> on petitioner Reyes' positions and arguments, particularly on the <i><b>issue of the delineation of jurisdiction between the HRET and the Comelec.</b></i><br><br><u><b>Sixth</b></u>. The Court's rulings - both in the June 25, 2013 outright dismissal of the <i>Reyes</i> petition and the October 22, 2013 resolution on the motion for reconsideration — <b>never declared nor recognized Velasco as the duly elected Representative of Marinduque.</b><br><br><u><b>Seventh.</b></u> The rulings in SPA No. 13-053 and <i>Reyes v. Comelec </i>did not consider and rule on any matter other than the material misrepresentation she allegedly committed.<br><br>Thus, any legal effect that these rulings carry should not be extended to matters outside of the issues and matters specifically addressed by these rulings, as these extraneous rulings are <i>obiter dicta.</i><br><br>Specifically, these rulings and their legal effects cannot extend to Reyes' election, returns, and qualification as Marinduque Representative. Nor should these rulings vest in Velasco the title to hold the position, even assuming that petitioner Reyes' CoC was properly cancelled.<br><br>In resolving the present <i>mandamus</i> petition, the Court must appreciate that Velasco's cited rulings are simply summary determinations of the alleged material misrepresentation committed by Reyes in her CoC, and cannot be used as basis for the requested issuance of the writ.<br><br><u><b>Eight</b></u>. In the outright dismissal of Reyes' <i>certiorari</i> petition, the Court's majority declared that the Comelec retained its jurisdiction over respondent Reyes and the CoC cancellation proceeding against her because respondent Reyes was not a member of the HOR over whom the HRET can exercise its jurisdiction.<br><br>The majority reasoned out that a candidate is considered a Member of the HOR only after the candidate has been <b>proclaimed, has taken the proper oath, and has assumed office.</b><br><br>This declaration is noteworthy because of the <u><i><b>intervening factual developments</b></i></u> that significantly altered the consequent legal effects of: (1) the Comelec's rulings in SPC No. 13-053 and of the Court's rulings in <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i>; and (2) the subsequent Comelec actions and rulings affecting respondent Reyes' right to hold her congressional seat.<br><br>These intervening factual developments, more fully discussed below, is another reason why the Court cannot issue the writ of <i>mandamus<b> for the reason alone</b></i> that the rulings in SPC No. 13-053 and in <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i> had <u><i><b>become final and executory.</b></i></u><br><br>Lastly, the Court should sit up and take notice because of the <i>Reyes</i>' pronouncement on the jurisdictional divide between the HRET and the Comelec, a matter more extensively discussed below.<br><br><b>IV.C.l.b. SPC No. 13-010 (<i>Rep. Lord Allan Jay Q. Velasco vs. New Members/Old Members of the Provincial Board of Canvassers [PBOCJ of the Lone District of Marinduque and Regina Ongsiako-Reyes</i>)</b><br><br><u><b>SPC No. 13-010</b></u> was the petition that Velasco filed before the Comelec on May 20, 2013, to declare respondent Reyes' May 18, 2013 proclamation void.<br><br><b>The Comelec dismissed SPC No. 13-010 on June 19, 2013.</b><br><br>On July 9, 2013, however, the Comelec issued a resolution reversing its June 19, 2013 resolution; this reversal declared void and without legal effect respondent Reyes' proclamation.<br><br>In between these dates - <i>i.e</i>., from May 20, 2013, when Velasco initiated SPC No. 13-010 before the Comelec, and the Comelec's July 9, 2013 resolution - respondent Reyes had already taken her oath (on June 7, 2013) and had assumed office on June 30, 2013. Significantly, as of June 30, 2013, when respondent Reyes assumed office, the challenge to respondent Reyes' proclamation <b>stood dismissed</b> by the Comelec and was entered in its records.<br><br>Thus,<b> as of June 30, 2013, respondent Reyes was the candidate the Comelec recognized as the duly proclaimed winner of the Marinduque congressional seat</b>. She was proclaimed pursuant to the electorate's mandate through the majority of the votes cast in Marinduque. More importantly, at the time Reyes assumed the office on June 30, 2013 - after she had been proclaimed and had taken her oath - there was no standing challenge against her proclamation.<br><br>Significantly, the records of <i>Reyes</i> show that soon after assumption to office on June 30, 2013, <u>she started discharging the functions of her office</u> by filing bills with the HOR.<br><br>These developments and dates are pointed out because of their critical significance. In resolving the present petition, the Court cannot simply undertake a mechanistic reading of the cited rulings and on this basis rely on the finality doctrine. The Court must appreciate that at the time respondent Reyes assumed office on June 30, 2013, the Comelec had cast aside the challenge to her proclamation and her oath was properly taken.<br><br>To be sure, the Comelec eventually declared respondent Reyes' proclamation void, but this reversal happened only on July 9, 2013, and only after Reyes had taken her oath and assumed office based on a standing proclamation. The proclamation, oath, and assumption <u><b>effectively altered the legal situation</b></u> as respondent Reyes - instead of being a mere candidate waiting for proclamation - had already become a Member of the HOR whose election, returns, and qualification are subject to the jurisdiction of the HRET.<br><br>This altered legal situation cannot but affect how the petition for <i>mandamus</i> should be resolved.<br><br><b>IV.C.l.c. The intervening factual<br>developments; <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i> versus the present petition</b><br><br>Another critical point the Court should not fail to consider in determining whether Velasco has a clear legal right to a writ of <i>mandamus</i> are the various factual developments that intervened (from the Comelec's rulings in SPA No. 13-053 and the Court's ruling in <i>Reyes v. Comelec,</i> to the filing of the present petition) that substantially and substantively differentiate the present <i>mandamus</i> case from <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i>.<br><br>These factual developments are:<br><br><i><b>First</b></i>, while respondent Reyes took her oath and assumed the office of Representative of Marinduque after the Comelec cancelled her CoC in SPA No. 13-053, she did not simply accept the cancellation and forthwith proceeded to question it before this Court through a petition for <i>certiorari</i> entitled <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i>. This petition was still pending at the time respondent Reyes took her oath and assumed office (on June 30, 2013); by then the case was pending based on the motion for reconsideration that respondent Reyes filed against the Court's June 25, 2013 Resolution. <b>As a result, Reyes had already assumed office even before <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i> became final and executory.</b><br><br>It must be noted, too, that respondent Reyes' oath and assumption to office also occurred before the Comelec (in SPC No. 13-010 filed by Velasco) declared void respondent Reyes' proclamation as Marinduque Representative. The Comelec ruling only came on July 9, 2013. As discussed above, respondent Reyes took her oath and assumed office (on June 30, 2013) when the <u><b>standing Comelec ruling</b></u> in SPC No. 13-010 (to cancel respondent Reyes' proclamation) was the June 19, 2013 dismissal of the Velasco petition.<br><br>Thus, as of June 30, 2013, Reyes had taken her oath and had assumed office based on a subsisting proclamation. The Comelec declared her proclamation void only on July 9, 2013; prior to this declaration, there was no pending legal challenge that could have impeded her oath and assumption of office.<br><br><i><b>Second</b></i>, the Comelec granted Tan's motion for execution, in SPA No. 13-053, and directed the proclamation of Velasco as the duly elected Representative of Marinduque, only on <u><b>July 10, 2013</b></u>. Velasco was proclaimed by the new PBOC much later — on <u><b>July 16, 2013.</b></u><br><br>These dates are stressed because when the Comelec took actions to enforce SPA No. 13-053 and to proclaim Velasco as the duly elected Representative of Marinduque, Reyes was already a member of the HOR -she had by then been proclaimed, taken her oath, and assumed office.<br><br>Significantly, <b>these developments were not considered in <i>Reyes v.

"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>I highlight, too, that in <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i>, the majority declared that a winning candidate becomes subject to the jurisdiction of the HRET only after he or she <b>becomes a member of the HOR</b>. The majority stressed that a candidate becomes a member of the HOR only after he or she has been <b>proclaimed, taken his or her oath, and assumed the office.</b><br><br>In other words, the majority in<i> Reyes v. Comelec </i>required the concurrence of all three events - proclamation, oath, and assumption to office - to trigger the jurisdiction of the HRET over election contests relating to the winning candidate's election, returns, and qualifications.<b> All three events duly took place in the case of respondent Reyes</b>, such that the HRET at this point should have jurisdiction over questions relating to respondent Reyes' election, even on the basis of the majority's <i><b>own</b></i> standards.<br><br>(Note in this regard that in my Dissent in <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i>, I considered this majority action a "major <b>retrogressive</b> jurisprudent development that can emasculate the HRET."<br><br>I still maintain that the proclamation of the winning candidate - the last operative act in the election process that is subject to Comelec jurisdiction - triggers and opens the way for the HRET's own jurisdiction.<br><br>This was the position I took, backed up by jurisprudence,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> in my <i>Dissent in Reyes v.

I said;<br><br><blockquote><i>[T]he proclamation of the winning candidate is the operative fact that triggers the jurisdiction of the HRET over election contests relating to the winning candidate's election, returns and qualifications x x x the proclamation of the winning candidate divests the Comelec of its jurisdiction over matters pending before it at the time of the proclamation and the party questioning the qualifications of the winning candidate should now present his or her case in a proper proceeding (i.e., quo warranto) before the HRET, who, by constitutional mandate, has the sole jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving the election, returns and qualifications of members of the [HOR]</i>).</blockquote><br>Thus, even by the Court majority's own standard<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> as defined in <i>Reyes v. Comelec,</i> respondent Reyes became a member of the HOR as of June 30, 2013. To reiterate, respondent Reyes was proclaimed on May 16, 2013. She then took her oath on June 7, 2013, and assumed office on June 30, 2013, pursuant to a subsisting proclamation. The Comelec ruling that declared respondent Reyes' proclamation void came only after she had already fully complied with <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i>'s defined standard.<br><br>In these lights, the Comelec had already been divested of jurisdiction over any issue that may have affected respondent Reyes' proclamation (including all consequent legal effects her proclamation carries) at the time the Comelec declared her proclamation void on July 9, 2013. As well, the Comelec was already without jurisdiction when it granted Tan's motion for execution on July 10, 2013, and proclaimed Velasco (through the new PBOC) as the duly elected Marinduque Representative on July 16, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Under Section 2(2), Article IX-C of the Constitution, the Comelec has the <i>"exclusive jurisdiction over all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of all <u><b>elective resional, provincial, and city officials</b></u> x x x.</i>" In other words, the Constitution vests the Comelec this exclusive jurisdiction only with respect to <i>elective regional, provincial, and city officials</i>. <b>The Comelec, by express constitutional mandate, has no jurisdiction over the election, returns, and qualifications of members of the HOR (or of the Senate) as Article VI vests this jurisdiction with the HRET (or the SET).</b><br><br>The validity of the proclamation of respondent Reyes who became a member of the HOR on June 30, 2013, and the right of either respondent Reyes or Velasco to hold the contested congressional seat are <b>election contests</b> relating to a Member's election, returns, and qualifications. By <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i>'s, own defined standard, the jurisdiction over these election contests affecting respondent Reyes already rested with the HRET beginning June 30, 2013.<br><br>To be sure, the validity of this Comelec resolution in SPC No. 13-010 was never challenged before this Court such that the ruling lapsed to finality. Under existing legal principles, the Court cannot pass upon the validity of this Comelec ruling without violating the doctrine of finality of judgments and the principle of separation of powers with the principle of judicial non­interference that it carries.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Court also cannot and should not simply rely on this Comelec ruling to grant Velasco's present <i>mandamus</i> petition and compel the HOR to admit him as its member. The fact that these Comelec rulings and actions all occurred after Reyes had fully complied with the restrictive <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i> standard creates substantial doubt on their validity and efficacy. In view of these substantial doubts, the Court should consider them with utmost caution.<br><br>In this respect, I submit that any legal significance the Court may accord to the Comelec's ruling in SPC No. 13-010 (as well as its July 10, 2013 execution order) in considering Velasco's present move to compel, <i>via mandamus,</i> the HOR to admit him as its member must be limited to:<br><br><u><i>one</i></u>, the fact of their issuance;<br><br><u><i>two,</i></u> the fact that the Comelec declared void Reyes' proclamation on July 9, 2013; and<br><br><u><i>three</i></u>, the fact that Velasco was proclaimed on July 16, 2013,<br><br>without prejudice to whatever ruling that the HRET and this Court may render in the future on the validity or invalidity of the Comelec rulings that were made after HOR jurisdiction had vested.<br><br>Any other legal significance which these rulings may have on the right of either Reyes or Velasco to the congressional seat must now be left to the judgment and discretion of the HRET which must appreciate them in a properly filed action.<br><br>Additionally and finally on this point, the HRET now has jurisdiction to rule upon <b>all questions</b> relating to respondent Reyes' election, returns, and qualifications that may still be fit and proper for its resolution in accordance with existing laws and its own rules of procedure. This Court itself cannot assume jurisdiction over any aspect of HRET jurisdiction unless it relates to a matter filed or pending with us on a properly filed petition, taking into account the clear conferment and delineation of the Court's jurisdiction and those of the HRET under the Constitution.<br><br><b>In sum</b>, the Comelec's rulings in SPA No. 13-053 and SPC No. 13-010, and the Court's rulings in <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i> did not establish a clear and unmistakable right in Velasco's favor to the position of the Representative of Marinduque.<br><br>At most, Velasco's right to hold the congressional seat based on these rulings is substantially doubtful. Unless this substantial doubt is settled, Velasco cannot claim as of right any entitlement, and cannot also compel the respondents to admit him, to HOR membership through the Court's issuance of a writ of <i>mandamus.</i><br><br>In the absence of any other clear and unmistakable legal source for his claimed right to the contested congressional seat, Velasco's petition must necessarily fail.<br><br><b>IV.C.l.e. Reyes' holding of the office could not have worked injustice and seriously prejudiced Velasco with her receipt of the salaries, allowances, bonuses, and emoluments that pertain to the office.</b><br><br>Finally, I find tenuous Velasco's claim that Reyes' continued holding of the contested Congressional seat has "<i>worked injustice and serious prejudice to [him] in that she has already received the salaries, allowances, bonuses and emoluments that pertain to the [office] since June 30, 2013 up to the present xxx."</i><br><br>This argument clearly forgets that public office is a public trust.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Public service and public duty are and must be the primary and utmost consideration in entering the public service. Any remuneration, salaries, and benefits that a public officer or employee receives in return must be a consideration merely secondary to public service.<br><br>Accordingly, any salary, allowance, bonus, and emoluments pertaining to an office must be received by one who is not only qualified for the office, but by one whose right to the office is clearly and unmistakably without doubt and beyond dispute. In the case of an elective public office, this right is, at the very least, established by the mandate of the majority of the electorate. More importantly, of course, the right to receive the salaries, allowances, bonuses, and emoluments that pertain to an office must be received by one who actually perform the duties called for by the office.<br><br>Here, Velasco may be qualified for the office. His right to hold the congressional seat, however, is at most substantially doubtful or in substantial dispute; worse, he has not performed the duties of the office. In short, Reyes' receipt of the salaries, etc. that pertain to the congressional seat obviously could not have worked injustice to and seriously prejudiced him.<br><br><i><b>IV. C.2. Clear, established, and specific legal duty and unlawful neglect in the performance of ministerial acts</b></i><br><br>For the same factual and legal reasons discussed above, I submit that Velasco likewise failed to show that Speaker Belmonte and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap have the clear and specific duty, founded in law, to administer the required oath, to allow Velasco to assume the duties of the office, and to register his name in the Roll of Members as the duly elected Representative of Marinduque. He also failed to show that the respondents unlawfully refused or neglected to admit him as member.<br><br>At the very least, he failed to show that the respondents have the clear and specific legal duty to allow a second-placer candidate like him whose right to the contested congressional seat is substantially doubtful, to assume the office until such time that all doubts are resolved in his favor.<br><br>Thus, in the absence of any law specifically requiring Speaker Belmonte and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap to act, and to act in a particularly clear manner, the Court cannot compel these respondents to undertake the action that Velasco prays for via a writ of <i>mandamus</i>.<br><br>Additionally, the HOR in this case simply acted pursuant to law and jurisprudence when it admitted respondent Reyes as the duly elected Representative of Marinduque. After this admission, the HOR and its officers cannot be compelled to remove her without an order from the tribunal having the exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all contests affecting HOR members, of which Reyes has become one. This tribunal, of course, is the HOR's own HRET.<br><br><i><b>IV.C.3. Absence of any other plain, speedy and adequate remedy</b></i><br><br>Lastly, I submit that Velasco failed to show that there is <b>no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy</b> available in the ordinary course of law to secure to him the congressional seat.<br><br>I reiterate and emphasize once more that respondent Reyes became a Member of the HOR on June 30, 2013, after her proclamation, oath, and assumption to office. Whether the Court views these circumstances under the restrictive standard of <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i> to be the legally correct standard or simply the applicable one<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> under the circumstances of the petition, respondent Reyes undoubtedly has complied with the conditions for HOR membership that <i>Reyes v. Cdmelec</i> laid down.<br><br>Since Reyes is a member of the HOR, any challenge against her right to hold the congressional seat or which may have the effect of removing her from the office - whether pertaining to her election, returns or qualifications - now rests with the HRET. i<br><br>Viewed by itself and in relation to the surrounding cited cases and circumstances, Velasco's present petition cannot but be a challenge against respondent Reyes' election, returns, and qualifications, hiding behind the cloak of a petition for <i>mandamus</i>. In other words, although presented as a petition that simply seeks to enforce a final Court ruling, the petition is an original one that ultimately Seeks to oust Reyes from the congressional seat. The relationships between arid among the cited cases and the present case, read in relation with the relevant developments, all point to this conclusion.<br><br>Thus, rather than recognize this roundabout manner of contesting respondent Reyes' seat, the Court should recognize this kind of challenge for what it really is - a challenge that properly belongs to the domain of the HRET and one that should b| e raised before that tribunal through the proper action. The Court, in other words, should acknowledge that it has no jurisdiction to act on the present petition.<br><br>Under the 2011 Rules of the HRET,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> the proper actions in coming before the HRET are: (1) a Verified petition of protest (election protest) to contest the election or returns of the member; or (2) a verified petition for<i> quo warranto</i> to contest tjie election of a member on the ground of ineligibility or disloyalty to the Republic of the Philippines.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Both petitions should be filed within fifteen (15) days after-the proclamation of the winner,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> save in the case of a petition for <i>quo warranto</i> on the ground of citizenship which may be filed at any time during the member's tenure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The failure to file the appropriate petition before the HRET within the prescribed periods will bar the contest.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> These are the rules that must guide Velasco in his quest for a remedy.<br><br>To be sure, though, this remedy has been within Velasco's knowledge and contemplation as on May 31, 2013,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> he filed an <u><b>election protest</b></u> before the HRET, docketed as HRET Case No. 13-028.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Very obviously, he recognized that, as early as May 31, 2013, any challenge against respondent Reyes's election, returns, or qualifications should be raised before the HRET - the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of HOR members.<br><br>Why he now appears to have glossed over this legal reality in the present petition (especially since Reyes is now a clearly recognized member of the HOR after satisfying the restrictive <i>Reyes v. Comelec</i> standard) is a question I would not dare speculate on; only the attendant facts and the legal realities can perhaps sufficiently provide the answer.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>In reality, two other cases - both of them <i>quo warranto</i> petitions -were subsequently filed against Reyes. The first is HRET Case No. 13-036 entitled "<i>Noeme Mayores Tan and Jeasseca L. Mapacpac v. Regina Ongsiako Reyes."</i> The second is HRET No. 13-037 entitled "<i>Eric Del Mundo v. Regina Ongsiako Reyes."</i><br><br>On March 14, 2014, the HRET issued a resolution in HRET Case No. 13-036 and HRET No. 13-037 stating that <u><i>"the proclamation of Representative Reyes as the winning candidate for the position of Representative of the Lone District ofMarinduque is and remains valid and subsisting until annulled by HRET."</i></u><br><br><b>In a modified <i>ponencia</i> circulated on January 11, 2016 (for deliberation on January 12, 2016), <i>it was alleged</i> that the HRET promulgated a Resolution on December 14, 2015, dismissing HRET Case Nos. 13-036 and 13-037 - the twin petitions for <i>quo warranto</i> filed against Reyes.</b><br><br><i>Allegedly</i>, the HRET held that <i>"the final Supreme Court ruling in G.R. No. 207264 is the COGENT REASON to set aside the September 11, 2014 Resolution</i>." The HRET ruling allegedly reversed its own ruling of September 11, 2014 that ordered the dismissal of the petition of Victor Vela Sioco in the twin petitions for <i>quo warranto</i> for "lack of merit," and for the hearings in the petitions against Reyes to proceed.<br><br>Under these attendant facts, the circumstances surrounding the Reyes-Velasco dispute becomes more confused and all the more should this Court refrain from acting on the present petition.<br><br>If indeed there is already a HRET ruling as alleged, then the proper remedy now is for the HRET to present this ruling, certified as a final and executory one, to the HOR for that body's action in light of its own Tribunal's decision.<br><br>To state the obvious, the admission of a member and his or her exclusion is primarily an internal affair that the HOR should first resolve before this Court should step in through the coercive power of a writ of mandamus. The principles of separation of powers and judicial non­interference demand that the Court respect and give due recognition to the HOR in its internal affairs.<br><br>By granting the petition and issuing a writ of mandamus, the Court, not only disrespects the HOR, but sows confusion as well into the HRET's jurisdiction - a jurisprudential minefield in the coming elections.<br><br><b>IV.D. The Separation of Powers<br><br>Principle Demands the Dismissal of the Present Petition.<br><br><i>IV.D.l. The principle of separation of powers</i>.</b><br><br>An issue that the Court cannot but recognize in the present case is whether it can, under the circumstances of this case, compel a House of Congress - a co-equal branch - to act. The resolution of this issue calls for the consideration of several principles, foremost of which is the principle of separation of powers that underlie our governmental structure.<br><br>The Constitution does not specifically provide for the principle of separation of powers. Instead of a distinct express provision, the Constitution divides the governmental powers among the three branches -the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary. Under this framework, the Constitution confers on the Legislature the duty to make the law, on the Executive the duty to execute the law, and on the Judiciary the duty to construe and apply the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Underlying the principle of separation of powers is the general scheme that each department is supreme within their respective spheres of influence, and the exercise of their powers to the full extent cannot be questioned by another department. Outside of these spheres, neither of the great governmental departments has any power; and neither may any of them validly exercise any of the powers conferred upon the others.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Thus, as a fundamental principle, the separation of powers provides that each of the three departments of our government is distinct and not directly subject to the control of another department. The power to control is the power to abrogate; and the power to abrogate is the power to usurp.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[32]</sup></font> In short, for one branch to control the other is to usurp its power. In this situation, the exercise of control by one department over another would clearly violate the principle of separation of powers.<br><br>In this light, the question that we ask next is: whether the Court can compel Speaker Belmonte and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap - who are admittedly officers of the HOR - to perform the acts specifically prayed for by Velasco <i>via mandamus.</i> To properly answer this question, we must hark back to our earlier discussion of <i>mandamus</i>, and consider it in the context of the principle of separation of powers.<br><br><i><b>IV.D.2. Mandamus against a co-equal branch</b></i><br><br>Over and above the usual requirements of <i>mandamus</i> earlier discussed, it must be appreciated that the remedy of <i>mandamus</i> is essentially a discretionary remedy that is contingent upon compelling equitable grounds for its grant. As a peremptory writ, a presumption exists strongly against its grant; it will and must issue only in the most extraordinary of circumstances and always with great caution.<br><br>In the context of the separation of powers principle, I submit that the Court must proceed with greater caution before issuing the writ against a co­equal branch, notwithstanding the concurrence of the requirements.<br><br><b>As a general rule, <i>mandamus</i> will not lie against a coordinate branch.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The rule proceeds from the obvious reason that none of the three departments is inferior to the others; by its very nature, <u>the writ of <i>mandamus</i> is available against an <b>inferior</b> court, tribunal, body, corporation, or person.</u> With respect to a coordinate and co-equal branch, the issuance can be justified only under the Court's expanded jurisdiction under Article VIII Section 1 of the Constitution<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[34]</sup></font> and under the <i><b>most compelling circumstances</b></i> and <i><b>equitable reasons</b></i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>I submit that no grave abuse of discretion intervened in the present case to justify resort to the Court's expanded jurisdiction. Neither are there compelling and equitable reasons to justify a grant as <i><b>there is a remedy in law that was available to petitioner Velasco</b></i> (for reasons of his own, he has failed to pursue the remedy before the HRET to its full fruition) and <i><b>that is available now</b></i> - to present the final rulings in the cited HRET cases to the HOR for its own action on an internal matter it zealously guards.<br><br>The Comelec petition to contest respondent Reyes' proclamation was filed by Velasco, but this was a case solely addressing respondent Reyes' proclamation and voiding it. Beyond this, the ruling made no other directive. But even given all these, there is indisputably the live question of whether the Comelec still had jurisdiction when it issued its rulings as Reyes had by then become a member of the HOR. At the very least, this complication leaves the continued validity of the Comelec ruling in doubt.<br><br>Another point to consider is the filing and withdrawal by Velasco of an election protest case with the HRET against respondent Reyes. By doing this and despite the withdrawal of his petition, Velasco recognized the jurisdiction of the HRET. Can he now turn around and simply say that the Comelec and the Court are, after all, correct in its rulings and that he would now avail of these rulings although he was never a party to them? I provide no answers but again this development effectively brings the propriety of Velasco's use of <i>mandamus</i> within the realm of doubt.<br><br>A further point to consider is that Speaker Belmonte and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap are officers of the HOR chosen by its members.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> As HOR officers, their acts made in the performance of their duties and functions are acts of the HOR. The acts Velasco wants this Court to compel Speaker Belmonte and Sec. Gen. Barua-Yap to perform pertain to their official positions. Hence, any <i>mandamus</i> that will be issued against them is a <i>mandamus</i> issued against the HOR. As I have stated before, <i>mandamus</i> does not and will not lie against a coordinate branch.<br><br>Notably, under the attendant facts, significantly altered by the intervening factual developments and the consequent legal considerations, the acts sought to be performed - the exclusion of sitting members and the admission of replacement members - are not ministerial acts for which mandamus will lie. That much is implied, if not directly held, as early as <i>Angara v. Electoral Commission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and many other cases relating to this situation followed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Their common thread is that <b><i>Congress takes the admission (or exclusion) of its members as a very serious concern that is reserved for itself to decide, save only when a superior law or ruling with undoubted validity intervenes</i></b>. Such freedom from doubt, however, is not apparent in the present petition.<br><br>Appeal to "<i><b>compelling and equitable circumstances</b></i>" that call for the application of the equitable remedy of <i>mandamus</i> is, at best, a murky proposition in light of the circumstances surrounding the May 2013 Marinduque election situation as a whole.<br><br>It should not be forgotten that Reyes won by a convincing margin over Velasco, but the latter chose to fight his electoral battle in the Comelec, bypassing thereby the verdict against him of the people of Marinduque. The merits of the Comelec ruling is likewise not beyond doubt from the point of view of the imputed due process violations, as the Dissent in Reyes and the close vote in Court showed.<br><br>In any case, mandamus is, by its nature, a discretionary remedy that can be denied when no compelling equitable grounds exist. In particular, in situations where the constitutional separation-of-powers principle is involved, <i>mandamus</i>, as a rule, will not lie against a co-equal branch notwithstanding the petitioner's compliance with the requirements necessary for its grant, as discussed above. To justify the issuance of the writ, the petitioner must not only comply with the requirements; the petitioner must, more importantly, show that <i>mandamus</i> is <i><b>demanded by the most compelling reasons or circumstances and by the demands of equity.</b></i> These exception-inducing factors, as discussed above, are simply not present in this case.<br><br>Thus, the Court cannot dictate action under the present petition without committing gross usurpation of power. The risk for the Court in ruling under these circumstances is to be accused of ruling under a situation of doubt and uncertainty in favor of the son of a colleague. In a worse scenario, Congress - even if it does not frontally rebuff the Court - may raise issues that would effectively disregard the writ issued by the Court. While no constitutional crisis may result, the Court would have tested the limits of its constitutional powers and failed. The situation does not bode well for the Court's integrity, reputation, and credibility — the essential attributes that allow it to occupy the moral high ground in undertaking its functions within the Constitution's tripartite system.<br><br><b>The better view, under the circumstances and as posited above, is to allow internal matters within the HOR to take their natural course. This position best addresses the confused situation that is the Marinduque May 2013 elections, while respecting the interests of all concerned parties, including those of the Court's.</b><br><br><center><b>V. <u>CONCLUSION</u></b></center><br>In sum, the present petition for <i>mandamus</i> must be dismissed as petitioner Velasco failed to comply with all five requirements for the issuance of the writ of <i>mandamus</i>. Most importantly, the petitioner's speedy remedy to address his situation lies with the HRET and the HOR, not with the Court. In any case, the remedy of <i>mandamus</i> does not lie against the HOR, a co-equal branch, <i>under the circumstances of the case</i> and would be an unwarranted intrusion and impermissible usurpation by this Court of the authority and functions of the HOR and of the HRET.<br><br>For these reasons, I vote to dismiss the petition.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 3-26.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Petitioner Velasco is the son of incumbent Supreme Court Justice Presbiterio J.

Pertinent are the following discussions:<br><blockquote><i>The ponencia 's holding on the <br>COMELEC's jurisdiction vis-a-vis<br>the HRET is inconsistent with the<br>HRET Rules</i><br><br>The view that the proclamation of the winning candidate is the operative fact that triggers the jurisdiction of the HRET is also supported by the HRET Rules. They state:<br><blockquote>RULE 14. <i>Jurisdiction.</i> - The Tribunal is the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of the Members of the House of Representatives.<br><br>RULE 15. <i>How Initiated.</i> — An election contest is initiated by the filing of a verified petition of protest or a verified petition for <i>quo warranto</i> against a Member of the House of Representatives. An election protest shall not include a petition for <i>quo warranto.</i> Neither shall a petition for <i>quo warranto</i> include an election protest.<br><br>RULE 16. <i>Election Protest.</i> - A verified petition contesting the election or returns of any Member of the House of Representatives shall be filed by any candidate who has duly filed a certificate of candidacy and has been voted for the same office, within fifteen (15) days after the proclamation of the winner. The party filing the protest shall be designated as the protestant while the adverse party shall be known as the protestee. x x x<br><br>RULE 17. <i>Quo Warranto</i>. - A verified petition for quo warranto contesting the election of a Member of the House of Representatives on the ground of ineligibility or of disloyalty to the Republic of the Philippines shall be filed by any registered voter of the district concerned within fifteen (15) days from the date of the proclamation of the winner. The party filing the petition shall be designated as the petitioner while the adverse party shall be known as the respondent[.]</blockquote>Based on the above Rules, it appears clear that as far as the HRET is concerned, the proclamation of the winner in the congressional elections serves as the reckoning point as well as the trigger that brings any contests relating to his or her election, return and qualifications within its sole and exclusive jurisdiction.<br><br>In the context of the present case, by holding that the COMELEC retained jurisdiction (because Reyes, although a proclaimed winner, has not yet assumed office), the majority effectively emasculates the HRET of its jurisdiction as it allows the filing of an election protest or a petition for <i>quo warranto</i> only after the assumption to office by the candidate (<i>i.e.,</i> on June 30 in the usual case). To illustrate using the dates of the present case, any election protest or a petition for <i>quo warranto </i>filed after June 30 or more than fifteen (15) days from Reyes' proclamation on May 18, 2013, shall certainly be dismissed outright by the HRET for having been filed out of time under the HRET rules.</blockquote><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> See Article XI, Section 1 of the Constitution.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> As I discussed in my Dissenting Opinion to the June 25, 2013 Resolution in <i>Reyes v.

Nevertheless, she would only assail the ruling <i>via</i> petition for certiorari with the Court on June 7, 2013. Needless to say, no injunctive writ was issued by the Court in the interim. There was, effectively, no restraint against the enforcement of Reyes' disqualification, a legal bar to a valid proclamation.

Petitioner lost in the COMELEC as respondent. Her certificate of candidacy has been ordered cancelled. She could not be proclaimed because there was a final finding against her by the COMELEC. She needed a restraining order from the Supreme Court to avoid the final finding. After the five days when the decision adverse to her became executory, the need for Supreme Court intervention became even more imperative. She would have to base her recourse on the position that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in cancelling her certificate of candidacy and that a restraining order, which would allow her proclamation, will have to be based on irreparable injury and demonstrated possibility of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COMELEC. In this case, before and after the 18 May 2013 proclamation, there was not even an attempt at the legal remedy, clearly available to her, to permit her proclamation. What petitioner did was to "take the law into her hands" and secure a proclamation in complete disregard of the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> decision that was final on 14 May 2013 'and final and executory five days thereafter.<br></blockquote><br>SPA No. 13-053 eventually made its way to this Court (the Reyes case), docketed as G.R.

This finds basis in the seminal case of <i>Aratea v.

There was only one qualified candidate for Mayor in the May 2010 elections - Antipolo, who therefore received the highest number of votes.</blockquote><br>Thus, notwithstanding the margin of votes Reyes garnered over Velasco, the votes cast in her favor are considered strays since she is not eligible for the congressional post, a non-candidate in the bid for the coveted seat of Representative for the Lone District of Marinduque. Following the doctrinal teaching in <i>Aratea</i>, Velasco, as the only remaining qualified candidate in the congressional race, is, for all intents and purposes, the rightful member of the lower house.<br><br>Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen (Justice Leonen), however, echoing the position of the OSG and that of the respondents, asserts in his Dissent that Velasco is a second-placer during the elections who is not entitled to hold the subject position. The honorable Justice suggests that petitioner cannot seek refuge under the Court's pronouncements in <i>Aratea</i> and the subsequent cases of <i>Jalosjos v.

In all these cases, and as it should likewise be in this case, the Court ruled that the CoC was deemed void<i> ab initio</i> and as such:<br><br><blockquote>"If the certificate of candidacy is void ab initio, then legally the person who filed such void certificate of candidacy was never a candidate in the elections at any time. All votes for such non-candidate are stray votes and should not be counted. Thus, such non-candidate can never be a first-placer in the elections. If a certificate of candidacy void ab initio is cancelled on the day, or before the day, of the election, prevailing jurisprudence holds that all votes for that candidate are stray votes. If a certificate of candidacy void ab initio is cancelled one day or more after the elections, all votes for such candidate should also be stray votes because the certificate of candidacy is void from the very beginning, x x x"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Maquiling,</i> this Court also said:<br><br><blockquote>Thus, the votes cast in favor of the ineligible candidate are not considered at all in determining the winner of an election.<br><br>Even when the votes for the ineligible candidate are disregarded, the will of the electorate is still respected, and even more so. The votes cast in favor of an ineligible candidate do not constitute the sole and total expression of the sovereign voice. The votes cast in favor of eligible and legitimate candidates form part of that voice and must also be respected.<br><br>As in any contest, elections are governed by rules that determine the qualifications and disqualifications of those who are allowed to participate as players. When there are participants who turn out to be ineligible, their victory is voided and the laurel is awarded to the next in rank who does not possess any of the disqualifications nor lacks any of the qualifications set in the rules to be eligible as candidates.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br>The electorate's awareness of the candidate's disqualification is not a prerequisite for the disqualification to attach to the candidate. The very existence of a disqualifying circumstance makes the candidate ineligible. Knowledge by the electorate of a candidate's disqualification is not necessary before a qualified candidate who placed second to a disqualified one can be proclaimed as the winner. The second-placer in the vote count is actually the first-placer among the qualified candidates.<br><br>That the disqualified candidate has already been proclaimed and has assumed office is of no moment. The subsequent disqualification based on a substantive ground that existed prior to the filing of the certificate of candidacy voids not only the COC but also the proclamation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>Velasco v. COMELEC, </i>this Court further expounded:<br><br><blockquote>x x x. Section 78 may likewise be emasculated as mere delay in the resolution of the petition to cancel or deny due course to a COC can render a Section 78 petition useless if a candidate with false COC data wins. To state the obvious, candidates may risk falsifying their COC qualifications if they know that an election victory will cure any defect that their COCs may have. Election victory then becomes a magic formula to bypass election eligibility requirements.<br><br>In the process, the rule of law suffers; the clear and unequivocal legal command, framed by a Congress representing the national will, is rendered inutile because the people of a given locality has decided to vote a candidate into office despite his or her lack of the qualifications Congress has determined to be necessary.<br><br>In the present case, Velasco is not only going around the law by his claim that he is registered voter when he! is not, as has been determined by a court in a final judgment. Equally important is that he has made a material misrepresentation <i>under oath in his COC</i> regarding his qualification. For these violations, he must pay the ultimate price - the nullification of his election victory. He may also have to account in a criminal court for making a false statement under oath, but this is a matter for the proper authorities to decide upon.<br><br>We distinguish our ruling in this case from others that we have made in the past by the clarification that COC defects <i>beyond matters of form</i> and that involve <i>material misrepresentations</i> cannot avail of the benefit of our ruling that COC mandatory requirements before elections are considered merely directory after the people shall have spoken. A mandatory and material election law requirement involves more than the will of the people in any given locality. Where a <i>material COC misrepresentation under oath</i> is made, thereby violating both our election and criminal laws, we are faced as well with an assault on the will of the people of the Philippines as expressed in our laws. In a choice between provisions on material qualifications of elected officials, on the one hand, and the will of the electorate in any given locality, on the other, we believe and so hold that we cannot choose the electorate will. The balance must always tilt in favor of upholding and enforcing the law. To rule otherwise is to slowly gnaw at the rule of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote><br>Therefore, considering that Reyes' CoC was cancelled and was deemed <i>void ab initio</i> by virtue of the final and executory decisions rendered by the COMELEC and this Court, Velasco is a not second-placer as claimed by the Dissent; rather, Velasco is the <b>only placer and the winner</b> during the May elections and thus, for all intents and purposes, Velasco has a clear legal right to office as Representative of the Lone District of Marinduque.<br><br>Unconvinced, Justice Leonen would protest in his Dissent that petitioner Velasco, a non-party to SPC No. 13-053 and G.R. No. 207264, is a stranger to the case and cannot be bound by Our factual findings and rulings therein.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The proposition is devoid of merit.<br><br>Sec. 1, Rule 23 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, as amended, pertinently reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 1. Ground for Denial or Cancellation of Certificate of Candidacy</b>. —<br>A verified Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel a Certificate of Candidacy for any elective office <b>may be filed by any registered voter</b> or a duly registered political party, organization, or coalition of political parties on the exclusive ground that any material representation contained therein as required by law is false, xxx (emphasis added)</blockquote><br>By lodging a petition for denial or cancellation of CoC, a voter seeks to ensure that the candidate who purports to be qualified to represent his or her constituents is indeed eligible to do so. Such petition, therefore, is for and in benefit of the electorate, and not for one's personal advantage. This is in clear consonance with the afore-quoted rule, which never required the petition to be filed by a candidate's political rival. Otherwise stated, it is not required for petitioner Tan in SPA No. 13-053 to have a claim to the contested electoral post to be permitted by law to challenge the validity of Reyes' CoC. At the same time, petitioner Velasco herein is not under any legal obligation to intervene in SPA No. 13-053 and G.R. No. 207264 before he could benefit directly or indirectly from the ruling. Unlike civil cases which only involve private rights, petitions to deny or cancel certificates of candidacy are so imbued with public interest that they cannot be deemed binding only to the parties thereto. Indeed, it would be an absurd situation, after all, to declare Reyes ineligible only insofar as Tan is concerned, and presumed eligible as to the rest of the Marinduquenos, including Velasco.<br><br>Furthermore, for a petition for <i>mandamus</i> to prosper, Sec. 3, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 3</b>. <i>Petition for mandamus.</i> — When any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered commanding the respondent, immediately or at some other time to be specified by the court, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights of the petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner by reason of the wrongful acts of the respondent.<br></blockquote><br>Apparently, there is nothing in foregoing provision which requires that the person applying for a writ of <i>mandamus</i> should establish that he or she was the prevailing party litigant to a prior case (<i>i.e</i>. a petitioner, respondent or an intervenor) to be entitled to the writ's issuance. Contrary to the opinion espoused in the Dissent, Sec. 3, Rule 65 merely requires the applicant to establish a clear legal right to the ministerial function to be performed, without distinction on whether this right emanates from a final judgment in a prior case or not. Thus, there is no basis to the opinion that Velasco should have been a party in <i>Reyes</i> in order for this Court to grant a of writ of mandamus in his favor.<br><br>b. <i>Respondent Belmonte and Barua-Yap 'sministerial duties</i><br><br>Anent the second element for <i>mandamus </i>to lie, it is critical that the duty the performance of which is to be compelled be ministerial in nature, rather than discretionary. A purely ministerial act or duty is one that an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of its own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The writ neither confers powers nor imposes duties.

It must be borne in mind that this petition was brought to fore because, despite repeated demands from petitioner and their receipt of the "<i>Certificate of Canvass of Votes and Proclamation of Winning Candidate for the position of Member of House of Representatives for the Lone District of Marinduque,</i>" respondents Belmonte and Barua-Yap refused to allow Velasco to sit in the Lower House as Marinduque Representative<br><br>The non-discretionary function of respondents Belmonte and Barua-Yap is underscored in <i>Codilla, Sr. v. De Venecia (Codilla)</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> wherein the Court held that the House Speaker and the Secretary General of the Lower House are duty-bound to recognize the legally elected district representatives as members of the House of Representatives. In the concluding statements of <i>Codilla</i>, the Court, speaking through retired Chief Justice Reynato Puno, instructs that:<br><br><blockquote>In the case at bar, the administration of oath and the registration of the petitioner in the Roll of Members of the House of Representatives representing the 4th legislative district of Leyte is no longer a matter of discretion on the part of the public respondents. The facts are settled and beyond dispute: petitioner garnered 71,350 votes as against respondent Locsin who only got 53, 447 votes in the May 14, 2001 elections. The COMELEC Second Division initially ordered the proclamation of respondent Locsin; on Motion for Reconsideration the COMELEC en banc set aside the order of its Second Division and ordered the proclamation of the petitioner. The Decision of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> has not been challenged before this Court by respondent Locsin and said Decision has become final and executory.<br><br>In sum, the issue of who is the rightful Representative of the 4th legislative district of Leyte has been finally settled by the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>, the constitutional body with jurisdiction on the matter. <b>The rule of law demands that its Decision be obeyed by all officials of the land.

No. 207624, and SPA No. 13-010. Reyes' ineligibility and Velasco's consequent membership in the Lower House is then beyond the discretion of respondents Belmonte and Barua-Yap, and the rulings upholding the same must therefore be recognized and respected. To hold otherwise - that the Court is not precluded from entertaining questions on Reyes' eligibility to occupy Marinduque's congressional seat - would mean substantially altering, if not effectively vacating, Our ruling in<i> Reyes</i> that has long attained finality, a blatant violation of the immutability of judgments. Under the doctrine, a decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable, and may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law, and whether it be made by the court that rendered it or by the Highest Court of the land. Any act which violates this principle must immediately be struck down.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Justice Leonen, however, urges this Court to revisit, nay re-litigate, <i>Reyes</i> two (2) years after the date of its finality and abandon the same, in clear contravention of the doctrine of immutability and finality of Supreme Court decisions.<br><br>It matters not that respondents Belmonte and Barua-Yap are non-parties to <i>Reyes.</i> It is erroneous to claim that Our final ruling therein is not binding against Belmonte and Barua-Yapon ground that that they were neither petitioners nor respondents in the said case,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and that they were not given the opportunity to be heard on the issues raised therein.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Again, SPA No. 13-053, G.R. No. 207264, and SPA No. 13-010 are not civil cases and do not involve purely private rights which requires notice and full participation of respondents Belmonte and Barua-Yap. It must also be noted that the said case originated as petition to deny or cancel Reyes' COC, which does not require the participation of the Speaker and Secretary General of the House of Representatives. In fact, there is nothing in BP 881, the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, nor in Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, which requires that the Speaker and Secretary General to be included either in the original petition for cancellation of CoC or when the case is elevated to this Court via petition for certiorari.

To reiterate the holding in<i> Codilla: "the issue of who is the rightful Representative xxx has been <b>finally settled</b> by the COMELEC en banc, the constitutional body with jurisdiction on the matter." </i>(Emphasis added) Hence, it became ministerial on the part of then House Speaker Jose de Venecia and then Secretary General Roberto P.

On the next day, he would lodge a separate petition challenging the validity of Locsin's proclamation anew. The petition, however, would suffer the same fate of being initially decided against his favor. It will not be until August 29, 2001 when the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>, by a 4-3 vote, would reverse the rulings that disqualified Codilla and upheld the validity of Locsin's proclamation. Notably, Locsin did not appeal from this Resolution annulling her proclamation and so the COMELEC <i>en banc's</i> ruling then became final and executory.<br><br>Thereafter, on September 6, 2001, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> reconstituted the PBOC of Leyte to implement its August 29, 2001 Resolution, and to proclaim the candidate who obtained the highest number of votes in the district as the duly elected Representative of the 4th Legislative District of Leyte.

Similarly, respondents raised the issue of jurisdiction arguing that the proclamation alone of the winning candidate is the operative act"that triggers the commencement of HRET's exclusive jurisdiction,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and insisted that to rule otherwise would result in the clash of jurisdiction between the HRET and the COMELEC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>On the outset, I express my strong reservations on revisiting herein the issue on the HRET's jurisdiction, which has already been settled with finality in <i>Reyes,</i> for<b> it is not at issue in this petition for <i>mandamus</i></b>. I SHARE THE OBSERVATION BY THE <i>PONENCIA</i> THAT RESPONDENTS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS PETITION TO RE-LITIGATE WHAT HAS BEEN SETTLED IN <i>REYES</i> AND DOES NOT SEEM TO RESPECT THE ENTRY OF JUDGMENT THAT HAS BEEN ISSUED THEREIN ON OCTOBER 22, 2013. Nevertheless, assuming <i>in arguendo</i> that there is no impropriety in taking a second look at the issue in this case, I see no irreconcilability between <i>Reyes</i>, on the one hand, and the cases cited in the Dissent, on the other.<br><br>As a review, the doctrine in <i>Reyes</i> is that the HRET only has jurisdiction over <b>Members</b> of the House of Representatives. To be considered a Member of the House of Representatives, the following requisites must concur: (1) a valid proclamation, (2) a proper oath, and (3) assumption of office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Our ruling in <i>Reyes</i> does not run in conflict with <i>Tañada</i>, which was decided by the Court <i>en banc</i> by a unanimous vote, as our esteemed colleague pointed out. As held in <i>Tañada</i>:<br><br><blockquote>In the foregoing light, considering that Angelina <b>had already been proclaimed</b> as Member of the House of Representatives for the 4th District of Quezon Province on May 16, 2013, <b>as she has in fact taken her oath</b> and <b>assumed office</b> past noon time of June 30, 2013, the Court is now without jurisdiction to resolve the case at bar. As they stand, the issues concerning the conduct of the canvass and the resulting proclamation of Angelina as herein discussed are matters which fall under the scope of the terms "election" and "returns" as above-stated and hence, properly fall under the HRET's sole jurisdiction. (Emphasis added)<br></blockquote><br>Hence, the Court's ruling in Tañada, disclaiming jurisdiction in favor of the HRET, is premised on the concurrence of the three (3) requirements laid down in <i>Reyes</i>. In any case, Tanada is a Minute Resolution not intended to amend or abandon <i>Reyes</i>, as was made evident by the subsequent case <i>Bandara v. COMELEC,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>It is a well-settled rule that once a winning candidate has been proclaimed, taken his oath, and assumed office as a Member of the House of representatives, the jurisdiction of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) over election contests relating to his/her election, returns, and qualification ends, and the HRET's own jurisdiction begins. Consequently, the instant petitions for certiorari are not the proper remedies for the petitioners in both cases to question the propriety of the National Board of Canvassers' proclamation, and the events leading thereto.</blockquote><br><i>Limkaichong </i>is even more blunt as the Court decided the case with the following opening statement:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Once a <b>winning candidate</b> has been <b>proclaimed, taken his oath</b>, and <b>assumed office</b> as a Member of the House of Representatives, the <b>jurisdiction of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal begins.</b>x x x .

(Emphasis added)<br></blockquote><br>Verily, <i>Reyes</i> delineated the blurred lines between the jurisdictions of the COMELEC and the HRET, explicitly ruling where one ends and the other begins. Our ruling therein was not wanting in jurisprudential basis and is in fact supported by cases cited by in the Dissent no less.<br><br>Certainly, the principle in Reyes does not offend Art. VI, Sec. 17 of the Constitution nor does it undermine the adjudicatory powers of the HRET. On the contrary, it strictly adheres to the textual tenor of the constitutional provision, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 17</b>. The Senate and the House of Representatives shall each have an Electoral Tribunal which shall be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications <b>of their respective Members</b>. Each Electoral Tribunal shall be composed of nine Members, three of whom shall be Justices of the Supreme Court to be designated by the Chief Justice, and the remaining six shall be Members of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, who shall be chosen on the basis of proportional representation from the political parties and the parties or organizations registered under the party-list system represented therein. The senior Justice in the Electoral Tribunal shall be its Chairman. (Emphasis added)<br></blockquote><br>It has to be emphasized that the Court, in deciding <i>Reyes</i>, did not divest the Senate and House of Representative Electoral Tribunals of their jurisdiction over their respective members, but merely set the parameters on who these "Members" are. The jurisprudence earlier reviewed are in unison in holding that to be considered a "Member" within the purview of the constitutional provision, the three indispensable elements must concur.<br><br>As to the alleged clash of jurisdiction, the Court, in its October 22, 2013 Resolution in <i>Reyes,</i> explained:<br><br><blockquote>"11. It may need pointing out that there is no conflict between the COMELEC and the HRET insofar as the petitioner's being a Representative of Marinduque is concerned. The COMELEC covers the matter of petitioner's certificate of candidacy, and its due course or its cancellation, which are the pivotal conclusions that determines who can be legally proclaimed. The matter can go to the Supreme Court but not as a continuation of the proceedings in the COMELEC, which has in fact ended, but on an original action before the Court grounded on more than mere error of judgment but on error of jurisdiction for grave abuse of discretion. At and after the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> decision, there is no longer any certificate cancellation matter than can go to the HRET. In that sense, the HRET's constitutional authority opens, over the qualification of its MEMBER, who becomes so only upon a duly and legally based proclamation, the first and unavoidable step towards such membership. The HRET jurisdiction over the qualification of the Member of the House of Representatives is original and exclusive, and as such, proceeds <u><i>de novo</i></u> unhampered by the proceedings in the COMELEC which, as just stated has been terminated. The HRET proceedings is a regular, not summary, proceeding. It will determine who should be the Member of the House. <b>It must be made clear though, at the risk of repetitiveness, that no hiatus occurs in the representation of Marinduque in the House because there is such a representative who shall sit as the HRET proceedings are had till termination. Such representative is the duly proclaimed winner resulting from the terminated case of cancellation of certificate of candidacy of petitioner. <u>The petitioner [Reyes] is not, cannot, be that representative</u>. And this, all in all, is the crux of the dispute between the parties: who shall sit in the</b> House in representation of Marinduque, while there is yet no HRET decision on the qualifications of the Member.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis and words in brackets added)</blockquote><br>It thus appears that there is no conflict of jurisdiction, and that if a <i>quo warranto</i> case should be filed before HRET as espoused by the respondents and in the Dissent, it cannot be one against Reyes who never became a member of the House of Representatives over whom the HRET could exercise jurisdiction.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>The Dissent also claims that when respondent Reyes was proclaimed by the PBOC as the duly elected Representative of the Lone District of Marinduque of May 18, 2013, petitioner Velasco should have continued his election protest <i>via</i> a <i>quo warranto</i> petition before the HRET.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>This suggestion is legally flawed considering that the HRET is without authority to review, modify, more so annul, the illegal acts of PBOC. On the contrary, this authority is lodged with the COMELEC and is incidental to its power of "direct control and supervision over the Board of Canvassers."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Therefore, the COMELEC is the proper entity that can legally and validly nullify the acts of the PBOC. As held by this Court held in <i>Mastura v. COMELEC</i>;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"Pursuant to its administrative functions, the COMELEC exercises direct supervision and control over the proceedings before the Board of Canvassers. In <i>Aratuc v. Commission on Elections</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> we held —<br><blockquote>"While nominally, the procedure of bringing to the Commission objections to the actuations of boards of canvassers has been quite loosely referred to in certain quarters, even by the Commission and by this Court ... as an appeal, the fact of the matter is that the authority of the Commission in reviewing such actuations does not spring from any appellate jurisdiction conferred by any specific provision of law, for there is none such provision anywhere in the Election Code, but from the plenary prerogative of direct control and supervision endowed to it by the above-quoted provisions of Section 168. And in administrative law, it is a too well settled postulate to need any supporting citation here, that a superior body or office having supervision and control over another may do directly what the latter is supposed to do or ought to have done, xxxx"<br></blockquote></blockquote>Furthermore, the illegal proclamation of the PBOC cannot operate to automatically oust the COMELEC of its supervisory authority over the PBOC. As clearly explained in<i> Reyes</i>:<br><br><blockquote>"More importantly, we cannot disregard a fact basic in this controversy -that before the proclamation of petitioner on 18 May 2013, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> had already finally disposed of the issue of petitioner's lack of Filipino citizenship and residency via its Resolution dated 14 May 2013. <b>After 14 May 2013, there was, before the COMELEC, no longer any pending case on petitioner's qualifications to run for the position of Member of the House of Representative.</b> We will inexcusably disregard this fact if we accept the argument of the petitioner that the COMELEC was ousted of jurisdiction when she was proclaimed, which was four days after the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> decision. <b>The Board of Canvasser which proclaimed petitioner cannot by such act be allowed to render nugatory a decision of the COMELEC En Banc which affirmed a decision of the COMELEC First Division</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>It must likewise be noted that the COMELEC <i>en banc</i>'s May 14, 2013 Decision in SPA No. 13-053 was already final as "there was, before the COMELEC, no longer any pending case on petitioner's qualifications to run for the position of Member of the House of Representative," and in the absence of a restraining order from this Court, it became executory. Thus, as held in Reyes, it was an error for the PBOC to proclaim Reyes, a non-candidate, on May 18, 2013. As aptly observed by Chief Justice Sereno in her Concurring Opinion in the said case:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"On 14 May 2013, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> had already resolved the Amended Petition to Deny Due Course or to Cancel the Certificate of Candidacy filed against Reyes.

The COMELEC En Banc Resolution dated 9 July 2013 and submitted to this Court through the Manifestation of private respondent, quoted the averments in the Verified Petition of petitioner therein as follows:<br><blockquote>xxx While the proceedings of the PBOC is suspended or in recess, the process server of this Honorable Commission, who identified himself as PEDRO P.

When the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i> affirmed the cancellation of the certificate of candidacy on the day of the elections, but before the proclamation of the winner, it had the effect of declaring that herein petitioner was not a candidate.<br><br>Thus, <b>when the PBOC proclaimed herein petitioner, it proclaimed not a winner but a non-candidate</b>.<br><br><b>The proclamation of a non-candidate cannot take away the power vested in the COMELEC to enforce and execute its decisions.

Consequently, the COMELEC <i>En Banc</i>, in its July 9, 2013 Resolution in SPC No. 13-010, nullified the proclamation of Reyes, proceeded to constitute a special PBOC and on July 9, 2013, proclaimed Velasco as the winning Representative for the Lone District of Marinduque for the 2013-2016 term.

No. 207264, the final and executory resolutions of the COMELEC in SPA No. 13-053 (DC) cancelling Reyes' Certificate of Candidacy, and the final and executory resolution of the COMELEC in SPA No. 13-010 declaring null and void the proclamation of Reyes and proclaiming Velasco as the winning candidate for the position of Representative for the Lone District of the Province of Marinduque, it cannot be claimed that the present petition is one for the determination of the right of Velasco to the claimed office.</blockquote><br>It has thus been conclusively proven that Velasco is the winning candidate for the position of Representative for the Lone District of Marinduque during the May 2013 Elections. As a consequence, when respondents Belmonte and Barua-Yap received the <i>"Certificate of Canvass of Votes and Proclamation of Winning Candidate for the position of Member of House of Representatives for the Lone District of Marinduque" </i>issued by the COMELEC in favor of the herein petitioner, they should have, without delay, abide by their respective ministerial duties to administer the oath in favor of the petitioner and to register his name in Roll of Members of the House of Representatives for the 2013-2016 term. Upon their unlawful refusal to do so despite repeated demands from petitioner, the extraordinary writ of <i>mandamus</i> ought to lie.<br><br>In the end, Reyes has no legal basis whatsoever to continue exercising the rights and prerogatives as the Lone District Representative of Marinduque as there is at present no pending action or petition which was instituted by her either before the HRET or the Court challenging petitioner Velasco's proclamation. Respondents Belmonte and Barua-Yap must thus honor the rights of petitioner and execute the final COMELEC and Supreme Court Resolutions in accordance with and furtherance of the rule of law.<br><br>May I just be permitted one last word.<br><br>In what was in all ill designed as a master stroke, Reyes, after all have been said and done by this Court in the petition, she herself filed, submitted a motion to withdraw that petition, G.R. No. 207264, <i>Regina Ongsiako Reyes v. COMELEC and Tan</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> I had the opportunity to say, in the Court's denial of her motion to reconsider the dismissal of her petition, that:<br><br><blockquote><center>xxx<br></center><br>The motion to withdraw petition filed AFTER the Court has acted thereon, is noted. It may well be in order to remind petitioner that jurisdiction, once acquired, is not lost upon the instance of the parties, but continues until the case is terminated. When petitioner filed her Petition for Certiorari, jurisdiction vested in the Court and, in fact, the Court exercised such jurisdiction when it acted on the petition. Such jurisdiction cannot be lost by the unilateral withdrawal of the petition by petitioner.<br><br>More importantly, the Resolution dated 25 June 2013, being a valid court issuance, undoubtedly has legal consequences. Petitioner cannot, by the mere expediency of withdrawing the petition, negative and nullify the Court's Resolution and its legal effects. At this point, we counsel petitioner against trifling with court processes. Having sought the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, petitioner cannot withdraw her petition to erase the ruling adverse to her interests. Obviously, she cannot, as she designed below, subject to her predilections the supremacy of the law.</blockquote><br>I cannot be moved one bit away from the conclusion, then as now, that parties to cases cannot trifle with our Court processes. If we deny the petition at hand, we will ourselves do for Reyes what we said in judgment cannot be done by her.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, I register my vote to <b>GRANT</b> the petition.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Ponencia, p. 13.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Lota v.

This action set up the title of Velasco to a public office. Velasco claims a clear and better legal right as against the occupant.

The Senate and the House of Representatives shall each have an Electoral Tribunal which shall be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of their respective Members. Each Electoral Tribunal shall be composed of nine Members, three of whom shall be Justices of the Supreme Court to be designated by the Chief Justice, and the remaining six shall be Members of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, who shall be chosen on the basis of proportional representation from the political parties and the parties or organizations registered under the party-list system represented therein.

A grant of the writ of mandamus would have openly defied the Constitution and, in all likelihood, would muddle the administration of justice as it would have rendered the quo warranto cases properly pending before the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal moot and academic.

We said:<br><br><blockquote>Case law states that the proclamation of a congressional candidate following the election divests the COMELEC of jurisdiction over disputes relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of the proclaimed representative in favor of the HRET. The phrase "election, returns, and qualifications" refers to all matters affecting the validity of the contestee's title. In particular, the term "election" refers to the conduct of the polls, including the listing of voters, the holding of the electoral campaign, and the casting and counting of the votes; "returns" refers to the canvass of the returns and the proclamation of the winners, including questions concerning the composition of the board of canvassers and the authenticity of the election returns; and "qualifications" refers to matters that could be raised in a quo warranto proceeding against the proclaimed winner, such as his disloyalty or ineligibility or the inadequacy of his CoC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>In <i>Limkaichong v.

Nos. 179120, 179132-33, and 179240-41) steadfastly maintained that Limkaichong's proclamation was tainted with irregularity, which will effectively prevent the HRET from acquiring jurisdiction.<br><br>The fact that the proclamation of the winning candidate, as in this case, was alleged to have been tainted with irregularity does not divest the HRET of its jurisdiction. The Court has shed light on this in the case of <i>Vinzons-Chato</i>, to the effect that:<br><blockquote>In the present case, it is not disputed that respondent Unico has already been proclaimed and taken his oath of office as a Member of the House of Representatives (Thirteenth Congress); hence, the COMELEC correctly ruled that it had already lost jurisdiction over petitioner Chato's petition. The issues raised by petitioner Chato essentially relate to the canvassing of returns and alleged invalidity of respondent Unico's proclamation. These are matters that are best addressed to the sound judgment and discretion of the HRET. Significantly, the allegation that respondent Unico's proclamation is null and void does not divest the HRET of its jurisdiction:<br><blockquote>xxx [I]n an electoral contest where the validity of the proclamation of a winning candidate who has taken his oath of office and assumed his post as congressman is raised, that issue is best addressed to the HRET. The reason for this ruling is self-evident, for it avoids duplicity of proceedings and a clash of jurisdiction between constitutional bodies, with due regard to the people's mandate.<br></blockquote>Further, for the Court to take cognizance of petitioner Chato's election protest against respondent Unico would be to usurp the constitutionally mandated functions of the HRET.<br></blockquote>In fine, any allegations as to the invalidity of the proclamation will not prevent the HRET from assuming jurisdiction over all matters essential to a member's qualification to sit in the House of Representatives.<br>. . . .<br><br>Accordingly, after the proclamation of the winning candidate in the congressional elections, the remedy of those who may assail one's eligibility/ineligibility/qualification/disqualification is to file before the HRET a petition for an election protest, or a petition for quo warranto, within the period provided by the HRET Rules. In <i>Pangilinan v. Commission on Elections</i>, we ruled that where the candidate has already been proclaimed winner in the congressional elections, the remedy of petitioner is to file an electoral protest with the Electoral Tribunal of the House of Representatives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>In <i>Vinzons-Chato v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> this court ruled that:<br><br><blockquote>once a winning candidate has been proclaimed, taken his oath, and assumed office as a Member of the House of Representatives, the COMELEC's jurisdiction over election contests relating to his election, returns, and qualifications ends, and the HRET's own jurisdiction begins.<i> Stated in another manner, where the candidate has already been proclaimed winner in the congressional elections, the remedy of the petitioner is to file an electoral protest with the HRET</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>When Reyes was proclaimed by the Provincial Board of Canvassers as the duly elected Representative of the Lone District of Marinduque on May 18, 2013, Velasco should have continued his election protest or filed a quo warranto Petition before the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Instead, Velasco filed a Petition to annul the proceedings of the Provincial Board of Canvassers and the proclamation of Reyes on May 20, 2013 before the Commission on Elections.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> At that time, the Commission on Elections no longer had jurisdiction over the Petition that was filed after Reyes' proclamation.<br><br>Any alleged invalidity of the proclamation of a Member of the House of Representatives does not divest the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Should there have been pending cases at the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal, we should have deferred to the action of the constitutional body given the competence to act initially on the matter. Thus, in the Dissenting Opinion in <i>Reyes v. Commission on Elections</i>:<br><br><blockquote>In case of doubt, there are fundamental reasons for this Court to be cautious in exercising its jurisdiction to determine who the members are of the House of Representatives. We should maintain our consistent doctrine that proclamation is the operative act that removes jurisdiction from this Court or the Commission on Elections and vests it on the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET).<br><br>The first reason is that the Constitution unequivocably grants this discretion to another constitutional body called the House of Representative Electoral Tribunal (HRET). This is a separate organ from the Judiciary.<br>. . . .<br>The second fundamental reason for us to exercise caution in determining the composition of the House of Representatives is that this is required for a better administration of justice. Matters relating to factual findings on election, returns, and qualifications must first be vetted in the appropriate electoral tribunal before these are raised in the Supreme Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal is the sole judge of contests involving Members of the House of Representatives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> This is a power conferred by the sovereign through our Constitution.<br><br>Again, as in my dissent in <i>Reyes v.

Commission on Elections</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In their Resolution, the House of Representatives pronounced:<br><br><blockquote>Such element is obviously absent in the present cases as Regina Reyes' proclamation was <i><b>nullified</b></i> by the COMELEC, which nullification was <i><b>upheld</b></i> by the Supreme Court. On this ground alone, the Tribunal is without power to assume jurisdiction over the present petitions since Regina Reyes "<b>cannot be considered a Member of the House of Representatives</b>," as declared by the Supreme Court <i>En Banc</i> in G.R. No. 207264.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citation omitted)</blockquote><br>The tribunal dismissed the quo warranto cases holding that the Commission on Elections' cancellation of Reyes' certificate of candidacy resulted in the nullification of her proclamation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the September 23, 2014 Motion for Reconsideration of Victor Vela Sioco is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>. The September 11, 2014 Resolution of Tribunal is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. Accordingly, the present <i>Petitions for Quo Warranto</i> are hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>In effect, the decision by the sole judge of all electoral contests acknowledges Reyes' lack of qualifications. While maintaining my dissent in<i> Reyes v. Commission on Elections</i>, I now acknowledge that there is no other remedy in law or equity to enforce a final decision of this court except through mandamus.<br><br>Applying <i>Codilla, Sr. v.

The candidate receiving the next highest number of votes would be entitled to the position if the Certificate of Candidacy of the candidate receiving the highest number of votes had been initially declared valid at the time of filing but had to be subsequently cancelled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Additionally, if the Certificate of Candidacy of the candidate receiving the highest number of votes was void ab initio, the votes of the candidate should be considered stray and not counted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> This would entitle the candidate receiving the next highest number of votes to the position. Thus:<br><br><blockquote>Decisions of this Court holding that the second-placer cannot be proclaimed winner if the first-placer is disqualified or declared ineligible should be limited to situations where the certificate of candidacy of the first-placer was <b>valid at the time of filing</b> but subsequently had to be cancelled because of a violation of law that took place, or a legal impediment that took effect, after the filing of the certificate of candidacy. If the certificate of candidacy is void <i>ab initio</i>, then legally the person who filed such void certificate of candidacy was never a candidate in the elections at any time. All votes for such non-candidate are stray votes and should not be counted. Thus, such non-candidate can never be a first-placer in the elections. If a certificate of candidacy void ab initio is cancelled on the day, or before the day, of the election, prevailing jurisprudence holds that all votes for that candidate are stray votes. If a certificate of candidacy void<i> ab initio</i> is cancelled one day or more after the elections, all votes for such candidate should also be stray votes because the certificate of candidacy is void from the beginning. This is the more equitable and logical approach on the effect of the cancellation of a certificate of candidacy that is void<i> ab initio</i>. Otherwise, a certificate of candidacy void<i> ab initio</i> can operate to defeat one or more valid certificates of candidacy for the same position.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>The Decision in <i>Aratea</i> was subsequently reiterated in <i>Jalosjos, Jr. v.
