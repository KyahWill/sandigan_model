Trial thereafter ensued.<br><br>The prosecution's evidence showed that in 2004, AAA was only 10 years old having been born on May 4, 1994,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and a grade 4 student.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> She and appellant used to be neighbors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> On September 17, 2004, after her dismissal from school, AAA and her younger sister, BBB, went to the house of appellant, who was known in their neighborhood as a magician by occupation, to watch his magic tricks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> While AAA and BBB were inside appellant's house, the latter told BBB to leave the house as he was going to tell a secret to AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> BBB left the house and waited outside the gate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Appellant brought AAA to his room and undressed her by removing her pants and panty and laid her on the bed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Appellant then kissed her lips several times, licked her vagina and pressed his penis against it while on top of her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> AAA then felt a sticky liquid coming out from appellant's penis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Later, appellant told AAA to put on her dress and gave her thirty pesos (P30.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> AAA then left appellant's house and looked for BBB, who after a while came out from the direction of appellant's apartment carrying two school bags, that of AAA's and her sister's. Both sisters then went home together.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>CCC, the godfather of AAA's father, DDD, and also appellant's neighbor was approached by BBB on September 17, 2004 asking the whereabouts of her sister AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> CCC later saw that as BBB passed by appellant's house, the latter handed a school bag to BBB<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> which he later learned to belong to AAA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> CCC told DDD about what he saw.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> As DDD got suspicious that appellant was doing something unpleasant to AAA, he had a heart to heart talk with AAA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> who told him what appellant did to her on that day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> AAA also divulged that appellant had abused her several times before only that she was afraid to tell her parents because of fear that they would spank her. The same evening, DDD, accompanied by his wife, brought AAA to the Baguio City Police Station and filed a complaint against appellant,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and later proceeded to the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center (BGHMC) for AAA's physical examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Dr. Gwynette Dizon, the Chief Resident of the Pediatric Department of the BGHMC, conducted an ano-genital examination on AAA the following day the incident happened. She issued a medical certificate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which showed erythema and swelling of the urethra and periurethral area and erythema on the hymen. During trial, she testified that there was erythema or redness over the urethra and periurethral area and such erythema was fresh which implied a recent incident;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> that erythema or redness and swelling may be caused by the pressing of the male sex organ to the victim's organ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Appellant denied the allegation saying that he was doing laundry chores outside his apartment when AAA approached him to collect the amount of P30.00 as payment for taking care of his doves and rabbits, which appellant then paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Appellant later saw AAA sliding down on the stairway railing with her hands and her two feet clipped over the pole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> By past noon, he was asked by BBB regarding AAA's whereabouts to which he replied that AAA had already gone home.<br><br>On June 10, 2009, the RTC rendered its Decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises all duly considered, the court finds that the prosecution has established the guilt of the accused of the crime of rape under par. 1 (d) of RA 8353 beyond reasonable doubt and hereby imposes upon him the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> and to indemnify the offended party the amount of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, the amount of P25,000.00 as moral damages, and P25,000.00 as exemplary damages and to pay the costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC found that appellant's denial cannot prevail over AAA's clear and positive testimony. Appellant's admission that AAA went to his place and gave her P30.00 strengthened the prosecution's evidence; and that the findings of Dr. Dizon that the erythema and swelling found in AAA's genitalia supported the charge of statutory rape.<br><br>On September 10, 2012, the CA rendered its Decision, the decretal portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Judgment dated 10 June 2009 issued by the Regional Trial Court of Baguio City, Branch 59, finding accused-appellant Felipe Bugho GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of RAPE is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION as to the award of damages: Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as civil indemnity, Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral damages and Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) as exemplary damages. Costs against the accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br></blockquote>Dissatisfied, appellant filed a Notice of Appeal. On September 30, 2013, we required the parties to submit Supplemental Briefs if they so desired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The parties manifested that they were no longer filing supplemental briefs as they had already exhaustively argued their case in their respective briefs filed before the CA.<br><br>Appellant contends that his conviction is patently erroneous as it was merely based on the corroborative testimony of Dr. Dizon that AAA suffered erythema on her urethra and periurethral areas; and that AAA's credibility is questionable considering her unexplained continued visits to appellant's apartment until September 17, 2004 despite her allegation that the latter raped her in the same place and manner for several times; and also her failure to justify her non-immediate and voluntary reporting of any molestations to her parents. Appellant further argues that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt as there was no showing that appellant had a penile penetration to consummate the crime of rape.<br><br>We find no merit in the appeal.<br><br>Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 8353, defines statutory rape as follows:<br><blockquote>Article 266-A. <i>Rape, When and How Committed</i>. - Rape is committed -<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman x x x:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present;<br><br>x x x x<br></div></blockquote>Thus, two elements must be established to hold the accused guilty of statutory rape, namely: (1) that the accused had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) that the woman is below twelve years of age or demented. Thus, proof of force, intimidation and consent is unnecessary since none of these is an element of statutory rape as the only subject of inquiry is the age of the woman and whether carnal knowledge took place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In this case, AAA was only 10 years old when appellant had carnal knowledge of her on September 17, 2004 as she was born on May 4, 1994. AAA's age was stipulated and admitted by appellant and his counsel during the pre-trial conference.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>AAA had narrated in a positive and categorical manner how she was sexually abused by appellant. She testified that appellant brought her to his room, removed her pants and panty and laid her on the bed. He kissed her lips, licked her vagina and pressed his penis against her vagina while he was on top of her. She later felt a warm sticky liquid coming out from appellant's sex organ. Thereafter, appellant asked her to put on her dress and gave her P30.00.<br><br>The Medical Certificate issued by Dr. Dizon lends credence to AAA's testimony that appellant had pressed his sex organ on her vagina. The medical certificate showed that there was erythema or redness and swelling of the urethra and periurethral area and also erythema of the hymen. During the trial, Dr. Dizon explained her findings in this wise:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q. </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Now I call your attention to an entry under the heading Ano-Genital Examination after the phrase urethra and periurethral area of the entry reads (+)erythema(+) swelling.

Campuhan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> we stated that:<br><blockquote>x x x touching when applied to rape cases does not simply mean mere epidermal contact, stroking or grazing of organs, a slight brush or a scrape of the penis on the external layer of the victim's vagina, or the <i>mons pubis</i>, as in this case. There must be sufficient and convincing proof that the penis indeed touched the labias or slid into the female organ, and not merely stroked the external surface thereof, for an accused to be convicted of consummated rape. As the labias, which are required to be "touched" by the penis, are by their natural situs or location beneath the mons pubis or the vaginal surface, to touch them with the penis is to attain some degree of penetration beneath the surface, hence, the conclusion that touching the <i>labia majora</i> or the <i>labia minora</i> of the <i>pudendum</i> constitutes consummated rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>Indeed, there is no doubt that appellant's sex organ had gone beyond AAA's <i>mons pubis</i> and had touched the labia of the pudendum as established by the erythema or redness of the urethra and hymen and swelling of the periurethral area, which are of recent incident. The said areas are located in the internal part of the vagina and for the penis to touch those areas is to attain a degree of penetration beneath the surface of the female genitalia. Penile invasion necessarily entails contact with the <i>labia</i> and even the briefest of contacts without laceration of the hymen is deemed to be rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Moreover, Dr. Dizon's finding that the erythema and swelling found in the internal part of the vagina are of recent incident further bolstered AAA's claim of rape the day before.<br><br>Appellant also attacks AAA's credibility because of her continued visits to appellant's house despite her allegations of several rapes earlier committed against her.<br><br>AAA testified that she found appellant's magical tricks fun to watch<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and because he had rabbits, snakes and doves in his house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The joy that appellant's magic and his animals brought to an innocent child did not deter the latter from going back to appellant's house. Sadly, however, appellant took the opportunity to satisfy his carnal desires on the innocent child. It bears stressing that mere sexual congress with a woman below twelve years of age consummates the crime of statutory rape. The absence of struggle or outcry of the victim or even her passive submission to the sexual act will not mitigate nor absolve the accused from liability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The law presumes that a woman of tender age does not possess discernment and is incapable of giving intelligent consent to the sexual act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The child victim's consent is immaterial because of her presumed incapacity to discern evil from good.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Appellant's claim that AAA's failure to report the sexual abuse to her parents also casts doubt on the credibility of her charge is not meritorious. AAA explained that she did not report the sexual abuse to her parents for fear that the latter might get angry with her and might scold or whip her<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> since she and her sister had ben forbidden by their parents to go to appellant's house to watch magic' tricks as it disturbed their schooling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Thus, as the Office of the Solicitor General correctly stated, "the prospect of experiencing physical pain and verbal abuse from her parents, in the mind of a ten-year-old girl, is enough reason for the delay in exacting the truth from her."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Notably, it was only after AAA's father had a heart-to-heart talk with her on the night of September 17, 2004 and assured her of the latter's understanding that AAA started to talk on what appellant had done to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The alleged inconsistency as to the amount AAA received from appellant after the rape incident, whether P15.00 or P30.00, refers to a minor matter which is irrelevant to the elements of the crime of rape.<br><br>The RTC correctly rejected appellant's denial which is a self-serving negative evidence that cannot be given greater weight than the declaration of a credible witness who testify on affirmative matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> AAA's positive testimony, coupled with the medical findings, deserves more persuasive weight than the bare denial of appellant.<br><br>We find that the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, correctly imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> upon appellant for the crime of statutory rape in accordance with Article 266-B<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.<br><br>The CA's modification of the RTC's awards of civil indemnity and moral damages to the amounts of P50,000.00 each, as well as the increase of the exemplary damages to the amount of P30,000.00, are likewise affirmed.
