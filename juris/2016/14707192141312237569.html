Overall, they prayed that the assailed CA rulings be reversed and set aside insofar as the CA found CESCO as engaged in labor-only contracting and that its employees are actually the regular employees of CEPALCO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petitions are partly meritorious.<br><br>At the outset, it is well to note that the status of CESCO as a labor-only contractor was raised in respondent's complaints before the labor tribunals only in relation to the charges of ULP. In particular, respondent, in its complaint in <b>NLRC Case No. RAB-10-07-00408-2007</b>, mainly argued that the "[labor-only] contracting agreement between CEPALCO and [CESCO] discriminates regular union member employees and will ultimately result in the dissipation of its ranks in the line maintenance and construction department."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> This is similar to the thrust of its complaint in <b>NLRC Case No. RAB-10-12-00602-2009</b>, wherein they averred that "the [labor-only] contracting arrangement between CEPALCO and [CESCO] discriminates union members and restrains or coerces employees in the exercise of their rights to [self-organization] and collective bargaining[,] and amounts to union busting."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> As the LA in the latter case aptly observed, "the essential issue between the same parties remain[s] identical: whether the contracting out of activities or services being performed by [u]nion members constitute [ULP]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Under Article 106<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> of the Labor Code, as amended, labor-only contracting is an arrangement where the contractor, who does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, supplies workers to an employer and the workers recruited are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer. <b>Section 5 of Department Order No. 18-02, Series of 2002, otherwise known as the "Rules Implementing Articles 106 to 109 of the Labor Code, As Amended" (DO 18-02), provides the following criteria to gauge whether or not an arrangement constitutes labor-only contracting:</b><br><blockquote><b><i>Section 5. Prohibition against labor-only contracting.</i></b> Labor-only contracting is hereby declared prohibited. For this purpose, labor-only contracting shall refer to an arrangement where the contractor or subcontractor merely recruits, supplies or places workers to perform a job, work or service for a principal, and any of the following elements are present:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"><strong>i) </strong></div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"><strong>The contractor or subcontractor does not have substantial capital or investment which relates to the job, work or service to be performed and the employees recruited, supplied or placed by such contractor or subcontractor are performing activities which are directly related to the main business of the principal; or</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"><strong>ii)</strong></div></td><td><div align="justify"><strong> the contractor does not exercise the right to control over the performance of the work of the contractual employee.</strong><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>The foregoing provisions shall be without prejudice to the application of Article 248 (C) of the Labor Code, as amended.<br><br>"Substantial capital or investment" refers to capital stocks and subscribed capitalization in the case of corporations, tools, equipment, implements, machineries and work premises, actually and directly used by the contractor or subcontractor in the performance or completion of the job, work or service contracted out.<br><br>The "right to control" shall refer to the right reserved to the person for whom the services of the contractual workers are performed, to determine not only the end to be achieved, but also the manner and means to be used in reaching that end. (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>Labor-only contracting is considered as a form of ULP when the same is devised by the employer to "interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights to self-organization."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Article 259 of the Labor Code, as amended, which enumerates certain prohibited activities constitutive of ULP, provides:<br><blockquote>Article 259. <i>Unfair Labor Practices of Employers</i>. - It shall be unlawful for an employer to commit any of the following unfair labor practice:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(c) To contract out services or functions being performed by union members <b><u>when such will interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights to self-organization</u></b>.<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">x x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></div></blockquote>The need to determine whether or not the contracting out of services (or any particular activity or scheme devised by the employer for that matter) was intended to defeat the workers' right to self-organization is impelled by the underlying concept of ULP. This is stated in Article 258 of the Labor Code, as amended, to wit:<br><blockquote>Article 258. <i>Concept of Unfair Labor Practice and Procedure for Prosecution Thereof</i>. - <b><u>Unfair labor practices violate the constitutional right of workers and employees to self-organization</u></b>, are inimical to the legitimate interests of both labor and management, <b><u>including their right to bargain collectively</u></b> and otherwise deal with each other in an atmosphere of freedom and mutual respect, disrupt industrial peace and hinder the promotion of healthy and stable labor-management relations.<br><br>x x x x (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, in <i>Great Pacific Employees Union v. Great Pacific Life Assurance Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the Court observed:<br><blockquote>There should be no dispute that all the prohibited acts constituting unfair labor practice in essence <b><u>relate to the workers' right to self-organization</u></b>. Thus, an employer may be held liable under this provision if his conduct affects in whatever manner the right of an employee to self-organize.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote>Similarly, in <i>Bankard, Inc. v. NLRC</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><blockquote>The Court has ruled that the prohibited acts considered as ULP relate to the workers' right to self-organization and to the observance of a CBA. <b>It refers to "acts that violate the workers' right to organize." Without that element, the acts, even if unfair, are not ULP.</b> Thus, an employer may only be held liable for unfair labor practice if it can be shown that his acts affect in whatever manner the right of his employees to self-organize.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>In these cases, the Court agrees with the CA that CEPALCO was engaged in labor-only contracting as its Contract for Meter-Reading Work dated February 19, 2007 and Contract of Service To Perform Warehousing Works dated January 5, 2010 (subject contracts) with CESCO fit the criteria provided for in Section 5 of DO 18-02, as above-highlighted.<br><br>To be specific, petitioners failed to show that CESCO has substantial capital or investment which relates to the job, work or service to be performed. While it is true that: (<i>a</i>) CESCO's Amended Articles of Incorporation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> as of November 26, 2008 shows that CESCO's authorized capital stock is P200,000,000.00 as of September 26, 2008,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> which was increased from P100,000,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> on May 30, 2007; and (<i>b</i>) its financial statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> as of 2010 and 2011 shows that its paid-up capital stock is in the sum of P81,063,000.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> there is no available document to show CESCO's authorized capital stock at the time of the <b>contracting out of CEPALCO's <i>meter-reading</i> activities</b> to CESCO on February 19, 2007. As it is, the increases in its authorized capital stock and paid-up capital were only made after November 26, 2008, hence, are only relevant with regard to the time CEPALCO contracted out its warehousing works to CESCO on January 5, 2010. Since the amount of CESCO's authorized capital stock at the time CEPALCO contracted out its meter-reading activities was not shown, the Court has no means of determining whether it had substantial capital at the time the contract therefor was entered into. Furthermore, the list<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> of CESCO's office equipment, furniture and fixtures, and vehicles offered in evidence by petitioners does not satisfy the requirement that they could have been used in the performance of the specific work contracted out, <i>i.e.</i>, meter-reading service. As the CA aptly pointed out,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> the tools and equipment utilized by CESCO in the meter-reading activities are owned by CEPALCO, emphasizing the fact that CESCO has no basic equipment to carry out the service contracted out by CEPALCO.<br><br>It is also evident that meter-reading is a job that is directly related to the main business of CEPALCO, considering that the latter is an electric distribution utility,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> which is necessarily tasked with the evaluation and appraisal of meters in order to bill its clients.<br><br>More significantly, records are devoid of evidence to prove that the work undertaken in furtherance of the meter-reading contract was made under the sole control and supervision of CESCO. Instead, as noted<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> by the CA, it was CEPALCO that established the working procedure and methods and supervised CESCO's workers in their tasks.<br><br>On the other hand, although it may be said that CESCO had substantial capital when CEPALCO contracted out its <b><i>warehousing</i> works</b> on January 5, 2010, there is, however, lack of credible evidence to show that CESCO had the aforesaid substantial investment in the form of equipment, tools, implements, machineries, and work premises to perform the warehousing activities on its own account. Similarly, the job contracted out is directly related to CEPALCO's electric distribution business, which involves logistics, inventories, accounting, billing services, and other related operations. Lastly, same as above, no evidence has been offered to establish that CESCO exercised control with respect to the manner and methods of achieving the warehousing works, or that it supervised the workers assigned to perform the same.<br><br>The foregoing findings notwithstanding, the Court, similar to the CA and the labor tribunals, finds that CEPALCO's contracting arrangements with CESCO did not amount to ULP. This is because respondent was not able to present any evidence to show that such arrangements violated CEPALCO's workers' right to self-organization, which, as above-mentioned, constitutes the core of ULP. Records do not show that this finding was further appealed by respondent. <b><u>Thus, the complaints filed by respondent should be dismissed with finality.</u></b><br><br>At this juncture, it should be made clear that the disposition of these cases should be limited only to the foregoing declaration. Again, the complaints filed by respondent were only for ULP. While there is nothing infirm in passing upon the matter of labor-only contracting since it was vigorously litigated in these proceedings, the resolution of the same must only be read in relation to the charges of ULP. As earlier stated, labor-only contracting was invoked by respondent as a prohibited act under Article 259 (c) of the Labor Code, as amended. As it turned out, however, respondent failed to relate the arrangement to the defining element of ULP, <i>i.e.</i>, that it violated the workers' right to self-organization. Hence, being a preliminary matter actively argued by respondent to prove the charges of ULP, the same was not rendered moot and academic by the eventual dismissal of the complaints as an issue only becomes moot and academic if it becomes a "dead" issue, devoid of any practical value or use to be passed upon. In <i>Pormento v. Estrada</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><blockquote>An action is considered "moot" when it no longer presents a justiciable controversy because the issues involved have become academic or dead or when the matter in dispute has already been resolved and hence, one is not entitled to judicial intervention unless the issue is likely to be raised again between the parties. There is nothing for the court to resolve as the determination thereof has been overtaken by subsequent events.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br></blockquote>For another, the Court also observes that while respondent did ask for the nullification of the subject contracts between petitioners, and even sought that the employees provided by CESCO to CEPALCO be declared as the latter's own employees, petitioners correctly argue that respondent is not a real party-in-interest and hence, had no legal standing insofar as these matters are concerned. This is because respondent failed to demonstrate how it stands to be benefited or injured by a judgment on the same, or that any personal or direct injury would be sustained by it if these reliefs were not granted. In <i>Joya v. Presidential Commission on Good Government</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> the Court explained:<br><blockquote>"Legal standing" means a personal and substantial interest in the case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the x x x act being challenged. The term "interest" is material interest, an interest in issue and to be affected by the decree, as distinguished from mere interest in the question involved, or a mere incidental interest. Moreover, the interest of the party plaintiff must be personal and not one based on a desire to vindicate the constitutional right of some third and unrelated party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br></blockquote>If at all, it would be the employees of CESCO who are entitled to seek the foregoing reliefs since in cases of labor-only contracting, "the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> However, they have not been impleaded in these cases. Thus, as prayed for by petitioners, the Court must set aside the portions of the assailed CA Decisions declaring: (<i>a</i>) the workers hired by CESCO, pursuant to the contracts subject of these cases, as regular employees of CEPALCO; and (<i>b</i>) the latter responsible to said workers in the same manner and extent as if they were directly employed by it. This pronouncement not only squares with the rules on real party-in-interest and legal standing, but also with the precept that no one shall be affected by any proceeding to which he is a stranger, and that strangers to a case are not bound by any judgment rendered by the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>With the principal issues already resolved, the Court sees no need to delve into other ancillary issues that would have no effect to the conclusion of these cases.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions are <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>.
