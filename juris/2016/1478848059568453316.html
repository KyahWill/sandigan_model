It added that the factors considered in determining MERALCO's ARR and MAP had already been settled in the ERC's August 30, 2007 Decision and FD in <b>ERC Case No. 2006-045</b>, hence, cannot be the subject of review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The CA likewise dismissed petitioners' contention that a complete audit by the COA is required before approving MERALCO's applications, pointing out that no less than the <i>Lualhati</i> case held that the same was not an indispensable requirement, and that absent any showing that the decision and order of the ERC were arrived at arbitrarily, the latter's findings are accorded not only respect but even finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In the same manner, the CA denied petitioners' claims for rate rollback and refund for lack of basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Hence, the instant petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The main issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA correctly upheld the ERC ruling in <b>ERC Case Nos. 2008-004 RC and 2008-018 RC</b>, which approved with modification MERALCO's applications for the translation into distribution rates of the ERC-approved ARR under the PBR methodology for the first and second regulatory years of the 2007-2011 regulatory period.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is without merit.<br><br>Primarily, petitioners assail the ERC's shift to the PBR methodology, arguing that while the ERC has the authority to adopt alternative forms of internationally-accepted rate-setting methodology as provided for by the EPIRA, it must nevertheless ensure a reasonable price of electricity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Co<i>rollo</i>ry thereto, petitioners likewise assail the approval of MERALCO's proposed rates pursuant to the PBR methodology, contending that such rates are unreasonable and unjustified, especially in view of its allegation that MERALCO was receiving excessive profits over the last six (6) years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>The arguments are untenable.<br><br>The rule is settled that "[a]dministrative regulations enacted by administrative agencies to implement and interpret the law which they are entrusted to enforce have the force of law x x x and enjoy the presumption of constitutionality and legality <u>until they are set aside with finality in an appropriate case by a competent court</u>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> As such, they "<u>cannot be attacked collaterally</u>. Unless [such] rule is annulled in a direct proceeding, the legal presumption of its validity stands."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioners' opposition against the PBR rate-setting methodology adopted by the ERC, through its issuance of the DWRG and the RDWR, was not made through the proper case directly attacking the constitutionality and/or validity of the same. Hence, the instant petition constitutes a collateral attack on the above-stated regulation, and therefore, should, at the outset, be disallowed. To explain, based on the PBR methodology, regulated entities, such as MERALCO, are required to go through two (2) <b><u>separate</u></b> proceedings for their rates to be finally approved. These are: <b><i>first</i></b>, the determination of the ARR, which is used to derive the MAP; and <b><i>second</i></b>, <u>the translation of the MAP into a distribution rate structure for each customer class or segment</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> <b>ERC Case Nos. 2008-004 RC and 2008-018 RC, <u>from which the instant petition emanated</u></b>, already refer to MERALCO's separate applications for the translation of its MAP into distribution rates of different customer classes for the First and Second regulatory years of the ERC-approved ARR for the regulatory period 2007-2011, which is <u>the second proceeding contemplated under the PBR methodology</u>. <b>It no longer concerns the propriety of MERALCO's shift to the PBR methodology</b>, which was what the ERC had officially adopted at the time <b>ERC Case Nos. 2008-004 RC and 2008-018 RC</b> were filed.<br><br>Moreover, it should be highlighted that no discernible objection was raised by petitioners during the public consultations conducted by the ERC relative to its shift to the PBR methodology. Neither did petitioners raise their opposition to the ERC's adoption of the same in <b>ERC Case No. 2006-045 RC</b> where the subject matter was precisely MERALCO's application for the approval of its ARR and determination of its MAP for the same regulatory period, which is the first proceeding contemplated under the PBR system. As the records show, during the pendency of <b>ERC Case No. 2006-045 RC</b>, MERALCO was not only required to present to the public the circumstances of its application, they also had to present their witnesses who undertook a lengthy-cross examination and addressed clarificatory questions propounded by the ERC and its technical consultants. Further, when the ERC issued its Draft Determination, it invited various stakeholders in the energy sector, including herein petitioners, to attend public consultations, ask clarificatory questions themselves, and even file their respective comments and/or petitions for intervention; however, they failed to do so despite due notice. It was only after affording all stakeholders the opportunity to be heard that the ERC rendered its Decision dated August 30, 2007 approving with modification MERALCO's ARR, performance incentive scheme, and MAP for regulatory period 2007-2011, <b>which ruling has now lapsed into finality</b>. Based on the foregoing, it is therefore evident that petitioners were given an ample opportunity to question the ERC's shift to the PBR methodology, including its application relative to MERALCO's rate propositions, but to no avail. Consequently, they can no longer question the judgment rendered in said case which had long become final and executory and hence, immutable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Besides, the resolution of the instant petition would nonetheless entail a determination of factual matters which is proscribed in petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The general rule is that in a petition for review under Rule 45, only questions of law may be raised.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> In this case, petitioners contest the reasonableness of the rates approved by the ERC<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> inasmuch as it granted MERALCO's application for the approval of its ARR and determination of its MAP covering the regulatory period of 2007-2011. In support of their protest, petitioners presented factual data which purportedly show MERALCO's strong financial position for the last 21 years (1987-2007), considering that it had actually earned a total of P88,960.00 for every P1,000.00 investment, which translates to a gain of 8,896% on their actual investments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> For its part, MERALCO contests petitioners' "misleading assertions", clarifying that petitioners incorrectly assumed that the original value of the common shares issued is the only investment of the investors, and further maintained that when net income earned throughout the years are retained by a company as accumulated in the Retained Earnings account and are used for the company's continuing operations, it is considered a reinvestment, and therefore should be an addition to the investors' investment in the company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Case law provides that the test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is <u>whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise it is a question of fact</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> As applied in this case, in order to assess the reasonableness of the rates approved by the ERC, there is a glaring need to scrutinize the veracity of the adverse allegations of both parties, which, in turn, necessitates an examination of the evidence in support thereof. Therefore, the issue on reasonableness posed in the petition inevitably treads the territory of questions of fact, which is generally proscribed from review in a Rule 45 petition, as in this case.<br><br>The factual nature of the considerations involved in the present petition is further highlighted by the observation that the ERC, in line with the PBR methodology, used macroeconomic forecasts available for the Philippines from a number of independent sources and compared them with the economic forecasts submitted by it in its Revenue Application (which includes data on the Philippines Consumer Price Index [CPI], the United States CPI, and the PhP/US$ exchange rate) in order to assess whether these forecasts are reasonable to apply during the covered regulatory period, or whether these need to be adapted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> As to the regulatory year 2009 rate application, MERALCO echoed the following factual findings of the ERC:<br><blockquote>iv. The annual adjusted MAP for a regulatory year, in terms of the RDWR, is an adjustment of the MAP for the previous regulatory year, taking into account the following factors:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The X-factor as determined by the Commission;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The Philippines CPI for the previous measurement period;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the previous measurement period;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. The US Dollar-Philippine Peso exchange rate for the previous measurement period;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. The performance incentive factor (S-factor) for the previous measurement period; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Under or over recovery in rates over the previous measurement period (the Kt-factor)<br><br><b><u>These factors were calculated by MERALCO and thoroughly reviewed by the Commission. It was noted that all of MERALCO's calculations were carried out in accordance with the RDWR.</u></b><br><br>v. Based on the Commission's own calculation using the actual March index, the CPI movement over this period was determined to be 3.83%.<br><br>vi. Based on the actual indices, the Commission made its own calculation on the USER-factor at - 10.19%.<br><br>vii. After correcting the factors noted above, the Commission recalculated the same at - 1.78%.<br><br>viii. The table below shows a comparison of MERALCO's performance incentive targets and its actual service performance over the measurement period. It can be noted that MERALCO performed reasonably well, slightly exceeding its average performance of recent times. This corresponds with the calculation made by the Commission.<br><br>ix. MERALCO calculated the under-recovery factor (k2009) at PhP0.1580/kWh. This is the same figure that was determined by the Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>It must be stressed that since rate-fixing calls for a technical examination and a specialized review of specific details which the courts are ill-equipped to enter, such matters are primarily entrusted to the administrative or regulating authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Hence, the factual findings of administrative officials and agencies that have acquired expertise in the performance of their official duties and the exercise of their primary jurisdiction are generally accorded not only respect but, at times, even finality if such findings are supported by substantial evidence. Absent any of the exceptions laid down by jurisprudence, such factual findings of quasi­ judicial agencies, especially when affirmed by the CA, are binding on this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>As determined by the ERC, which was affirmed by the CA, petitioners failed to sufficiently show that the rates approved in the proceedings below were unreasonable as they claimed to be. As pointed out by the CA, MERALCO's rate applications were approved only after the ERC conducted the necessary proceedings, received evidence in support of the applications and, thereafter, made an independent evaluation of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Thus, the CA cannot be faulted in sustaining the reasonableness of the rates approved by the ERC. In <i>Ynchausti Steamship Co. v. Public Utility Commissioner</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> this Court articulated that "[t]here is a legal presumption that the fixed rates are reasonable, and it must be conceded that the fixing of rates by the Government, through its authorized agents, involves the exercise of reasonable discretion and unless there is an abuse of that discretion, the courts will not interfere."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>For another, petitioners decry the ERC's failure to wait for and take into consideration the complete audit on the books, records, and accounts of MERALCO by the COA before approving MERALCO's new rates. According to them, <i>Lualhati</i> directed the ERC to request the COA to perform such audit relative to MERALCO's provisionally-approved increase and unbundled rates. Petitioners further add that due to ERC's unbridled approval of new rates, MERALCO was able to amass excess profits in the amount of P39,208,556,000.00 for the period of 2003-2008, thus, giving it an average annual return of investment of 51%, which is way above the 12% return on investment generally allowed for public utilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>However, it is well to point out that <i>Lualhati</i> is traced from <b>ERC Case Nos. 2001-646 and 2001-900</b>, which cover MERALCO's application for rate increase <b><u>when the ERC was still adopting the RORB methodology in its rate-setting function</u></b>. In other words, the need of a COA audit, under the auspices of the <i>Lualhati</i> ruling, pertained to MERALCO's rates when it was still under the RORB system. During the pendency of this case, the ERC shifted to the PBR methodology, which premises and assumptions are conceptually different from that followed in the RORB. In particular, under the RORB methodology, power rates were set to recover the cost of service prudently incurred, <i>i.e.</i>, historical costs, plus a reasonable rate of return. This means that actual and reasonable costs were used for a prescribed test year to determine the revenue requirement, with the use of the test year assuming that the past relationship among revenue, costs, and net investment during said test year will continue into the future.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> On the other hand, the PBR methodology deviates from the use of historical costs, and instead, uses projections of operating and capital expenditures to meet projected demand, thereby enabling the regulated entities to invest in facilities to meet customer requirements and prescribed service levels. This methodology also features a performance incentive scheme which provides incentives and penalties to the utility to compel it to be more efficient and reliable, while maintaining reasonable rates and improving the quality of service to achieve pre-determined target levels.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br>Because of the variances in its premises and assumptions, the ERC's shift from the RORB to the PBR methodology should therefore be deemed as a supervening circumstance that rendered inconsequential this Court's provisional approval of the rate increases applied for by MERALCO in <i>Lualhati</i> which was made under the context of the now-defunct RORB system. Accordingly, the issue of whether or not the ERC should have first took into account the findings in the COA audit before approving MERALCO's applications in <b>ERC Case Nos. 2008-004 RC and 2008-018 RC</b> as directed in <i>Lualhati</i> has become moot and academic. In <i>Carpio v. CA</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> it was explained that "[a] case or issue is considered moot and academic when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that an adjudication of the case or a declaration on the issue would be of no practical value or use," as the aforesaid issue raised in this case. For all these reasons, the petition is therefore denied.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>. The Decision dated January 29, 2010 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
