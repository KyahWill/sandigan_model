Accordingly, respondent's claim should be filed in the proceedings for the settlement of their estates. Petitioner averred that respondent had, in fact, participated in the settlement proceedings and had issued a certification<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> stating that it was petitioner's deceased parents who were indebted to respondent for P2,000,000.00.

She further claimed that the check was blank when she issued it and that despite having no authority to fill up the same, respondent wrote the amount and date thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> She also maintained that from December 29, 2000 to May 31, 2003, she made, in almost daily installments, payments to respondent ranging from P500.00 to P10,000.00, and that while she tried to make succeeding payments, respondent refused to accept the same, demanding, instead, the payment of the entire balance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> As counterclaim, petitioner prayed that moral damages, attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and exemplary and punitive damages be awarded to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated May 5, 2009, the RTC ruled in favor of respondent and ordered petitioner to pay: (<i>a</i>) P1,710,049.00 which represents the unpaid portion of the P2,100,000.00 debt; (<i>b</i>) twelve percent (12%) interest computed from the time judicial demand was made on August 20, 2003 until fully paid; (<i>c</i>) P10,000.00 as attorney's fees; (<i>d</i>) litigation expenses amounting to P19,662.78; and (<i>e</i>) the costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>The RTC refused to give credence to petitioner's contention that it was her deceased parents who borrowed money from respondent, observing that while the latter acknowledged that the former's deceased parents owed her P700,000.00 out of the P2,100,000.00, petitioner likewise admitted that she obtained personal loans from respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Hence, according to the RTC, petitioner cannot deny her liability to respondent. Further, by assuming the liability of her deceased parents and agreeing to pay their debt in installments - which she in fact paid from December 29, 2000 to May 31, 2003 in amounts of P500.00 to P10,000.00, and which payments respondent did actually accept - a mixed novation took place and petitioner was substituted in their place as debtor. Thus, the liabilities of the estates of petitioner's deceased parents were extinguished and transferred to petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Anent the sum due, the RTC surmised that petitioner and her deceased parents owed respondent the sum of P2,000,000.00 as principal and since petitioner undertook to pay the same in installments, P100,000.00 was added as interest; hence, petitioner issued the check for P2,100,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Based on the receipts submitted by petitioner, the genuineness and due execution of which were not put in issue, petitioner had paid a total of P389,951.00 in installments, leaving an unpaid balance of P1,710,049.00, subject to interest of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the time judicial demand was made on August 20, 2003, in the absence of any written stipulation on interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioner appealed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> to the CA, arguing that novation did not take place and no interest was due respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated March 16, 2012, the CA affirmed the ruling of the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It agreed that petitioner cannot deny her liability to respondent in view of her admission that she borrowed money from the latter several times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The CA also found petitioner's claim that she issued a blank check incredible, pointing out that petitioner testified in court that she personally wrote the amount thereon after she and respondent agreed that the loans she and her deceased parents obtained amounted to P2,100,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Anent the issue of novation, the CA concurred with the RTC that novation took place insofar as petitioner was substituted in place of petitioner's late parents, considering that petitioner undertook to pay her deceased parents' debt. However, the CA opined that there was no novation with respect to the object of the contract, following the rule that an obligation is not novated by an instrument which expressly recognizes the old obligation and changes only the terms of paying the same, as in this case where the parties merely modified the terms of payment of the P2,100,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, petitioner moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> dated July 14, 2014; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The primary issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not petitioner should be held liable to respondent for the entire debt in the amount of P2,100,000.00.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>At the outset, it must be emphasized that the fact of petitioner's liability to respondent is well-established. As correctly pointed out by the RTC and the CA, while respondent acknowledged that petitioner's deceased parents owed her money, petitioner also admitted obtaining loans from respondent, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>From [respondent's] recollection, the amount due from [petitioner's] parents is P700,000.00. Aside from her parents' loans, however, [petitioner] herself admitted having obtained personal loans from the respondent while her parents were still alive. She testified:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="10%"><div align="justify">ATTY.

It is settled that judicial admissions made by the parties in the pleadings or in the course of the trial or other proceedings in the same case are conclusive and do not require further evidence to prove them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> They are legally binding on the party making it,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> except when it is shown that they have been made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was actually made,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> neither of which was shown to exist in this case. Accordingly, petitioner is bound by her admission of liability and the only material question remaining is the extent of such liability.<br><br>Based on the records of this case, respondent, for her part, admitted that petitioner's deceased parents owed her P700,000.00 of the P2,100,000.00 debt and that petitioner owed her P1,400,000.00 only:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">ATTY.

Thus, respondent only remains liable to petitioner for such amount. Considering that petitioner had already paid P389,951.00 in installments as evidenced by the receipts submitted by petitioner - the genuineness and due execution of which were not put in issue - the unpaid balance of petitioner's P1,400,000.00 debt to respondent stands at <u><b>P1,010,049.00</b></u>. On the other hand, the remaining P700,000.00 of the total P2,100,000.00 debt to respondent is properly for the account of the estates of petitioner's deceased parents and, hence, should be claimed in the relevant proceeding therefor.<br><br>At this juncture, the Court finds it apt to correct the mistaken notions that: (<i>a</i>) <b><u>novation by substitution of the debtor took place</u></b> so as to release the estates of the petitioner's deceased parents from their obligation, which, thus, rendered petitioner solely liable for the entire P2,100,000.00 debt; and (<i>b</i>) the P100,000.00 of the P2,100,000,00 debt was <u><b>in the nature of accrued monetary interests</b></u>.<br><br>On the first matter, while it is observed that petitioner had indeed admitted that she agreed to settle her late parents' debt, which was supposedly evinced by (<i>a</i>) the P2,100,000.00 check she issued therefor, and (<i>b</i>) several installment payments she made to respondent from December 29, 2000 to May 31, 2003, there was <b>no allegation, much less any proof to show, that the estates of her deceased parents were released from liability thereby</b>. In <i>S.C. Megaworld Construction and Development Corporation v. Parada</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the Court held that <b>to constitute novation by substitution of debtor, the former debtor must be expressly released</b> from the obligation and the third person or new debtor must assume the former's place in the contractual relations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Moreover, the Court ruled that the "fact that the creditor accepts payments from a third person, who has assumed the obligation, <b><u>will result merely in the addition of debtors and not novation</u></b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> At its core, novation is never presumed, and the <i>animus novandi</i>, whether totally or partially, must appear by express agreement of the parties, or by their acts that are too clear and unequivocal to be mistaken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Here, the intent to novate was not satisfactorily proven by respondent. At best, petitioner only manifested her desire to shoulder the debt of her parents, which, as above-discussed, does not amount to novation. Thus, the courts <i>a quo</i> erred in holding petitioner liable for the debts obtained by her deceased parents on account of novation by substitution of the debtor.<br><br>Similarly, both courts faultily concluded that the principal sum loaned by petitioner and her deceased parents amounted to P2,000,000.00 and the P100,000.00 was added as interest because petitioner undertook to pay the loan in installments.<br><br>It is fundamental that for monetary interest to be due, there must be an express written agreement therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Article 1956 of the Civil Code provides that "<u><b>[n]o interest shall be due unless it has been expressly stipulated in writing</b></u>." In this relation, case law states that the lack of a written stipulation to pay interest on the loaned amount bars a creditor from charging monetary interest<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and the collection of interest without any stipulation therefor in writing is prohibited by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Here, respondent herself admitted that there was no written agreement that interest would be due on the sum loaned, only that there was an implicit understanding that the same would be subject to interest since she also borrowed the same from banks which, as a matter of course, charged interest. Respondent also testified on cross examination that the P2,100,000.00 corresponds only to the principal and does not include interest, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2"><div align="justify">[Atty.
