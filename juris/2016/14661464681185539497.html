Santos, Sr., Miguel Santos, Efren U. Santos, Ric U. Santos, Simon Marce, Jr., Joel F. Salinel, Bebiana San Pedro, and Marina Santos against petitioners Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc. and Shell Philippines Exploration B.V.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The Court of Appeals remanded the case to Branch 72 of the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City, which had earlier dismissed the Complaint for damages on the grounds of <i>litis pendentia</i>, failure to state a cause of action, and lack of cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>With respect to Tomas M. Fredeluces, the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the Complaint on the ground of lack of cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 87, otherwise known as the Oil Exploration and Development Act of 1972, the Republic of the Philippines entered into Service Contract No. 38 and engaged the services of Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. "for the exploration, development[,] and production of petroleum resources in an . . . area offshore northwest of . . . Palawan[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The service contractors eventually discovered in offshore Malampaya-Camago at least 2.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas deposits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Exploration and development of the Malampaya-Camago natural gas reservoir required the construction and operation of a shallow water platform off the coast of Palawan. The water platform further required a concrete gravity structure that would sit on the seabed, and a topside or the platform's deck which would sit on top of the concrete gravity structure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The topside was constructed in Singapore. As for the concrete gravity structure, Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. searched for possible construction sites here in the Philippines. Subsequently identified as a possible construction site was Subic, Zambales, and Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. met with representatives of the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority proposed a 40-hectare site in Sitio Agusuhin as a possible construction site for the concrete gravity structure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The site formed part of the military reservation of the former naval base of the United States in Subic, which, under Republic Act No. 7227,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> became part of the Subic Special Economic Zone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Results of a socio-economic survey commissioned by Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. showed that there were about 200 households living at or near the proposed construction site. Together with the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc., Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. established contact with the occupants of Sitio Agusuhin. It was ultimately determined that 80 households would have to be relocated to nearby areas within the Subic Seaport Economic Free Zone to carry out the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In May 1998, the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority and Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. entered into a Lease and Development Agreement for the construction of the concrete gravity structure in Sitio Agusuhin. The Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority undertook to relocate the affected households, while Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. undertook to give financial assistance to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The undertakings of Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. were implemented through Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc. By the end of May 1998, Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc. concluded agreements with some of the affected households. In exchange for financial assistance, some of the claimants voluntarily dismantled their houses and relocated to nearby areas within the Subic Seaport Economic Free Zone. Other claims, however, were denied by Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. for the claimant's failure to show that he or she resided in Sitio Agusuhin prior to the construction project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>With the assistance of the Subic Sangguniang Bayan, a Compensation Community Relations Study Group was organized to re-evaluate the claims that had been previously denied by Shell Philippines Exploration B.V.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In the meantime, the construction of the concrete gravity structure was completed, and the shallow water platform was successfully installed in Palawan on June 2, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. turned over Sitio Agusuhin to the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority, cleared, leveled, and elevated, together with improvements "consisting of a finger pier, a fence and gate, a drainage system[,] and a berthing facility for ferry sea crafts or similar vessels along the southern bank of the basin."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On December 1, 2000, a Complaint for damages was filed against Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc. before the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Tomas M. Fredeluces, Marcos B. Corpuz, Jr., Reynaldo M. Samonte, Norma M. Samonte, Ambrocio Villanueva, Salvacion A. Bon, Ramiro A. Bon, Luzviminda B. Andillo, Ludivico F. Bon, Elmo Areglo, Rose A. San Pedro, Dante U. Santos, Sr., Miguel Santos, Efren U. Santos, Ric U. Santos, Simon Marce, Jr., Joel F. Salinel, Bebiana San Pedro, and Marina Santos (Fredeluces, et al.) alleged that having resided in the area even prior to 1998, they were lawful residents of Sitio Agusuhin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> They allegedly constructed their houses and introduced improvements in Sitio Agusuhin, such as fruit trees and other seasonal plants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>However, "[f]or the direct benefit of the defendants [Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc.],"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Fredeluces, et al. were "effectively evicted"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> from their homes in "total disregard"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of their rights. Admitting that some of the claimants were given financial assistance, Fredeluces, et al. alleged that the amounts given were "insufficient to compensate the damages they sustained[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Worse, they were allegedly "pressured, coerced or . . . 'sweet talked'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> into signing quitclaims and waivers.<br><br>"In arbitrarily and unlawfully evicting [Fredeluces, et al.] from their place of abode and livelihood,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc. allegedly failed to act with justice, "did not give . . . [Fredeluces, et al.] their due[,] and acted in bad faith."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The actions of Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc. were allegedly contrary to law, for which they should pay Fredeluces, et al. the following amounts representing actual damages:<br><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="50%">1.

Santos, Sr., Efren U. Santos, Miguel Santos, Ric U. Santos, and Bebiana San Pedro—earlier filed against them a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> for sum of money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> This Complaint, filed on October 9, 2000 also before the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City, allegedly prayed for payment of disturbance compensation for their eviction from Sitio Agusuhin for the construction of the concrete gravity structure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc. argued that the Complaint for sum of money and the Complaint for damages had substantially similar causes of action and relief sought, rendering the subsequently filed Complaint for damages dismissible on the ground of <i>litis pendentia</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>According to Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc., Fredeluces, et al. were praying for payment of damages corresponding to the value of the land they previously occupied, a right that did not belong to them because they never owned the land in Sitio Agusuhin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc. emphasized that Sitio Agusuhin belonged to the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority pursuant to Republic Act No. 7227; hence, lands in Sitio Agusuhin are government property not subject to private ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> In addition, Fredeluces, et al.'s claims for the value of the improvements they introduced in Sitio Agusuhin were allegedly paid as evidenced by the quitclaims they had signed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Consequently, the Complaint for damages failed to state a cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>With respect to Tomas M. Fredeluces and Ludivico F. Bon, Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, inc. alleged that these plaintiffs never resided in Sitio Agusuhin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Tomas M. Fredeluces and Ludivico F. Bon were not entitled to any compensation and, therefore, lacked a cause of action against Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Fredeluces, et al. opposed the Motion to Dismiss and prayed for its denial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> In their Opposition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Fredeluces, et al. argued that Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc., in filing their Motion to Dismiss, hypothetically admitted the factual allegations in their Complaint. Corollarily, the trial court may not inquire into the truth of the allegations and may only resolve the Motion to Dismiss based on the facts as alleged in the Complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Countering the first ground of the Motion to Dismiss, Dante U. Santos, Efren U. Santos, Miguel Santos, Ric U. Santos, and Bebiana San Pedro claimed that they were not aware of their inclusion as plaintiffs in the earlier filed Complaint for sum of money. In any case, they had allegedly revoked the Special Power of Attorney that they executed in favor of Atty. Renato H. Collado before the lawyer filed the Complaint for sum of money on their behalf. It follows that the Complaint for sum of money was filed without their authority and should be deemed not to have been filed. <i>Litis pendentia</i>, therefore, should not apply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Fredeluces, et al. expressly admitted that they never owned Sitio Agusuhin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Nevertheless, they contended that they "were peacefully settled in the area and [had] introduced improvements"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> when Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc. "summarily evicted"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> them. It is for their "unlawful eviction"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> from, not ownership of, Sitio Agusuhin for which Fredeluces, et al. demand payment of damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Although admitting that they executed quitclaims in favor of Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc., Fredeluces, et al. specifically alleged that they were pressured, coerced, or "sweet-talked" into signing them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> In effect, Fredeluces, et al. assailed the validity of these quitclaims for lack of consent, an issue requiring the presentation of evidence during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Fredeluces, et al. similarly argued that the issue of residence of Tomas M. Fredeluces and Ludivico F. Bon required the presentation of evidence during trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>On April 20, 2001, the Motion to Dismiss was heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Subsequently, in the Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> dated June 7, 2001, Branch 72 of the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City granted the Motion to Dismiss and ruled in favor of Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Between the Complaint for sum of money and the Complaint for damages, the trial court found identity of parties, causes of action, and reliefs sought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> The trial court said that Dante U. Santos, Efren U. Santos, Miguel Santos, Ric U. Santos, and Bebiana San Pedro "cannot feign ignorance that they were not aware that they were included as party plaintiffs in the [Complaint for sum of money]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> because "they actively secured copies of . . . Certificates of Occupancy"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> in Sitio Agusuhin, which were annexed to the earlier filed Complaint.<br><br>The trial court likewise held that the Complaint for damages failed to state a cause of action. According to the trial court, Fredeluces, et al. based the amount of actual damages they sought on the fair market values of the parcels of land they occupied and of the improvements introduced on the property. Fredeluces, et al. effectively prayed for payment of just compensation, a relief they cannot avail themselves of because they do not own the land in Sitio Agusuhin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>As for the quitclaims, the trial court held that they were valid since Fredeluces, et al. voluntarily executed them. Fredeluces, et al. even voluntarily vacated Sitio Agusuhin after they received financial assistance from Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>In resolving the issue of whether Tomas M. Fredeluces and Ludivico F. Bon were former residents of Sitio Agusuhin, the trial court relied on the Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> of a certain Robert Hadji (Hadji), a former resident of Sitio Agusuhin and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc.'s Community Coordinator in the site. Hadji stated in his Affidavit that Tomas M. Fredeluces and Ludivico F. Bon never resided in Sitio Agusuhin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> While the resolution of the issue would generally require presentation of evidence during trial, the trial court said that Fredeluces, et al. did not even bother to attend the hearing of the Motion to Dismiss on April 20, 2001 to present evidence contrary to the allegations of Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Failing to present such contrary evidence, Tomas M. Fredeluces and Ludivico F. Bon should be deemed non-residents of Sitio Agusuhin and, therefore, were not entitled to any compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Order dated June 7, 2001 reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Motion to Dismiss filed by the defendants dated April 5, 2001 is hereby granted. The case is ordered DISMISSED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br></blockquote>Fredeluces, et al. filed a Notice of Appeal before the Court of Appeals on June 28, 2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> The parties subsequently filed their respective appeal briefs,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> both reiterating the arguments they had made before the trial court.<br><br>In contrast with the trial court, the Court of Appeals appreciated in evidence a Revocation of Special Power of Attorney allegedly executed by Dante U. Santos, Efren U. Santos, Miguel Santos, Ric U. Santos, and Bebiana San Pedro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> The Complaint for sum of money was, thus, filed without their authority, and there was no <i>litis pendentia</i> so as to bar the filing of the Complaint for damages on December 1, 2000.<br><br>Despite Fredeluces, et al.'s admission that they did not own the parcels of land they occupied in Sitio Agusuhin, the Court of Appeals nonetheless held that Fredeluces, et al. may file a complaint for damages for having been "adversely affected by [Shell Philippines Exploration B.V.'s] construction works."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Fredeluces, et al. may likewise repudiate the quitclaims they executed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>As to the issue of residence, the Court of Appeals found that Ludivico F. Bon formerly resided in Sitio Agusuhin. The Court of Appeals relied on the Report submitted by the Compensation Community Relations Study Group where Ludivico F. Bon was listed as one of the beneficiaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> As for Tomas M. Fredeluces, he was not listed on the Report; thus, he was not entitled to any financial assistance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>Thus, the Court of Appeals partially granted the appeal in the Decision dated January 25, 2006, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, except with respect to appellant Tomas Fredeluces, appellants' complaint is ordered <b>REINSTATED</b> and the case is, accordingly, <b>REMANDED</b> to the trial court for further proceedings.<br><br><b>SO . . . .<br><br>. . . . ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. and Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc. filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration and/or Clarification,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> which the Court of Appeals denied in the Resolution dated August 16, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Assailing the Court of Appeals' January 25, 2006 Decision and August 16, 2006 Resolution, petitioners Pilipinas Shell Foundation, Inc. and Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Respondents Tomas M.
