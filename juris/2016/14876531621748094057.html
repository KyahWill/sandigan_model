It does not purport to be a demand for payment of tax due, which a final assessment notice should supposedly be. An assessment, in the context of the National Internal Revenue Code, is a "written notice and demand made by the [Bureau of Internal Revenue] on the taxpayer for the settlement of a due tax liability that is there definitely set and fixed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> Although the disputed notice provides for the computations of respondent's tax liability, the amount remains indefinite. It only provides that the tax due is still subject to modification, depending on the date of payment. Thus:<br><blockquote>The complete details covering the aforementioned discrepancies established during the investigation of this case are shown in the accompanying Annex 1 of this Notice. The 50% surcharge and 20% interest have been imposed pursuant to Sections 248 and 249 (B) of the [National Internal Revenue Code], as amended.

This negates petitioner's demand for payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> Petitioner's contention that April 15, 2004 should be regarded as the actual due date cannot be accepted. The last paragraph of the Final Assessment Notice states that the due dates for payment were supposedly reflected in the attached assessment:<br><blockquote>In view thereof, you are <i>requested to pay</i> your aforesaid deficiency internal revenue tax liabilities through the duly authorized agent bank in which ou are enrolled <i>within the time shown in the enclosed assessment notice</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>However, based on the findings of the Court of Tax Appeals First Division, the enclosed assessment pertained to remained unaccomplished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br><br>Contrary to petitioner's view, April 15, 2004 was the reckoning date of accrual of penalties and surcharges and not the due date for payment of tax liabilities.
