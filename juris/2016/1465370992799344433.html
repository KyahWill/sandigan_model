Petitioner is liable for the non-remittance of the contributions to GSIS and Pag-IBIG Fund.<br><br>Petitioner's liability for the non-remittance to GSIS and Pag-IBIG Fund of the employer's share in the contributions is clearly set out in the laws mandating the collection and remittance of the premiums:<br><br><blockquote><u><b>Republic Act No. 8291, Sec. 52 (g):</b></u><br><br>I.

When the offender is a corporation, public or private, the penalty shall be imposed upon the members of the governing board and the President or General Manager without prejudice to the prosecution of related offenses under the Revised Penal Code and other laws, revocation and denial of operating rights and privileges in the Philippines and deportation when the offender is a foreigner. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In both cases, petitioner was informed of the underpayment or non-remittance of premiums for a period of one (1) year and six (6) months, or from January 1997 to June 1998.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Petitioner failed to heed the letters and billing statements, which asked him, as head of DAR-ARMM, to pay the deficiencies.<br><br>The importance of the GSIS and the Pag-IBIG Fund cannot be underscored enough. "The GSIS was created for the purpose of providing social security and insurance benefits as well as promoting efficiency and the welfare of government employees."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> To this end, the state has adopted a policy of maintaining and preserving the actuarial solvency of GSIS funds at all times.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The fund comes from both member and employer contributions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Hence, non-remittance of the contributions threatens the actuarial solvency of the fund.<br><br>In the same vein, the Pag-IBIG Fund was established pursuant to "constitutional mandates on the promotion of public welfare through ample social services, as well as its humanist commitment to the interest of the working groups, in relation particularly to their need for decent shelter."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> This continued commitment to social justice and national development through the establishment, development, promotion, and integration of a sound and viable tax-exempt mutual provident savings system for the working peoples' housing needs, with the mandatory contributory support of the employers, is seen in the subsequent amendments to the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Failure of the employer to remit its share of the contributions jeopardizes the peoples' needs and rights to decent shelter or housing.<br><br>We cannot accept petitioner's argument that the duty to remit the required amounts falls to his co-accused. Republic Act No. 8291, Section 52(g) clearly provides that heads of agencies or branches of government shall be criminally liable for the failure, refusal, or delay in the payment, turnover, and remittance or delivery of such accounts to the GSIS.<br><br>Similarly, the refusal or failure without lawful cause or with fraudulent intent to comply with the provisions of Republic Act No. 7742, with respect to the collection and remittance of employee savings as well as the required employer contributions to the Pag-IBIG Fund, subjects the employer to criminal liabilities such as the payment of a fine, imprisonment, or both.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Indeed, non-remittance of GSIS and Pag-IBIG Fund premiums is criminally punishable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>When an act is<i> malum prohibitum,</i> "[i]t is the commission of that act as defined by the law, and not the character or effect thereof, that determines whether or not the provision has been violated."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In <i>ABS-CBN Corp. v. Gozon</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> we discussed the difference between acts <i>mala prohibita</i> and <i>mala in se</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The general rule is that acts punished under a special law are <i>malum prohibitum.</i> "An act which is declared <i>malum prohibitum, </i>malice or criminal intent is completely immaterial."<br><br>In contrast, crimes<i> mala in se</i> concern inherently immoral acts:<br><blockquote>Not every criminal act, however, involves moral turpitude. It is for this reason that "as to what crime involves moral turpitude, is for the Supreme Court to determine." In resolving the foregoing question, the Court is guided by one of the general rules that crimes <i>mala in se</i> involve moral turpitude, while crimes mala prohibita do not, the rationale of which was set forth in "<i>Zari v. Flores</i>," to wit:<br><blockquote><i>It (moral turpitude) implies something immoral in itself, regardless of the fact that it is punishable by law or not. It must not be merely mala prohibita, but the act itself must be inherently immoral. The doing of the act itself, and not its prohibition by statute fixes the moral turpitude.</i> Moral turpitude does not, however, include such acts as are not of themselves immoral but whose illegality lies in their being positively prohibited.</blockquote><br>[These] guidelines nonetheless proved short of providing a clear-cut solution, for in <i>International Rice Research Institute v. NLRC,</i> the Court admitted that it cannot always be ascertained whether moral turpitude does or does not exist by merely classifying a crime as <i>malum in se</i> or as<i> malum prohibitum.</i> There are crimes which are <i>mala in se </i>and yet but rarely involve moral turpitude and there are crimes which involve moral turpitude and are <i>mala prohibita </i>only. In the final analysis, whether or not a crime involves moral turpitude is ultimately a question of fact and frequently depends on all the circumstances surrounding the violation of the statue.</blockquote><br>"Implicit in the concept of <i>mala in se</i> is that of <i>mens rea</i>." <i>Mens rea</i> is defined as "the nonphysical element which, combined with the act of the accused, makes up the crime charged. Most frequently it is the criminal intent, or the guilty mind[.]"<br><br>Crimes<i> mala in se </i>presuppose that the person who did the felonious act had criminal intent to do so, while crimes <i>mala prohibita</i> do not require knowledge or criminal intent:<br><br>In the case of <i>mala in se it is necessary, to constitute a punishable offense, for the person doing the act to have knowledge of the nature of his act and to have a criminal intent; in the case of mala prohibita, unless such words as "knowingly" and "willfully" are contained in the statute, neither knowledge nor criminal intent is necessary.</i> In other words, a person morally quite innocent and with every intention of being a law-abiding citizen becomes a criminal, and liable to criminal penalties, if he does an act prohibited by these statutes.<br><br>Hence, "<i>[i]ntent to commit the crime and intent to perpetrate the act must be distinguished.</i> A person may not have consciously intended to commit a crime; but he did intend to commit an act, and that act is, by the very nature of things, the crime itself[.]" When an act is prohibited by a special law, it is considered injurious to public welfare, and the performance of the prohibited act is the crime itself.<br><br>Volition, or intent to commit the act, is different from criminal intent. Volition or voluntariness refers to knowledge of the act being done. On the other hand, criminal intent — which is different from motive, or the moving power for the commission of the crime — refers to the state of mind beyond voluntariness. It is this intent that is being punished by crimes <i>mala in se</i>.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[52]</sup></font> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>The non-remittance of GSIS and Pag-IBIG Fund premiums is <i>malum prohibitum.</i> What the relevant laws punish is the failure, refusal, or delay without lawful or justifiable cause in remitting or paying the required contributions or accounts.<br><br>In<i> Saguin v.

However, the petitioners in <i>Saguin</i> were justified in not remitting the premiums on time as the hospital they were working in devolved to the provincial government and there was confusion as to who had the duty to remit.<br><br>In this case, however, petitioner failed to prove a justifiable cause for his failure to remit the premiums. We cannot subscribe to petitioner's defense that the funds for the remittances were not directly credited to DAR-ARMM but to the account of the Office of the Regional Governor of the ARMM, which had the obligation to remit to the various line agencies of the ARMM the specific amounts provided to them.<br><br>As the Sandiganbayan found from the testimonies of the witnesses and evidence on record, the amounts meant for remittance to GSIS and Pag-IBIG Fund were indeed deposited into the bank account maintained by DAR-ARMM for its Fund 101.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> It is settled that factual findings of the trial court are entitled to respect and finality unless it is shown that such findings are patently misplaced or without any basis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Hence, petitioner's duty to ensure the remittance of the amounts to GSIS and Pag-IBIG Fund was triggered by the availability of the funds in DAR-ARMM's account.<br><br>In the assailed Decision, the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. 26707, for the failure to remit the GSIS premium contributions, sentenced petitioner to suffer the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from one (1) year as minimum to three (3) years as maximum, and to pay a fine of P20,000.00.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[56]</sup></font> He was also sentenced to suffer absolute perpetual disqualification from holding public office and from practicing any profession or calling licensed by government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> In Criminal Case No. 26708, for the non-remittance of the employer's share to the contributions to the Pag-IBIG Fund, petitioner was sentenced to pay a fine of P190,506.00 as well as a penalty of three percent (3%) per month of the amounts payable computed from the date the contributions fell due and until these were paid.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Under the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the basic goal is "to uplift and redeem valuable human material, and prevent unnecessary and excessive deprivation of personal liberty and economic usefulness[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> However, it has also been held that "penalties shall not be standardized but fitted as far as is possible to the individual, with due regard to the imperative necessity of protecting the social order."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Hence, this Court must look at certain factors when imposing penalties:<br><br><blockquote><i>Considering the criminal as an individual</i>, some of the factors that should be considered are: (1) His age, especially with reference to extreme youth or old age; (2) his general health and physical condition; (3) his mentality, heredity and personal habits; (4) his previous conduct, environment and mode of life (and criminal record if any); (5) his previous education, both intellectual and moral; (6) his proclivities and aptitudes for usefulness or injury to society; (7) his demeanor during trial and his attitude with regard to the crime committed; (8) the manner and circumstances in which the crime was committed; (9) the gravity of the offense (note that section 2 of Act No. 4103 excepts certain grave crimes — this should be kept in mind in assessing the minimum penalties for analogous crimes).<br><br>In <i>considering the criminal as a member of society</i>, his relationship, first, toward his dependents, family and associates and their relationship with him, and second, his relationship towards society at large and the State are important factors. The State is concerned not only in the imperative necessity of protecting the social organization against the criminal acts of destructive individuals but also in redeeming the individual for economic usefulness and other social ends. In a word, the Indeterminate Sentence Law aims to individualize the administration of our criminal law to a degree not heretofore known in these Islands. With the foregoing principles in mind as guides, the courts can give full effect to the beneficent intention of the Legislature.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>With these factors in mind, we find that the penalty imposed on petitioner should be modified.

Public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives. Public servants must bear in mind this constitutional mandate at all times to guide them in their actions during their entire tenure in the government service. "The good of the service and the degree of morality which every official and employee in the public service must observe, if respect and confidence are to be maintained by the Government in the enforcement of the law, demand that no untoward conduct on his part, affecting morality, integrity and efficiency while holding office should be left without proper and commensurate sanction, all attendant circumstances taken into account."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Under Section 52(g) of Republic Act No. 8291, the penalty that can be imposed upon petitioner is "imprisonment of not less than one (1) year nor more than five (5) years and a fine of not less than Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) nor more than Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00)." The accused shall suffer absolute perpetual disqualification from holding public office and from practicing any profession or calling licensed by the government.<br><br>For violations of Rule XIII, Section 1 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 7742, the imposable penalty is "a fine of not less but not more than twice the amount involved or imprisonment of not more than six (6) years; or both such fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the court, apart from the civil liabilities and/or obligations of the offender or delinquent employer."<br><br>Considering petitioner's position and his actions of trying to pass the blame to his co-accused, we modify petitioner's sentence of imprisonment in Criminal Case No. 26707 to a minimum of three (3) years to a maximum of five (5) years. Accordingly, in Criminal Case No. 26708, petitioner is sentenced to suffer imprisonment of three (3) to six (6) years in addition to the fine imposed by the Sandiganbayan.
