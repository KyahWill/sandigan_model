They also cited the case of <i>Amoves v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal, et al</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> where the Court declared that Villanueva, CIBAC National Council's President, was ineligible to hold office as a member of the House of Representatives representing the CIBAC Party-list.<br><br>Thus, Rivera and Luis sought to nullify the following resolutions of the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> in connection with the May 2013 elections:<br><br><ol><li>NBOC Resolution No. 0011-13<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> dated June 5, 2013, ordering the issuance of a Certificate of Canvass and Proclamation to the CIBAC Party-List, and recognizing its legitimate nominees as follows:<br><blockquote>• Sherwin N.

No. 213069, arguing in the main that the CIBAC National Council lost its legal existence following the registration of CIBAC with the SEC as CIBAC Foundation by reason of which it is now governed by a BOT. By recognizing the nominees of CIBAC National Council, CIBAC Foundation insists that the COMELEC unlawfully deprived it of its right and authority to represent CIBAC in Congress.<br><br>Thus, CIBAC Foundation raised the issue of whether they are the rightful and legitimate representatives of CIBAC Party-List in the 16<sup>th</sup> Congress.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>As a factual backdrop, Villanueva's group, representing CIBAC National Council, first sought registration in November 2000 with the COMELEC as a multi-sectoral party-list organization for the May 2001 elections. Under its Constitution and By-Laws,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the CIBAC National Council is the governing body empowered to formulate the policies, plans, and programs of CIBAC and to issue decisions and resolutions binding on party members and officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>CIBAC's registration, participation in the May 2001 elections, and eventual proclamation as a winner, was hounded by controversy after the COMELEC ruled that it did not belong to any marginalized sectoral group. In <i>Ang Bagong Bayani-OFW Labor Party v. COMELEC</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) directing the COMELEC to refrain from proclaiming the winners in the May 2001 party-list elections, which included CIBAC. In the subsequent Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> dated June 26, 2001, the Court reiterated the TRO but ordered the COMELEC to immediately conduct summary evidentiary hearings on the qualifications of the party-list participants in light of the guidelines laid down therein.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In its first compliance report, the COMELEC excluded CIBAC from the qualified party-list groups. The Court, however, issued a Resolution dated January 29, 2002, qualifying CIBAC and lifted the TRO to enable the COMELEC to proclaim CIBAC, whose nominee was Villanueva, as one of the party-list winners. This was reiterated in the Court's Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated June 25, 2003 as follows:<br><br><blockquote>[W]e accept Comelec's submission, per the OSG, that APEC and CIBAC have sufficiently met the 8-point guidelines of this Court and have garnered sufficient votes to entitle them to seats in Congress. Since these issues are factual in character, we are inclined to adopt the Commission's findings, absent any patent arbitrariness or abuse or negligence in its action. There is no substantial proof that CIBAC is merely an arm of JIL, or that APEC is an extension of PHILRECA. The OSG explained that these are separate entities with separate memberships. Although APEC's nominees are all professionals, its membership is composed not only of professionals but also of peasants, elderly, youth and women. Equally important, APEC addresses the issues of job creation, poverty alleviation and lack of electricity. Likewise, CIBAC is composed of the underrepresented and marginalized and is concerned with their welfare. CIBAC is particularly interested in the youth and professional sectors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The Court also subsequently lifted the TRO against the proclamation of CIBAC's additional nominee since it garnered 4.96% of the votes cast, entitling it to two seats in the House of Representatives.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Interestingly, the present case is a virtual reprise of<i> Lokin, Jr., et al. v. COMELEC, et al</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> which was invoked by the COMELEC in the assailed NBOC Resolution No. 0011-13.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>By way of background, the same two contending entities as above, each claiming to represent CIBAC, filed with the COMELEC a "Manifestation of Intent to Participate in the Party-List System of Representation in the May 10, 2010 Elections." The first Manifestation,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> filed on November 20, 2009, was signed by Derla, who claimed to be CIBAC's acting Secretary-General, according to an authority granted by the BOT of CIBAC Foundation. However, at 1:30 p.m. of the same day, another Manifestation was submitted by Gonzales and Virginia Jose (Jose), CIBAC's Vice-President and Secretary-General, respectively, by authority of the CIBAC National Council.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Claiming that the nomination of Luis and Teresita F. Planas was unauthorized, Villanueva's group filed with the COMELEC a <i>Petition to Expunge From The Records And/Or For Disqualification</i>, seeking to nullify the Certificate of Nomination filed by Derla. They contended that: (1) Derla misrepresented herself as "acting secretary-general" since she was not even a member of CIBAC; (2) the Certificate of Nomination and other documents she submitted were unauthorized by the party; and (3) it was Villanueva who was duly authorized to file the Certificate of Nomination on its behalf.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The COMELEC First Division granted the petition, ordered the Certificate of Nomination filed by Derla expunged from the records, and declared Villanueva's group's nominees as the legitimate nominees of CIBAC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> On motion for reconsideration, the COMELEC<i> en banc </i>in a <i>per curiam</i> Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> dated August 31, 2010 affirmed the First Division's findings, reiterating that Derla was unable to prove her authority to file the said Certificate, whereas Villanueva presented overwhelming evidence that CIBAC Secretary General Jose was duly deputized to submit the Certificate of Nomination pursuant to CIBAC's Constitution and by-laws.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>On petition for <i>certiorari</i> to this Court, Maria Blanca's group insisted that it was CIBAC Foundation which participated in the party-list elections in the 2004 and 2007, not the CIBAC National Council, which had become defunct since 2003, the year when CIBAC Foundation was registered with the SEC. Villanueva's group countered that CIBAC Foundation was established solely for the purpose of acting as CIBAC's legal and financial arm, as provided in the party's Constitution and by-laws, and never to substitute for, or oust CIBAC, the party-list itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The Court affirmed the COMELEC's ruling that the nominees of Villanueva's group were the legitimate CIBAC nominees. The Court's decision became final and executory on October 20, 2012, thereby settling with finality the question of who are the true nominees of CIBAC Party-List. Significantly, the Court expressly ruled that the BOT of CIBAC Foundation and its acting Secretary-General Derla, were not affiliated with the CIBAC multi-sectoral party, which is registered with COMELEC, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>[Derla], who is not even a member of CIBAC, is thus a virtual stranger to the party-list, and clearly not qualified to attest to petitioners [Luis and Teresita F. Planas] as CIBAC nominees, or certify their nomination to the COMELEC. <u><b>Petitioners cannot use their registration with the SEC as a substitute for the evidentiary requirement to show that the nominees, including Derla, are bona fide members of the party</b></u>. Petitioners Planas and [Luis] have not even presented evidence proving the affiliation of the so-called [BOT] to the CIBAC Sectoral Party that is registered with COMELEC.<br><br><u>Petitioners cannot draw authority from the [BOT] of the SEC-registered entity, because the Constitution of CIBAC expressly mandates that <b>it is the National Council, as the governing body of CIBAC, that has the power to formulate the policies, plans, and programs of the Party, and to issue decisions and resolutions binding on party members and officers.</b> Contrary to petitioners' allegations, <b>the National Council of CIBAC has not become defunct, and has certainly not been replaced by the [BOT] of the SEC-registered entity</b></u>. The COMELEC carefully perused the documents of the organization and outlined the process followed by the National Council before it complied with its task of choosing the party's nominees. This was based on the "Minutes of Meeting of CIBAC Party-List National Council" held on 12 November 2009, which respondents attached to their Memorandum.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> (Citations omitted and emphasis and underscoring ours)<br></blockquote><br>The Court also reiterated that the COMELEC's jurisdiction to settle the struggle for leadership within the party is well established, emanating from one of its constitutional functions, under Article IX-C, Section 2, Paragraph 5, of the 1987 Constitution, which is to "register, after sufficient publication, political parties, organizations, or coalitions which, in addition to other requirements, must present their platform or program of government," and that this singular power of COMELEC to rule upon questions of party identity and leadership is an incident to its enforcement powers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>The Court reiterates, then, that: (1) the petitioners have shown no evidence of the affiliation of the BOT of CIBAC Foundation to the CIBAC sectoral party which is registered with the COMELEC; (2) it is the CIBAC National Council, the COMELEC-registered governing body of CIBAC under its Constitution, which is empowered to formulate its policies, plans, and programs, and to issue decisions and resolutions binding on party members and officers; and (3) the CIBAC National Council alone can authorize the party's participation in party-list elections and the submission of its nominees. Thus, in view of CIBAC's subsisting registration with the COMELEC as a multi-sectoral organization, CIBAC National Council has not become defunct or non-existent, nor replaced by the BOT of the SEC-registered entity, CIBAC Foundation, whose registration with the SEC will not <i>per se</i> dispense with the evidentiary requirement under R.A. No. 7941 that its nominees must be <i>bona fide</i> members and nominees of the party.<br><br>The petitioners erred in citing the <i>consolidated Lokin Case</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> In the said case, CIBAC manifested its intent to participate in the May 2007 synchronized national and local elections through Villanueva, and submitted a Certificate of Nomination containing five nominees for representatives, namely: Villanueva, Luis, Gonzales, Tugna and Emil L. Galang (Galang). However, Villanueva filed a "Certificate of Nomination, Substitution and Amendment" whereby CIBAC withdrew the nominations of Luis, Tugna and Galang and substituted Armi Jane R. Borje (Borje) as its third and last nominee. With CIBAC having won two seats, Villanueva transmitted to then COMELEC Chairman Benjamin Abalos the signed petitions of 81% of CIBAC members confirming the withdrawal of the nomination of Luis, Tugna and Galang and the substitution of Borje. The COMELEC en bane accepted CIBAC's amended list of nominees, and Gonzales took her oath of office as CIBAC's second party-list representative.<br><br>Thus, what was at issue in the <i>consolidated Lokin case</i> was not whether the CIBAC National Council, headed by Villanueva, could no longer represent CIBAC in the COMELEC for purposes of party-list elections, but whether the withdrawal by Villanueva, as CIBAC President, of the nomination of Luis in favor of a new list of nominees was valid. The Court ruled that: (1) Villanueva's act was contrary to Section 8<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> of R.A. No. 7941, which requires the submission, not later than 45 days before the election, of a list of not less than five (5) nominees; and (2) Section 13 of Resolution No. 7804, containing the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 7941 issued by the COMELEC, invalidly expanded the exceptions in Section 8 of R.A. No. 7941 for the substitution of nominees.<br><br>Lastly, the petitioners invoke <i>Amores</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> where it was declared that Villanueva was ineligible to hold office as a member of the House of Representatives representing the youth sector of CIBAC. The subject of the case was NBOC Resolution No. 07-60 dated July 9, 2007, where the COMELEC partially proclaimed CIBAC as a winner in the May 2007 elections, along with other party-list organizations. The Court found that at the time of the filing of his certificates of nomination and acceptance, Villanueva was already 31 years old and beyond the age limit of 30 provided under Section 9 of R.A. No. 7941, and that his change of affiliation from CIBAC's youth sector to its overseas Filipino workers and their families sector was not effected at least six months prior to the May 2007 elections, in violation of Section 15 of R.A. No. 7941.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Court also clarified that NBOC Resolution No. 07-60 was not a proclamation of Villanueva himself, but of CIBAC as one of the party-list winners, since Section 13 of R.A. No. 7941 separately provides that, "[p]arty-list representatives shall be proclaimed by the COMELEC based on the list of names submitted by the respective parties, organizations, or coalitions to the COMELEC according to their ranking in said list."<br><br>Concerning now the <i>quo warranto</i> petition, G.R. No. 213069, of CIBAC Foundation, the Court reminds the petitioners that under Section 17 of Article IV of the 1987 Constitution, the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of the Members of the House of Representatives is the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET). Section 17 reads:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 17</b>. The Senate and the House of Representatives shall each have an Electoral Tribunal which shall be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of their respective Members, x x x.</blockquote><br>Because the nominees of CIBAC National Council, Tugna and Gonzales, assumed their seats in Congress on June 26, 2013 and July 22, 2013, respectively, G.R. No. 213069 should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. It should be noted that since they had been already proclaimed, the jurisdiction to resolve all election contests lies with the HRET as it is the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of its Members.<br><br>In a long line of cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and more recently in <i>Reyes v. COMELEC, et al</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the Court has held that once a winning candidate has been proclaimed, taken his oath, and assumed office as Member of the House of Representatives, the COMELEC's jurisdiction over election contests relating to his election, returns, and qualifications ends, and the HRET's own jurisdiction begins. Since the nominees of CIBAC National Council have already assumed their seats in Congress, the <i>quo warranto</i> petition should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petitions are <b>DISMISSED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.J., Carpio, Leonardo-De Castro, Brion, Peralta, Bersamin, Del Castillo, Perez, Mendoza, Reyes,</i> and <i>Perlas-Bernabe, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Velasco, Jr., J.</i>, pls. see concurring opinion.<br><i>Leonen, J.</i>, see separate concurring and dissenting opinion.<br><i>Jardeleza, J.</i>, no part prior action Sol Gen. <br><i>Caguioa, J.</i>, no part due to relationship to a party.<br><br><br><hr align="CENTER" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><br><br><b><center>NOTICE OF JUDGMENT</center></b><br><br>Sirs/Mesdames:<br><br>Please take notice that on <u> April 19, 2016</u> a <u>Decision</u>/Resolution, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on June 20, 2016 at 3:00 p.m.<br><br><center>Very truly yours,<br><br><b>(SGD)<br>FELIPA G.

It is petitioners' contention that the CIBAC National Council has become defunct, having been replaced by the Board of Trustees (BOT) of the CIBAC Foundation, Inc. registered with the SEC. They then argue that it is CIBAC Foundation's own list that ought to be considered by the COMELEC as CIBAC party-list's nominees.<br><br>I agree with the <i>ponencia</i> that the extant case is but a reprise of G.R. No. 193808, which the Court had resolved on June 26, 2012.1 Petitioners are, therefore, estopped by <i>res judicata</i> from re-litigating in G.R. No. 210273 the settled facts and issues in G.R. No. 193808.<br><br><i>Res judicata</i> embraces two concepts: bar by prior judgment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and by conclusiveness of judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> For the legal principle to apply, the following elements must concur: (1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be as between the first and second action, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. Anent the fourth element, <i>res judicata</i> in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment only requires the identity of parties and issues, not necessarily of the causes of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment prescribes that a fact or question settled by final judgment or order binds the parties to that action, persons in privity with them, and their successors-in-interest, and continues to bind them while the judgment or order remains standing and unreversed by proper authority. The conclusively settled fact or question cannot again be litigated in any future or other action between those bound by the final judgment, either for the same or for a different cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>As aptly observed by the <i>ponencia</i>, the Court resolved in G.R. No. 193808 which between the CIBAC Foundation, Inc. and CIBAC National Council is authorized to field nominees in behalf of CIBAC party-list for the party-list elections. The Court held therein that it is CIBAC National Council, the COMELEC-registered governing body of the CIBAC party-list, that is empowered to formulate the policies, plans, and programs of the party, and to issue decisions and resolutions binding on party members and officers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> This ruling, which has long attained finality, was issued pursuant to the Court's valid exercise of its jurisdiction to review rulings of the COMELEC. It is, therefore, binding on substantially the same parties and bars them from re-litigating the same issue.<br><br>Needless to state, the case at bench involves parties privy to the Court's ruling in G.R. No. 193808, albeit raising a different cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Petitioner Luis K. Lokin as well as respondents Sherwin C. Tugna and Cinchona C. Cruz-Gonzales directly participated in the proceedings in G.R. No. 193808. The involvement of CIBAC National Council and CIBAC Foundation, Inc. in the case cannot also be disclaimed.<br><br>Verily, all the elements for res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment obtain herein. The instant petition for certiorarit which substantially raised the same issues as those in G.R. No. 193808, should, thus, be dismissed.<br><br><i><b>The controversy in G.R. No. 213069<br>falls within the jurisdiction of the <br>House of Representatives Electoral<br>Tribunal</b></i><br><br>I likewise concur with the ponencia that the<i> quo warranto</i> case falls outside the jurisdictional bounds of the Court, as it should have been lodged with the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET). Article VI, Section 17 of the Constitution pertinently reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 17. The Senate and the House of Representatives shall each have an Electoral Tribunal which shall be the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications <b>of their respective Members</b>. Each Electoral Tribunal shall be composed of nine Members, three of whom shall be Justices of the Supreme Court to be designated by the Chief Justice, and the remaining six shall be Members of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, who shall be chosen on the basis of proportional representation from the political parties and the parties or organizations registered under the party-list system represented therein. The senior Justice in the Electoral Tribunal shall be its Chairman, (emphasis added)<br></blockquote><br><i>Reyes v. COMELEC (Reyes)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> delineated the blurred boundaries between the COMELEC and the HRET, explicitly ruling where one ends and the other begins.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> This landmark case instructs that the HRET has jurisdiction over Members of the House of Representatives (HoR) and that to be considered a "<i>Member</i>" the following requisites must concur: (1) a valid proclamation, (2) a proper oath, and (3) assumption of office.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen (Justice Leonen) submits that the elements for membership are not independent events, and that mere proclamation suffices to vest the HRET of jurisdiction over the winning congressional candidate, citing the cases of <i>Limkaichong v. COMELEC (Limkaichong)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and <i>Vinzons-Chato v. COMELEC (Vinzons-Chato).</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> However, these very cases relied upon served as jurisprudential basis in the Court's ruling in<i> Reyes</i>. To demonstrate, the opening salvo of Limkaichong reads:<br><br><blockquote>Once a winning candidate has been <u><b>proclaimed</b></u>, <u><b>taken his oath</b></u>, and <u><b>assumed office</b></u> as a Member of the House of Representatives, the jurisdiction of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal begins, (emphasis added)</blockquote><br>And as the Court held in<i> Vinzons-Chato</i>:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [I]n an electoral contest where the validity of the <b>proclamation of a winning candidate</b> who has <u><b>taken his oath</b></u> of office and <u><b>assumed his post</b></u> as Congressman is raised, that issue is best addressed to the HRET. The reason for this ruling is self-evident, for it avoids duplicity of proceedings and a clash of jurisdiction between constitutional bodies, with due regard to the people's mandate, (emphasis added)<br></blockquote><br>Evidently, the Court's doctrine in <i>Reyes </i>is in hew with jurisprudence. The Court merely adhered to its long-standing criteria for membership in Congress that all three indispensable requirements—a valid proclamation, a proper oath, and assumption of office—must concur.<br><br>Contrary to Justice Leonen's postulation, the subsequent case of <i>Tañada v. COMELEC (Tañada)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> did not deviate from our ruling in <i>Reyes</i>. Markworthy is that before disposing the petition in <i>Tañada,</i> the Court made the following observations:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [Considering that Angelina had already been <u><b>proclaimed</b></u> as Member of the House of Representatives for the 4th District of Quezon Province on May 16, 2013, as she has in fact <u><b>taken her oath</b></u> and <u><b>assumed office</b></u> past noon time of June 30, 2013, the Court is now without jurisdiction to resolve the case at bar. As they stand, the issues concerning the conduct of the canvass and the resulting proclamation of Angelina as herein discussed are matters which fall under the scope of the terms "election" and "returns" as above-stated and hence, properly fall under the HRET's sole jurisdiction, (emphasis added)</blockquote><br>Indubitably, the Court's ruling in <i>Tañada</i> disclaiming jurisdiction in favor of the HRET is premised on the concurrence of the three (3) requirements for membership in the HoR, in clear consonance with our ruling in Reyes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Hence, the statement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> in Tañada cited by Justice Leonen--that proclamation alone vests the HRET with jurisdiction over election, returns, and qualification of the winning congressional candidate—is mere <i>obiter dictum</i>. This lone statement in the Tañada Resolution pales in comparison with the academic discussion in <i>Reyes</i>, which was the product of a more extensive discussion and incisive scrutiny of the issue regarding the HRET's jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br><i>Tañada</i> is clearly not intended as a reversal of <i>Reyes</i>. It could not have overturned nor abandoned Reyes for they are, in fact, consistent in their holdings. Thus, the Reyes doctrine remains to be the litmus test in ascertaining whether or not the winning candidate can already be deemed a "<i>Member</i>" of Congress over whom the HRET can validly exercise jurisdiction. This is even affirmed in the February 3, 2015 ruling in <i>Bandara v. COMELEC (Bandara)</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> which was decided by the Court after the October 22, 2013 <i>Tañada</i> Resolution. As held in <i>Bandara</i>:<br><br><blockquote>It is a well-settled rule that once a winning candidate has been <u><b>proclaimed, taken his oath</b></u><b>, and assumed office</b> as a Member of the House of representatives, the jurisdiction of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) over election contests relating to his/her election, returns, and qualification ends, and the HRET's own jurisdiction begins. Consequently, the instant petitions for certiorari are not the proper remedies for the petitioners in both cases to question the propriety of the National Board of Canvassers' proclamation, and the events leading thereto, (emphasis added)<br></blockquote><br>In view of the foregoing, the doctrine in Reyes, as affirmed in <i>Tañada </i>and <i>Bandara,</i> must now be applied herein. In so doing, it must first be noted that the petition for <i>quo warranto</i> was filed on July 11, 2014.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> By that date, private respondents Sherwin Tugna and Cinchona C. Cruz-Gonzales have already taken their respective oaths and assumed office as CIBAC party-list's representatives to Congress. The occurrence of these events effectively divested the Court of the power to adjudicate the case for <i>quo warranto</i>. The <i>quo warranto</i> petition should then be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br><i><b>G.R. No. 213069 should be dismissed<br>for lack of cause of action<br></b></i><br>Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the Court has jurisdiction over the <i>quo warranto</i> proceeding, G.R. No. 213069 should nevertheless be dismissed for lack of cause of action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>A ruling in G.R. No. 210273 that is favorable to petitioners is a precondition before the petition for <i>quo warranto</i> in G.R. No. 213069 can prosper. Otherwise stated, the <i>certiorari</i> case is so closely intertwined with the <i>quo warranto</i> case that dismissal of the former necessarily results in the dismissal of the latter. Thus, as a consequence of the Court's ruling in G.R No. 210273, as earlier discussed, so too must G.R. No. 213069 be dismissed.<br><br>To recall, the <i>quo warranto</i> case was filed on the postulation that petitioners are the rightful and legitimate representatives of CIBAC party-list in Congress.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Raising grounds for the allowance of the petition similar to those in the <i>certiorari </i>case, petitioners argued in the main that CIBAC National Council has already lost its legal existence, and that CIBAC Foundation, Inc.'s BOT is the governing body of CIBAC party-list. Clearly, petitioners' case for <i>quo warranto</i> presupposes that the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in recognizing CIBAC National Council's list of nominees, thereby allegedly depriving petitioners of their right to represent CIBAC in Congress.<br><br>These presuppositions, however, are bereft of factual basis.<br><br>Guilty of reiteration, it has already been resolved that it is the CIBAC National Council, not the CIBAC Foundation, Inc.'s BOT, which can validly nominate CIBAC party-list representatives to Congress. This holding in G.R. No. 193808, as now affirmed in G.R. No. 210273, automatically renders petitioners' contentions meritless and their claimed right to field party-list nominees, illusory. The pivotal allegations in the petition are just as easily belied by settled facts. Therefore, in view of the majority vote to dismiss G.R. No. 210273, the Court is constrained to likewise dismiss G.R. No. 213069.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Entitled <i>Luis K.

More particularly, I concur in holding that the Petition for Quo Warranto (docketed as G.R. No. 213069) directly filed before this court by petitioner Citizens' Battle Against Corruption (CIBAC) Foundation should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. This Petition is not within this Court's original jurisdiction. Instead, it falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal.<br><br>However, I express my reservations on the reference to a list of three (3) events—proclamation, taking of the oath of office, and assumption of duties—that are made to appear as entirely separate and distinct and, thus, are intimated to be events that must <i><b>all</b></i> occur before any petition is deemed to be exclusively cognizable by the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal. Rather than having to await the consummation of all such occurrences, it suffices that a candidate for member of the House of Representatives shall have been proclaimed a winner in order for contests relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of any such member to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal. Parenthetically, this is also true of senators in relation to the Senate Electoral Tribunal, and the President and Vice President in relation to the Presidential Electoral Tribunal. <br><br>Article VI, Section 17 of the 1987 Constitution creates separate electoral tribunals for the Senate and the House of Representatives. It also provides for each tribunal's composition and jurisdiction:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 17.

Each Electoral Tribunal shall be composed of nine Members, three of whom shall be Justices of the Supreme Court to be designated by the Chief Justice, and the remaining six shall be Members of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, who shall be chosen on the basis of proportional representation from the political parties and the parties or organizations registered under the party-list system represented therein. The senior Justice in the Electoral Tribunal shall be its Chairman. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The term "contest" is understood to refer to post-election disputes. In <i>Tecson v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> this Court interpreted this term as used in the analogous provision in Article VII<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the 1987 Constitution, which spells out the jurisdiction of the Presidential Electoral Tribunal:<br><br><blockquote>Ordinary usage would characterize a "contest" in reference to a post-election scenario. Election contests consist of either an election protest or a quo warranto which, although two distinct remedies, would have one objective in view, i.e., to dislodge the winning candidate from office. A perusal of the phraseology in Rule 12, Rule 13, and Rule 14 of the "Rules of the Presidential Electoral Tribunal," promulgated by the Supreme Court en bane on 18 April 1992, would support this premise —<br>. . . .<br><br>The rules categorically speak of the jurisdiction of the tribunal over contests relating to the election, returns and qualifications of the "President" or "Vice-President," of the Philippines, and not of "candidates" for President or Vice-President. . . .<br><br>It is fair to conclude that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, defined by Section 4, paragraph 7, of the 1987 Constitution, would not include cases directly brought before it questioning the qualifications of a candidate for the presidency or vice-presidency before the elections are held.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>An election protest is "a contest between the <i>defeated and winning candidates</i> on the ground of frauds [sic] or irregularities in the casting and counting of the ballots, or in the preparation of the returns. It raises the question of who actually obtained the plurality of the legal votes and therefore is entitled to hold the office."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> A successful election protest results in the revision or a recount of the ballots to determine the true winner of the election.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><i>Tecson</i> explained quo warranto proceedings as follows:<br><br><blockquote>A quo warranto proceeding is generally defined as being an action against a person who usurps, intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises a public office. In such context, the election contest can only contemplate a post-election scenario. In Rule 14, only a registered candidate who would have received either the second or third highest number of votes could file an election protest. This rule again presupposes a post-election scenario.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>In the 2013 case of <i>Tañada, Jr. v. Commission on Elections,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> this Court En Bane unanimously sustained the jurisdiction of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal "over disputes relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of the proclaimed representative[.]"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> We emphasized that a candidate's proclamation as winner was the definitive event that strips the Commission on Elections of jurisdiction, jurisdiction that is then vested exclusively in the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal:<br><br><blockquote>Case law states that <i>the proclamation of a congressional candidate following the election divests the COMELEC of jurisdiction over disputes relating to the election, returns, and qualifications of the proclaimed representative in favor of the HRET</i>. The phrase "election, returns, and qualifications" refers to all matters affecting the validity of the contesteeV title. In particular, the term "election" refers to the conduct of the polls, including the listing of voters, the holding of the electoral campaign, and the casting and counting of the votes; "returns" refers to the canvass of the returns and the proclamation of the winners, including questions concerning the composition of the board of canvassers and the authenticity of the election returns; and "qualifications" refers to matters that could be raised in a <i>quo warranto</i> proceeding against the proclaimed winner, such as his disloyalty or ineligibility or the inadequacy of his CoC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>This Court has even clarified that allegations of irregularity as to a candidate's proclamation as winner shall not prevent the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal from assuming jurisdiction. In <i>Limkaichong v. Commission on Elections</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Petitioners (in G.R. Nos. 179120, 179132-33, and 179240-41) steadfastly maintained that Limkaichong's proclamation was tainted with irregularity, which will effectively prevent the HRET from acquiring jurisdiction.<br><br>The fact that the proclamation of the winning candidate, as in this case, was alleged to have been tainted with irregularity does not divest the HRET of its jurisdiction. The Court has shed light on this in the case of <i>Vinzons-Chalo</i>, to the effect that:<br><br><blockquote>In the present case, it is not disputed that respondent Unico has already been proclaimed and taken his oath of office as a Member of the House of Representatives (Thirteenth Congress); hence, the COMELEC correctly ruled that it had already lost jurisdiction over petitioner Chato's petition. The issues raised by petitioner Chato essentially relate to the canvassing of returns and alleged invalidity of respondent Unico's proclamation. These are matters that are best addressed to the sound judgment and discretion of the HRET. Significantly, the allegation that respondent Unico's proclamation is null and void does not divest the-HRET of its jurisdiction:<br><br><blockquote>xxx [I]n an electoral contest where the validity of the proclamation of a winning candidate who has taken his oath of office and assumed his post as congressman is raised, that issue is best addressed to the HRET. The reason for this ruling is self-evident, for it avoids duplicity of proceedings and a clash of jurisdiction between constitutional bodies, with due regard to the people's mandate.</blockquote>Further, for the Court to take cognizance of petitioner Chato's election protest against respondent Unico would be to usurp the constitutionally mandated functions of the HRET.<br></blockquote>In fine,<i> any allegations as to the invalidity of the proclamation will not prevent the HRET from assuming jurisdiction over all matters essential to a member's qualification to sit in the House of Representatives.</i><br>. . . .<br><br>Accordingly, <i>after the proclamation of the winning candidate in the congressional elections, the remedy of those who may assail one'seligibility/ineligihility/qualification/disqualification is to file before the HRET a petition for an election protest, or a petition for quo warranto, within the period provided by the HRET Rules. In Pangilinan v. Commission on Elections, we ruled that where the candidate has already been proclaimed winner in the congressional elections, the remedy of petitioner is to file an electoral protest with the Electoral Tribunal of the House of Representatives.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><br>A winning candidate's taking of the oath of office and assumption of duties are but natural and necessary consequences of his or her proclamation as winner. They are mere incidents, transpiring precisely and only because a candidate has been previously proclaimed as a winner. Thus, they should not be appreciated separately of proclamation, as though they are entirely non-aligned and self-sufficient occurrences.<br><br>In <i>Codilla, Si. v. Hon. de Venecia</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> this Court described as "no longer a matter of discretion"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the task of the Speaker of the House of Representatives to administer the oath to proclaimed winners for membership in the House of Representatives:<br><br><blockquote>The distinction between a ministerial and discretionary act is well delineated. A purely ministerial act or duty is one which an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. If the law imposes a duty upon a public officer and gives him the right to decide how or when the duty shall be performed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministerial only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of official discretion or judgment[.]<br><br>In the case at bar, the administration of oath and the registration of the petitioner in the Roll of Members of the House of Representatives representing the 4<sup>th</sup> legislative district of Leyte is no longer a matter of discretion on the part of the public respondents. The facts are settled and beyond dispute: petitioner garnered 71,350 votes as against respondent Locsin who only got 53,447 votes in the May 14, 2001 elections. The COMELEC Second Division initially ordered the proclamation of respondent Locsin; on Motion for Reconsideration the COMELEC en bane set aside the order of its Second Division and ordered the proclamation of the petitioner. The Decision of the COMELEC en bane has not been challenged before this Court by respondent Locsin and said Decision has become final and executory.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (Citation omitted)</blockquote><br>Only a winner in an election—that is, one who has been proclaimed as such—can proceed to take the oath of office. Further, only one who has won and taken his or her oath may proceed to validly exercise the functions of an elective public office. Therefore, it remains that the definite occurrence is proclamation as winner: it defines the competencies of the erstwhile candidate (now a winner) and identifies the body with the competence to rule on contests arising from this victory. From this, it follows that it is an error to demand taking of the oath of office and assumption of duties as separate requisites before a contest is deemed to fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal.<br><br>When the Commission on Elections proclaimed CIBAC the winner in the party-list elections and issued National Board of Canvassers Resolution No. 0011-13 on June 5, 2013, it also recognized the nominees identified by the CIBAC National Council as the legitimate nominees. At this juncture, any petition contesting the election, returns and/or qualifications of CIBAC and, by extension, of its nominees should have been filed before the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal.<br><br>As CIBAC acquired more than four percent (4%) of the votes cast for the party-list system, taking the oath of office and assuming duties as members of the House of Representatives necessarily followed for CIBAC s first two (2) nominees, Sherwin N. Tugna and Cinchona C. Cruz-Gonzales. As soon as CIBAC was proclaimed, their taking of oaths and assumption of duties became certain. As soon as this proclamation transpired, petitioner CIBAC Foundation should have filed an election protest, quo warranto, or mandamus petition before the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal within 10 days from May 18, 2013.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Instead, it erroneously filed its quo warranto petition before this Court.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>DISMISS</b> the consolidated Petitions.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 468 Phil. 421 (2004) [Per J.
