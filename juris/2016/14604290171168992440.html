by the cadastral court granting in favor of CMU the title to the subject parcels of land.<br><br>The Republic argued that the cadastral court should have summarily dismissed the registration proceedings since the Solicitor General did not sign or file the petition for compulsory registration of the parcels of land, as provided in Sections 53<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> and 87<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> of Commonwealth Act No. 141.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It also alleged that the subject parcels of land are inalienable lands

The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, the instant petition is GRANTED. The 1) Decision dated December 22, 1971, 2) Amended Decision dated October 7, 1972 and 3) Second Amended Decision dated September 12, 1974, all rendered by the Court of First Instance, 15<sup>th</sup> Judicial District, Branch II, Bukidnon Province, in "L.R.C.

Quema, authorizing the Director of Lands to file the necessary petition in the CFI of Bukidnon for compulsory registration of the parcels of land reserved for CMU's site purposes is equivalent to a declaration and certification by the Office of the President that the subject parcels of land are alienable and disposable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>CMU has cited the case of <i>Republic v.

This Court held that the said presidential directive was equivalent to a declaration and certification that the subject land area is alienable and disposable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>This Court finds the instant petition without merit.<br><br>Under the <i>Regalian</i> doctrine, all lands of the public domain belong to the State, and that the State is the source of any asserted right to ownership of land and charged with the conservation of such patrimony.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Also, the doctrine states that all lands not otherwise appearing to be clearly within private ownership are presumed to belong to the State.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Consequently, the person applying for registration has the burden of proof to overcome the presumption of ownership of lands of the public domain.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>To prove that a land is alienable, the existence of a positive act of the government, such as presidential proclamation or an executive order; an administrative action; investigation reports of Bureau of Lands investigators; and a legislative act or a statute declaring the land as alienable and disposable must be established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Hence, a public land remains part of the inalienable public domain unless it is shown to have been reclassified and alienated by the State to a private person.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>As noted, Proclamation No. 476 issued by then President Garcia, decreeing certain portions of the public domain in Musuan, Maramag, Bukidnon for CMU's site purposes, was issued pursuant to Section 83 of C.A. No. 141. Being reserved as CMU's school site, the said parcels of land were withdrawn from sale and settlement, and reserved for CMU. Under Section 88 of the same Act, the reserved parcels of land would ordinarily be inalienable and not subject to occupation, entry, sale, lease or other disposition, subject to an exception, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>Section 88. The tract or tracts of land reserved under the provisions of section eighty-three shall be non-alienable and shall not be subject to occupation, entry, sale, lease, or other disposition <b>until again declared alienable under the provisions of this Act or by proclamation of the President</b>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In the case of <i>Navy Officers' Village Association, Inc. v.

As such, CMU avows that the subject lots, as declared alienable and disposable, are properly registered in its name.<br><br>This Court finds that the <i>De la Rosa </i>case does not apply in the instant petition because of the varying factual settings, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>In <i>De la Rosa</i>, the Mallig Plains Reservation was reserved by the President for settlement purposes under the administration of National Land Settlement Administration (<i>NLSA</i>), later replaced by Land Settlement and Development Corporation (<i>LASEDECO</i>), while the subject lots in the present case was reserved for educational purposes, e.g. as CMU's school site, under the administration of the Board of Trustees of CMU.<br><br></li><li>The National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration, when it replaced LASEDECO, excluded the Mallig Plains Reservation among the properties it needed in carrying out the purposes and objectives of Republic Act No. 1160,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> thus, the Reservation eventually reverted to and became public agricultural land. There was no evidence that CMU ceased to use and occupy the reserved lots in Musuan, Maramag, Bukidnon as its school site or that its public purpose is abandoned, for the lots to revert to and become public agricultural land.<br><br></li><li>At the time that President Quirino issued the directive, the Gamu Public Land Subdivision in the Mallig Plains Reservation was not reserved for public or quasi-public purpose or has ceased to be so. On the other hand, the subject lots in Bukidnon are reserved for public purpose when the President, through the Assistant Executive Secretary, issued the said directive.<br><br></li><li>In the <i>De la Rosa </i>case, the private respondent was a qualified private claimant with the requisite period of possession of the subject residential lot in his favor. Meanwhile, CMU is not a private claimant of the land so reserved.<br></li></ol></blockquote><br>It was explicated in <i>De la Rosa</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> that the authority of the President to issue such a directive, held as equivalent to a declaration and certification that the subject land area is alienable and disposable, finds support in Section 7 of C.A. No. 141, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 7. For purposes of the <b>administration and disposition of alienable or disposable public lands,</b> the President, upon recommendation by the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, shall from time to time declare what lands are open to disposition or concession under this Act. (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote><br>However, the said directive by the President is limited to those enumerated in Section 8 of C.A. No. 141, which provides that:<br><br><blockquote>Section 8. Only those lands shall be declared <b>open to disposition or concession</b> which have been <b>officially delimited and classified</b> and, <b>when practicable, surveyed</b>, and which have <b>not been reserved for public or quasi-public uses, nor appropriated by the Government, nor in any manner become private property, nor those on which a private right authorized and recognized by this Act or any other valid law may be claimed</b>, or which, <b>having been reserved or appropriated, have ceased to be so</b>. However, the President may, for reasons of public interest, declare lands of the public domain open to disposition before the same have had their boundaries established or been surveyed, or may, for the same reason, suspend their concession or disposition until they are again declared open to concession or disposition by proclamation duly published or by Act of the National Assembly. (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote><br>As can be gleaned from the above provision, the lands which can be declared open to disposition or concession are those which have been officially delimited and classified, or when practicable surveyed; those not reserved for public or <i>quasi</i>-public purpose; those not appropriated by the Government; those which have not become private property in any manner; those which have no private right authorized and recognized by C.A. No. 141 or any other valid law may be claimed; or those which have ceased to be reserved or appropriated.<br><br>For the said President's directive to file the necessary petition for compulsory registration of parcels of land be considered as an equivalent of a declaration that the land is alienable and disposable, the subject land, among others, should not have been reserved for public or <i>quasi</i>-public purposes.<br><br>Therefore, the said directive on December 12, 1960 cannot be considered as a declaration that said land is alienable and disposable. Unlike in <i>De la Rosa,</i> the lands, having been reserved for public purpose by virtue of Proclamation No. 476, have not ceased to be so at the time the said directive was made. Hence, the lots did not revert to and become public agricultural land for them to be the subject of a declaration by the President that the same are alienable and disposable.<br><br>We have ruled in the case of <i>CMU v. DARAB</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> that the CMU land reservation is not alienable and disposable land of public domain,<i> viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>It is our opinion that the 400 hectares ordered segregated by the DARAB and affirmed by the Court of Appeals in its Decision dated August 20, 1990, is not covered by the [Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program] CARP because:<br><blockquote>(1) It is <b>not alienable and disposable land</b> of the public domain;<br><br>(2) The CMU land reservation is not in excess of specific limits as determined by Congress;<br><br>(3) It is private land registered and titled in the name of its lawful owner, the CMU;<br><br>(4) It is exempt from coverage under Section 10 of R.A. 6657 because the lands are actually, directly and exclusively used and <i>found to be necessary</i> for school site and campus, including experimental farm stations for educational purposes, and for establishing seed and seedling research and pilot production centers.<br></blockquote></blockquote><br>The inalienable character of the lands as part of the long term functions of autonomous agricultural educational institution is reiterated in <i>CMU v. Executive Secretary</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It did not matter that it was President Arroyo who, in this case, attempted by proclamation to appropriate the lands for distribution to indigenous peoples and cultural communities. As already stated, the lands by their character have become <b>inalienable from the moment President Garcia dedicated them for CMU's use</b> in scientific and technological research in the field of agriculture. They have <b>ceased to be alienable public lands</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote><br>This Court is not unmindful of its earlier pronouncement in <i>CMU v. DARAB</i> that the land reservation is a private land registered and titled in the name of its lawful owner, the CMU. This pronouncement, which is now being argued by CMU as one of its bases in convincing this Court that the subject property is owned by it and already alienable, is specious. The 1992 CMU case merely enumerated the reasons why the said portion of the property is beyond the coverage of CARP. Moreover, the fact that the Court had already settled the inalienable character of the subject property as part of the long term functions of the autonomous agricultural educational institution in the case of <i>CMU v. DARAB</i> and reiterated in <i>CMU v. Executive Secretary,</i> belies CMU's contention that this Court has recognized that the said land is a private property or that the land is alienable and disposable.<br><br>As to what constitutes alienable and disposable land of the public domain, this Court expounds in its pronouncements in <i>Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources v. Yap</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>A positive act declaring land as alienable and disposable is required. In keeping with the presumption of State ownership, the Court has time and again emphasized that there must be a positive act of the government, such as an official proclamation, declassifying inalienable public land into disposable land for agricultural or other purposes. In fact, Section 8 of CA No. 141 limits alienable or disposable lands only to those lands which have been "officially delimited and classified."<br><br>The burden of proof in overcoming the presumption of State ownership of the lands of the public domain is on the person applying for registration (or claiming ownership), who must prove that the land subject of the application is alienable or disposable. To overcome this presumption, incontrovertible evidence must be established that the land subject of the application (or claim) is alienable or disposable. There must still be a positive act declaring land of the public domain as alienable and disposable. To prove that the land subject of an application for registration is alienable, the applicant must establish the existence of a positive act of the government such as a presidential proclamation or an executive order; an administrative action; investigation reports of Bureau of Lands investigators; and a legislative act or a statute. The applicant may also secure a certification from the government that the land claimed to have been nossessed for the required number of years is alienable and disposable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In the case at bar, CMU failed to establish, through incontrovertible evidence, that the land reservations registered in its name are alienable and disposable lands of public domain. Aside from the series of indorsements regarding the filing of the application for the compulsory registration of the parcels of land and the said directive from the President, CMU did not present any proof of a positive act of the government declaring the said lands alienable and disposable.<br><br>For lack of proof that the said land reservations have been reclassified as alienable and disposable, the said lands remain part of inalienable public domain, hence; they are not registrable under Torrens system.<br><br>This Court will not discuss the other issue raised by CMU, <i>e.g</i>., the filing of the petition for cadastral proceeding was pursuant to the written consent, authorization and directive of the OSG, as the same was not discussed in the assailed Decision of the CA. This Court also dismisses the other issue raised — that the titles in CMU's name were singled out by respondent- for lack of evidence.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> dated January 14, 2011 filed by petitioner Central Mindanao University is hereby <b>DENIED</b>.
