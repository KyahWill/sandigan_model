				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Under Commonwealth Act No. 141, a claimant may acquire alienable and disposable public land upon evidence of exclusive and notorious possession of the land since June 12, 1945.

stated that it had no reason to doubt the evidence presented by the Delfin Spouses:<br><blockquote>On this regards (sic), the Court finds no reason to doubt the veracity of the plaintiff['s evidence], there being none to controvert the same. If said. evidence did not ring true, the defendant should have and could have easily destroyed their probatory value. Such indifference can only mean that defendant had not (sic) equitable rights to protect or assert over the disputed property together with all the improvements existing thereon. This, the defendant did not do so and the Court finds no cogent reasons to disbelieve or reject the plaintiffs categorical declarations on the witness stand under a solemn oath, for the same are entitled to full faith and credence. Indeed, if the defendant National Housing Authority have been blinded with the consequence of their neglect and apathy, then defendant have no right to pass on to the spouses-plaintiffs of their negligence and expect the Court to come to their rescue. For it is now much too late in the day to assail the decision which has become final and executory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>The National Housing Authority filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but this was denied in the Regional trial Court's September 10, 2002 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>On the National Housing Authority's appeal, the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed February 26, 2010 Decision reversing the Regional Trial Court:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appeal is GRANTED. The assailed Decision is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Consequently, appellees' complaint for compensation is DISMISSED for lack of merit. The property taken by appellant NHA and for which compensation is sought by appellees is hereby DECLARED land of the public domain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals ruled that the characterization of the property is no longer an issue because the National Housing Authority already conceded that the property is disposable public land by citing Proclamation No. 2151, which characterized the property as "a certain disposable parcel of public land."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> However, the Delfin Spouses supposedly failed to establish their possession of the property since June 12, 1945, as required in Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>During the pendency of their petition before the Court of Appeals.

Article III, Section 9 of the 1987 Constitution states that<br><blockquote>Section 9.

[Emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote>For acquisitive prescription to set in pursuant to Section 14(2) of Presidential Decree No. 1529, two (2) requirements must be satisifled: first, the property is established to be private in character; and second the applicable prescriptive period under existing laws had passed.<br><br>Property - such as land - is either of public dominion or private ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>"Land is considered of public dominion if it either: (a) is intended for public use; or (b) belongs to the State, without being for public use, and is intended for some public service or for the development of the national wealth."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Land that belongs to the state but which is not or is no longer intended for public use, for some public service or for the development of the national wealth, is patrimonial property;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> it is property owned by the State in its <i>private</i> capacity.

Consistent with this, Article 1113 of Civil Code demarcates properties of the state, which are not patrimonial in character, as being not susceptible to prescription:<br><blockquote>Art. 1113. All things which are within the commerce of men are susceptible of prescription, unless provided. Property of the State or any of its subdivisions not patrimonial in character shall not be the object of prescription.<br></blockquote>Contrary to petitioners' theory then, for prescription to be viable, the publicly-owned land must be patrimonial or private in character at the onset. Possession for thirty (30) years does not convert it into patrimonial property.<br><br>For land of the public domain to be converted into patrimonial property, there must be an express declaration - "in the form of a law duly enacted by Congress or a Presidential Proclamation in cases where the President is duly authorized by law"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> - that "the public dominion property is no longer intended for public service or the development of the national wealth or that the property has been converted into patrimonial."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>This Court's 2009 Decision in <i>Heirs of Malabanan v. Republic</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> explains:<br><blockquote>Nonetheless, Article 422 of the Civil Code states that "[p]roperty of public dominion, when no longer intended for public use or for public service, shall form part of the patrimonial property of the State". It is this provision that controls how public dominion property may be converted into patrimonial properly susceptible to acquisition by prescription. After all, Article 420 (2) makes clear that those property "which belong to the State, without being for public use, and are intended for some public service or for the development of the national wealth" are public dominion property. For as long as the property belongs to the State, although already classified as alienable or disposable, it remains property of the public dominion if when * it is "intended for some public service or for the development of the national wealth".<br><br>Accordingly, there must be an express declaration by the State that the public dominion property is no longer intended for public service or the development of the national wealth or that the property has been converted into patrimonial. Without such express declaration, the property, even if classified as alienable or disposable, remains property of the public dominion, pursuant to Article 420 (2), and thus incapable of acquisition by prescription. It is only when such alienable and disposable lands are expressly declared by the State to be no longer intended for public service or for the development of the national wealth that the period of acquisitive prescription can begin to run. Such declaration shall be in the form of a law duly enacted by Congress or a Presidential Proclamation in cases where the President is duly authorized by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br></blockquote>This was reiterated in this Court's 2013 Resolution in <i>Heirs of Malabanan v. Republic</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><blockquote>[W]hen public land is no longer intended for public service or for the development of the national wealth, thereby effectively removing the land from the ambit of public dominion, a declaration of such conversion must be made in the form of a law duly enacted by Congress or by a Presidential proclamation in cases where the President is duly authorized by law to that effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br></blockquote>Attached to the present Petition was a copy of a May 18, 1988 supplemental letter to the Director of the Land Management Bureau.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> This referred to an executive order, which stated that petitioners' property was no longer needed for any public or quasi-public purposes:<br><blockquote>That it is very clear in the 4<sup>th</sup> Indorsement of the Executive Secretary dated April 24, 1954 the portion thereof that will not be needed for any public or quasi-public purposes, be disposed in favor of the actual occupants under the administration of the Bureau of Lands (copy of the Executive Order is herewith attached for ready reference)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>However, a mere indorsement of the executive secretary is not the law or presidential proclamation required for converting land of the public domain into patrimonial property and rendering it susceptible to prescription. There then was no viable declaration rendering the Iligan property to have been patrimonial property at the onset. Accordingly, regardless of the length of petitioners' possession, no title could vest on them <i>by way of prescription</i>.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>While petitioners may not claim title by prescription, they may, nevertheless, claim title pursuant to Section 48 (b) of Commonwealth Act No. 141 (the Public Land Act).<br><br>Section 48 enabled the confirmation of claims and issuance of titles in favor of citizens occupying or claiming to own lands of the public domain or an interest therein. Section 48 (b) specifically pertained to those who "have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and, occupation of agricultural lands of the public domain, under a bona fide claim of acquisition or ownership, since June 12, 1945":<br><blockquote>Sec. 48. The following-described citizens of the Philippines, occupying lands of the public domain or claiming to own any such lands or an interest therein, but whose titles have not been perfected or completed, may apply to the Court of First Instance of the province where the land is located for confirmation of their claims and the issuance of a certificate of title therefor under the Land Registration Act, to wit: <br>&nbsp;<br><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(b)</div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">Those who by themselves or through their predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession and, occupation of agricultural lands of the public domain, under a bona fide claim of acquisition or ownership, since June 12, 1945, immediately preceding the filing of the application for confirmation of title, except when prevented by war or force majeure. These shall be conclusively presumed to have performed all the conditions essential to a government grant and shall be entitled to a certificate of title under the provisions of this chapter. (As amended by PD 1073.)<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act therefore requires that two (2) requisites be satisfied before claims of title to public domain lands may be confirmed: first, that the land subject of the claim is agricultural land; and second, open, continuous, notorious, and exclusive possession of the land since June 12, 1945.<br><br>The need for the land subject of the claim to have been classified as agricultural is in conformity with the constitutional precept that "[a]lienable lands of the public domain shall be limited to agricultural lands."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> As explained in this Court's 2013 Resolution in <i>Heirs of Malabanan v. Republic</i>:<br><blockquote>Whether or not land of the public domain is alienable and disposable primarily rests on the classification of public lands made under the Constitution. Under the 1935 Constitution, lands of the public domain were classified into three, namely, agricultural, timber and mineral. Section 10, Article XTV of the 1973 Constitution classified lands of the public domain into seven, specifically, agricultural, industrial or commercial, residential, resettlement, mineral, timber or forest, and grazing land, with the reservation that the law might provide other classifications. The 1987 Constitution adopted the classification under the 1935 Constitution into agricultural, forest or timber, and mineral, but added national parks. Agricultural lands may be further classified by law according to the uses to which they may be devoted. The identification of lands according to their legal classification is done exclusively by and through a positive act of the Executive Department.<br><br>Based on the foregoing, the Constitution places a limit on the type of public land that may be alienated. Under Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution, only agricultural lands of the public domain may be alienated; all other natural resources may not be.<br><br>Alienable and disposable lands of the State fall into two categories, to wit: (a) patrimonial lands of the State, or those classified as lands of private ownership under Article 425 of the Civil Code, without limitation; and (b) lands of the public domain, or the public lands as provided by the Constitution, but with the limitation that the lands must only be agricultural. Consequently, lands classified as forest or timber, mineral, or national parks are not susceptible of alienation or disposition unless they are reclassified as agricultural. A positive act of the Government is necessary to enable such reclassification, and the exclusive prerogative to classify public lands under existing laws is vested in the Executive Department, not in the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br></blockquote>As the Court of Appeals emphasized, respondent has conceded that the Iligan property was alienable and disposable land:<br><blockquote>As to the first requirement: There was no need for appellees to establish that the property involved was alienable and disposable public land. This characterization of the property is conceded by [respondent] who cites Proclamation No. 2151 as declaring that the disputed property was a certain disposable parcel of public land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>That the Iligan property was alienable and disposable, agricultural land, has been admitted. What is claimed instead is that petitioners' possession is debunked by how the Iligan Property was supposedly part of a military reservation area<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> which was subsequently reserved for Iligan City's slum improvement and resettlement program, and the relocation of families who were dislocated by the National Steel Corporation's five-year expansion program.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Indeed, by virtue of Proclamation No. 2143 (erroneously referred to by respondent as Proclamation No. 2151) certain parcels of land in Barrio Suarez, Iligan City were reserved for slum-improvement and resettlement program purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The proclamation characterized the covered area as "disposable parcel of public land":<br><blockquote>WHEREAS, a certain disposable parcel of public land situated at Barrio Suarez, Iligan City consisting of one million one hundred seventy-four thousand eight hundred fifty-three (1,174,853) square meters, more or less, has been chosen by National Steel Corporation and the City Government of Iligan with the conformity of the National Housing/Authority, as the most suitable site for the relocation of the families to be affected/dislocated as a result of National Steel Corporation's program and for the establishment of a slum improvement and resettlement project in the City of Iligan;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote>However, even if the Iligan Property was subsumed by Proclamation No. 2143, the same proclamation recognized private rights, which may have already attached, and the rights of qualified free patent applicants:<br><blockquote>NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by law, do hereby reserve for relocation of the families to be affected/dislocated by the 5-year expansion program of the National Steel Corporation and for the slum improvement and resettlement project of the City of Iligan under the administration and disposition of the National Housing Authority, subject to private rights, if any there be, Lot 5258 (portion) of the Iligan Cadastre, which parcel of land is of the public domain, situated in Barrio Suarez, City of Iligan and more particularly described as follows:<br><br>....<br><br><i>This Proclamation is subject to the condition that the qualified free patent applicants occupying portions of the aforedescribed parcel of land, if any, may be compensated for the value of their respective portions and existing improvements thereon</i>, as may be determined by the National Housing Authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br></blockquote>Whatever rights petitioners (and their predecessors-in-interest) may have had over the Iligan property was, thus, not obliterated by Proclamation No. 2143. On the contrary, the Proclamation itself facilitated compensation.<br><br>More importantly, there is documentary evidence to the effect that the Iligan Property was not even within the area claimed by respondent. In a letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> to the Director of Lands, dated December 22, 1987, Deputy Public Land Inspector Pio Lucero, Jr. noted that:<br><blockquote>That this land known as Lot No. 5258, Cad. 292, Iligan Cadastre which portion was claimed also by the Human Settlement and/or National Housing Authority; but the area applied for by Leopoldo Delfin is outside the claim of the said agency as per certification issued dated June 10, 1988; copy of which is herewith attached for ready reference;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br></blockquote>The same letter likewise indicated that the Iligan Property was already occupied by June 1945 and that it had even been released for agricultural purposes in favor of its occupants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Accordingly, the Deputy Public Land Inspector recommended the issuance of a patent in favor of petitioner Leopoldo Delfin:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><blockquote>Upon investigation conducted by the undersigned in the premises of the land, it was found and ascertained that the land applied for by Leopoldo Delfrn was first entered, occupied, possessed and cultivated by him since the year June, 1945 up to the present; he have already well improved the land and introduced some considerable improvements such as coconut trees and different kinds of fruit trees which are presently all fruit bearing trees; declared the same for taxation purposes and taxes have been paid every year; and that there is no other person or persons who bothered him in his peaceful occupation and cultivation thereof;<br><br>Records of this Office show that said land was surveyed and claimed by the Military Reservation, but the portion of which has been released in favor of the actual occupants and the area of Leopoldo Delfin is one of the portions released for agricultural purposes;<br><br>....<br><br>That the applicant caused the survey of the land under Sgs-12-000099, approved by the Regional Land Director, Region XII, Bureau of Lands, Cotabato City on April 3, 1979 (see approved plan attached hereof);<br><br>In view hereof, it is therefore respectfully recommended that the entry of the application be now confirmed and that patent be yes issued in favor of Leopoldo Delfin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br></blockquote>A May 18, 1988 supplemental letter to the Director of the Land Management Bureau further stated:<br><blockquote>That the land applied for by Leopoldo Delfin is a portion of Lot No. 5258, Cad. 292, Iligan Cadastre which was entered, occupied and possessed by the said applicant since the year June 1945 up to the present; well improved the same and introduced some considerable improvements such as different kinds of fruit trees, coconut trees and other permanent improvements thereon;<br><br>....<br><br>That is very clear in the 4<sup>th</sup> Indorsement of the Executive Secretary dated April 24, 1954 the portion thereof that will not be needed for any public or quasi-public purposes, be disposed in favor of the actual occupants under the administration of the Bureau of Lands[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br></blockquote>Clearly then, petitioners acquired title over the Iligan Property pursuant to Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act.<br><br>First, there is no issue that the Iligan Property had already been declared to be alienable and disposable land. Respondent has admitted this and Deputy Public Land Inspector Pio Lucero, Jr.'s letters to the Director of Land attest to this.<br><br>Second, although the Delfin Spouses' testimonial evidence and tax declarations showed that their possession went only as far back as 1952, Deputy Public Land Inspector Pio Lucero, Jr.'s letters to the Director of Land nevertheless attest to a previous finding that the property had already been occupied as early as June 1945.<br><br>Having shown that the requisites of Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act have been satisfied and having established their rights to the Iligan Property, it follows that petitioners must be compensated for its taking.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
