Moreover, the Commission on Elections did not gravely abuse its discretion in disqualifying petitioner Arlene Llena Empaynado Chua, annulling her proclamation, and subsequently proclaiming private respondent Krystle Marie C.

The remedies have different legal consequences.<br><br>A person files a certificate of candidacy to announce his or her candidacy and to declare his or her eligibility for the elective office indicated in the certificate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Section 74 of the Omnibus Election Code on the contents of a certificate of candidacy states:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 74. <i><b>Contents of certificate of candidacy</b></i>. - The certificate of candidacy shall state that the person filing it is announcing his candidacy for the office stated therein and that he is eligible for said office; if for Member of the Batasang Pambansa, the province, including its component cities, highly urbanized city or district or section which he seeks to represent; the political party to which he belongs; civil status; his date of birth; residence; his post office address for all election purposes; his profession or occupation; that he will support and defend the Constitution of the Philippines and will maintain true faith and allegiance thereto; that he will obey the laws, legal orders, and decrees promulgated by the duly constituted authorities; that he is not a permanent resident or immigrant to a foreign country; that the obligation imposed by his oath is assumed voluntarily, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that the facts stated in the certificate of candidacy are true to the best of his knowledge.<br><br>Unless a candidate has officially changed his name through a court approved proceeding, a candidate shall use in a certificate of candidacy the name by which he has been baptized, or if has not been baptized in any church or religion, the name registered in the office of the local civil registrar or any other name allowed under the provisions of existing law or, in the case of a Muslim, his <i>Hadji</i> name after performing the prescribed religious pilgrimage: <i>Provided,</i> That when there are two or more candidates for an office with the same name and surname, each candidate, upon being made aware of such fact, shall state his paternal and maternal surname, except the incumbent who may continue to use the name and surname stated in his certificate of candidacy when he was elected. He may also include one nickname or stage name by which he is generally or popularly known in the locality.<br><br>The person filing a certificate of candidacy shall also affix his latest photograph, passport size; a statement in duplicate containing his bio-data and program of government not exceeding one hundred words, if he so desires.</blockquote><br>The Commission on Elections has the ministerial duty to receive and acknowledge receipt of certificates of candidacy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> However, under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> the Commission may deny due course or cancel a certificate of candidacy through a verified petition filed <i>exclusively</i> on the ground that "any material representation contained therein as required under Section 74 hereof is false." The "material representation" referred to in Section 78 is that, which involves the eligibility or qualification for the office sought by the person who filed the certificate.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Section 78 must, therefore, be read "in relation to the constitutional and statutory provisions on qualifications or eligibility for public office."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Moreover, the false representation "must consist of a deliberate attempt to mislead, misinform, or hide a fact which would otherwise render a candidate ineligible."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>A person intending to run for public office must not only possess the required qualifications for the position for which he or she intends to run. The candidate must also possess none of the grounds for disqualification under the law. As Justice Vicente V. Mendoza said in his Dissenting Opinion in <i>Romualdez-Marcos v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> "that an individual possesses the qualifications for a public office does not imply that he is not disqualified from becoming a candidate or continuing as a candidate for a public office and vice-versa."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code provides for grounds in filing a petition for disqualification:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 68<i><b> Disqualifications</b></i>. - Any candidate who, in action or protest in which he is a party is declared by final decision of a competent court guilty of, or found by the Commission of having (a) given money or other material consideration to influence, induce or corrupt the voters or public officials performing electoral functions; (b) committed acts of terrorism to enhance his candidacy; (c) spent in his election campaign an amount in excess of that allowed by this Code; (d) solicited, received or made any contribution prohibited under Sections 89, 95, 96, 97 and 104; or (e) violated any of Sections 80, 83, 85, 86 and 261, paragraphs d, e, k, v, and cc, sub-paragraph 6, shall be disqualified from continuing as a candidate, or if he has been elected, from holding the office. Any person who is a permanent resident of or an immigrant of a foreign country in accordance with the residence requirement provided for in the election laws.<br></blockquote><br>Apart from the grounds provided in Section 68, any of the grounds in Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code as well as in Section 40 of the Local Government Code may likewise be raised in a petition for disqualification. Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code states:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 12. <i><b>Disqualifications.</b></i> - Any person who has been declared by competent authority insane or incompetent, or has been sentenced by final judgment for subversion, insurrection, rebellion, or for any offense for which he has been sentenced to a penalty of more than eighteen months or for a crime involving moral turpitude, shall be disqualified to be a candidate and to hold any office, unless he has been given plenary pardon or granted amnesty.<br><br>This disqualifications to be a candidate herein provided shall be deemed removed upon the declaration by competent authority that said insanity or incompetence had been removed or after the expiration of a period of five years from his service of sentence, unless within the same period he again becomes disqualified.</blockquote><br>Disqualifications specifically applicable to those running for local elective positions are found in Section 40 of the Local Government Code:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 40. <i><b>Disqualifications</b>.</i> - The following persons are disqualified from running for any elective local position:<br><br>(a) Those sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment, within two (2) years after serving sentence;<br><br>(b) Those removed from office as a result of an administrative case;<br><br>(c) Those convicted by final judgment for violating the oath of allegiance to the Republic;<br><br>(d) Those with dual citizenship;<br><br>(e) Fugitives from justice in criminal or nonpolitical cases here or abroad;<br><br>(f) Permanent residents in a foreign country or those who have acquired the right to reside abroad and continue to avail of the same right after the effectivity of this Code; and<br><br>(g) The insane or feeble-minded.</blockquote><br>Private respondent Fragata alleges in her Petition that petitioner is a permanent resident in the United States, a green card holder who, prior to the filing of her Certificate of Candidacy for Councilor, has resided in the State of Georgia for 33 years. She anchors her Petition on Section 40 of the Local Government Code, which disqualifies permanent residents of a foreign country from running for any elective local position.<br><br>It is true that under Section 74 of the Omnibus Election Code, persons who file their certificates of candidacy declare that they are not a permanent resident or immigrant to a foreign country. Therefore, a petition to deny due course or cancel a certificate of candidacy may likewise be filed against a permanent resident of a foreign country seeking an elective post in the p Philippines on the ground of material misrepresentation in the certificate of A candidacy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>What remedy to avail himself or herself of, however, depends on the petitioner. If the false material representation in the certificate of candidacy relates to a ground for disqualification, the petitioner may choose whether to file a petition to deny due course or cancel a certificate of candidacy or a petition for disqualification, so long as the petition filed complies with the requirements under the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>Before the Commission on Elections, private respondent Fragata had a choice of filing either a petition to deny due course or cancel petitioner's certificate of candidacy or a petition for disqualification. In her Petition, private respondent Fragata did not argue that petitioner made a false material representation in her Certificate of Candidacy; she asserted that petitioner was a permanent resident disqualified to run for Councilor under Section 40 of the Local Government Code. Private respondent Fragata's Petition, therefore, was a petition for disqualification.<br><br>It follows that private respondent Fragata timely filed her Petition before the Commission on Elections. Under Rule 25, Section 3 of the Rules of Procedure of the Commission, a petition for disqualification "shall be filed any day after the last day for filing of certificates of candidacy, but not later that the date of proclamation." Private respondent Fragata filed her Petition on the date of petitioner's proclamation on May 15, 2013. The Commission on Elections did not gravely abuse its discretion in taking cognizance of private respondent Fragata's Petition.<br><br>In addition, the Commission on Elections correctly admitted private respondent Bacani's pleading-in-intervention.<br><br>An adverse decision against petitioner would require a pronouncement as to who should assume the position of Councilor. Hence, those who believe that they are entitled to the position may prove their legal interest in the matter in litigation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> and may properly intervene for a complete disposition of the case.<br><br>Private respondent Bacani claims that she is entitled to the position of Councilor. In her Motion to Intervene, she argues for petitioner's disqualification and alleges the circumstances surrounding petitioner's dual citizenship. She then cites <i>Maquiling</i>, arguing that she should be proclaimed a in lieu of petitioner because she obtained the sixth highest number of votes among the qualified candidates. Private respondent Bacani's intervention was, therefore, proper.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>The Commission on Elections did not gravely abuse its discretion in disqualifying petitioner, annulling her proclamation, and subsequently proclaiming private respondent Bacani as the duly elected Councilor for the Fourth District of Manila.<br><br>Petitioner was born to Filipino parents in 1967, which makes her a natural-born Filipino under the 1935 Constitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> Ten years later, on December 7, 1977, petitioner became a naturalized American. Hence, she lost her Filipino citizenship pursuant to Section 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 63.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>It was on September 21, 2011 when petitioner took an Oath of Allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines, thus reacquiring her Filipino citizenship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> From September 21, 2011 up to the present, however, petitioner failed to execute a sworn and personal renunciation of her foreign citizenship particularly required of those seeking elective public office. Section 5(2) of the Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003 provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 5. <i>Civil and Political Rights and Liabilities</i>. - Those who retain or re-acquire Philippine citizenship under this Act shall enjoy full civil and political rights and be subject to all attendant liabilities and responsibilities under existing laws of the Philippines and the following conditions:<br>....<br><br>(2) Those seeking elective public office in the Philippines shall meet the qualifications for holding such public office as required by the Constitution and existing laws and, at the time of the filing of the certificate of candidacy, make a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship before any public officer authorized to administer an oath[.]<br></blockquote><br>Petitioner cannot claim that she has renounced her American citizenship by taking the Oath of Allegiance. The oath of allegiance and the sworn and personal renunciation of foreign citizenship are separate requirements, the latter being an<i> additional</i> requirement for qualification to run for public office. In <i>Jacot v. Dal</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[T]he oath of allegiance contained in the Certificate of Candidacy, which is substantially similar to the one contained in Section 3 of Republic Act No. 9225, does not constitute the personal and sworn renunciation sought under Section 5(2) of Republic Act No. 9225. It bears to emphasize that the said oath of allegiance is a general requirement for all those who wish to run as candidates in Philippine elections; while the renunciation of foreign citizenship is an additional requisite only for those who have retained or reacquired Philippine citizenship under Republic Act No. 9225 and who seek elective public posts, considering their special circumstance of having more than one citizenship.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup></blockquote><br>With petitioner's failure to execute a personal and sworn renunciation of her American citizenship, petitioner was a dual citizen at the time she filed her Certificate of Candidacy on October 3, 2012. Under Section 40 of the Local Government Code, she was disqualified to run for Councilor in the Fourth District of Manila during the 2013 National and Local Elections.<br><br>Petitioner, however, argues that the Commission on Elections gravely abused its discretion in proclaiming private respondent Bacani, the mere seventh placer among the candidates for Councilor and, therefore, not the electorate's choice. Petitioner maintains that the vacancy left by her disqualification should be filled according to the rule on succession under Section 45(a)(l) of the Local Government Code, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 45. <i><b>Permanent Vacancies in the Sanggunian</b></i>. - (a)&nbsp; Permanent vacancies in the sanggunian where automatic successions provided above do not apply shall be filled by appointment in the following manner:<br><br>(1) The President, through the Executive Secretary, in the case of the sangguniang panlalawigan and the sangguniang panlungsod of highly urbanized cities and independent component cities[.]</blockquote><br>The permanent vacancies referred to in Section 45 are those arising "when an elective local official fills a higher vacant office, refuses to assume office, fails to qualify, dies, is removed from office, voluntarily resigns, or is otherwise permanently incapacitated to discharge the functions of his office."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> In these situations, the vacancies were caused by those whose certificates of candidacy were valid at the time of the filing "but subsequently had to be cancelled because of a violation of law that took place, or a legal impediment that took effect, after the filing of the certificate of candidacy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br>The rule on succession under Section 45, however, would not apply if the permanent vacancy was caused by one whose certificate of candidacy was void ab initio. Specifically with respect to dual citizens, their certificates of candidacy are void ab initio because they possess "a substantive [disqualifying circumstance] . . . [existing] prior to the filing of their certificate of candidacy."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Legally, they should not even be considered candidates. The votes casted for them should be considered stray and should not be counted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>In cases of vacancies caused by those with void ab initio certificates of candidacy, the person legally entitled to the vacant position would be the candidate who garnered the next highest number of votes among those eligible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> In this case, it is private respondent Bacani who is legally entitled to the position of Councilor, having garnered the sixth highest number of votes among the eligible candidates. The Commission on Elections correctly proclaimed private respondent Bacani in lieu of petitioner.<br><br>Petitioner may have garnered more votes than private respondent Bacani. She may have already been proclaimed. Nevertheless, elections are more than a numbers game. Hence, in <i>Maquiling</i>:<br><br><blockquote>The ballot cannot override the constitutional and statutory requirements for qualifications and disqualifications of candidates. When the law requires certain qualifications to be possessed or that certain disqualifications be not possessed by persons desiring to serve as elective public officials, those qualifications must be met before one even becomes a candidate. When a person who is not qualified is voted for and eventually garners the highest number of votes, even the will of the electorate expressed through the ballot cannot cure the defect in the qualifications of the candidate. To rule otherwise is to trample upon and rent asunder the very law that sets forth the qualifications and disqualifications of candidates. We might as well write off our election laws if the voice of the electorate is the sole determinant of who should be proclaimed worthy to occupy elective positions in our republic.<br>. . . .<br><br>As in any contest, elections are governed by rules that determine the qualifications and disqualifications of those who are allowed to participate as players. When there are participants who turn out to be ineligible, their victory is voided and the laurel is awarded to the next in rank who does not possess any of the disqualifications nor lacks any of the qualifications set in the rules to be eligible as candidates.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup></blockquote><br>All told, petitioner Arlene Llena Empaynado Chua is a dual citizen correctly disqualified from running for the position of Councilor in the Fourth District of Manila during the 2013 National and Local elections. With her dual citizenship existing prior to the filing of the certificate of candidacy, her Certificate of Candidacy was void ab initio. She was correctly considered a non-candidate. All votes casted for her were stray, and the person legally entitled to the position is private respondent Krystle Marie C. Bacani, the candidate with the next highest number of votes among the eligible candidates. The Commission on Elections did not gravely abuse its discretion in annulling Chua's proclamation and subsequently proclaiming private respondent Bacani.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition is <b>DISMISSED</b>.
