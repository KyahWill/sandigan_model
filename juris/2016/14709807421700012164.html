The RTC found the testimonies of their witnesses credible, in that the money of Melecia was used in buying the property but the name of Godofredo was used when the title was obtained because Godofredo lived in Cagayan de Oro City while Melecia lived in Bornay, Gitagum, Misamis Oriental.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Thus, the RTC held that a trust was established by operation of law pursuant to Article 1448 of the Civil Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The dispositive portion of the RTC's Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered, and this Court hereby:<br><ol><li>Declares that the Spouses Godofredo and Baldomera Nacalaban held the land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-2259 issued in the name of Godofredo Nacalaban married to Baldomera Dalondonan issued on January 13, 1959 in trust for Melecia Vda. de Dalondonan with the Spouses as the trustees and Melecia Vda. de Dalondonan as the <u>cestui que trust</u>;<br><br></li><li>Declares that upon the death of Melecia Vda. de Dalondonan on August 20, 1997, the ownership and beneficial interest of the foregoing Land passed to the plaintiffs and individual defendants by operation of law as legal heirs of Melecia Vda. de Dalondonan;<br><br></li><li>Nullifies the Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate of Deceased Person with Sale executed by the individual defendants on July 30, 1996 and known as Doc.

The CA held that: (1) the defense of co-ownership based on an implied trust by a defendant in an unlawful detainer case shall not divest the MTCC of jurisdiction over the case;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (2) the dead man's statute does not apply because Gabutan, <i>et al.</i>'s counsel did not interpose any objection when the testimony of Crisanta Ubaub was offered and Gabutan, <i>et al.</i>'s counsel even examined her;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (3) Nacalaban, <i>et al</i>.'s claim that Gabutan, <i>et al.</i>'s witnesses are not competent to testify on matters which took place before the death of Godofredo and Melecia is without merit because Gabutan, <i>et al</i>. have not specified these witnesses and such hearsay evidence alluded to;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> (4) the parole evidence rule does not apply because Melecia and Nacalaban, <i>et al</i>. were not parties to the Deed of Conditional Sale;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (5) the action for reconveyance has not yet prescribed because Gabutan, <i>et al</i>. are in possession of the property;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> and (6) the College is a buyer in good faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Nacalaban, et al. filed their motion for reconsideration of the CA Decision, but it was denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> dated August 17, 2010. Hence, they filed the present petition for <i>certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> under Rule 65, where they allege that: (1) the action for reconveyance already expired;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> (2) for an action for reconveyance to prosper, the property should not have passed into the hands of another who bought the property in good faith and for value;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> and (3) the title of Godofredo under TCT No. T-2259 which was issued on January 13, 1959 could not be attacked collaterally.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Gabutan, <i>et al</i>. filed the present petition for review on certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> under Rule 45, seeking a partial appeal of the CA Decision. In their petition, Gabutan, <i>et al</i>. allege that the College is not a buyer in good faith because it did not buy the property from the registered owner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Since Godofredo was the registered owner of the property and not Nacalaban,<i> et al</i>., the College should have exercised a higher degree of prudence in establishing their capacity to sell it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Further, despite knowing that other persons possessed the property, the College did not inquire with Gabutan, <i>et al.</i> the nature of their stay on the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Under Section 1, paragraph 2, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court, the publication of the Extrajudicial Settlement with Sale was also without prejudice to claims of other persons who had no notice or participation thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Finally, Gabutan, <i>et al</i>. argue that they cannot be ejected from the property because there is no evidence to show that their stay was by mere tolerance, and that Melecia was a builder in good faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Considering that the petitions assail the same CA Decision and involve the same parties, we issued a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> dated December 13, 2010 consolidating them.<br><br><u><center><b>The Issues</b></center></u><br><br>The issues for resolution are:<br><br><ol><li>Whether the petition for <i>certiorari</i> of Nacalaban, <i>et al</i>. shall prosper;<br></li><li>Whether the action for reconveyance was proper; and<br></li><li>Whether the College is a buyer in good faith.<br></li></ol><br><u><center><b>Our Ruling</b></center></u><br><br><i>I. The petition for certiorari of<br>Nacalaban, et al. is a wrong<br>remedy</i><br><br>Pursuant to Section 1, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> the proper remedy to obtain a reversal of judgment on the merits, final order or resolution is an appeal. The Resolution dated August 17, 2010 of the CA, which affirmed its Decision dated December 11, 2008, was a final resolution that disposed of the appeal by Nacalaban, <i>et al</i>. and left nothing more to be done by the CA in respect to the said case. Thus, Nacalaban, <i>et al</i>. should have filed an appeal in the form of a petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>and not a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65, which is a special civil action.<br><br>Rule 65 is a limited form of review and is a remedy of last recourse. This extraordinary action lies only where there is no appeal nor plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> In<i> Malayang Manggagawa ng Stayfast Phils., Inc. v. National Labor Relations Comission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> we held that appeal would still be the proper remedy from a judgment on the merits, final order or resolution even if the error ascribed to the court rendering the judgment is its lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, or the exercise of power in excess thereof, or grave abuse of discretion in the findings of fact or of law set out in the decision, order or resolution. The existence and availability of the right of appeal prohibits the resort to <i>certiorari</i> because one of the requirements for the latter remedy is that there should be no appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> We have always declared that a petition for<i> certiorari </i>is not a substitute for an appeal where the latter remedy is available but was lost through fault or negligence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>Here, Nacalaban, <i>et al</i>. received the assailed Resolution dated August 17, 2010 on September 7, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Under the Rules of Court, they had 15 days or until September 22, 2010 to file an appeal before us. Nacalaban, <i>et al.</i> allowed this period to lapse without doing so and, instead, filed a petition for certiorari on November 5, 2010.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Being the wrong remedy, the petition of Nacalaban,<i> et al</i>. is, therefore, dismissible. Although there are exceptions<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> to this general rule, none applies in this case.<br><br>In spite of the consolidation we have ordered, we cannot treat the petition of Nacalaban, <i>et al.</i> as one under Rule 45. We have the discretion to treat a Rule 65 petition for <i>certiorari </i>as a Rule 45 petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> if (1) the petition is filed within the reglementary period for filing a petition for review; (2) when errors of judgment are averred; and (3) when there is sufficient reason to justify the relaxation of the rules.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> The first and third requisites are absent in this case. To reiterate, the petition was filed beyond the 15-day reglementary period of filing a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>. As will be discussed, we also find no compelling reason to relax the rules.<br><br><i>II. The action for reconveyance <br>filed by Gabutan, et al.<br>is proper</i><br><ol type="a"><li><i>An implied resulting trust was <br>created between Melecia and<br>Godofredo</i></li></ol><br>We stress at the outset that the question of existence of an implied trust is factual, hence, ordinarily outside the purview of Rule 45.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> The resolution of factual issues is the function of the lower courts whose findings, when aptly supported by evidence, bind us. This is especially true when the CA affirms the lower court's findings, as in this case. While we, under established exceptional circumstances, had deviated from this rule, we do not find this case to be under any of the exceptions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> Even if we were to disregard these established doctrinal rules, we would still affirm the assailed CA rulings.<br><br>Article 1448 of the Civil Code provides in part that there is an implied trust when property is sold, and the legal estate is granted to one party but the price is paid by another for the purpose of having the beneficial interest of the property. The former is the trustee, while the latter is the beneficiary. The trust created here, which is also referred to as a purchase money resulting trust,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> occurs when there is (1) an actual payment of money, property or services, or an equivalent, constituting valuable consideration; (2) and such consideration must be furnished by the alleged beneficiary of a resulting trust.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> These two elements are present here.<br><br>Gabutan,<i> et al</i>., through the testimonies of Felisia, Crisanta, and Trifonia, established that Melecia's money was used in buying the property, but its title was placed in Godofredo's name. She purchased the property because Felisia wanted to build a pharmacy on it.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> On one occasion in Melecia's house, and when the entire family was present, Melecia gave Godofredo the money to purchase the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Melecia entrusted the money to Godofredo because he was in Cagayan de Oro, and per Melecia's instruction, the deed of sale covering the property was placed in his name.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> It was allegedly her practice to buy properties and place them in her children's name, but it was understood that she and her children co-own the properties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>Melecia built a residential building on the property, where her daughter Crisanta and some of her grandchildren resided.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> Godofredo also thereafter built a house on the property. Twice, he also mortgaged the property to secure loans. Melecia allowed him to do so because she trusted him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> After Godofredo's death, and when Baldomera fell ill, there were family discussions to transfer the title in Melecia's name so Melecia's children can divide it together with the rest of Melecia's properties. The plans, however, always fell through.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>Both the RTC and CA found credence on these pieces of testimonial evidence that an implied resulting trust exists. Reliance on these testimonies will not violate the parol evidence rule, as Nacalaban, <i>et al</i>. once raised. In <i>Tong v. Go Tiat Kun,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> we ruled that since an implied trust is neither dependent upon an express agreement nor required to be evidenced by writing, Article 1457 of our Civil Code authorizes the admission of parol evidence to prove their existence. What is crucial is the intention to create a trust.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> We cautioned, however, that the parol evidence that is required to establish the existence of an implied trust necessarily has to be trustworthy and it cannot rest on loose, equivocal or indefinite declarations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> The testimonies of Felisia, Crisanta, and Trifonia satisfy these requirements. They are consistent and agree in all material points in reference to the circumstances behind the arrangement between Melecia and Godofredo. We agree with the RTC when it said that this arrangement among family members is not unusual, especially in the 1950s.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>Nacalaban, <i>et al.</i>, on the other hand, denied the arrangement between Melecia and Godofredo, and maintained that it was really the latter who purchased the property from its original owners, as evidenced by their possession of the Deed of Conditional Sale and the title being in Godofredo's name.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> It is telling, however, that Nacalaban, <i>et al</i>. failed to provide the details of the sale, specifically with regard to how Godofredo could have been able to afford the purchase price himself, which would have directly refuted the allegation that Melecia's money was used in the purchase. As the RTC aptly observed, if Godofredo really bought the property with his own money, it was surprising that Baldomera did not transfer the title of the property to her name when Godofredo died in 1974. Baldomera did not do so until her death in 1994 despite being pressed by her siblings to partition the property. The RTC correctly deduced that this only meant that Baldomera acknowledged that the property belongs to Melecia.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>Having established the creation of an implied resulting trust, the action for reconveyance filed by Gabutan, <i>et al</i>., the heirs of Melecia in whose benefit the trust was created, is proper. An action for reconveyance is a legal and equitable remedy granted to the rightful landowner, whose land was wrongfully or erroneously registered in the name of another, to compel the registered owner to transfer or reconvey the land to him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> It will not amount to a collateral attack on the title, contrary to the allegation of Nacalaban, <i>et al</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> We explained in <i>Hortiznela v. Tagufa</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br><blockquote>x x x As a matter of fact, an action for reconveyance is a recognized remedy, an action <i>in personam,</i> available to a person whose property has been wrongfully registered under the Torrens system in another's name. In an action for reconveyance, the decree is not sought to be set aside. It does not seek to set aside the decree but, respecting it as incontrovertible and no longer open to review, seeks to transfer or reconvey the land from the registered owner to the rightful owner. Reconveyance is always available as long as the property has not passed to an innocent third person for value.<br><br>There is no quibble that a certificate of title, like in the case at bench, can only be questioned through a direct proceeding. The MCTC and the CA, however, failed to take into account that in a complaint for reconveyance, the decree of registration is respected as incontrovertible and is not being questioned. What is being sought is the transfer of the property wrongfully or erroneously registered in another's name to its rightful owner or to the one with a better right. If the registration of the land is fraudulent, the person in whose name the land is registered holds it as a mere trustee, and the real owner is entitled to file an action for reconveyance of the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br></blockquote><br>The fact that the property was already titled in Godofredo's name, and later transferred to the College, is not a hindrance to an action for reconveyance based on an implied trust. The title did not operate to vest ownership upon the property in favor of the College. As held in <i>Naval v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br><blockquote>xxx Registration of a piece of land under the Torrens System does not create or vest title, because it is not a mode of acquiring ownership. A certificate of title is merely an evidence of ownership or title over the particular property described therein. It cannot be used to protect a usurper from the true owner; nor can it be used as a shield for the commission of fraud; neither does it permit one to enrich himself at the expense of others. Its issuance in favor of a particular person does not foreclose the possibility that the real property may be co-owned with persons not named in the certificate, or that it may be held in trust for another person by the registered owner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup></blockquote><br>Moreover, the body of the Complaint filed by Gabutan, <i>et al.</i> shows that it is not only for the reconveyance of the property but also for the annulment of TCT No. T-111846 issued in the name of the College.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> Gabutan,<i> et al. </i>questioned the validity of the sale to the College and claimed co-ownership over the property. Thus, we can rule on the validity of TCT No. T-111846 since the Complaint is a direct attack on the title of the College.<br><ol start="2" type="a"><li><i>The action for reconveyance is imprescriptible <br>because the plaintiffs are in possession of<br> the property</i><br></li></ol>An action for reconveyance based on an implied or a constructive trust prescribes 10 years from the alleged fraudulent registration or date of issuance of the certificate of title over the property. However, an action for reconveyance based on implied or constructive trust is imprescriptible if the plaintiff or the person enforcing the trust is in possession of the property. In effect, the action for reconveyance is an action to quiet the property title, which does not prescribe.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> The reason is that the one who is in actual possession of the land claiming to be its owner may wait until his possession is disturbed or his title is attacked before taking steps to vindicate his right. His undisturbed possession gives him a continuing right to seek the aid of a court of equity to ascertain and determine the nature of the adverse claim of a third party and its effect on his own title, which right can be claimed only by one who is in possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><br>The fact of actual possession of Gabutan, <i>et al</i>. of the property, during the lifetime of Melecia and even after her death, is an undisputed and established fact. The College has even filed an ejectment case against the Heirs of Melecia for this reason.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> Thus, their complaint for reconveyance is imprescriptible. It follows, with more reason, that Gabutan, et al. cannot be held guilty of laches as the said doctrine, which is one in equity, cannot be set up to resist the enforcement of an imprescriptible legal right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br><br><i>III.The property shall be reconveyed to the estate of Melecia<br><ol type="a"><li>The Extrajudicial Settlement with Sale executed<br> between Nacalaban, et al. and the College is void</li></ol></i><br>Having established the creation of an implied resulting trust between Melecia and Godofredo, the law thereby creates the obligation of the trustee to reconvey the property and its title in favor of the true owner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> The true owner, Melecia, died in 1997 and was succeeded by her children and grandchildren. The property, therefore, must be reconveyed to her estate.<br><br>The execution of the Extrajudicial Settlement with Sale between Godofredo's heirs and the College will not defeat the legal obligation to reconvey the property because at the time of its execution in 1996, Melecia was still alive. Hence, Nacalaban, <i>et al</i>. did not have the right or authority to sell the property. <i>Nemo dat quod non habet</i>. One can sell only what one owns or is authorized to sell, and the buyer can acquire no more right than what the seller can transfer legally.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> Nacalaban, <i>et al</i>. cannot find refuge in their argument that the property was registered in their father's name and that after his death, his rights passed to them as his legal heirs.

We see an exception, however, to this general rule relative to the finding that the College is a buyer in good faith. We hold that the RTC's finding that the College is a buyer in good faith, which finding was upheld by the CA, was based on an obvious misapprehension of facts and was clearly not supported by law and jurisprudence.<br><br>In <i>Bautista v. Silva,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> we reiterated the requisites for one to be considered a purchaser in good faith:<br><br><blockquote>A buyer for value in good Faith is one who buys property of another, without notice that some other person has a right to, or interest in, such property and pays full and fair price for the same, at the time of such purchase, or before he has notice of the claim or interest of some other persons in the property. He buys the property with the welt-founded belief that the person from whom he receives the thing had title to the property and capacity to convey it.<br><br>To prove good faith, a buyer of registered and titled land need only show that he relied on the face of the title to the property. He need not prove that he made further inquiry for he is not obliged to explore beyond the four corners of the title. <b>Such degree of proof of good faith, however, is sufficient only when the following <br>conditions concur: <i>first</i>, the seller is the registered owner of the land; <i>second</i>, the latter is in possession thereof; and <i>third</i>, at the time of the sale, the buyer was not aware of any claim or interest of some other person in the property, or of any defect or restriction in the title of the seller or in his capacity to convey title to the property.</b><br><br>Absent one or two of the foregoing conditions, then the law itself puts the buyer on notice and obliges the latter to exercise a higher degree of diligence by scrutinizing the certificate of title and examining all factual circumstances in order to determine the seller's title and capacity to transfer any interest in the property. Under such circumstance, it is no longer sufficient for said buyer to merely show that he relied on the face of the title; he must now also show that he exercised reasonable precaution by inquiring beyond the title. Failure to exercise such degree of precaution makes him a buyer in bad faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br>Thus, the College, which has the burden to prove the status of being a purchaser in good faith, is required to prove the <b>concurrence</b> of the above conditions. This <i>onus probandi</i> cannot be discharged by mere invocation of the legal presumption of good faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> We find that the College failed to discharge this burden.<br><br>Firstly, as correctly pointed out by Gabutan, <i>et al</i>., Nacalaban, <i>et al</i>. are not the registered owners of the property, but Godofredo. In <i>Bautista v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> we held:<br><br><blockquote>However, it is important to note that petitioners did not buy the land from the registered owner, Dionisio Santiago. They bought it from his heirs, Maria dcla Cruz and Jose Santiago.<br><br>Where a purchaser buys from one who is not the registered owner himself, the law requires a higher degree of prudence even if the land object of the transaction is registered. One who buys from one who is not the registered owner is expected to examine not only the certificate of title but all factual circumstances necessary for him to determine if there are any flaws in the title of the transferor, or in his capacity to transfer the land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup></blockquote><br>Secondly, the College was aware that aside from Nacalaban, <i>et al</i>., the Heirs of Melecia, were also in possession of the property. The College cited the tax declaration which bore an annotation that Melecia owned a residential building and Godofredo owned the lot.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> Also, apart from filing an ejectment case against the Heirs of Melecia, the College retained part of the purchase price for the demolition of Melecia's building as well.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup><br><br>In<i> Occeña v. Esponilla</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> we held that petitioner-spouses were not purchasers in good faith when they merely relied on the representation of the seller regarding the nature of possession of the occupants of the land:<br><br><blockquote>In the case at bar, we find that petitioner-spouses failed to prove good faith in their purchase and registration of the land, x x x At the trial, Tomas Occena admitted that he found houses built on the land during its ocular inspection prior to his purchase. <b>He relied on the representation of vendor Arnold that these houses were owned by squatters and that he was merely tolerating their presence on the land.

There is no evidence that the College did inquire from Melecia or her heirs themselves, who were occupying the property, the nature and authority of their possession. It is not far-fetched to conclude, therefore, that the College merely relied on the representations of the sellers and the documents they presented. In this regard, the College is not a buyer in good faith.<br><br>The "honesty of intention" which constitutes good faith implies a <b>freedom from knowledge of circumstances which ought to put a person on inquiry</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> If the land purchased is in the possession of a person other than the vendor, the purchaser must be wary and must investigate the rights of the actual possessor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> Without such inquiry, the purchaser cannot be said to be in good faith and cannot have any right over the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup><br><br>We are aware that in the ejectment case, the MTCC and RTC ruled in favor of the College. We emphasize, though, that the ruling on the College's better right of possession was without prejudice to the eventual outcome of the reconveyance case where the issue of ownership was fully threshed out. We have held that the sole issue for resolution in an unlawful detainer case is physical or material possession of the property involved, independent of any claim of ownership by any of the parties. When the defendant, however, raises the defense of ownership in his pleadings and the question of possession cannot be resolved without deciding the issue of ownership, the issue of ownership shall be resolved only to determine the issue of possession.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> Thus, the ruling on the ejectment case is not conclusive as to the issue of ownership. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> in G.R.
