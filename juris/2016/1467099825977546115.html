The trial court held:<br><br><blockquote>As correctly raised by the respondents, in order for a petition for mandamus, the petitioner must show that he has a well defined, clear and certain right for the grant thereof. Section 3 Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court refers to unlawful neglect of the performance of an act enjoined by law or which unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is entitled.<br><br>In the advent of RA 6758 and DBM CC[C] No. 10, the petition must clearly establish with certainty the relief sought.

There was likewise no showing of a law that clearly establishes petitioners' legal right to the same which respondents may be directed to implement. Considering the reissuance and publication of DBM CC[C] No. 10, a question arises whether the payment of cost of living allowance would continue. This already creates doubt as to the legal basis of petitioner's (sic) claim. Clearly, petitioners must first establish a clear legal right to the act required to be done or the relief sought.

The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply when the issue deals with a question of law:<br><br><blockquote>[The case] does not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the parties. There is a question of law when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, and not as to the truth or the falsehood of alleged facts. Said question [of law] at best could be resolved only tentatively by the administrative authorities. <i>The final decision on the matter rests not with them but with the courts of justice.</i> Exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply, because nothing of an administrative nature is to be or can be done. The issue does not require technical knowledge and experience but one that would involve the interpretation and application of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>Issues dealing with the interpretation of law solely involve a question of law. A question of law exists when the law applicable to a particular set of facts is not settled, whereas a question of fact arises when the truth or falsehood of alleged facts is in doubt.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>The case involves a question of law, specifically, whether Republic Act No. 6758 and the re-issuance and publication of the Department of Budget and Management's Corporate Compensation Circular No. 10 entitle petitioners to the back pay of the COLA.<br><br><center>II<br></center><br>Republic Act No. 6758 and its implementing rules, Corporate Compensation Circular No. 10, have already included the COLA in the government worker's standardized salary rates.<br><br>This Court is mindful that the case of<i> Tañada v.

This is erroneous.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758 states the general rule on integration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> That is to say, all allowances are generally integrated into the government employee's standardized salary rates:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 12. <i>Consolidation of Allowances and Compensation. </i>-</b> <i>All allowances,</i> except for representation and transportation allowances; clothing and laundry allowances; subsistence allowance of marine officers and crew on board government vessels and hospital personnel; hazard pay; allowances of foreign service personnel stationed abroad; and such other additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be determined by the DBM, shall be <i>deemed included in the standardized salary </i>rates herein prescribed. Such other additional compensation, whether in cash or in kind, being received by incumbents only as of July 1, 1989 not integrated into the standardized salary rates shall continue to be authorized. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>By exception, Section 12 provides for seven (7) types of allowances that do not form part of basic pay, or non-integrated allowances. All other allowances, save for these items, are deemed included in the government employee's standardized salary. These are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>(1) representation and transportation allowances (RATA);<br><br>(2) clothing and laundry allowances;<br><br>(3) subsistence allowance of marine officers and crew on board government vessels;<br><br>(4) subsistence allowance of hospital personnel;<br><br>(5) hazard pay;<br><br>(6) allowances of foreign service personnel stationed abroad; and<br><br>(7) such other additional compensation not otherwise specified in Section 12 as may be determined by the [Department of Budget and Management].<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup></blockquote><br>In <i>National Tobacco Administration v.

This is because the COLA is not an allowance that seeks to reimburse expenses incurred in the fulfillment of the government worker's official functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Rather, as this Court has ruled in <i>Gutierrez, et al. v. Department of Budget and Management, et al</i>.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> the COLA is meant to cover for the government employee's rising cost of living:<br><br><blockquote>As defined, cost of living refers to "the level of prices relating to a range of everyday items" or "the cost of purchasing those goods and services which are included in an accepted standard level of consumption." Based on this premise, COLA is a benefit intended to cover increases in the cost of living. Thus, it is and should be <i>integrated into the standardized salary rates.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>We now determine whether the Department of Budget and Management likewise excludes the COLA from the exceptions to the general rule on integration, pursuant to item 7 of Section 12.<br><br>In <i>Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Employees Hired After July 1, 1989 v.
