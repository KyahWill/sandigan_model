Case No. 2004-819, Cad. Record No. 936.<br><br><u><center><b>The Antecedent Facts</b></center></u><br>On 19 August 2004, Mae Flor Galido (petitioner) filed before the RTC of San Jose, Antique a petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> to cancel all entries appearing on Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) Nos. T-22374, T-22375 and T-22376, all in the name of Isagani Andigan (Andigan), and to annul TCT No. T-24815 and all other TCTs issued pursuant to the Order dated 18 October 2011 of RTC Branch 11, San Jose, Antique (Branch 11) in RTC Civil Case No. 2001-2-3230. The petition was raffled to RTC Branch 12, San Jose, Antique (trial court) and docketed as RTC Cad. Case No. 2004-819 Cad. Record No. 936.<br><br>The controversy revolves around three parcels of land, designated as Lot 1052-A-l, Lot 1052-A-2 and Lot 1052-A-3, all of the San Jose, Antique Cadastre. These parcels of land were, prior to subdivision in 1999, part of Lot 1052-A which was covered by TCT No. T-21405 in the name of Andigan.<br><br>On 28 December 1998, Andigan sold undivided portions of Lot 1052-A to Nelson P. Magrare (Magrare), Evangeline M. Palcat (Palcat) and Rodolfo Bayombong (Bayombong). To Magrare was sold an undivided portion with an area of 700 square meters, more or less; to Palcat, 1,000 square meters, more or less; and to Bayombong, 500 square meters, more or less.<br><br>Andigan caused the subdivision of Lot 1052-A into five lots, namely: Lot 1052-A-l, Lot 1052-A-2, Lot 1052-A-3, Lot 1052-A-4 and Lot 1052-A-5. On 18 October 1999, TCT No. T-21405 was cancelled and new certificates were issued for the subdivided portions. Pertinent to the case are TCT No. T-22374 which was issued for Lot 1052-A-l, TCT No. T-22375 for Lot 1052-A-2 and TCT No. T-22376 for Lot 1052-A-3, all in the name of Andigan. Andigan did not turn over the new TCTs to Magrare, Palcat and Bayombong, and the latter were unaware of the subdivision.<br><br>On 8 May 2000, Andigan mortgaged the same three lots to petitioner and the latter came into possession of the owner's duplicate copies of TCT Nos. T-22374, T-22375 and T-22376.<br><br>On 6 February 2001, at 11:00 a.m., Magrare, Palcat and Bayombong registered their respective adverse claims on TCT Nos. T-22374, T-22375 and T-22376. On the same day, at 3:00 p.m., petitioner also registered her mortgage on the same TCTs, such that the certificates in the custody of the Register of Deeds were annotated thus:<br><br><blockquote><center>TCT No. T-22374<br></center><br>Entry No. 246290 - Adverse Claim - executed by Nelson Magrare, covering the parcel of land described herein subject to the conditions embodied in the instrument on file in this office.

They registered their adverse claims upon discovery of the subdivision. Neither were they aware that Andigan had mortgaged the lots he sold to them. They only discovered the mortgage when they requested certified true copies of TCT Nos. T-22374, T-22375 and T-22376, in preparation for filing a petition to compel delivery.<br><br>On the other hand, Andigan insisted that he made demands on Magrare, Palcat and Bayombong to pay for the costs of subdividing Lot 1052-A and registering the subdivided lots. Their failure to pay the costs was his motivation in withholding the TCTs from them. In other words, Andigan did not dispute that the undivided portions of Lot 1052-A he sold them were indeed Lot 1052-A-1 covered by TCT No. T-22374, Lot 1052-A-2 covered by TCT No. T-22375 and Lot 1052-A-3 covered by TCT No. T-22376.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On 18 October 2001, RTC Branch 11 issued an Order granting the petition, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the PETITION dated February 16, 2001 is hereby granted and, in consequence, the respondent spouses ISAGANI ANDIGAN and MERL[E] ANDIGAN are hereby directed to surrender or deliver to the Register of Deeds for Antique the owner's duplicate copies of Transfer Certificates of Title Nos.

However, at the time Andigan mortgaged the lots to petitioner he had already sold the same to Magrare, Palcat and Bayombong. Indeed, petitioner's case is negated by Civil Case No. 2001-2-3230. There, Andigan admitted that Lot Nos. 1052-A-l, 1052-A-2 and 1052-A-3 were the parcels of land he sold to Magrare, Palcat and Bayombong, respectively, on 28 December 1998.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Hence, when Andigan mortgaged the lots to petitioner on 8 May 2000, he no longer had any right to do so. We quote with approval the discussion of the trial court:<br><br><blockquote>Finally, when the spouses Andigan mortgaged to the herein petitioner Galido Lot Nos. 1052-A-l and 1052-A-2, the said lots were already sold to the respondents Palcat and Magrare. It is therefore as if nothing was mortgaged to her because Isagani Andigan was no longer the owner of the mortgaged real property. Under Art. 2085 of the Civil Code, two of the prescribed requisites for a valid mortgage are, that, the mortgagor be the absolute owner of the thing mortgaged and, that, he has the free disposal thereof. These requisites are absent when Isagani Andigan and his wife mortgaged the lots alluded to above to the herein petitioner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></blockquote><br>A spring cannot rise higher than its source. Since Andigan no longer had any interest in the subject properties at the time he mortgaged them to her, petitioner had nothing to foreclose.<br><br><center><i>Prior Registered Adverse Claims Prevail</i></center><br>The parcels of land involved in this case are registered under the Torrens system.

They were already in existence when petitioner filed her case for foreclosure of mortgage. In fact, when petitioner registered the mortgages on 6 February 2011 at 3:00 in the afternoon, she was charged with the knowledge that the properties subject of the mortgage were encumbered by interests the same as or better than that of the registered owner.<br><br>Petitioner does not hide the fact that she was aware of the adverse claim and the proceedings in Civil Case No. 2001-2-3230. In her petition before the Court, she stated that "on March 03, 2004, petitioner had filed a third party claim with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 11 in said Civil Case No. 2001-2-3230."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Instead, petitioner insists that it was illegal for Magrare, Palcat and Bayombong to file a case compelling the surrender of the owner's duplicates of TCT Nos. T-22374, T-22375 and T-22376. On the contrary, the law itself provides the recourse they took - registering an adverse claim and filing a petition in court to compel surrender of the owner's duplicate certificate of title:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 70. <i>Adverse claim</i>. Whoever claims any part or interest in registered land adverse to the registered owner, arising subsequent to the date of the original registration, may if no other provision is made in this Decree for registering the same, make a statement in writing setting forth fully his alleged right or interest, and how or under whom acquired, a reference to the number of the certificate of title of the registered owner, the name of the registered owner, and a description of the land which the right or interest is claimed.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Sec. 107. <i>Surrender of withheld duplicate certificates.</i> Where it is necessary to issue a new certificate of title pursuant to any involuntary instrument which divests the title of the registered owner against his consent or where a voluntary instrument cannot be registered by reason of the refusal or failure of the holder to surrender the owner's duplicate certificate of title, the party in interest may file a petition in court to compel surrender of the same to the Register of Deeds. The court, after hearing, may order the registered owner or any person withholding the duplicate certificate to surrender the same, and direct the entry of a new certificate or memorandum upon such surrender. If the person withholding the duplicate certificate is not amenable to the process of the court, or if for any reason the outstanding owner's duplicate certificate cannot be delivered, the court may order the annulment of the same as well as the issuance of a new certificate of title in lieu thereof. Such new certificate and all duplicates thereof shall contain a memorandum of the annulment of the outstanding duplicate.<br></blockquote><br>Further, RTC Branch 11, after trial on the merits of Civil Case No. 2001-2-3230, found for Magrare, Palcat and Bayombong. That decision has attained finality and was entered in the Book of Judgments. The trial court was correct in not touching upon the final and executory decision in that case.<br><br><center><i>Petitioner is not a Buyer in Good Faith</i></center><br>But even assuming that the mortgage was valid, petitioner can hardly be considered a buyer in good faith. A purchaser in good faith and for value is one who buys the property of another without notice that some other person has a right to or interest in such property and pays a full and fair price for the same at the time of such purchase, or before he has notice of the claims or interest of some other person in the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>As discussed above, petitioner had notice as early as 2001 of the adverse claims of Magrare, Palcat and Bayombong. The decision in Civil Case No. 2001-2-3230 became final and executory before the Certificate of Sale was issued by the Provincial Sheriff on 14 July 2004 in Civil Case No. 3345.<br><br>Without speculating as to petitioner's motivations in foreclosing on the mortgage, the law on the matter is clear. Preference is given to the prior registered adverse claim because registration is the operative act that binds or affects the land insofar as third persons are concerned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Thus, upon registration of respondents' adverse claims, notice was given the whole world, including petitioner.<br><br>Hence, the trial court's dismissal of the case against Magrare and Palcat is in order. There is no need for us to discuss petitioner's other assignments of error. Besides, the same issues were sufficiently addressed by the Court of Appeals.<br><br><center><i>Heirs of Bayombong are Indispensable Parties</i></center><br>However, we find reversible error on the part of the trial court in not impleading the heirs of Bayombong. Indispensable parties are parties in interest without whom no final determination can be had of an action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Petitioner's action was for the cancellation of titles, including TCT No. T-22376. In its Order dated 17 January 2005,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[51]</sup></font> the trial court itself recognized that the controversy was contentious in nature, and required the participation of Bayombong, among others. Bayombong, like respondents Magrare and Palcat stood to be benefited or prejudiced by the outcome of the case. Since he was already dead at the time the case was filed by petitioner, the heirs of Bayombong stand in his stead not only as parties in interest, but indispensable parties. Without the heirs of Bayombong to represent the interest of Bayombong, there can be no complete determination of all the issues presented by petitioner, particularly, in regard to TCT No. T-22376.<br><br>Failure to implead an indispensable party is not a ground for the dismissal of an action, as the remedy in such case is to implead the party claimed to be indispensable, considering that parties may be added by order of the court, on motion of the party or on its own initiative at any stage of the action.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>By denying petitioner's motion to implead the heirs of Bayombong due to technicalities, the trial court in effect deprived petitioner a full adjudication of the action, and the heirs of Bayombong any beneficial effects of the decision. Indeed, the dismissal of the petition as to Magrare and Palcat greatly benefits them as the controversy regarding TCT Nos. T-22374 and T-22375 is finally laid to rest. Not so with the heirs of Bayombong. We note that the trial court's decision discusses TCT Nos. T-22374 and T-22375. The records do not contain any direct refutation of the claim of petitioner as to TCT No. T-22376, as could be expected since there were no parties impleaded to defend such interest. Hence, we cannot, without depriving petitioner due process, extend the trial court's decision to TCT No. T-22376.<br><br>Given the Court's authority to order the inclusion of an indispensable party at any stage of the proceedings,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the heirs of Bayombong are hereby ordered impleaded as parties-defendants. Since the action has been disposed of as regards Magrare and Palcat, the action is to proceed solely against the heirs of Bayombong, once they are properly impleaded.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>We note that the counsel representing Magrare and Palcat is the same counsel that represented Magrare, Palcat and Bayombong in Civil Case No. 2001-2-3230. There is no information on record, apart from petitioner's allegation, whether or not counsel informed the court of the death of Bayombong, in accordance with Section 16, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. Nevertheless, for expediency, Arty. Alexis C. Salvani is directed to provide the trial court and petitioner the full names and addresses of the heirs of Bayombong to enable the trial court to properly implead them.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>GRANT</b> the petition <b>IN PART</b>.
