				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A judge embodies the law; she cannot be above it. She should not use it to advance her personal convenience, or to oppress others. She should be obedient to the rules and directives enunciated by the Supreme Court for the effective administration of justice; otherwise, she becomes an arrogant tyrant. Being a magistrate of the law, she must comport herself in a manner consistent with the dignity of her judicial office, and must not commit any act that erodes public confidence in the Judiciary.<br><br>In these consolidated administrative proceedings, we resolve the several charges of gross misconduct, gross ignorance of the law, gross insubordination, oppression, and conduct unbecoming of a judge leveled by various complainants, some of.them her fellow Judges, against respondent Judge Eliza B. Yu, the Presiding Judge of Branch 47, Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) in Pasay City.<br><br>On June 4, 2013, A.M. No. MTJ-12-1813 was consolidated with A.M.

No. MTJ-12-1813<br>(<i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Eliza B. Yu</i>)</b><br></center><br>On January 27, 2011, the Court, through Chief Justice Renata C. Corona, issued Administrative Order No. 19-2011<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> in response to the specific request of Secretary Alberto A. Lim of the Department of Tourism (DOT) to establish night courts in Pasay City and Makati City. A.O. No. 19-2011 designated the branches of the MeTC in Pasay City and Makati City as night courts to expeditiously hear and try cases involving nighttime apprehensions, special cases under the <i>Rule on Summary Procedure</i>, and criminal cases involving tourists, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><center><b>ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 19-2011<br><br>ESTABLISHING NIGHT COURTS IN THE METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURTS OF PASAY CITY AND MAKATI CITY</b><br></center><br><b>WHEREAS,</b> the Constitution mandates the speedy disposition of cases of all persons before judicial bodies;<br><br><b>WHEREAS,</b> "the Executive Judges of the Metropolitan Trial Courts and Municipal Trial Courts in Cities of the cities and municipalities comprising Metro Manila x x x may assign all judges to hold night court sessions daily from Monday to Friday and on official holidays and special days."<br><br><b>WHEREAS,</b> in line with the constitutional mandate on the speedy disposition of cases and in the exercise of its power of administrative supervision over all courts, the Supreme Court has ordered (a) the establishment of night courts in the Metropolitan Trial Courts of Manila "to try and decide all special cases enumerated in the Rule on Summary Procedure," and (b) the opening of two branches in the Metropolitan Trial Courts of Quezon City as night courts to hear "cases involving nighttime apprehensions" and special cases enumerated in the Rule on Summary Procedure;<br><br><b>WHEREAS,</b> the Court held that the operational guidelines for the assignment of judges and the holding of night court sessions in Manila shall also be applicable to the night courts established in Quezon City;<br><br><b>WHEREAS,</b> the Court requires the expeditious disposition of criminal cases involving tourists;<br><br><b>WHEREAS,</b> the Honorable Secretary Alberto A. Lim of the Department of Tourism has requested the designation of night courts also in Pasay City and Makati City, in addition to those already existing in Manila and Quezon City;<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> it is hereby directed that:<br><blockquote>1. Night courts similar to those designated in the Metropolitan Trial Courts of Manila City and Quezon City be established in the Metropolitan Trial Courts of Pasay City and Makati City;<br><br>2. The operational guidelines for the assignment of judges and the holding of night court sessions in the Metropolitan Trial Courts of Manila be applicable to the night courts in the Metropolitan Trial Courts of Pasay City and Makati City, respectively, except operating hours, which shall be from four-thirty in the afternoon (4:30 p.m.) until eleven o'clock in the evening (11:00 p.m.);<br><br>3. The night courts of Pasay City and Makati City be authorized to try and decide cases involving nighttime apprehensions and all special cases enumerated in the Rule on Summary Procedure;<br><br>4. The provisions of Administrative Circular No. 58-2002, dated 14 November 2002, requiring an expeditious disposition of criminal cases involving tourists be complied with; and<br><br>5. The Executive Judges of the Metropolitan Trial Courts of Pasay City and Makati City (a) to inform the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Prosecutor's Office within their respective jurisdictions of the schedule of the branches of the metropolitan trial courts assigned to hold night sessions; and (b) make representations with the PNP and the local government units to ensure that appropriate security measures are adopted to protect the judges and their staff during night sessions.<br></blockquote>Immediate compliance with this order is enjoined.<br><br>27 January 2011.<br></blockquote>To comply with A.O. No. 19-2011, then Pasay City MeTC Executive Judge Bibiano G. Colasito issued a Memorandum dated February 9, 2011<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> prescribing the schedules for night court service of all Pasay City MeTC Judges and employees effective February 14, 2011. Under the Memorandum, MeTC Branch 47, presided by respondent Judge Yu, was assigned night court duties every Friday. But Judge Yu did not desire to comply, and so inscribed the following marginal note on the February 9, 2011 Memorandum of Judge Colasito, to wit:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><blockquote>February 11, 2011<br><br>Pls. I dissent with the night court assignment. I have pending legal question before the Office of Court Administrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>The pending legal question Judge Yu adverted to had been posed in her letter dated February 2, 2011 to the Court Administrator Jose Midas P. Marquez,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>Sir:<br><br>Our Court is in receipt of Administrative Order No. 19-2011 (Establishing Night Courts in the Metropolitan Trial Courts of Pasay City and Makati City) today.<br><br>Among others, it is provided that: "3. The night Courts of Pasay City and Makati City be authorized to try and decide cases involving night time apprehensions and all special cases enumerated in the Rule on Summary Procedure."<br><br>With due respect, <b>the police officers cannot apprehend, detain and bring the arrested persons charged with cases covered by the Rule on Summary Procedure at night without being liable for Arbitrary Detention. The arrested persons need not post bail under the Rule on Summary Procedure. Thus, there is no legal basis for the police officers to detain them prior to the hearing of their cases at night by the court. Moreover, the public prosecutors cannot conduct inquest on the night arrests of the suspected criminals because the penalty involved in cases covered by the Rule on Summary Procedure is not more than six (6) months. Inquest can be conducted only where the penalty is four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day and above. The night inquest without the release of the arrested suspects is questionable. It can make the public prosecutors criminally and administratively liable.<br><br>It is tedious for the public prosecutor and the public attorney to attend the night court from 4:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. after attending an exhaustive hearing in the morning then attend the hearing on the following day, without additional pay.<br><br>Unlike in Manila Metropolitan Trial Courts where the cases tried by night courts are mostly violation of ordinances, in Pasay Metropolitan Trial Courts, most of the cases filed are Theft, B.P. Blg. 6 and P.D. No. 1602 that entail full blown trial because the accused refuses to enter into a plea bargaining. In this sense, the establishment of night courts in Pasay City cannot unclog a court's criminal docket.</b> (Bold emphases supplied)<br><br>Please enlighten us on this concern.<br><br>Thank you.<br></blockquote>It appears that the Station Investigation and Detective Management Section (SIDMS) of the Pasay City Police Station received a copy of Judge Yu's letter to Court Administrator Marquez. Wary of the potential criminal liability of apprehending officers adverted to in the letter, Police Chief Inspector Raymund A. Liguden of the SIDMS sought clarification from the Office of the Pasay City Prosecutor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> In response, the Office of the Pasay City Prosecutor explained through Prosecutor Dolores P. Rillera that the apprehending officers could become liable for arbitrary detention only when they failed to refer the arrested persons for inquest proceedings within the periods specified under Article 125 of the <i>Revised Penal Code</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Apprised of the explanation from the Office of the Pasay City Prosecutor, Judge Yu requested Prosecutor Rillera to refer the matter to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and request a legal opinion thereon,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> even as she requested Court Administrator Marquez to have her letter to Prosecutor Rillera docketed as an administrative matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Judge Yu communicated her reservations about the night court by letter directly to DOT Secretary Lim,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> pointing out that the DOT's request for the establishment of the night courts was supported neither by statistical data nor by any study. After rendering a lengthy discourse on the flaws of establishing night courts, she ended her letter with a request for additional compensation and security in case she would undertake night court duties. The pertinent portions of her letter ran as follows:<br><blockquote>Dear Sir:<br><br>This Court learned that you requested for the designation of night courts in Pasay City that resulted to the issuance of Administrative Order No. 19-2011 (Establishing Night Courts in the Metropolitan Trial Courts of Pasay City and Makati City) dated January 27, 2011.<br><br><b>With due respect, there is insufficient basis for your request. There was no statistical data present or there was no study conducted by your department recommending the necessity of establishing night courts in Pasay City.</b> For the record, this Court is yet to hear a case involving any tourist. <b>Moreover, the tourists should be advised not to roam around the city at night so as not to be victims of various crimes. Usually, the perception of the tourists who are going around the city at night is negative, for they are likely to be engaging in unlawful nocturnal activities. They are at their own risk at night.</b><br><br><b>There was no prior consultation with the police officers, public attorneys, public prosecutors, judges and their staff before your department requested for the creation of night courts in Pasay City.<br><br>There are many concerns which your department did not consider.<br><br>First, some of the rights of the accused who were charged with cases covered by the Summary Procedure are impaired by the operation of night courts.</b> x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Second, night courts in Manila City and Quezon City are criticized for being ineffective and non-functional.</b> In Manila City, when I was a public prosecutor, I questioned as to the legality of the detention of the accused being arraigned at night for violation of ordinances. When I was not given any legal justification, I requested to be relieved from night court. My experience showed that night court is a waste of time for all. The cases tried at night court can be tried during day time without burdening the three (3) pillars of our criminal justice system. xxx. The cases tried are violation of city ordinances, mostly on illegal vending in the night courts. I heard that these cases were filed for money making scheme by the police officers. From the information gathered, only those accused who did not give them money were arrested, detained and brought to the night courts.<br><br><b>Third, there is a grave violation of the right of government employees against long and extended period of work with no additional pay at night.</b> This is a form of exploitation of workers whose rights are enshrined under the Constitution. It bears pointing out that additional compensation for night time work is founded on public policy.<br><blockquote>x x x x.<br><br><b>Fourth, it is very burdensome to attend the court at night.</b><br><br>x x x x.<br><br><b>Fifth, it is risky to work at night because of lack of security.</b><br><br>x x x x.<br></blockquote><b>Lastly, the establishment of night courts in Pasay City will not unclog a court's criminal docket.</b> The situation in Manila City and Quezon City are not similar with Pasay City. x x x. In Manila Metropolitan Trial Courts, majority of the accused pay the fine for the violation of ordinances not involving any tourist crime during the night court hearing. Also, a study must be conducted by your department, if necessary, about the effectiveness of night courts in Manila City and Quezon City, and if these night courts are attaining the purposes they were created. If not, there is no reason for the establishment of a night court or tourism court here in Pasay City. Another thing, there is uneven assignment of judges alone to the night court. x x x.<br><br>I hope you find merit with this letter. May your department reconsider your request for the establishment of night courts in Pasay City. With due respect, <b>it will be appreciated if your department will give additional compensation and provide police security to the judges, public prosecutors, public attorneys and the entire court staff, if it insist of</b> [sic] <b>establishing night courts here without conducting any study</b>.<br><br>x x x x. (Bold emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>On May 5, 2011, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), through Assistant Court Administrator (ACA) Thelma C. Bahia, responded to the concerns raised by the Judge Yu in the following manner:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><blockquote>This refers to your letter dated February 2, 2011 apprising us of certain concerns relative to the establishment of night courts in Pasay City.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The first concern has been ably explained in the attached letter dated February 25, 2011 of Prosecutor Dolores P. Rillera, Chief, Inquest Division, Office of the City Prosecutor, Pasay City, addressed to Police Chief Inspector Raymond A. Liguden, Chief SIDMS, Pasay City, who, having been furnished a copy of your letter dated February 2, 2011, subsequently sought the guidance of Prosecutor Rillera on the matter.<br><br>With respect to the second point you raised, prosecutors and public attorneys of Pasay City had long been assigned their respective schedules to handle inquest proceedings until 10 p.m. prior to the designation of night courts in Pasay City. Attending night courts would not be as tedious as you surmise. Besides, prosecutors and public attorneys already receive allowances for staying beyond office hours.<br><br>As to the third issue, the main consideration for the designation of night courts is to address the matter of nighttime apprehension which include offenses enumerated in the Rule of Summary Procedure. Priority is also given to those criminal cases where the offended party or the complainant is a tourist or transient in the country as already explained in Administrative Circular No. 58-2002 dated November 14, 2002.<br><br>Be reminded that judges, prosecutors and public attorneys are public officers who are duty bound to serve with the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency and whose main concern in the performance of their duties is public welfare and interest.<br><br>Please be guided accordingly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br></blockquote>Ostensibly not satisfied, Judge Yu replied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> pertinently stating:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>With due respect, your letter did not address the issues raised in my letter dated February 11, 2011 to Hon.

She further declared that it would be best to either hire a new lawyer or to call for another batch of applicants in the event that Ms. Bernardo would not be appointed.<br><br>The OCA-SPBLC, through Deputy Court Administrator Nimfa C. Vilches, denied Judge Yu's request for Ms. Bernardo's temporary designation pursuant to Section 2(b), Rule III of the <i>Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Personnel Actions</i> in view of the availability of a qualified applicant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On April 14, 2011, Ms. Tejero-Lopez learned from Ms. Emmie San Miguel, the then OIC of Branch 47, that Judge Yu had wanted her to execute a waiver or withdrawal of her application.<br><br>Wishing to settle the issue of the appointment amicably, Ms. Tejero-­Lopez paid Judge Yu a visit in her chambers. The meeting between them was hostile. In describing the meeting, Ms. Tejero-Lopez pointed out that Judge Yu had shouted and exclaimed at her: "<i>Nanggugulo ka[!] Ikaw ang nanggugulo[!] katatawag ko lang sa Supreme Court, Sabi ng Supreme Court, ikaw ang nanggugulo[!]</i>." Ms. Tejero-Lopez recalled that Judge Yu then demanded her withdrawal with a threat to revoke her appointment later on. Faced with the prospect of eventually losing her job, Ms. Tejero-Lopez decided to withdraw her application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>On April 26, 2011, Judge Yu asked for the reconsideration with the OCA-SPBLC by submitting a copy of the withdrawal of the application signed by Ms. Tejero-Lopez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>However, by her letter dated May 10, 2011, Ms. Tejero-Lopez retracted her withdrawal, and signified her intention to pursue her application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>After an investigation that established that Ms. Tejero-Lopez did not voluntarily withdraw her application, the OCA-SPBLC continued processing her appointment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> and she was eventually appointed Clerk of Court III effective May 31, 2011.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Upon receiving her appointment on June 7, 2011, Ms. Tejero-Lopez went to Judge Yu's chambers to take her oath, but the latter refused her request to administer her oath. According to Ms. Tejero-Lopez, Judge Yu questioned the integrity of the selection process, and told her directly that the Court had appointed her in retaliation to her refusal to render night court service. Judge Yu threatened Ms. Tejero-Lopez with criminal cases of grave coercion and trespassing, and contempt of court if she persisted on taking her oath of office. Judge Yu further vowed to assail the appointment before the Court and the Civil Service Commission (CSC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>On the same day, Judge Yu wrote to Atty. Caridad A. Pabello, Chief of Office, OCA-Office of Administrative Services (OCA-OAS),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> to protest the appointment, to wit:<br><blockquote>Madam:<br><br>Thank you for your telegram today. Please be informed that Leilani Lopez has withdrawn her application as Clerk of Court III in this court [a] long time ago. <b>She failed to comply</b> (sic) <b>all the requirements for the consideration of her application for such position because, among others, she has no personal endorsement from this court despite her last ditch attempt to get it on March 7, 2011.</b> This court did not sign an important document for her relative to the position thus her application cannot be considered by the Selection and Promotion Board for the Lower Courts at all. Moreover, <b>this court has continuing protest against her appointment in this court to date. And this was reiterated to Leilani Lopez few moments ago</b>.<br><br>Please be guided accordingly.<br><br>x x x x (Bold emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>A week later, Judge Yu sent another letter stating that she had apprised Ms. Tejero-Lopez of her possible indictment for unlawful appointment, grave coercion and unjust vexation, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> She thereby also expressed her refusal to honor the "<i>void ab initio</i>" appointment of Ms. Tejero-Lopez, which she characterized as "<i>a big joke</i>." For the fullest appreciation of the contents, the letter is quoted herein below:<br><blockquote>Madam:<br><br>Please be informed that today Leilani Lopez, the applicant for Clerk of Court III who has withdrawn her application long time ago, sought to see me because of her appointment, <b>a legally infirm one</b>. I accommodated her for a brief talk for the last time, hoping to not see her again and never to bother me anymore.<br><br><b>It was explained to her that she will face possible indictment of, among others, unlawful appointment, grave coercion and unjust vexation, all punishable under the Revised Penal Code, if she forcibly insist to take a seat in this court despite of numerous oral and written opposition by the court to her selection and appointment. Likewise, she can be thrown to jail for contempt of court, if such callousness and discourteousness continue to exist in this court.</b> Moreover, she was told that if thievery extends to public office, the elements of Theft under our penal code were established <i>prima facie</i>, as the concept of apoderamiento or unlawful taking predominates in this situation, an affront of the Rule of Law, showing that the Rule of Jungle where might is right triumphs as can be gleaned in a paper, a null and void appointment paper held by her. <b>Her appointment is highly questionable. Leilani Lopez received the proverbial forbidden apple, obviously grown from a toxic tree. Our court advised her for the last time not to eat it, or she will suffer the grave consequences, without any taint of threats to her. The ways of a scholar seem not to have a place in this prestigious institution, for her appointment is an example of brute force, they say it is a rape of the honor of this bench, others say it is a spit of insult.</b> However, this court will not press formal charges against the poor Leilani Lopez, a sorry victim of a subtle power play. Article 24 of the New Civil Code says indirectly that the court must be vigilant for the protection of morally dependent, ignorant, indigent, mentally weak, tenderness of age or other handicap of a person. Your office must be reminded that I took my oath seriously before SC Justice Antonio B. Nachura, and I swore to him that I will uphold the Constitution, and I will remain faithful to my oath even after his retirement in the judiciary. Consequently, <b>this court will not honor the void ab initio appointment of Leilani Lopez, a big joke and so this court is laughing at her</b> and all others who are like her, not to put her and others down, only to treat this delicate matter lightly in jest strange things, sometimes contrary to law or contrary to the spirit of the law, do happen in judiciary. <b>The Selection and Promotion Board for the Lower Court is funny, and it made me laugh.</b> I rather laugh than be angry, than feel helpless, than look powerless in this awful and mean situation. Firmness of decision anchored on the principles of righteousness and justice is one of the characteristic of this unassuming court. I am happy to feel that God is with me, and He not Satan is cheering with me in this lonely fight as to what is right and just.<br><br>Thank you. (Bold emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>On June 17, 2011, Judge Yu submitted her formal protest<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> against Ms. Tejero-Lopez' appointment, as follows:<br><blockquote>Chief Justice Renato C. Corona<br>Supreme Court<br>P. Faura St., Manila City<br><br><center>FORMAL PROTEST TO THE APPOINTMENT OF LEILANI LOPEZ AS BRANCH CLERK OF COURT OF METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT BRANCH 47, PASAY CITY<br></center><br>Sir:<br><br><b>All the laws provide the inherent relief of protest by the incumbent judge to an appointment of any staff in his or her court. The appointed applicant Leilani Lopez is not qualified and not fit to work as the branch clerk of court in my sala.</b><br><br><b>Leilani Lopez lacked personal indorsement.</b> The applicant knew this, and so she said to me on June 14, 2011 that she does not know why she was appointed. She attempted to get a personal indorsement from me on March 7, 2011 that I rejected. She must submit her neuro-psychiatric test results to me and to the Board because it is definitely abnormal, some kind of an obsession, to insist in clinging on to a position of a branch clerk of court after numerous oral and written opposition by a judge she will be working with. This alone is a sign that she is unfit for the job. Her obsession is dark, it is destructive because she places her own personal interest over public interest[.] [w]ith her presence in my court, the public will definitely suffer, and so the judiciary. I as a judge will suffer. <b>I am demoralized with this rotten system of appointing an unfit applicant. I am unhappy right now of her appointment, and it will affect my enthusiasm and productivity in court. I expressed my disgust unabashedly before the Chief of OAS and the lawyer from the Legal Department, and so I felt discourteous as I was a victim of discourtesy here.</b> For showing lack of delicadeza, Leilani Lopez was rejected openly[,] verbally[,] and in writing, made to her by me and my court staff [sic] for numerous times, thus she is callous and discourteous.<br><br>Leilani Lopez deceived me by giving me a formal letter of her withdrawal of application, only to find out yesterday that she filed her waiver of withdrawal which disclosure should have been made to me by her in good faith. This qualifies her for the crime of Other Deceits under Article 318 of the Revised Penal Code. In doing this, she does not have my trust and confidence, a biting reality since the time she applied for the position until her numerous rejections. Dishonesty encompasses all that deviates sense of honesty. Our workplace provides that "Dishonesty is a serious offense which reflects a person's character and exposes the moral decay which virtually destroys honor, virtue, and integrity. It is a malevolent act that has no place in the judiciary, as no other office in the government service exacts a greater demand for moral righteousness from an employee than a position in the judiciary." If Leilani Lopez has a gull [sic] to deceive me at this point in time, giving me her formal withdrawal letter and filing her waiver of her withdrawal letter without my knowledge, and this was not disclosed to me by her despite her opportunities to do so, this meant that she has a dishonorable and vicious character, undeserving to be in my court. She did this deceitful conduct to me and she showed unpredictable actuations to me and to the Board while she is still an applicant, she will most likely do it as a branch clerk of court in my sala. And so I will always be wary with her presence in my court, and it is a tremendous mental stress or for me as a judge.<br><br>With due respect, <b>there was a misconstruction of the laws on selection and appointment of court personnel by the Board</b>, it presupposes that all the applicants submitted for consideration by the Board must have good and harmonious working relationship with a judge he or she will work with and so the judge must have assented or agreed to the proposed application of all applicants, expressly or impliedly. If an appointed applicant is not the liking of the judge, there will be disharmony in the court. The working relationship with [sic] be based on mistrust and distrust. It will not accomplish anything good for the judiciary as a whole. Each other's working life as a judge and as a branch clerk of court will be miserable. This is not the spirit of the letter of all the laws pertaining to selection and appointment of Supreme Court employee aspiring for confidential position such as branch clerk of court. In fact, I believe that the branch clerk of court must be co-terminus with a judge's assignment in a particular court. <b>I do not engage in a power play, it happens that the personal indorsement of a branch clerk of court is my prerogative as a judge and I want to exercise that prerogative to accomplish excellently in my judicial and non-judicial tasks. There were substantive and procedural flaws with her selection and appointment as branch clerk of court. The laws surrounding the irregular appointment of Leilani Lopez, including the fact of not resolving my grievance prior to her appointment, were misapplied in her case. We do not uphold the laws that cause quarrel and dissension in court. Assuming Leilani Lopez took her oath of an irregular appointment which she is aware of, my recourse as a judge is to ask for her detail to another court, preferable to the Selection and Promotion Board</b>. This will not contribute for the success of my court in the interest of public service. Our workplace deprived me of a court staff who I can completely trust, and help me accomplish great things in the judiciary. The Board deprived me already of my prerogative to choose my branch clerk of court, and so I want this deprivation to be put on record. If I lose this legal battle in this workplace, I am a winner because I brought to your attention, and all Supreme Court justices, ultimately the public, such unrighteous and unjust manner of selecting and appointing a branch clerk of court. <b>You may have been misled by the Board in signing her appointment. You have many things to do as Chief Justice, sometimes, you may not have read the minutes of Board and merely followed its recommendation. As a judge, I have my rights and privileges, and far more considered than the rights and privileges of an applicant for a branch clerk of court, a virtual stranger to me at the time of her application, and now her character is dubious to me. Imagine, this kind of irregular appointment invites suits and casts disrepute amongst us, I doubt if this is what our Supreme Court envisions or our Constitution dreams for the Supreme Court.</b> I re-plead all my letters and the attachments dated June 15 and 16, 2011 pertaining to the appointment of Leilani Lopez that were furnished to the Office of the Court Administrator and to you to form part of this formal protest.

While I thank you for your honest to goodness answer, and I would like to return the favor by answering your question but judges have restrictions and limited correspondence online. Judges are expected to be courteous to fellow judges. I promised not to speak or write anything about Emily that would put her in bad light. I honor my promises. She has high aspirations in the judiciary which we should support. Besides, we are enemies for judicial excellence awards. You can ask her directly the question please. She is the only one who can answer it correctly. My lips are sealed this time. Have a nice day. Thank you. God bless!<br><br>Bambie Yu July 3 at 6:04am Report<br><br>PS: Just to take advantage of your generosity, because Emily broke her vow not to open her Facebook account which she claimed to be Pandora's box, can you do me a little favor, to ask her to delete all my emails? She told me she kept all my old emails despite my instruction to delete them after reading. Our emails contained gossips which will lead to our disbarment as honorable members of the bar. Thus, I was anxious to learn from your post that hinted she opened up her Facebook account again yesterday, this meant she broke a vow. My emails may still be there, and I have waited for her assurance that she have deleted all. I did not receive any such assurance from her that my emails are gone except that she closed her FB account. I was relieved with that closed FB account until yesterday. I kept writing her before to delete my emails. She does not reply. Anyway, I am not going to speak anything bad against her. I would be glad if I will get an assurance from you, as her bestfriend, that she already deleted the emails. We are not speaking to each other because we have a huge misunderstanding and, I said earlier, we are enemies, mortal enemies for the judicial excellence award.<br><br>Thank you again &amp; good day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup><br></blockquote>Judge San Gaspar-Gito formally filed the present administrative complaint on July 12, 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup><br><br>Judge Yu submitted her comment by way of a compliance dated October 12, 2010,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> and attached her own complaint-affidavit charging Judge San Gaspar-Gito with conduct unbecoming of a judge, and requesting the OCA to conduct a discreet investigation on the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup> She manifested that she had come upon two versions of Judge San Gaspar-Gito's complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup><br><br><br>The following day, Judge Yu wrote to the OCA expressing her dissatisfaction over the investigation being conducted by the OCA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup><br><br>On October 22, 2010 Judge Yu submitted a supplemental manifestation arguing that Judge San Gaspar-Gito did not only violate the <i>Code of Judicial Ethics</i>, the <i>Civil Code</i> and the <i>Revised Penal Code</i>, but also Republic Act No. 8792, specifically Section 32<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> on confidentiality of electronic messages.

No. 19-2011</b><br></center><br>Judge Yu forthwith resisted the implementation of A.O. No. 19-2011 because of her unresolved protest against the issuance. She explained that her compliance with A.O. No. 19-2011 would render her protest moot. But her unresolved protest was not a sufficient justification for her to resist the implementation of A.O. No. 19-2011. She was quite aware that A.O. No. 19-2011 was issued pursuant to Section 6, Article VIII of the Constitution, which confers to the Court the power of administrative supervision over all courts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[200]</sup> and was for that reason an issuance to be immediately implemented and unquestioningly obeyed by the affected Judges.<br><br>The resistance by Judge Yu to the the implementation of A.O. No. 19-2011 was unexpected. She was quite aware that A.O. No. 19-2011 was not a mere request for her to comply with only partially, inadequately or selectively,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[201]</sup> or for her to altogether disregard. At the very least, her resistance to A.O. No. 19-2011 manifested an uncommon arrogance on the part of a Judge of a court of the first-level towards the Court itself. Such attitude smacked of her unbecoming condescension towards the Court and her judicial superiors. We cannot tolerate her attitude lest it needlessly sows the seeds of aiTogance in others that can ultimately destroy the faith and trust in the hierarchy of courts so essential in the effective functioning of the administration of justice.<br><br>Moreover, Judge Yu's resistance to the implementation of A.O. No. 19-2011 disrupted the orderliness of the other Pasay City MeTCs to the prejudice of public interest. This effect became unavoidable, for Executive Judge Colasito necessarily required the other courts to render additional night court duties to cope with her refusal to render night court duties.<br><br>Judge Yu compounded her condescension towards the Court and her judicial superiors by her bypassing them to directly communicate her personal reservations about A.O. No. 19-2011 to Secretary Lim, the proponent of holding the night courts, and other quarters like the police authority in Pasay City. Her reservations extended to assailing the legal foundation and the practicality for holding the night courts. Her doing so broadcast to them the notion that obedience to A.O. No. 19-2011 and similar issuances of the Court could be deferred at the whim and caprice of a lowly­ ranked judicial officer like her. Although she might have regarded her reservations as impressed with outstanding merit, that was no justification for her to defer or reject the implementation of A.O. No. 19-2011 in her court for any length of time, and to be public about it. A.O. No. 19-2011 dealt with an administrative matter on the administration of justice and procedure over which the Court was the supreme and sole authority. She should have the maturity to know so, and to bow her head before that authority. Her freedom to exercise her constitutional right to free speech and expression was not a consideration. She had no privilege to disobey; hers was but to follow.<br><br>Judge Yu's having directly communicated her misgivings about A.O. No. 19-2011 to Secretary Lim and to other quarters was beyond forgiving by the Court. She thereby strongly hinted that the Court was altogether wrong and impractical about holding night courts. What she accomplished from such exercise was to broadcast how little regard she had for the Court and its issuances. Her attitude constituted an open insubordination that extensively diminished the respect owed to the Court by the public, especially by the latter who were directly affected in the implementation of A.O. No. 19-2011. There is no question that when a Judge becomes the transgressor of the law that she has sworn to uphold, she places her office in disrepute, encourages disrespect for the law, and impairs public confidence in the integrity of the Judiciary itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[202]</sup><br><br>It is timely for the Courrto use this occasion to remind Judge Yu and other judicial officers of the land that although they may enjoy the freedoms of speech and expression as citizens of the Republic, they should always conduct themselves, while exercising such freedoms, in a manner that should preserve the dignity of their judicial offices and the impartiality and independence of the Judiciary. As to this duty to observe self-restraint, Section 6, Canon 4 of the <i>New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary</i> is clear and forthright, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Sec. 6. Judges, like any other citizen, are entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly, but in exercising such rights, they shall always conduct themselves in such a manner as to preserve the dignity of the judicial office and the impartiality and independence of the judiciary.<br></blockquote>For sure, Judge Yu's expression of her dissent against A.O. No. 19-2011 was misplaced. We may as well declare that she did not enjoy the privilege to dissent. Regardless of her reasons for dissenting, she was absolutely bound to follow A.O. No. 19-2011. Indeed, she did not have the unbridled freedom to publicly speak against A.O. No. 19-2011 and its implementation, for her being the Judge that she was differentiated her from the ordinary citizen exercising her freedom of speech and expression who did not swear obedience to the orders and processes of the Court without delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[203]</sup> Her resistance to the implementation of A.O. No. 19-2011 constituted gross insubordination and gross misconduct,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup> and put in serious question her fitness and worthiness of the honor and integrity attached to her judicial office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup><br><br>According to <i>Himalin v. Balderian</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup> the refusal of a Judge to comply with any resolution or directive of the Court constituted insubordination and gross misconduct, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>[A] judge who deliberately and continuously failed and refused to comply with a resolution of this Court was held guilty of gross misconduct and insubordination, the Supreme Court being the agency exclusively vested by our Constitution with administrative supervision over all courts and court personnel from the Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeals to the lowest municipal trial court clerk. The Court can hardly discharge such constitutional mandate of overseeing judges and court personnel and taking proper administrative sanction against them if the judge or personnel concerned does not even recognize its administrative authority.<br></blockquote>Insubordination is the refusal to obey some order that a superior officer is entitled to give and to have ob yed. It imports a willful or intentional disregard of the lawful and reasonable instructions of the employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup> Judge Yu's obstinate resistance to A.O. No. 19-2011 displayed both her rebellious character and her disdain and disrespect for the Court and its directives.<br><br>Judge Yu's unwillingness to comply with A.O. No. 19-2011 was also a betrayal of her sworn duty to maintain fealty to the law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup> and brought dishonor to the Judiciary. In that regard, her conduct amounted to gross misconduct, defined as follows:<br><blockquote>Misconduct means intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of a rule of law or standard of behavior in connection with one's performance of official functions and duties. For grave or gross misconduct to exist, the judicial act complained of should be corrupt or inspired by the intention to violate the law, or a persistent disregard of well-known rules. The misconduct must imply wrongful intention and not a mere error of judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup><br></blockquote>In all, Judge Yu exhibited an unbecoming arrogance in committing insubordination and gross misconduct. By her refusal to adhere to and abide by A.O. No. 19-2011, she deliberately disregarded her duty to serve as the embodiment of the law at all times. She thus held herself above the law by refusing to be bound by the issuance of the Court as the duly constituted authority on court procedures and the supervision of the lower courts. To tolerate her insubordination and gross misconduct is to abet lawlessness on her part. She deserved to be removed from the service because she thereby revealed her unworthiness of being part of the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[210]</sup><br><br><center><b>II<br>Refusal to honor the appointments of court personnel</b><br></center><br>Although Judge Yu insisted on the irregularity of the appointment of Ms. Tejero-Lopez for lack of personal endorsement from her as the Presiding Judge, and of the appointment of Ms. Lagman due to a pending administrative complaint, the appointments of Ms. Tejero-Lopez and Ms. Lagman were valid and regular. As such, Judge Yu had no good reason to reject the appointments.<br><br>To start with, Ms. Tejero-Lopez and other applicants had undergone scrutiny and processing by the duly constituted committee, and the OCA had then signed and executed the appointment. Nonetheless, the authority to appoint still emanated from the Court itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[211]</sup> Judge Yu's objection to Ms. Tejero-Lopez's appointment for lack of her personal endorsement was not enough to negate the appointment. Judge Yu had no right to reject the appointment, making her rejection another instance of gross insubordination by her. This consequence has been elucidated in <i>Edaño v. Asdala</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[212]</sup> as follows:<br><blockquote>[R]espondent Judge Asdala, in insisting on the designation of respondent Nicandro as OIC, blithely and willfully disregarded the Memorandum of this Court, through the OCA, which approved the designation of Amy Soneja alone and not in conjunction with respondent Nicandro - as OIC. <b>While the presiding judge, such as respondent Judge Asdala, can recommend and endorse persons to a particular position, this recommendation has to be approved by this Court. Again, the respondent judge ought to know that the Constitution grants this Court administrative supervision over all the courts and personnel thereof.</b> In the case at bar, despite the Court's approval of Amy Soneja's designation, the respondent judge allowed, if not insisted on, the continued discharge of the duties of OIC by respondent Nicandro. Respondent Judge Asdala even had the gall to insist that as presiding judge she has the authority and discretion to designate "anyone who works under her, as long as that person enjoys her trust and confidence." Coming from a judge, such arrogance, if not ignorance, is inexcusable. The memorandum from the OCA regarding the designation of court personnel is no less an order from this Court. Court officials and personnel, particularly judges, are expected to comply with the same. Respondent judge's gross insubordination cannot be countenanced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[213]</sup><br></blockquote>Judge Yu could only recommend an applicant for a vacant position in her court for the consideration of the SPBLC, which then accorded priority to the recommendee if the latter possessed superior qualifications than or was at least of equal qualifications as the other applicants she did not recommend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[214]</sup> The SPBLC explained to Judge Yu the selection process that had resulted in the appointment of Ms. Tejero-Lopez. She could not impose her recommendee on the SPBLC which was legally mandated to maintain fairness and impartiality in its assessment of the applicants<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[215]</sup> based on performance, eligibility, education and training, experience and outstanding accomplishments, psycho-social attributes and personality traits, and potentials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[216]</sup><br><br>Secondly, Judge Yu's rejection of the appointment of Ms. Lagman was just as unwarranted.<br><br>Under Section 34, Rule II of the <i>Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service</i> (URACCS),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup> a pending administrative complaint shall not disqualifY an employee from promotion, thus:<br><blockquote>Section 34. <i>Effect of the Pendency of an Administrative Case</i>. - Pendency of an administrative case shall not disqualify respondent from promotion or from claiming maternity/paternity benefits.<br><br>For this purpose, a pending administrative case shall be construed as follows:<br><blockquote>a. When the disciplining authority has issued a formal charge; or <br><br>b. In case of a complaint filed by a private person, a <i>prima facie</i> case is found to exist by the disciplining authority.<br></blockquote></blockquote>The rule, which is reiterated in Section 42 of the <i>Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service</i> (RRACCS) of 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[218]</sup> cannot be interpreted otherwise.<br><br>Accordingly, Judge Yu's administrative complaint had no bearing on Ms. Lagman's appointment, more so because Ms. Lagman was held liable only for simple misconduct, a less grave offense that did not merit termination from public service for the first offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[219]</sup> It is relevant to point out, too, that Judge Yu had no personality to object to or oppose Ms. Lagman's appointment, considering that only a qualified next-in-rank employee has been recognized as a party-in-interest to file the protest in accordance with paragraph 1.6.1, Article IX of the 2002 <i>Revised Manual of Clerks of Court</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[220]</sup><br><br>Thirdly, we also take Judge Yu to task for disrespectful language uttered against the Court, no less. She characterized the appointment of Ms. Tejero-Lopez as "<i>void ab initio</i>" and "<i>a big joke</i>." The use of such language in assailing the Court's exercise of its absolute power of appointment was highly offensive and intemperate. She thereby disregarded her obligation to show respect and deference toward the Court and its officials. She was thereby guilty of another serious misconduct.<br><br>And, fourthly, Judge Yu issued verbal threats of filing administrative, civil and criminal charges against Ms. Tejero-Lopez unless she withdrew her application. Judge Yu reiterated the threats in her letter dated June 14, 2011 addressed to Atty. Pabello.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[221]</sup> Ms. Tejero-Lopez felt intimidated enough because she actually withdrew her application (although she later went on with it). The making of the verbal threats by Judge Yu to compel a subordinate to withdraw her application constituted grave abuse of authority on the part of Judge Yu. Grave abuse of authority is committed by a public officer, who, under color of his office, wrongfully inflicts upon a person any bodily harm, imprisonment, or other injury; it is an act characterized with cruelty, severity, or excessive use of authority. Also, the intimidation exerted upon Ms. Tejero-Lopez amounted to oppression, which refers to an act of cruelty, severity, unlawful exaction, domination or excessive use of authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[222]</sup><br><br><center><b>III<br>Issuing a show-cause order against fellow Judges and court personnel</b><br></center><br>According to the OCA, Judge Yu gravely abused her authority in issuing the show-cause order against his fellow Judges, the complainants against her in OCA IPI No. 11-2378-MTJ. The OCA rendered its finding thereon, as follows:<br><blockquote><b>This Office finds it absolutely irregular for respondent Judge Yu to require the complainants in OCA IPI No. 11-2378-MTJ to explain within seventy-two (72) hours upon receipt of notice why they should not be cited in contempt for surreptitiously taking the TSNs, orders and minutes of the proceedings in Criminal Case No. M-PSY-09-08592-CR and using these as part of their attachments to their complaint. As the respondent in OCA IPI No. 11-2378-MTJ, respondent Judge Yu has no authority to summon the complainants (Executive Judge Colasito, et al.) because it is only the Supreme Court who has the power to issue directives requiring the parties in an administrative case to appear and to present their respective arguments in support of their position.</b><br><br>Not only is her directive misplaced, it also shows respondent Judge Yu's utter lack of respect and disdain for the Supreme Court. It must be noted that the parties in Criminal Case No. M-PSY-09-08592-CR (<i>the accused Ramil Fuentes et al. and the plaintiff Republic of the Philippines</i>) are outsiders to the administrative controversy between respondent Judge Yu and the complainants in OCA IPI No. 11-2378-MTJ. However, <b>respondent Judge Yu acted as if she was the investigating authority instead of being the respondent. She took undue advantage of her position as a judge and used the judicial process for her own benefit. Such action clearly depicts an abusive character which has no place in the judiciary</b>. (Bold emphasis supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[223]</sup><br></blockquote>The issuance of the show-cause order by Judge Yu represented clear abuse of court processes, and revealed her arrogance in the exercise of her authority as a judicial officer. She thereby knowingly assumed the role of a tyrant wielding power with unbridled breadth. Based on its supervisory authority over the courts and their personnel, the Court must chastise her as an abusive member of the Judiciary who tended to forget that the law and judicial ethics circumscribed the powers and discretion vested in her judicial office.<br><br>Nothing extenuated Judge Yu's abuse of authority and arrogance. Instead of accepting the error of her ways, Judge Yu defended her conduct by insisting on having the authority to initiate contempt proceedings against her fellow Judges and court personnel. She supported her insistence by citing the rulings in <i>People v. Godoy</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[224]</sup> <i>Zaldivar v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[225]</sup> and <i>Salcedo v. Hernandez</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[226]</sup> But the cited rulings had no relevance at all. <i>People v. Godoy</i> related to the contemptuous newspaper article involving a case that the trial court had decided. <i>Zaldivar v. Sandiganbayan</i> required the Tanodbayan-Ombudsman, a party in the case, to explain his contumacious remarks about an ongoing case to the media. <i>Salcedo v. Hernandez</i> concerned the contemptuous remarks by counsel for the petitioner in a motion filed before the Court. In short, the factual settings for the cited rulings involved parties or counsel of the parties, while the factual setting in this administrative matter concerned the act of merely copying the records of Judge Yu's court for purposes of producing evidence against her in the administrative cases her fellow Judges and the concerned court employees would be initiating against he. The latter were not parties in any pending case in her court.<br><br>Moreover, the Court notes that Judge Yu's issuance of the show-cause order emanated from her desire to retaliate against her fellow Judges and the concerned court employees considering that the allegedly contumacious conduct was the copying of court records to be used as evidence in the administrative complaint against her. She thereby breached her duty to disqualify herself from acting at all on the matter. Such self-disqualification was required under Section 5, Canon 3, and Section 8 of Canon 4 of the <i>New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary, viz.</i>:<br><blockquote>Section 5. Judges shall disqualify themselves from participating in any proceedings in which they are unable to decide the matter impartially or in which it may appear to a reasonable observer that they are unable to decide the matter impartially. Such proceedings include, but are not limited to, instances where:<br><br>(a) The judge has actual bias or prejudice concerning a party or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceedings;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Section 8.

The medical certificate indicated that he had been suffering from "<i>Bleeding submandibular mass in hypovolemic shock Squamous cell Carcinoma Stage IV floor of mouth</i>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[229]</sup> while the clinical abstracts dated June 14, 2011<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[230]</sup> and June 23, 2011<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[231]</sup> indicated the same reason for his hospital admission. However, Judge Yu was unconvinced by such submissions, and adamantly refused to approve Noel's leave application supposedly based on the ruling in <i>Re: Memorandum Report of Atty. Thelma C.

Crucial was the finding that despite several attempts by her office to contact the respondent and to inquire on her situation, she had deliberately failed to inform her superior of her absence and her condition. This is not the same in the case of Noel.<br><br>Under paragraph 2.1.2<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[233]</sup> of the 2002 Revised Manual, heads of offices like Judge Yu possessed the authority to confirm the employee's claim of ill health. Being aware of Noel's true medical condition after having met with Mrs. Labid who had seen her to plead for the approval of her son's leave application, Judge Yu was not justified in demanding a prior written notice about Noel's serious medical condition. Neither was she justified in still requiring Noel to submit the certificate of fitness to work considering that he had yet to report for work.<br><br>Noel's medical certificate and clinical abstracts had sufficiently established the reason for his absence and his hospital admission. Despite his obvious critical condition, Judge Yu chose to ignore the medical records certified by a government health institution, and unjustifiably demanded the submission of documents that the 2002 Revised Manual did not require. Judge Yu did not convincingly establish that her actions came within the limits of her authority as a court manager, or were sanctioned by existing court regulations and policies. Her unjustified refusal to approve Noel's leave application exposed her to administrative sanction under paragraph 2.2.2 of the 2002 Revised Manual. Accordingly, Judge Yu was again guilty of grave abuse of authority.<br><br>It is not hard to believe that Judge Yu deliberately refused to sign Noel's leave application in order to cause additional hardship to him in retaliation for his joining the administrative complaint against her. We consider to be credible Mrs. Labid's narration that Judge Yu had expressed her resentment towards Noel for his signing the complaint against her. By acting so, therefore, Judge Yu was vindictive, and exhibited indifference to the plight of the critically ill subordinate in urgent need of assistance. She was guilty of oppression, which is any act of cruelty, severity, unlawful exaction, domination or excessive use of authority constituting oppression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[234]</sup> Her oppression did not befit an administrator of justice.<br><br>Nonetheless, we dismiss the other allegations of oppression towards the staffmembers of Branch 47 for failure of the complainants to substantiate the same.

The fact that Judge Yu issued the memorandum naming Ms. Rosali, a student, as the encoder and assigning to her court duties similar to those of a regular court employee signified Judge Yu's intention to treat Ms. Rosali as a trainee instead of as a mere observer. Ms. Rosali denied in her <i>sinumpaang salaysay</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[237]</sup> that she had received the memorandum and performed encoding tasks, but nonetheless confirmed that she was directed to docket the decisions and staple the returns.

Pangilinan III, also attested that they had conducted their court observation as "assistant court stenographer."<br><br>Under the circumstances, Judge Yu could not feign ignorance of the tasks assigned to and performed by the OJTs.

It becomes immaterial whether nobody from Branch 47 opposed the designation because the memorandum circular expressly prohibits designation of first level personnel to a second level position.

Their office is the hub of adjudicative and administrative orders, processes and concerns. They perform delicate functions as designated custodians of the courts funds, revenues, records, properties and premises.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[242]</sup> The functions of a clerk of court require a higher degree of education as well as understanding of the law and court processes, that they cannot be delegated to first level personnel such as Mr. Santos. The position requires not only trust and confidence, but most importantly, education and experience. Ineluctably, the respondent ignored the clear import of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 06-05 in designating Mr. Santos as OIC.<br><br><b>III. Ordering presentation of <i>ex parte</i> evidence before the OIC who was not a member of the Bar</b><br><br>Judge Yu argued that she did not commit any irregularity in ordering the presentation of <i>ex parte</i> evidence before herOIC who was not a member of the Bar because the rule on the reception of evidence by a member of the Bar was only directory under Section 9, Rule 30 of the <i>Revised Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, which uses the word <i>may</i>.<br><br>Judge Yu's argument does not impress.<br><br>Section 9, Rule 30 of the <i>Revised Rules of Civil Procedure</i> expressly requires that only clerks of court who are members of the Bar can be delegated to receive evidence <i>ex parte</i>, thus:<br><blockquote>Section 9. <i>Judge to receive evidence; delegation to clerk of court</i>. - The <b>judge of the court where the case is pending shall personally receive the evidence to be adduced by the parties.

The rule on <i>ex parte</i> reception of evidence was unequivocal on this point, and required no elaboration. Neither the agreement by the parties nor their acquiescence could justify its violation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[243]</sup> It followed that Judge Yu could not validly allow the presentation of evidence <i>ex parte</i> before Mr. Santos who was a mere OIC because he was not a member of the Bar.

Ayco</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[249]</sup> the Court castigated the respondent judge for allowing the presentation of the defense witnesses in the absence of the public prosecutor or the private prosecutor specially designated for the purpose. A breach of the <i>Rules of Court</i> like that could not be rectified by subsequently giving the Prosecution the chance to cross-examine the witnesses. Judge Yu committed a flagrant error by allowing the direct examination of the defense witness without the public prosecutor, or without the private counsel duly authorized by the public prosecutor in Criminal Case No. M-PSY-09-08592-CR.<br><br>In addition, Judge Yu disregarded Section 6, Rule 116 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> when she allowed the change of plea by the accused in <i>People v. Manduriao</i> without the assistance of counsel. Judge Yu justified herself by claiming that she had apprised the accused of the penalty for the offense charged, which had then convinced the accused to change his plea.<br><br>The Court cannot accept her justification. In <i>Gamas v. Oco</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[250]</sup> we took the respondent judge to task for conducting an arraignment without the presence of counsel, and observed:<br><blockquote>Section 6 of Rule 116 means that:<br><blockquote>[W]hen a defendant appears [at the arraignment] without [an] attorney, the court has four important duties to comply with: 1-It must inform the defendant that it[,] is his right to have [an] attorney before being arraigned; 2-After giving him such information the court must ask him if he desires the aid of attorney; 3-If he desires and is unable to employ [an] attorney, the court must assign [an] attorney de oficio to defend him; and 4-If the accused desires to procure an attorney of his own the court must grant him a reasonable time therefor.<br></blockquote>Compliance with these four duties is mandatory. The only instance when the court can arraign an accused without the benefit of counsel is if the accused waives such right and the court, finding the accused capable, allows him to represent himself in person. However, to be a valid waiver, the accused must make the waiver voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. In determining whether the accused can make a valid waiver, the court must take into account all the relevant circumstances, including the educational attainment of the accused. In the present case, however, respondent judge contends that complainants waived their right to counsel and insisted on their immediate arraignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[251]</sup><br></blockquote>The justification that the accused had waived his right to counsel, and had changed his plea after the respondent Judge had explained to him the imposable penalty for the offense did not stand considering that in order that the waiver by the accused of his right to counsel would be valid, the trial court must ensure that the accused did so voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently, taking into account the capacity of the accused to give such consent. We have nothing to show that Judge Yu took the pains to enforce the safeguards.<br><br>Every judge was expected to know the fundamental substantive and procedural requirements on arraignment and right to counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[252]</sup> We have always been clear about the right of the accused to counsel under the Constitution, and about the requirements for the arraignment of an accused under the <i>Rules of Court</i>. As such, Judge Yu was guilty of gross ignorance of the law, which is ignorance of the law when the law is so elementary, and when one professes not to know it, or when one acts as if she does not know it. Canon 6 of the <i>New Code of Judicial Conduct</i> prescribes that competence is a prerequisite to the due performance of the judicial office. In Judge Yu's case, her competence was indispensable to her fair and proper administration of justice in her office.

Nonetheless, she could still be disciplined for such acts committed prior to her appointment to the Judiciary because her internet stalking of Judge San Gaspar-Gito continued after she had herself become a MeTC Judge in Pasay City on January 12, 2010 and lasted until July 2010.<br><br>Our reading of the messages supports the studied conclusions by CA Justice Abdulwahid that they did contain sexual insinuations that were ostensibly improper for a Judge to write and send to another. The messages, however they may be read and understood, were at least vexatious and annoying. In any case, the sender showed her deep-seated proclivities reflective of conduct unbecoming of a member of the Judiciary.<br><br>Finally, the OCA submits that Judge Yu's use of the letterhead of her office or court in summoning to a conference Atty. Reynaldo San Gaspar, the brother of Judge San Gaspar-Gito, constituted abuse of power, and violated Section 8, Canon 4 of the <i>New Code of Judicial Conduct</i>, thus:<br><blockquote>Respondent Judge Yu's use of the letterhead of Branch 47, MeTC, to invite Atty. Reynaldo San Gaspar, complainant Judge Gito's brother, to her court is no different from the aforecited cases. Respondent Judge Yu's letter reads as follows:<br><blockquote>Our court is inviting you for a brief conference in our court on August 5, 2011 around 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. or any available and convenient time and place for you, to clarify certain matters pertaining to the two (2) letters both dated July 12, 2010 of your sister Judge Emily L. San Gaspar-Gito. She can come with you if she wants to.<br><br>Your cooperation is highly appreciated. <br><br>Thank you.<br></blockquote>It is worthy to note that aside from appropriating the court's letterhead, respondent [J]udge Yu used the words "our court" to invite Atty. San Gaspar for the purpose of clarifying matters relative to the ongoing controversy between her and complainant Judge Gito. Even for an ordinary layman, receiving a letter from the court would already create the impression that his presence in the said venue is compulsory. Indeed, the letter to Atty. San Gaspar is a clear illustration of how respondent Judge Yu abuses her power as a member of the bench so that others would give in to her wishes. She undoubtedly took advantage of her position and used the same as a leverage against complainant Judge Gito who filed a case against her. This is patently a violation of Section 8, Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct which mandates that judges shall not use the prestige of such office to advance their personal interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[260]</sup><br></blockquote>The submission is well-founded.<br><br>In <i>Ladignon v. Garong</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[261]</sup> we discoursed on the liability of Judges for using their official letterhead to advance their personal interests, thus:<br><blockquote>x x x In <i>Rosauro v. Kallos</i>, we found the respondent Judge liable for violating Rule 2.03 of the Code of the Judicial Conduct when he used his stationery for his correspondence on a private transaction with the complainant and his counsel parties with a pending case in his court. The Court held:<br><blockquote>By using his sala's stationery other than for official purposes, respondent Judge evidently used the prestige of his office x x x in violation of Rule 2.03 of the Code.<br></blockquote>We do not depart from this rule on the use of official stationary. We clarify, however, that the use of a letterhead should not be considered independently of the surrounding circumstances of the use-the underlying reason that marks the use with the element of "impropriety" or "appearance of impropriety". In the present case, the respondent Judge crossed the line of propriety when he used his letterhead to report <i>a complaint involving an alleged violation of church rules and, possibly, of Philippine laws</i>. Coming from a judge with the letter addressed to a foreign reader, such report could indeed have conveyed the impression of official recognition or notice of the reported violation.<br><br><b>The same problem that the use of letterhead poses, occurs in the use of the title of Judge or Justice in the correspondence of a member of the Judiciary. While the use of the title is an official designation as well as an honor that an incumbent has earned, a line still has to be drawn based on the circumstances of the use of the appellation. While the title can be used for social and other identification purposes, it cannot be used with the intent to use the prestige of his judicial office to gainfully advance his personal, family or other pecuniary interests.</b> Nor can the prestige of a judicial office be used or lent to advance the private interests of others, or to convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the judge. (Canon 2, Rule 2.03 of the Code of Judicial Conduct) To do any of these is to cross into the prohibited field of impropriety.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[262]</sup><br></blockquote>In the letter in question, Judge Yu used the phrase "our court" in issuing the invitation to Atty. San Gaspar. She was obviously intending to use her authority as an incumbent Judge to advance her personal interest. Such conduct was reprehensible because she thereby breached Section 4 of Canon 1 and Section 1 of Canon 4 of the <i>New Code of Judicial Conduct, viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><center>CANON 1<br>INDEPENDENCE<br></center><br>x x x x<br><br>SECTION. 4. Judges shall not allow family, social, or other relationships to influence judicial conduct or judgment. The prestige of judicial office shall not be used or lent to advance the private interests of others, nor convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the judge.<br><br><center>CANON 4<br>PROPRIETY<br></center><br>Propriety and the appearance of propriety are essential to the performance of all the activities of a judge.<br><br>SECTION 1.

No. MTJ-13-1821, conduct unbecoming of a judicial officer</b> for sending inappropriate messages with sexual undertones to a fellow female Judge, and for using the official letterhead of her judicial office in summoning a lawyer to a conference.<br></li></ol></blockquote>In view of the totality of the serious infractions committed by Judge Yu, the OCA recommended her dismissal from the service with the following ratiocination, to wit:<br><blockquote>In all the cases subject of this consolidated administrative matters, the totality of the infractions committed by Judge Yu, <i>i.e.</i>. Gross Ignorance of the Law, Insubordination and Refusal to Perform Official Functions, Gross Misconduct Amounting to Violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Grave Abuse of Authority, Oppression, and Conduct Unbecoming a Judge, underscores the fact that she is not fit to occupy the position of a judge. She has done more than enough harm to the reputation of the judiciary and the administration of justice, exacerbated by the oppression she has inflicted on her subordinates and her utter disrespect for her superiors.<br><br>In similar instances, the Supreme Court did not hesitate to impose upon erring judges the ultimate penalty of dismissal from service as they have indeed fallen short of the standards required of them as dispensers of justice. These same standards must be required of respondent Judge Yu, failing which she must be meted the penalty of dismissal from the service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup><br></blockquote>The recommendation of the OCA is well-taken.<br><br>Judge Yu unquestionably committed several gross and serious administrative offenses ranging from gross misconduct and gross ignorance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup> to the lesser offense of conduct unbecoming of a judicial officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup> Under Section 8, Rule 140 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, either <b>gross misconduct</b> or <b>gross ignorance of the law</b> is punished by either: (1) dismissal from the service, forfeiture of benefits, and disqualification from reinstatement to any public office; or (2) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three months but not exceeding six months; or (3) fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[266]</sup> Under Section 46B, Rule 10 of the <i>Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service</i>, either <b>oppression</b> or <b>gross insubordination</b> - also considered grave offenses - is punishable with suspension from office for a period ranging from six months and one day to one year for the first offense, and dismissal from the service for the second offense. Under Section 11, Rule 140 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, <b>conduct unbecoming of a judicial officer</b> merits either: (1) fine of not less than P1,000.00 but not exceeding P10,000.00; or (2) censure; or (3) reprimand; or (4) admonition with warning.<br><br>The grossness and severity of her offenses taken together demonstrated Judge Yu's unfitness and incompetence to further discharge the office and duties of a Judge. Her arrogance and insubordination in challenging A.O. No. 19-2011, and her unyielding rejection of the appointments of court personnel constituted gross insubordination and gross misconduct, and warranted her immediate dismissal from the Judiciary. Her requiring her fellow Judges to submit to her authority by virtue of her show­cause order, whereby she revealed her utter disrespect towards and disdain for them, as well as her conduct unbecoming of a judicial officer aggravated her liability. The administration of justice cannot be entrusted to one like her who would readily ignore and disregard the laws and policies enacted by the Court to guarantee justice and fairness for all.<br><br><center><b>VIII<br>Disbarment Cannot Be Meted<br>Without Due Process</b><br></center><br>The foregoing findings may already warrant Judge Yu's disbarment.<br><br>A.M. No. 02-9-02-SC, dated September 17, 2002 and entitled <i>Re: Automatic Conversion of Some Administrative Cases Against Justices of the Court of Appeals and the Sandiganbayan; Judges of Regular and Special Courts; and Court Officials Who are Lawyers as Disciplinary Proceedings Against Them Both as Such Officials and as Members of the Philippine Bar</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[267]</sup> relevantly states:<br><blockquote>Some administrative cases against Justices of the Court of Appeals and the Sandiganbayan; judges of regular and special courts; and court officials who are lawyers are based on grounds which are likewise grounds for the disciplinary action of members of the Bar for violation of the Lawyer's Oath, the Code of Professional Responsibility, and the Canons of Professional Ethics, or for such other forms of breaches of conduct that have been traditionally recognized as grounds for the discipline of lawyers.<br><br><b>In any of the foregoing instances, the administrative case shall also be considered a disciplinary action against the respondent Justice, judge or court official concerned as a member of the Bar. The respondent may forthwith be required to comment on the complaint and show cause why he should not also be suspended, disbarred or otherwise disciplinarily sanctioned aa member of the Bar. Judgment in both respects may be incorporated in one decision or resolution.</b><br></blockquote>Under Section 27, Rule 138 of the <i>Rules of Court</i>, an attorney may be disbarred on the ground of <b>gross misconduct</b> and <b>willful disobedience of any lawful order of a superior court</b>. Given her wanton defiance of the Court's own directives, her open disrespect towards her fellow judges, her blatant abuse of the powers appurtenant to her judicial office, and her penchant for threatening the defenseless with legal actions to make them submit to her will, we should also be imposing the penalty of <b>disbarment</b>. The object of <b>disbarment</b> is not so much to punish the attorney herself as it is to safeguard the administration of justice, the courts and the public from the misconduct of officers of the court. Also, <b>disbarment</b> seeks to remove from the Law Profession attorneys who have disregarded their I. awyer's Oath and thereby proved themselves unfit to continue discharging the trust and respect given to them as members of the Bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[268]</sup><br><br>The administrative charges against respondent Judge Yu based on grounds that were also grounds for disciplinary actions against members of the Bar could easily be treated as justifiable disciplinary initiatives against her as a member of the Bar. This treatment is explained by the fact that her membership in the Bar was an integral aspect of her qualification for judgeship. Also, her moral and actual unfitness to remain as a Judge, as found in these cases, reflected her indelible unfitness to remain as a member of the Bar. At the very least, a Judge like her who disobeyed the basic rules of judicial conduct should not remain as a member of the Bar because she had thereby also violated her Lawyer's Oath.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[269]</sup><br><br>Indeed, respondent Judge Yu's violation of the fundamental tenets of judicial conduct embodied in the <i>New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary</i> would constitute a breach of the following canons of the <i>Code of Professional Responsibility</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote>CANON 1 - A LAWYER SHALL UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, OBEY THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND PROMOTE RESPECT FOR LAW AND FOR LEGAL PROCESSES.<br><blockquote>Rule 1.02 - A lawyer shall not counsel or abet activities aimed at defiance of the law or at lessening confidence in the legal system.<br></blockquote>CANON 6 THESE CANONS SHALL APPLY TO LAWYERS IN GOVERNMENT SERVICE IN THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR OFFICIAL TASKS.<br><blockquote>Rule 6.02 - A lawyer in the government service shall not use his public position to promote or advance his private interests, nor allow the latter to interfere with his public duties.<br></blockquote>CANON 11 - A LAWYER SHALL OBSERVE AND MAINTAIN THE RESPECT DUE TO THE COURTS AND TO JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND SHOULD INSIST ON SIMILAR CONDUCT BY OTHERS.<br><blockquote>Rule 11.03 - A lawyer shall abstain from scandalous, offensive or menacing language or behavior before the Courts.<br></blockquote></blockquote>The Court does not take lightly the ramifications of Judge Yu's misbehavior and misconduct as a judicial officer. By penalizing her with the supreme penalty of dismissal from the service, she should not anymore be allowed to remain a member of the Law Profession.<br><br>However, this rule of fusing the dismissal of a Judge with disbarment does not in any way dispense with or set aside the respondent's right to due process. As such, her disbarment as an offshoot of A.M. No. 02-9-02-SC without requiring her to comment on the disbarment would be violative of her right to due process. To accord due process to her, therefore, she should first be afforded the opportunity to defend her professional standing as a lawyer before the Court would determine whether or not to disbar her.<br><br><center><b>IX <br>Final Word</b><br></center><br>The Court will not hesitate to impose the extreme penalty on any judicial officer who has fallen short of the responsibilities of her worthy office. Any conduct that violates the norms of public accountability and diminishes the faith of the people in the judicial system must be condemned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[270]</sup> No act or omission by a Judge or Justice that falls short of the exacting norms of holding the public office of dispensing justice can be condoned, for the most important thing for every Judge or Justice is to preserve the people's faith and confidence in the Judiciary as well as in the individuals who dispense justice. The image of the Judiciary must remain unsullied by the misconduct of its officials. The Court will not shirk from its duty of removing from the Bench any Judge or Justice who has stained the integrity and dignity of the Judiciary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[271]</sup> This is what must be done now in these consolidated cases.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Court <b>FINDS</b> and <b>PRONOUNCES</b> respondent <b>JUDGE ELIZA B.

I compiled all the e-mails you sent to me through my Face book Account. Those reflect how disturbed and unstable you are.

The OCA's findings as affirmed by the Court.</i></b><br><br>A. <b>The OCA's findings and recommendation.</b><br><br>Through a Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> dated February 11, 2016, the Office of the Court Administrator (<i>OCA</i>), through Deputy Court Administrator Jenny Lind R. Aldecoa-Delorino, recommended the following:<br><blockquote><b>RECOMMENDATION:</b> It is respectfully recommended for the consideration of the Honorable Court that respondent Judge Eliza B. Yu, Branch 47, Metropolitan Trial Court, Pasay City be found <b>GUILTY</b> of INSURBORDINATION, GROSS IGNORANCE OF THE LAW, REFUSAL TO PERFORM OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS, GROSS MISCONDUCT AMOUNTING TO VIOLATION OF THE CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT, GRAVE ABUSE OF AUTHROITY, OPPRESSION, and CONDUCT UNBECOMING OF A JUDGE, and be DISMISSED FROM THE SERVICE with forfeiture of all benefits, except accrued leave credits, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office including government-owned or controlled corporations.</blockquote>The OCA found Judge Yu Guilty of: (1) insubordination for her refusaJ to comply with AO No. 19-2011 and to honor the appointments of Ms. Lagman and Ms. Tejero-Lopez; (2) gross misconduct and violation of Section 6, Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for her letter to the Department of Tourism Secretary Lim; (3) oppression for her conduct in relation with Noel Labid's request for sick leave; (4) gross ignorance of the law for her act of allowing the criminal proceedings in her court to continue without the presence of the public prosecutor and for ordering the reception of evidence by the OIC who was not a member of the Bar; and (5) grave abuse of authority for issuing a show cause order against Judge Colasito, <i>et al.</i><br><br>The OCA likewise agreed with the findings and recommendation of Judge Abdulwahid but clarified that her use of the court's official letterhead in summoning the brother of Judge San Gaspar-Gito demonstrated abuse of power and a violation of Section 8, Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct.<br><br>The OCA, however, recommended the dismissal of the charges of gross ignorance of the law for allowing OJTs and in directing the court staff to sell her books, including the alleged malicious utterances against Court Administrator Marquez; and upheld requiring the plaintiffs with pending replevin cases to pay legal fees for transcripts pursuant to her prerogative to ensure that the court funds are properly accounted for.<br><br>B. <b>The <i><i>ponencia</i>'s</i> ruling.</b><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> agreed with the recommendations and findings of the OCA.<br><br><i>In re Judge Yu's non-compliance with AO. No. 19-2011.</i> The <i>ponencia</i> rules that the manner by which Judge Yu chose to express her dissent against AO No. 19-2011 has transgressed the bounds of judicial ethics. The <i>ponencia</i> reminds that Judge Yuhas sworn to obey the orders and processes of the Court without delay. Her unjustified refusal to comply with the directives/orders of the OCA and the Court made her liable for gross insubordination and gross misconduct. More importantly, the <i>ponencia</i> emphasizes, refusal to submit to night duty openly defied the Court's authority, to issue AO No. 19-2011, that the Constitution grants it under Article VIII, Section 5(5) of the Constitution.<br><br><i>In re Judge Yu's refusal to honor the appointments of court personnel.</i> The <i>ponencia</i> agrees that persistent refusal to honor the appointments amounted to a brazen challenge against the Court's power and discretion to appoint court employees. It emphasizes that these appointments are in the form of an order or directive from the Court which Judge Yu had no right to reject For these acts, Judge Yu is liable for gross insubordination and gross misconduct.<br><br><i>In re Judge Yu's issuing of a show cause order against judges and court personnel.</i> The <i>ponencia</i> likewise agrees with the OCA that the show cause order Judge Yu issued in OCA IPI No. 11-2378-MTJ demonstrated her clear abuse of court processes and flagrant abuse of authority, as well as her motivation to retaliate against her accusers, thereby violating Section 8, Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct.<br><br><i>In re Judge Yu's refusal to sign the application for leave of absence and other allegations of oppression.</i> Equally, the <i>ponencia</i> agrees that inordinate refusal to approve Noel Labid's leave of absence application, notwithstanding the latter's compliance with the requirements for sick leave application per the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court, reveals a motive to retaliate against Noel Labid for his joining the administrative complaint against her; these acts amount to grave abuse of authority and oppression.<br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> also dismisses the other allegations of oppression for lack of substantiation.<br><br><i>In re the charges of gross ignorance of the law.</i> The <i>ponencia</i> however disagrees with the OCA's findings and rules that Judge Yu: (1) deliberately ignored OCA Circular No. 111-2005 in prohibiting on-the-job trainees when she issued the November 10, 2010 Memorandum naming the student, Ms. Rosali, as encoder and assigning her to court duties similar to a court employee; (2) violated CSC Memorandum Circular No. 06-05 when she designated Mr. Santos, as first level personnel, as OIC which is reserved to personnel belonging to the second level.<br><br><i>In re allowing criminal proceedings without the presence of the public prosecutor.</i> The <i>ponencia</i> rules that Judge Yu should not only be cited for her failure to abide by Section 5, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court when she allowed the proceedings in <i>People v. Manduriao</i> to proceed without the actual presence of the public prosecutor. The <i>ponencia</i> points out that she should likewise be cited for her failure to comply with Section 6, Rule 116 of the same Rules when she allowed the change of plea by the accused in the same case without the assistance of counsel. To the <i>ponencia</i>, as a judge, she should know the fundamental substantive and procedural requirements on arraignment and right to counsel found in the Constitution and the Rules of Court (Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure).<br><br><i>In re her sending inappropriate messages.</i> Finally, the <i>ponencia</i> agrees with Judge Abdulwahid's conclusions that Facebook and Yahoo messages to Judge San Gaspar-Gito contained sexual innuendos that are improper for a magistrate to write and send to another who find them vexatious and annoying, conduct that is improper and unbecoming of a member of the judiciary.<br><br>In line with this conclusion, the <i>ponencia</i> likewise agrees with the OCA's findings and rules that use of the court's official letterhead in summoning Atty. Reynaldo San Gaspar, Judge San Gaspar­-Gito's brother, constitutes abuse of power and violates Section 8, Canon 4, as well as Section 4 of Canon 1 and Section 1 of Canon 4, all of the New Code of Judicial Conduct.<br><br><b><i>III. My reasons for the vote to disbar Judge Yu.</i></b><br><br>The <i>ponencia</i> refuses to disbar Judge Yu reasoning that "<i>this rule of fusing the dismissal of a judge with disbarment does not in any way dispense with or set aside [Judge Yu's] right to due process. As such, his [sic] disbarment as an offthoot of A.M No. 02-9-02-SC without requiring him [sic] to comment on the disbarment is violative of her right to due process. Thus, she should first be afforded the opportunity of defending her professional standing as a lawyer before she would be disbarred</i>."<br><br>Notably, the <i>ponencia</i> recognizes that the administrative charges against Judge Yu in fact likewise constitutes as grounds for disciplinary actions against members of the Bar which the Court can very well treat as justifiable disciplinary initiatives to remove her from the Roll. It points out that membership in the Bar is an integral aspect of her qualification for judgeship. To the <i>ponencia</i>, "her moral and actual fitness to remain as a judge reflected her indelible unfitness to remain as a member of the Bar" who therefore must no longer "remain as its member because she thereby also violated her Layer's Oath."<br><br>I respect my colleague's position that gives significance to right to due process. To be sure, everyone charged before any court or tribunal is entitled to due process or at the very least an opportunity to relay one's side and defend himself or herself. No less than our Constitution guarantees this right as it provides that "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of the law x x x." Judges charged with administrative complaints are no exceptions to this due process requirement.<br><br>I disagree, however, with the <i>ponencia's</i> refusal to disbar Judge Yu in these proceedings as I do not find that she had not been given ample opportunity to explain and defend her professional standing as a lawyer. Contrary to the <i>ponencia's</i> observation, the records fully support the conclusion that Judge Yu has had more than the requisite minimum opportunity to explain herself against the disbarment charges that justifies her removal from the Roll of Attorneys.<br><br>A. <b>Nature of disbarment.</b><br><br>Under A.M. No. 02-9-02-SC (which took effect on October 1, 2002), an administrative case against a judge of a regular court based on grounds which are also grounds for disciplinary action against members of the Bar, shall be considered as disciplinary proceedings against such judge as a member of the Bar. Likewise, it provides that <b>judgment in both respects may be incorporated in one decision or resolution</b>. A.M. No. 02-9-02-SC specifically states:<br><blockquote><u>Some administrative cases against</u> justices of the Court of Appeals and the Sandiganbayan; <u>Judges of regular and special courts</u>; and court officials who are lawyers <u>are based on grounds which are likewise grounds for the disciplinary action of members of the Bar for violation of the Lawyer's Oath, the Code of Professional Responsibility; and the Canons of Professional Ethics,</u> or for such other forms of breaches of conduct that have been traditionally recognized as grounds for the discipline of lawyers.<br><br>In any of the foregoing instances, <b>the administrative case shall also be considered a disciplinary action against the respondent justice, judge or court official concerned as a member of the Bar</b>. The respondent may forthwith be required to comment on the complaint and show cause why he should not also be suspended, disbarred or otherwise disciplinary sanctioned as a member of the Bar. <b>Judgment in both respects may be incorporated in one decision or resolution.</b> [emphases and underscoring supplied]</blockquote>The Rules of Court, on the other hand, provides, under Section 27 of Rule 138, that a lawyer may be removed or suspended from the practice of law, <i>among others</i>, for gross misconduct, for any violation of the Lawyer's Oath, and for willful disobedience to the Court's orders, circulars, and other Issuances:<br><blockquote>Sec. 27. Attorneys removed or suspended by Supreme Court on what grounds. - <u>A member of the bar may be removed or suspended from his office as attorney by the Supreme Court</u> for any deceit, malpractice, or other <b>gross misconduct</b> in such office, grossly immoral conduct, or by reason of his conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, <b>or for any violation of the oath which he is required to take before the admission to practice, or for a willful disobedience of any lawful order of a superior court</b>, or for corruptly or willfully appearing as an attorney for a party to a case without authority so to do. The practice of soliciting cases at law for the purpose of gain, either personally or through paid agents or brokers, constitutes malpractice. [emphases and underscoring supplied]</blockquote>It should be pointed out that the Lawyer's Oath is a source of a lawyer's obligations and its violation is a ground for disbarment or other disciplinary action. In addition to this, the Code of Professional Responsibility forbids a lawyer to engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct as provided under its Rule 1.01. Thus, every lawyer must pursue only the highest standards in the practice of his calling. This is because the practice of law is a privilege, and only those adjudged qualified are permitted to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>It must be stressed, however, that the purpose of disbarment is not meant as a punishment depriving a lawyer of a source of livelihood; rather, it is intended to protect the administration of justice that those who exercise this function should be competent, honorable, and reliable in order that the courts and clients may rightly repose confidence in them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>In <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Indar</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> the Court automatically disbarred the respondent judge pursuant to the provisions of A.M. No. 02-9-02-SC, adopting the reasoning held in <i>Samson v. Caballero</i> that:<br><blockquote>Under the same rule, a respondent "may forthwith be required to comment on the complaint and show cause why he should not also be suspended, disbarred or otherwise disciplinarily sanctioned as member of the Bar." The rule does not make it mandatory, before respondent may be held liable as a member of the bar, that respondent be required to comment on and show cause why he should not be disciplinarily sanctioned as a lawyer separately from the order for him to comment on why he should not be held administratively liable as a member of the bench. In other words, an order to comment on the complaint is an order to give an explanation on why he should not be held administratively liable not only as a member of the bench but also as a member of the bar. This is the fair and reasonable meaning of "automatic conversion" of administrative cases against justices and judges to disciplinary proceedings against them as lawyers. This will also serve the purpose of A.M. No. 02-9-02-SC to avoid the duplication or unnecessary replication of actions by treating an administrative complaint filed against a member of the bench also as a disciplinary proceeding against him as a lawyer by mere operation of the rule. Thus, a disciplinary proceeding as a member of the bar is impliedly instituted with the filing of an administrative case against a justice of the Sandiganbayan, Court of Appeals and Court of Tax Appeals or a judge of a first- or second-level court.<br><br>It cannot be denied that respondent's dishonesty did not only affect the image of the judiciary, it also put his moral character in serious doubt and rendered him unfit to continue in the practice of law. Possession of good moral character is not only a prerequisite to admission to the bar but also a continuing requirement to the practice of law. If the practice of law is to remain an honorable profession and attain its basic ideals, those counted within its ranks should not only master its tenets and principles but should also accord continuing fidelity to them. <b>The requirement of good moral character is of much greater import, as far as the general public is concerned, than the possession of legal learning.</b> [emphasis in the original]</blockquote>The Court similarly ruled in the fairly recent case of <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Presiding Judge Joseph Cedrick O. Ruiz</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> where it dismissed from the service and at same time disbarred the erring respondent judge, Joseph Cedrick O. Ruiz.<br><br>B. <b>Due process requirements in administrative proceedings for disbarment.</b><br><br>Jurisprudence settles that technical rules of procedure and evidence are not strictly applied to administrative proceedings. In administrative proceedings, it is enough that the party is given the chance to be heard before the case against him is decided. In the application of the principle of due process in administrative proceedings, what is sought to be safeguarded is not lack of previous notice but the denial of the opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>In <i>Office of the Court Administrator v. Judge Indar</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> the Court explained the underlying principle for the relaxation of the due process requirements in administrative proceedings. Citing <i>Cornejo</i>, the Court pointed out that "<i>a public office is not property within the sense of the constitutional guaranties of due process of law, but is a public trust or agency</i>." Thus, the strict application of technical rules of procedure required in judicial proceedings are not required with equal force in administrative proceed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>In the leading case of <i>Ang Tibay v.
