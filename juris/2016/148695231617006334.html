Contextual Background</i><br><br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; A. History of Philippine land reform laws</i><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 4, Article XIII of the Constitution provides:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 4. The State shall, by law, undertake an agrarian reform program founded on the right of farmers and regular farmworkers, who are landless, to own directly or collectively the lands they till or, in the case of other farmworkers, to receive a just share of the fruits thereof. To this end, the State shall encourage and undertake the just distribution of all agricultural lands, subject to such priorities and reasonable retention limits as the Congress may prescribe, taking into account ecological, developmental, or equity considerations, and subject to the payment of just compensation.

Its scope was limited to the expropriation of private agricultural lands in excess of 300 hectares of contiguous area, if held by a natural person, and those in excess of 600 hectares if owned by corporations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> With respect to determining just compensation, it provided that the courts take into consideration the following:<br><br><blockquote>(a) Prevailing prices of similar lands in the immediate area;<br>(b) Condition of the soil, topography, and climate hazards;<br>(c) Actual production;<br>(d) Accessibility; and<br>(e) Improvements.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Afterwards, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 3844, otherwise known as the Agricultural Land Reform Code of 1963 (RA 3844). Its scope, though expanded, was limited by an order of priority based on utilization and area.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Just compensation under this law was based on the annual lease rental income, without prejudice to the other factors that may be considered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>On October 21, 1972, then President Ferdinand Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 27<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (PD 27).

Even more radical, however, is its system of land valuation. Instead of providing factors to be considered in the determination of just compensation, similar to the system under RA 1400 and RA 3844, PD 27 introduced a valuation process whereby just compensation is determined using a <i>fixed mathematical formula provided within the law itself. </i>The formula was also exclusively production based, that is, based only on the income of the land.<br><br>Under PD 27, landowner's compensation was capped to 2.5 times the annual yield, as follows:<br><br><center><b>Land Value = Average harvest of 3 normal crop years x (2.5)</b></center><br><br>Notably, this valuation scheme under PD 27 closely resembled those applied in agrarian reform programs earlier implemented in other Asian countries. In Taiwan, for example, compensation was capped at 2.5 times the annual yield of the main crop, when the land values at the time averaged four to six times the annual yield.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> South Korea, which commenced its land reform program sometime in the 1940s, on the other hand, capped compensation at 1.25 times the value of the annual yield, when the land values at the time averaged five times the annual yield.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In Japan, the price for the acquisition of agricultural land under its land reform program, at one point, "could not be greater than forty times the 'official rental value' <i>(chintai-kakaku) </i>of rice fields or forty-eight times the 'official rental value' of dry fields x x x."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>While the constitutionality of PD 27 was upheld in the cases of <i>De Chavez v.

Regulatory scheme to determine just compensation under RA 6657</i><br><br>With an undertaking of such magnitude, the Congress set up a regulatory scheme for the determination of just compensation founded on four major features.<br><br>First, under Section 17 of RA 6657, Congress identified factors to be considered in the determination of just compensation in the expropriation of agricultural lands. This Section reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 17. <i>Determination of Just Compensation. </i>- In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, and the assessment made by government assessors shall be considered. The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property as well as the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.</blockquote><br><br>Second, under Section 49, Congress vested the DAR and the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> with the power to issue rules and regulations, both substantive and procedural, to carry out the objects and purposes of the law:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 49. <i>Rules and Regulations.- </i>The PARC and the DAR shall have the power to issue rules and regulations, whether substantive or procedural, to carry out the objects and purposes of this Act. Said rules shall take effect ten (10) days after publication in two (2) national newspapers of general circulation.</blockquote><br><br>It is on the basis of this section that the DAR would issue its basic formulas.<br><br>Third, under Section 16(d) and (f), Congress gave the DAR primary jurisdiction to conduct summary administrative proceedings to determine and decide the compensation for the land, in case of disagreement between the DAR/LBP and the landowners:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 16. <i>Procedure for Acquisition of Private Lands. –</i> For purposes of acquisition of private lands, the following procedures shall be followed:<br><br><center>x x x</center><br><br>(d) In case of rejection or failure to reply, the DAR shall conduct summary administrative proceedings to determine the compensation for the land requiring the landowner, the LBP and other interested parties to submit evidence as to the just compensation for the land, within fifteen (15) days from the receipt of the notice.

The DAR shall decide the case within thirty (30) days after it is submitted for decision.<br><br><center>x x x</center><br><br>(f) Any party who disagrees with the decision may bring the matter to the court of proper jurisdiction for final determination of just compensation.</blockquote><br><br>Fourth, to implement Section 16(f), Congress provided for the judicial review of the DAR preliminary determination of just compensation. Under Sections 56 and 57, it vested upon designated Special Agrarian Courts the special original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 56. <i>Special Agrarian Court. </i>– The Supreme Court shall designate at least one (1) branch of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) within each province to act as a Special Agrarian Court. The Supreme Court may designate more branches to constitute such additional Special Agrarian Courts as may be necessary to cope with the number of agrarian cases in each province. In the designation, the Supreme Court shall give preference to the Regional Trial Courts which have been assigned to handle agrarian cases or whose presiding judges were former judges of the defunct Court of Agrarian Relations. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) judges assigned to said courts shall exercise said special jurisdiction in addition to the regular jurisdiction of their respective courts. The Special Agrarian Courts shall have the powers and prerogatives inherent in or belonging to the Regional Trial Courts.<br><br>Sec. 57. <i>Special Jurisdiction. </i>– The Special Agrarian Courts shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners, and the prosecution of all criminal offenses under this Act. The Rules of Court shall apply to all proceedings before the Special Agrarian Courts, unless modified by this Act. The Special Agrarian Courts shall decide all appropriate cases under their special jurisdiction within thirty (30) days from submission of the case for decision.</blockquote><br><br>We shall later on show how this regulatory scheme provided by Congress (and implemented by the DAR) is a reasonable policy choice given the grand scale of the government's agrarian reform program.<br><br><i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>C.

The UP-IAS study said:<br><br><blockquote>If agricultural lands are to be distributed to landless farmers and farmworkers for agricultural purposes, then landowners should be compensated for their lands based on its agricultural potential. <b>The appropriate formula, therefore, is to value land based only on production/productivity.</b> The land valuation on PD 27, which stipulates that the value is equivalent to 2.5 x average production of three preceding normal croppings is a classic illustration of simplicity and productivity-based land valuation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br><br>According to the study, the AMV component had no cut-off date, while the MV factor had no guidelines for determining comparable sales, which makes the DAR formula prone to manipulation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> It thus suggested control measures to prevent manipulation of the existing formula, including the setting of cut-off dates for AMV and guidelines for comparable sales.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> It went on to suggest that "x x x major components could be assigned weights <i> with more emphasis attached to the production-based value. </i> Should the declared value be unavailable, then the value should be based only on the components that are available, rather than employ the maximum limit, that is, assuming DV to be equivalent to the sum of the other components. x x x"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>It was also around this time that the infamous Garchitorena estate deal was exposed. Under this deal, land acquired privately for only P3.1 Million in 1988 was proposed to be purchased by the DAR a year later at "an extremely inflated price" of P62.5 Million.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> In his book <i>A Captive Land: The Politics of Agrarian Reform in the Philippines, </i>Dr. James Putzel wrote:<br><br><blockquote>Under the compensation formula finally included in the law and the early [guidelines] of DAR, landowners could secure even <i>more than [market value] </i>compensation for their lands. x x x With the passage of [RA 6657] in June 1988, DAR decided that the value of land would be determined by averaging three estimates of market value: the 'assessed market value' (AMV) reported in a landowner's most recent tax declaration, the 'market value' (MV) as an average of three sales of comparable land in the vicinity of a landholding inflated by the consumer price index, and the owner's own 'declaration of fair market value' (DMV) made during the government's land registration programme, <i>Listasaka 1 and II, </i>between 1987 and 1988. While the compensation formula included a safeguard against extreme [overvaluation] in the owner's own declaration, it still pem1itted compensation at up to 33 per cent more than the market value x x x.<br><br>Such a compensation formula might have guaranteed against excessive compensation, in terms of the [market value] criteria enunciated in the law, if state institutions like DAR or the tax bureau[ ] were immune to landowner influence. However, DAR officials were urged to demonstrate results by closing as many deals as possible with landowners. There were several ways in which the formula was abused. First, DAR officials often chose to establish market value (MV) as an average of three sales of highly-valued land, labelling the sales as 'comparable.' The arbitrary character of their choice along with the tendency for land speculation demonstrated the unsoundness of using&nbsp; 'comparable sales' as an element in the compensation formula. Secondly, landowners were able to pay just one tax instalment on the basis of an inflated land value and thus raise the level of 'assessed market value' (AMV). The nearer that assessed value was to the market value, the higher could be their own declared value and the resulting compensation. There was no obligation for landowners to pay unpaid tax arrears at the inflated level, but beneficiaries who received the land would be required to pay taxes at this level. Thirdly, because DAR officials discussed with landowners the level of comparable sales being chosen, landowners could both influence that choice and plan the most advantageous level for their 'declared market value' (DMV). The formula was therefore extremely susceptible to abuse by the landowners and opened the door to corrupt practices by DAR officials.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Within the same year, DAR Administrative Order No. 17<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (DAR AO No. 17 [1989]) was issued revising the land valuation formula under DAR AO No. 6 (1989). This revision appears to be a reaction to the recent developments, with the new formula reflecting lessons learned from the Garchitorena estate scandal and the UP-IAS study's comments and suggested improvements.<br><br>Under DAR AO No. 17 (1989), the DAR laid down guidelines for the determination of the Comparable Sales (CS) component,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> provided a cut-off date for Market Value per Tax Declaration (MV),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> and placed greater weight to productivity through the Capitalized Net Income (CNI) factor, among others. Thus:<br><br><blockquote><b>Land Value= (CS x 0.3) + (CNI x 0.4) + (MV x 0.3)</b><br><br>Where:<br>CS&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comparable Sales<br>CNI&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capitalized Net Income<br>MV&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Market Value per Tax Declaration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br></blockquote><br>In case of unavailability of figures for the three main factors, the DAR, in keeping with the UP-IAS study, also came up with alternate formulas using the available components, always with more weight given to CNI, the production-based value.<br><br>On April 25, 1991, the capitalization rate (relevant for the CNI factor) was lowered from 20% to 16%.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> This decrease was presumably made for the benefit of the landowners, considering a lower capitalization rate results to a higher CNI valuation.<br><br>The next major change in the basic formula came with the issuance of DAR Administrative Order No. 6<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (DAR AO No. 6 [1992]) on October 30, 1992, which, among others, gave even more weight to the CNI factor, and further lowering the capitalization rate to 12%.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>This basic formula<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> was retained under DAR AO No. 5 (1998), issued on April 15, 1998.

[<i>EPZA v. Dulay</i>] resolved a challenge to several decrees promulgated by President Marcos providing that the just compensation for property under expropriation should be either the assessment of the property by the government or the sworn valuation thereof by the owner, whichever was lower. In declaring these decrees unconstitutional, the Court held through Mr. Justice Hugo E. Gutierrez, Jr.:<br><br><blockquote>The method of ascertaining just compensation under the aforecited decrees constitutes impermissible encroachment on judicial prerogatives. It tends to render this Court inutile in a matter which under this Constitution is reserved to it for final determination.<br><br>Thus, although in an expropriation proceeding the court technically would still have the power to determine the just compensation for the property, following the applicable decrees, its task would be relegated to simply <i>stating </i>the lower value of the property as declared either by the owner or the assessor. As a necessary consequence, it would be useless for the court to appoint commissioners under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court. Moreover, the need to satisfy the due process clause in the taking of private property is seemingly fulfilled since it cannot be said that a judicial proceeding was not had before the actual taking. However, the strict application of the decrees during the proceedings would be nothing short of a mere formality or charade as the court has only to choose between the valuation of the owner and that of the assessor, and its choice is always limited to the lower of the two. The court cannot exercise its discretion or independence in determining what is just or fair. Even a grade school pupil could substitute for the judge insofar as the determination of constitutional just compensation is concerned.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center><br><blockquote>In the present petition, we are once again confronted with the same question of whether the courts under P.D.

We note that it did not apply the DAR valuation formula since according to the SAC, it is Section 17 of RA No. 6657 that "should be the principal basis of computation as it is the law governing the matter." The SAC further held that said Section 17 "cannot be superseded by any administrative order of a government agency," thereby implying that the valuation formula under DAR Administrative Order No. 5, Series of 1998 (DAR AO No. 5, s. of 1998), is invalid and of no effect.<br><br>While SAC is required to consider the acquisition cost of the land, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declaration and the assessments made by the government assessors to determine just compensation, it is equally true that these factors have been translated into a basic formula by the DAR pursuant to its rule-making power under Section 49 of RA No. 6657. As the government agency principally tasked to implement the agrarian reform program, it is the DAR's duty to issue rules and regulations to carry out the object of the law. DAR AO No. 5, s. of 1998 precisely "filled in the details" of Section 17, RA No. 6657 by providing a basic formula by which the factors mentioned therein may be taken into account. <b>The SAC was <u>at no liberty to disregard the formula</u> which was devised to implement the said provision.</b><br><br>It is elementary that rules and regulations issued by administrative bodies to interpret the law which they are entrusted to enforce, have the force of law, and are entitled to great respect. Administrative issuances partake of the nature of a statute and have in their favor a presumption of legality. <b>As such, courts <u>cannot ignore</u> administrative issuances especially when, as in this case, its validity was not put in issue.

Sps. Banal, </i>we said that the RTC-SAC <u><b>must consider</b></u> the factors enumerated under Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657, as translated into a basic formula by the DAR, in determining just compensation.<br><br>We stressed the RTC-SAC's duty to apply the DAR formula in determining just compensation in <i>Landbank of the Philippines v.

Colarina, </i>to name a few.<br><br>In the recent case of <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Honeycomb Farms Corporation, </i>we again affirmed the need to apply Section 17 of R.A. No. 6657 and DAR AO 5-98 in just compensation cases. There, we considered the CA and the RTC in grave error when they opted to come up with their own basis for valuation and completely disregarded the DAR formula. The need to apply the parameters required by the law cannot be doubted; the DAR's administrative issuances, on the other hand, partake of the nature of statutes and have in their favor a presumption of legality. Unless administrative orders are declared invalid or unless the cases before them involve situations these administrative issuances do not cover, the <b>courts <u>must apply</u> them.</b><br><br><b>In other words, in the exercise of the Court's essentially judicial function of determining just compensation, the RTC-SACs are not granted unlimited discretion and <u>must consider and apply</u> the R.A.

This uniform system will ensure that they do not arbitrarily fix an amount that is absurd, baseless and even contradictory to the objectives of our agrarian reform laws as just compensation. This system will likewise ensure that the just compensation fixed represents, at the very least, a close approximation of the full and real value of the property taken that is fair and equitable for both the farmer-beneficiaries and the landowner.<br><br><u><b>When acting within the parameters set by the law itself, the RTC-SACs, however, are not strictly bound to apply the DAR formula to its minute detail, particularly when faced with situations that do not warrant the formula's strict application; they may, in the exercise of their discretion, relax the formula's application to fit the factual situations before them. They must, however, clearly explain the reason for any deviation from the factors and formula that the law and the rules have provided.</b></u><br><br>The situation where a deviation is made in the exercise of judicial discretion should at all times be distinguished from a situation where there is utter and blatant disregard of the factors spelled out by law and by the implementing rules. For in such a case, the RTC-SAC's action already amounts to grave abuse of discretion for having been taken outside of the contemplation of the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br><br>Prescinding from <i>Association,</i> the cases of <i>Banal, Celada</i> and <i>Yatco</i> combined provide the three strands of controlling and unifying doctrines governing the determination of just compensation in agrarian reform expropriation.<br><br>For clarity, we restate the body of rules as follows: <b>The factors listed under Section 17 of RA 6657 and its resulting formulas provide a uniform framework or structure for the computation of just compensation which ensures that the amounts to be paid to affected landowners are not arbitrary, absurd or even contradictory to the objectives of agrarian reform. Until and unless declared invalid in a proper case, the DAR formulas partake of the nature of statutes, which under the 2009 amendment became law itself, and thus have in their favor the presumption of legality, such that courts shall consider, and not disregard, these formulas in the determination of just compensation for properties covered by the CARP. When faced with situations which do not warrant the formula's strict application, courts may, in the exercise of their judicial discretion, relax the formula's application to fit the factual situations before them, subject only to the condition that they clearly explain in their Decision their reasons (as borne by the evidence on record) for the deviation undertaken. It is thus entirely allowable for a court to allow a landowner's claim for an amount higher than what would otherwise have been offered (based on an application of the formula) for as long as there is evidence on record sufficient to support the award.</b><br><br>In Part II, we shall evaluate the challenged rulings of the Court of Appeals based on the foregoing guidelines.<br><br><i>II.

While the DAR-issued formula generally uses the three (3) traditional approaches to value, each with assigned weights, Commissioner Chua chose to apply only two approaches, namely, the Market Data Approach (MDA) and the Capitalized Income Approach (CIA)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> and <i>averaged </i>the indications resulting from the two approaches.

For this reason, we find that the Court of Appeals erred in setting aside the SAC's Decision <i>on the mere fact of deviation </i>from the prescribed legislative standards and basic formula. <i>Yatco </i>teaches us that courts may, in the exercise of its judicial discretion, relax the application of the DAR formula, subject only to the condition that the reasons for said deviation be clearly explained.<br><br>In this case, the SAC, in adopting the Cuervo Report valuation, merely said:<br><br><blockquote>Considering all these factors, the valuation made by the Commissioner and the potentials of the property, <b>the Court considers that the valuation of the Commissioner as the <u>more realistic appraisal</u> which could be the basis for the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from the owner while the Court finds that the valuation of the [LBP] as well as the Provincial Adjudicator of Sorsogon in this (sic) particular parcels of land for acquisition are <u>unrealistically low</u>.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br><br><b>The statement that the government's valuation is "unrealistically low," <i>without more, </i>is insufficient to justify its deviation from Section 17 and the implementing DAR formula.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> There is nothing in the SAC's Decision to show <i>why </i>it found Commissioner Chua's method more appropriate for purposes of appraising the subject properties, apart from the fact that his method yields a much higher (thus, in its view, "more realistic") result.<br><br>The Cuervo Report itself does not serve to enlighten this Court as to the reasons behind the non-application of the legislative factors and the DAR-prescribed formula.<br><br>For example, the Cuervo Report cited a number of "comparable sales" for purposes of its market data analysis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> Aside from lack of proof of fact of said sales, the Report likewise failed to explain how these purported "comparable" sales met the guidelines provided under DAR AO No. 5 (1998).

C.2 The criteria in the selection of the comparable sales transaction (ST) shall be as follows:<br><br><ol type="a"><li>When the required number of STs is not available at the barangay level, additional STs may be secured from the municipality where the land being offered/covered is situated to complete the required three comparable STs. In case there are more STs available than what is required at the municipal level, the most recent transactions shall be considered. The same rule shall apply at the provincial level when no STs are available at the municipal level.

Dissents as indirect constitutional attacks</i><br><br>At this juncture, we emphasize that petitioner Alfonso never himself questioned the constitutionality of Section 17 of RA No. 6657 and the DAR Administrative Order implementing the same. The main thrust of Alfonso's petition concerns itself only with the non-binding nature of Section 17 of RA 6657 and the resulting DAR formula in relation to the judicial determination of the just compensation for his properties.<br><br>Petitioner is a direct-injury party who could have initiated a direct attack on Section 17 and DAR AO No. 5 (1998).

Narrowed as its function is in this manner, the judiciary does not pass upon questions of wisdom, justice or expediency of legislation. More than that, courts accord the presumption of constitutionality to legislative enactments, not only because the legislature is presumed to abide by the Constitution but also because the judiciary in the determination of actual cases and controversies must reflect the wisdom and justice of the people as expressed through their representatives in the executive and legislative departments of the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br><br>Our views as individual justices cannot make up for the deficiency created by the petitioner's failure to question the validity and constitutionality of Section 17 and the DAR formulas.

This complete paucity of evidence cannot be cured by the arguments raised by, and debated among, members of the Court. As we held in <i>Ermita-Malate Hotel and Motel Operators Association, Inc. v. City Mayor of Manila:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It admits of no doubt therefore that there being a presumption of validity, <b>the necessity for evidence to rebut it is unavoidable, unless the statute or ordinance is void on its face, which is not the case here.</b> The principle has been nowhere better expressed than in the leading case of O'Gorman&amp; Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., where the American Supreme Court through Justice Brandeis tersely and succinctly summed up the matter thus: "[t]he statute here questioned deals with a subject clearly within the scope of the police power. <u>We are asked to declare it void on the ground that the specific method of regulation prescribed is unreasonable and hence deprives the plaintiff of due process of law. <b>As underlying questions of fact may condition the constitutionality of legislation of this character, the presumption of constitutionality must prevail in the absence of some factual foundation of record for overthrowing the statute."</b></u> No such factual foundation being laid in the present case, the lower court deciding the matter on the pleadings and the stipulation of facts, the presumption of validity must prevail and the judgment against the ordinance set aside.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br><br>Issues on the constitutionality or validity of Section 17 of RA 6657 and DAR AO No. 5 (1998) not having been raised by the petitioner, much less properly pleaded and ventilated, it behooves the Court to apply, not abandon, <i> Banal, Celada </i> and <i> Yatco,</i> and postpone consideration of the dissents' arguments in a case directly attacking Section 17 of RA 6657 and DAR AO No. 5 (1998).<br><br>If, however, left unanswered, the objections now casting Section 17 and the DAR formulas in negative light might be used as bases for the abandonment of the rule established in <i>Banal</i> and clarified in <i>Yatco.</i> The net practical effect, whether intended or not, of such a course of action would be to strip the implementing DAR regulations of all presumption of validity. We would then place upon the government the burden of proving the formula's appropriateness in every case, as against the valuation method chosen by the landowner, <i>whatever it may be.</i> It would allow the landowner to cherry-pick, so to speak, a factor or set of factors to support a proposed valuation method. As the case below has shown, such a process has allowed the SAC to conclude, without explanation, that Commissioner Chua's higher valuation was "more realistic" than the government's "ridiculously low" valuation and, therefore, in its opinion, more just.<br><br>Allowing the SAC to arrive at a determination of just compensation based on open-ended standards like "more realistic" and "ridiculously low" bodes ill for the future of land reform implementation. One can only imagine the havoc such a ruling, made in the name of ensuring absolute freedom of judicial discretion, would have on the government's agrarian reform program and the social justice ends it seeks to further. It could open the floodgates to the mischief of the Garchitorena estate scandal where, to borrow terms used by the SAC in this case, a property acquired at a "ridiculously low" cost of P3.1 million was proposed to be purchased by the DAR for the "more realistic" amount of P6.09 million.<br><br>We thus feel compelled to address these issues, if only to assure those directly affected, that the law and the implementing DAR regulations are reasonable policy choices made by the Legislative and Executive departments on how best to implement the law, hence, the heavy premium given their application.<br><br><i><i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></i>C.

Consequently, if the courts cannot resolve a question that is within the legal competence of an administrative body prior to the resolution of that question by the latter, especially where <u><b>the question demands the exercise of sound administrative discretion requiring the special knowledge, experience, and services of the administrative agency to ascertain technical and intricate matters of fact, and a uniformity of ruling is essential to comply with the purposes of the regulatory statute administered, suspension or dismissal of the action is proper</b></u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br><br>Rule 43 of the Revised Rules of Court, which provides for a uniform procedure for appeals from a long list of quasi-judicial agencies to the Court of Appeals, is a loud testament to the power of Congress to vest myriad agencies with the preliminary jurisdiction to resolve controversies within their particular areas of expertise and experience.<br><br>In fact, our landmark ruling in <i>Association </i>has already validated the grant by Congress to the DAR of the primary jurisdiction to determine just compensation.

Even a grade school pupil could substitute for the judge insofar as the determination of constitutional just compensation is concerned.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Unlike <i>EPZA, </i>and in answer to the question raised in one of the dissents,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> the scheme provided by Congress under RA 6657 does <b>not</b> take discretion away from the courts in determining just compensation in agrarian cases. Far from it. In fact, <b>the DAR valuation formula is set up in such a way that its application is dependent on the existence of a certain set of facts, the ascertainment of which falls within the discretion of the court.</b><br><br>Applied to the facts of this case, and confronted with the LBP/DAR valuation and the court-appointed commissioner's valuation, it was entirely within the SAC's discretion to ascertain the factual bases for the differing amounts and decide, for itself, which valuation would provide just compensation. If, in its study of the case, the SAC, for example, found that the circumstances warranted the application of a method of valuation different from that of the DAR's, it was free to adopt any other method it deemed appropriate (including the Cuervo method), subject only to the <i>Yatco </i>requirement that it provide a reasoned explanation therefor.<br><br>As pointed out earlier in this Opinion, however, the SAC in this case simply adopted the Cuervo valuation as the "more realistic" amount and rejected the DAR/LBP valuation for being "unrealistically low." In fact, there is nothing in its Decision to indicate that the SAC actually looked into the evidentiary bases for the opposing valuations to satisfy itself of the factual bases of each. This, in tum, explains the utter dearth of explanation for the stark inconsistencies between Commissioner Chua and the DAR/LBP's <i>factual </i>findings. Thus, and with all due respect, it is quite incorrect to say that the present rule requiring strict application of the DAR formula completely strips courts of any discretion in determining what compensation is just for properties covered by the CARP.<br><br>More importantly, in amending Section 17 of RA 6657, Congress provided that the factors <b>and</b> the resulting basic formula shall be "subject to the final decision of the proper court." Congress thus clearly conceded that courts <i>have </i>the power to look into the "justness" of the use of a formula to determine just compensation, and the "justness" of the factors and their weights chosen to flow into it.<br><br>In fact, the regulatory scheme provided by Congress in fact sets the stage for a <i>heightened </i>judicial review of the DAR's preliminary determination of just compensation pursuant to Section 17 of RA 6657. In case of a proper challenge, SACs are actually empowered to conduct a <i>de novo </i>review of the DAR's decision.

This became necessary considering the multiple factors laid down by the Congress in Section 17. For one, the formulas provide a concrete, uniform and consistent equation, applicable to all agricultural land nationwide, regardless of their location. It thus assures prompt, consistent and even-handed implementation by limiting the exercise of discretion by DAR officials. We have also earlier noted how formulas worked in the agrarian reform programs of other Asian countries. Finally, we have also noted how the absence of a formula resulted in the Garchitorena estate scandal.

We can see from AO No. 5 (1998) that the DAR finally settled on two approaches to value: the income capitalization approach and the sales comparison approach, represented under the CNI and CS factors, respectively. While the cost approach was excluded, market value of the land as per tax declaration of the owner (MV) is nevertheless considered. DAR also decided on the relative weights to allocate to each component.<br><br>The inclusion of the CNI as a component factor was in apparent reaction to the suggestion of the UP-IAS study, which roundly criticized DAR AO No. 6 (1989) for not having considered the production income of the land. While the same study recommended that the appropriate formula should "value land based <b>only</b> on production/productivity,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> he DAR, however, chose to also consider comparable sales and market value as per tax declaration. This is in keeping with the mandate of Section 17 which provided that "current value of like properties" and "the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations," and the "assessment made by government assessors" shall also be considered.<br><br>We note that while "cost of acquisition of the land" was also included as a factor to be considered in determining just compensation, it was not included as a component in the basic formula. Again, in the absence of contrary evidence of record, it is reasonable to assume that the DAR acted, on the knowledge that most agricultural lands are inherited. This makes their acquisition cost nil. To include the same as a component of the formula would only serve to reduce the resulting value, much to the prejudice of the landowner.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup><br><br><i>On the formula as DAR's expert opinion. </i> The general function of an appraisal or valuation exercise is to develop an <i>opinion </i>of a certain type of value.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[180]</sup></font> This process, though subjective, is amenable to a rigorous process that should result in a <i>considered </i>opinion of value.

Hence, it is <u>more appropriate to determine the Capitalized Net Income (CNI) of rubber plantations based on the actual yield and farm gate prices of raw products (field latex and cuplump) and the corresponding cost of production.</u></b><br><br>There is also a growing market for old rubber trees which are estimated to generate net incomes ranging between P20,000 and P30,000 per hectare or an average of about P100 per tree, depending on the remaining stand of old trees at the end of its economic life. This market condition for old rubber trees was not present at the time LVG No. 6, Series of 1990, was being prepared. (The terminal or salvage value of old rubber trees was at that time pegged at only P6,000 per hectare, representing the amount then being paid by big landowners to contractors for clearing and uprooting old trees.)<br><br>LVG No. 6, Series of 1990, was therefore revised to address the foregoing considerations and in accordance with DAR Administrative Order (AO) No. 05, Series of 1998. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br><br>What <i>can </i>be fairly inferred from the DAR's adoption of the direct capitalization method in its formula is the operational assumption<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[198]</sup> that the agricultural properties to be valued are, in general, operating on a stabilized basis, or are expected to produce on a steady basis. This choice of capitalization method is a policy decision made by the DAR drawn, we can presume, from its expertise and actual experience as the expert administrative agency.<br><br>Justice Velasco, for his part, calls for a revisit of the established rule on the ground that the same "have veritably rendered hollow and ineffective the maxim that the determination of just compensation is a judicial function."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[199]</sup> According to him, the view that application of the DAR formulas cannot be made mandatory on courts is buttressed by: (1) Section&nbsp; 50 of RA 6657 which expressly provides that petitions for determination of just compensation fall within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SACs;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[200]</sup> (2) <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v.

As adverted to earlier in this Opinion, this Court thus takes this case as a good opportunity to affirm, for the guidance of all concerned, what it perceives to be the better jurisprudential rule.<br><br>Justice Velasco reads both <i>Belista</i> and <i>Heirs of Vidad</i> as bases to show that SACs possess original and exclusive jurisdiction to determine just compensation, regardless of prior exercise by the DAR of its primary jurisdiction.<br><br>We do not disagree with the rulings in <i>Belista</i> and <i>Heirs of Vidad,</i> both of which acknowledge the grant of primary jurisdiction to the DAR, subject to judicial review. We are, however, of the view that the better rule would be to read these seemingly conflicting cases without having to disturb established doctrine.<br><br><i>Belista,</i> for example, should be read in conjunction with <i>Association,</i> the landmark case directly resolving the constitutionality of RA 6657. In <i>Association, </i>this Court unanimously upheld the grant of jurisdiction accorded to the DAR under Section 16 to preliminarily determine just compensation. This grant of primary jurisdiction is specific, compared to the general grant of quasi-judicial power to the DAR under Section 50. <i>Belista, </i>which speaks of exceptions to the <b>general</b> grant of quasi-judicial power under Section 50, cannot be read to extend to the <b>specific</b> grant of primary jurisdiction under Section 16.<br><br><i>Heirs of Vidad</i> should also be read in light of <i>our</i> ruling in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Martinez</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup> another landmark case directly and affirmatively resolving the issue of whether the DAR's preliminary determination (of just compensation) can attain finality. While the determination of just compensation is an essentially judicial function, <i>Martinez</i> teaches us that the administrative agency's otherwise preliminary determination may become conclusive <b>not because judicial power was supplanted by the agency's exercise of primary jurisdiction but because a party failed to timely invoke the same.</b> The Court said as much in <i>Heirs of Vidad:</i><br><br><blockquote>It must be emphasized that the taking of property under RA 6657 is an exercise of the State's power of eminent domain. The valuation of property or determination of just compensation in eminent domain proceedings is essentially a judicial function which is vested with the courts and not with administrative agencies. When the parties cannot agree on the amount of just compensation, only the exercise of judicial power can settle the dispute with binding effect on the winning and losing parties. <b>On the other hand, the determination of just compensation in the RARAD/DARAB requires the voluntary agreement of the parties. Unless the parties agree, there is no settlement of the dispute before the RARAD/DARAB, <u>except if the aggrieved party fails to file a petition for just compensation on time before the RTC.</u></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied.)</blockquote><br><br>Considering the validity of the grant of primary jurisdiction, our ruling in <i>Heirs of Vidad </i>should also be reconciled with the rationale behind the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. In this sense, neither landowner nor agency can disregard the administrative process provided under the law without offending the already established doctrine of primary jurisdiction:<br><br><blockquote>x x x [I]n cases raising issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges or cases requiring the exercise of administrative discretion, agencies created by Congress for regulating the subject matter should not be passed over. This is so even though the facts after they have been appraised by specialized competence serve as a premise for legal consequences to be judicially defined. <b>Uniformity and consistency in the regulation of business entrusted to a particular agency are secured, and the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised, by preliminary resort for ascertaining and interpreting the circumstances underlying legal issues to agencies that are better equipped than courts by specialization, by insight gained through experience, and by more flexible procedure</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote><br><br>Arguing against the binding nature of the DAR formula, Justice Carpio, in his Separate Concurring Opinion, cites <i>Apo Fruits</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup> which held, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>What is clearly implicit, thus, is that the basic formula and its alternatives—administratively determined (as it is not found in Republic Act No. 6657, but merely set forth in DAR AO No. 5, Series of 1998)—although referred to and even applied by the courts in certain instances, does not and cannot strictly bind the courts. x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The argument of <i>Apo Fruits</i> that the DAR formula is a mere administrative order has, however, been completely swept aside by the amendment to Section 17 under RA 9700. To recall, Congress amended Section 17 of RA 6657 by expressly providing that the valuation factors enumerated be "translated into a basic formula by the DAR x x x." This amendment converted the DAR basic formula into a requirement of the law itself. In other words, the formula ceased to be merely an administrative rule, presumptively valid as <i> subordinate legislation </i> under the DAR's rule-making power. The formula, now part of the <i> law </i> itself, is entitled to the presumptive constitutional validity of a <i>statute.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[210]</sup> More important, <i> Apo Fruits </i> merely states that the formula cannot "strictly" bind the courts. The more reasonable reading of <i> Apo Fruits </i> is that the formula does not strictly apply in certain circumstances. <i> Apo Fruits </i> should, in other words, be read together with <i>Yatco.</i><br><br>Justice Carpio also raises an issue of statutory construction of Section 18 of RA 6657 in relation to Section 17. Section 18 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 18. <i>Valuation and Mode of Compensation. — </i>The LBP shall compensate the landowner in such amounts as may be agreed upon by the landowner and the DAR and the LBP, in accordance with the criteria provided for in Sections 16 and 17, and other pertinent provisions hereof, <u><b>or</b></u> as may be finally determined by the court, as the just compensation for the land.</blockquote><br><br>The Justice reads Section 18 to mean that Section 17 and the implementing DAR formula operate only to qualify the offer to be made by the DAR and the LBP to the landowner. Section 17 is not a qualifying imposition on the court in its determination of just compensation. Stated differently, where there is disagreement on the issue of just compensation, Section 17 and the basic formula do not apply.<br><br>We disagree. Sections 16, 17 and 18 should all be read together in context<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[211]</sup> as to give effect to the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[212]</sup> This is the essence of the doctrines we laid down in <i>Banal, Celada </i>and <i>Yatco.</i><br><br>Section 16 governs the procedure for the acquisition of private lands. The relevant provision reads:<br><br><blockquote>Sec. 16. <i>Procedure for Acquisition of Private Lands.</i> — For purposes of acquisition of private lands, the following procedures shall be followed:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">(a)</div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">After having identified the land, the landowners and the beneficiaries, the DAR shall send its notice to acquire the land to the owners thereof, by personal delivery or registered mail, and post the same in a conspicuous place in the municipal building and barangay hall of the place where the property is located. <b>Said notice shall contain the offer of the DAR to pay a corresponding value in accordance with the valuation set forth in Sections 17, 18, and other pertinent provisions hereof.</b> x x x (Emphasis supplied.)</div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><br>It is clear from the foregoing provision that the procedure for acquisition of private land is commenced by the DAR's notice of acquisition and offer of compensation to the landowner. At such point, the DAR does not know whether the landowner will accept its offer. Section 16(a), however, states <i>without qualification </i>that the DAR shall make the offer in accordance with Sections 17 and 18. In case the landowner does not reply or rejects the offer, then the DAR initiates summary administrative proceedings to determine just compensation, subject to the final determination of the court. In the summary proceedings, the DAR offer remains founded on the criteria set forth in Section 17. Section 16(a) did not distinguish between the situation where the landowner accepts the DAR's offer and where he/she does not. Section 17, as amended, itself also did not distinguish between a valuation arrived at by agreement or one adjudicated by litigation. Where the law does not distinguish, we should not distinguish.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[213]</sup><br><br>Section 18, on the other hand, merely recognizes the possibility that the landowner will disagree with the DAR/LBP's offer. In such case, and where the landowner elevates the issue to the court, the court needs to rule on the offer of the DAR and the LBP. Since the government's offer is required by law to be founded on Section 17, the court, in exercising judicial review, will necessarily rule on the DAR determination based on the factors enumerated in Section 17.<br><br>Now, whether the court accepts the determination of the DAR will depend on its exercise of discretion. This is the essence of judicial review. That the court <i>can </i>reverse, affirm or modify the DAR/LBP's determination cannot, however, be used to argue that Section 18 excuses observance from Section 17 in cases of disagreement.<br><br>Finally, there is no cogent policy or common sense reason to distinguish. Worse, this reading flies in the face of the contemporaneous interpretation and implementation given by the DAR and the LBP to Sections 16, 17 (as amended) and 18. DAR AO No. 5 (1998) expressly provides that the basic formula applies to both voluntary offers to sell and to compulsory acquisition?<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[214]</sup><br><br><i><i><i><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></i></i>K. The matters raised by the dissents are better resolved in a proper case directly challenging Section 17 of RA 6657 and the resulting DAR formulas</i><br><br>The following central issues of fact underlying many of the arguments raised by the dissents are better raised in a case directly impugning the validity of Section 17 and the DAR formulas:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY"><i>(1)</i></div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY"><i>Whether, under the facts of a proper case, the use of a basic formula (based on factors enumerated by Congress) to determine just compensation is just and reasonable.</i> </div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><br>Evidence must be taken to determine whether, given the scale of the government's agrarian reform program, the DAR and the LBP (and later, Congress) acted justly and within reason in choosing to implement the law with the enumeration of factors in Section 17 and the use of a basic formula, <i>or, </i>whether, under the facts, it is more just and reasonable to employ a <i>case to case </i>method of valuation.<br><br>A core and triable question of fact is whether the DAR and the LBP can effectively and fairly implement a large scale land reform program without some guide to canalize the discretion of its employees tasked to undertake valuation. Otherwise stated, how can the DAR and the LBP commence CARP implementation if the different DAR and LBP employees tasked with making the offer, and spread nationwide, are each given complete discretion to determine value from their individual reading of Section 17? This will resolve the factual underpinnings of the argument advanced that the valuation factors enumerated in Section 17 apply only where there is agreement on value as between the DAR/LBP and the landowner, but not when there is disagreement.<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY"><i>(2)</i></div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY"><i> Whether, under the facts of a proper case, the enumeration of the factors in Section 17 and the resulting formula, are themselves just and reasonable.</i> </div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><br>To resolve this, there must be a hearing to determine: (a) whether, following generally-accepted valuation principles, the enumeration under Section 17 is sufficient or under-inclusive; (2) how the DAR arrived at selecting the components of the formula and their assigned weights; (3) whether there are fairer or more just and reasonable alternatives, or combinations of alternatives, respecting valuation components and their weights; and (4) whether the DAR properly computes or recognizes net present value under the CNI factor, and whether DAR employs a fair capitalization rate in computing CNI.<br><br>All things considered, it is important that the DAR and the LBP be heard so that they can present evidence on the cost and other implications of doing away with the use of a basic formula, or using a different mix of valuation components and weights.<br><br><i>IV. Conclusion</i><br><br>The determination of just compensation <i>is </i>a judicial function. The "justness" of the enumeration of valuation factors in Section 17, the "justness" of using a basic formula, and the "justness" of the components (and their weights) that flow into the basic formula, are all matters for the courts to decide. As stressed by <i>Celada, </i>however, until Section 17 or the basic formulas are declared invalid in a proper case, they enjoy the presumption of constitutionality. This is more so now, with Congress, through RA 9700, expressly providing for the mandatory consideration of the DAR basic formula. In the meantime, <i>Yatco, </i>akin to a legal safety net, has tempered the application of the basic formula by providing for deviation, where supported by the facts and reasoned elaboration.<br><br>While concededly far from perfect, the enumeration under Section 17 and the use of a basic formula have been the principal mechanisms to implement the just compensation provisions of the Constitution and the CARP for many years. Until a direct challenge is successfully mounted against Section 17 and the basic formulas, they and the collective doctrines in <i>Banal, Celada </i>and <i>Yatco </i>should be applied to all pending litigation involving just compensation in agrarian reform. This rule, as expressed by the doctrine of <i>stare decisis,</i> is necessary for securing certainty and stability of judicial decisions, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Time and again, the Court has held that it is a very desirable and necessary judicial practice that when a court has laid down a principle of law as applicable to a certain state of facts, it will adhere to that principle and apply it to all future cases in which the facts are substantially the same. <i>Stare decisis et non quieta movere. </i> Stand by the decisions and disturb not what is settled. <i>Stare decisis </i> simply means that for the sake of certainty, a conclusion reached in one case should be applied to those that follow if the facts are substantially the same, even though the parties may be different. It proceeds from the first principle of justice that, absent any powerful countervailing considerations, like cases ought to be decided alike. Thus, where the same questions relating to the same event have been put forward by the parties similarly situated as in a previous case litigated and decided by a competent court, the rule of <i>stare decisis </i> is a bar to any attempt to relitigate the same issue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[215]</sup></blockquote><br><br>This Court thus for now gives full constitutional presumptive weight and credit to Section 17 of RA 6657, DAR AO No. 5 (1998) and the resulting DAR basic formulas. To quote the lyrical words of Justice Isagani Cruz in <i> Association:</i><br><br><blockquote>The CARP Law and the other enactments also involved in these cases have been the subject of bitter attack from those who point to the shortcomings of these measures and ask that they be scrapped entirely. To be sure, these enactments are less than perfect; indeed, they should be continuously re-examined and rehoned, that they may be sharper instruments for the better protection of the farmer's rights. But we have to start somewhere. In the pursuit of agrarian reform, we do not tread on familiar ground but grope on terrain fraught with pitfalls and expected difficulties. This is inevitable. The CARP Law is not a tried and tested project. On the contrary, to use Justice Holmes's words, "it is an experiment, as all life is an experiment," and so we learn as we venture forward, and, if necessary, by our own mistakes. We cannot expect perfection although we should strive for it by all means. Meantime, we struggle as best we can in freeing the farmer from the iron shackles that have unconscionably, and for so long, fettered his soul to the soil.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[216]</sup></blockquote><br><br>For the guidance of the bench, the bar, and the public, we reiterate the rule: Out of regard for the DAR's expertise as the concerned implementing agency, courts should henceforth consider the factors stated in Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, as translated into the applicable DAR formulas in their determination of just compensation for the properties covered by the said law. If, in the exercise of their judicial discretion, courts find that a strict application of said formulas is not warranted under the specific circumstances of the case before them, they may deviate or depart therefrom, provided that this departure or deviation is supported by a reasoned explanation grounded on the evidence on record. In other words, courts of law possess the power to make a final determination of just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[217]</sup><br><br><i>A final note</i><br><br>We must be reminded that the government (through the administrative agencies) and the courts are not adversaries working towards different ends; our roles are, rather, complementary.

It was bought by Sharp Marketing Inc. from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) in 1988 for P3.1 Million. Sharp, in 1989, or less than a year later, tried to sell the estate to the DAR under the CARP's VOS program for P62.5 Million. The DAR, through then Secretary Phillip Juico, approved the sale. Then LBP President Deogracias Vistan, however, refused to give his consent to the deal, saying that Sharp had overreportd the pmJuctivity of the land and that the beneficiaries had been coerced to accept the value. President Vistan later reported the matter to Congress. The exposure of the deal led to a congressional investigation, the filing by Sharp of a case for mandamus <i>(Sharp International Marketing v. Court of Appeals, </i>G.R. No. 93661, September 4, 1991, 201 SCRA 299), and the filing of cases with the Sandiganbdyan, among others.

All that it requires is the consideration by the courts of the enumerated factors. The provision does not mandate that they use those factors exclusively for the determination of just compensation. Congress even circumscribed the consideration of the factors with the clause, "subject to the final decision of the proper court." They are, at most, guidelines to assist the courts in the determination of just compensation. Therefore, Section 17 does not take away, much less limit, the power of the courts to inquire into what <i>EPZA v.

I submit this Separate Concurring Opinion to clarify further the first paragraph of Section 18 of Republic Act No. 6657 (RA 6657) or the <i>Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988.</i><br><br>The first paragraph of Section 18 of RA 6657 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 18. <i>Valuation and Mode of Compensation. </i>- The LBP shall compensate the landowner in such amounts <b>as may be agreed upon by the landowner and the DAR and the LBP</b>, in accordance with the criteria provided for in Sections 16 and 17, and other pertinent provisions hereof, <b>or as may be finally determined by the court, as the just compensation for the land</b>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>This provision on valuation of just compensation consists of two parts. The first part refers to the amount of just compensation "as may be agreed upon by the landowner and the DAR and the LBP" while the second part pertains to the amount of just compensation "as may be finally determined by the court." <b>In other words, the amount of just compensation may either be (1) by an agreement among the parties concerned; or (2) by a judicial determination thereof.</b><br><br>In the first case, there must be an <b>agreement</b> on the amount of just compensation between the landowner and the DAR. Such <b>agreement</b> must be in accordance with the criteria under Sections 16 and 17 of RA 6657.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Section 16 outlines the procedure for acquiring private lands while Section 17 provides for the factors to be considered in determining just compensation. To translate such factors, the DAR devised a formula, which is presently embodied in DAO No. 5.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The DAR, using the formula in DAO No. 5, will make an initial determination of the value of the land and thereafter offer such amount to the landowner. If the landowner accepts the DAR's offer, he shall be paid the amount of just compensation as computed by the DAR. If the landowner rejects the DAR's offer, he may opt to file an action before the courts to finally determine the proper amount of just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <b>Clearly, the DAR cannot mandate the value of the land because Section 18 expressly states that the landowner shall be paid the amount of just compensation "as may be agreed upon" by the parties.</b> In other words, the DAR's valuation of the land is not final and conclusive upon the landowner. <b>Simply put, the DAR's computation of just compensation is not binding on the landowner.</b><br><br><b>Since the landowner is not bound to accept the DAR's computation of just compensation, with more reason are courts not bound by DAR's valuation of the land.</b> To mandate the courts to adhere to the DAR's valuation, and thus require the courts to impose such valuation on the landowner, is contrary to the first paragraph of Section 18 which states that the DAR's valuation is not binding on the landowner. If the law intended courts to be bound by DAR's valuation, and to impose such valuation on the landowner, then Section 18 should have simply directly stated that the landowner is bound by DAR's valuation. To hold that courts are bound by DAR's valuation makes resort to the courts an empty exercise. To avoid violating Section 18, courts must be given the discretion to accept, modify, or reject the DAR's valuation.<br><br>The law itself vests in the Regional Trial Courts, sitting as Special Agrarian Courts (SAC), the original and exclusive jurisdiction over actions for the determination of just compensation. Section 57 of RA 6657 reads:<br><br><blockquote>Section 57. <i>Special Jurisdiction. </i> — <b>The Special Agrarian Courts shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners,</b> and the prosecution of all criminal offenses under this Act. The Rules of Court shall apply to all proceedings before the Special Agrarian Courts, unless modified by this Act.<br><br>The Special Agrarian Courts shall decide all appropriate cases under their special jurisdiction within thirty (30) days from submission of the case for decision. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Montalvan,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the Court reiterated the exclusive jurisdiction of the SAC to determine just compensation, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>The SAC has been statutorily determined to have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation due to landovvners under the CARP. This legal principle has been upheld in a number of this Court's decisions and has passed into the province of established doctrine in agrarian reform jurisprudence. In fact, this Court has sustained the exclusive authority of the SAC over the DARAB, even in instances when no administrative proceedings were conducted in the DARAB.</blockquote><br><br>It is settled that the determination of just compensation is essentially a judicial function. The judicial determination of just compensation is what the second part of the first paragraph of Section 18 of RA 6657 comprehends, as it states that "The LBP shall compensate the landowner in such amounts x x x <i>as may be finally determined by the court, </i>as the just compensation for the land." In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Escandar,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>It is settled that the determination of just compensation is a judicial function. The DAR's land valuation is only preliminary and is not, by any means, final and conclusive upon the landowner or any other interested party. <b>In the exercise of their functions, the courts still have the final say on what the amount of just compensation will be</b>. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Considering that the SACs exercise exclusive jurisdiction over petitions for determination of just compensation, the valuation by the DAR, presented before the agrarian courts, should only be regarded as initial or preliminary. As such, the DAR's computation of just compensation is not binding on the courts. In <i>Heirs of Lorenza and Carmen Vidad v. Land Bank of the Philippines,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the Court held:<br><br></http:><blockquote><http: www.dar.gov.ph="" q-and-a-on-carp="" english=""><b>In fact, RA 6657 does not make DAR's valuation absolutely binding as the amount payable by LBP. A reading of Section 18 of RA 6657 shows that the courts, and not the DAR, make the final determination of just compensation.</b> It is well-settled that the DAR's land valuation is only preliminary and is not, by any means, final and conclusive upon the landowner or any other interested party. The courts will still have the right to review with finality the determination in the exercise of what is admittedly a judicial function. (Emphasis supplied)</http:><br><http: www.dar.gov.ph="" q-and-a-on-carp="" english=""></http:></blockquote><http: www.dar.gov.ph="" q-and-a-on-carp="" english=""><br>That the DAR valuation, based on the formula in DAO No. 5, is not controlling on the courts is likewise enunciated in <i>Apa Fruits Corporation v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>x x x <b>[T]he basic formula and its alternatives – administratively determined (as it is not found in Republic Act No. 6657, but merely set forth in DAR AO No. 5, Series of 1998) - although referred to and even applied by the courts in certain instances, does not and cannot strictly bind the courts.</b> To insist that the formula must be applied with utmost rigidity whereby the valuation is drawn following a strict mathematical computation goes beyond the intent and spirit of the law. The suggested interpretation is strained and would render the law inutile. Statutory construction should not kill but give life to the law. As we have established in earlier jurisprudence, the valuation of property in eminent domain is essentially a judicial function which is vested in the regional trial court acting as a SAC, and not in administrative agencies. The SAC, therefore, must still be able to reasonably exercise its judicial discretion in the evaluation of the factors for just compensation, which cannot be arbitrarily restricted by a formula dictated by the DAR, an administrative agency. <b>Surely, DAR AO No. 5 did not intend to straightjacket the hands of the court in the computation of the land valuation. While it provides a formula, it could not have been its intention to shackle the courts into applying the formula in every instance.</b> The court shall apply the formula after an evaluation of the three factors, or it may proceed to make its own computation based on the extended list in Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657, which includes other factors[.] x x x. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Suffice it to state that no administrative order can deprive the courts of the power to review with finality the DAR's determination of just compensation in the exercise of what is admittedly a judicial function.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> What the DAR is empowered to do is only to determine in a preliminary manner the amount of just compensation, leaving to the courts the ultimate power to decide this issue.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Further, to adhere to the formula in DAO No. 5, in every instance, constitutes an undue restriction of the power of the courts to determine just compensation. This is clear from the case of <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Heirs of Puyat</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> which stated:<br><br><blockquote>As the CA correctly held, the determination of just compensation is a judicial function; hence, courts cannot be unduly restricted in their determination thereof. To do so would deprive the courts of their judicial prerogatives and reduce them to the bureaucratic function of inputting data and arriving at the valuation. While the courts should be mindful of the different formulae created by the DAR in arriving at just compensation, they are not strictly bound to adhere thereto if the situations before them do not warrant it.</blockquote><br><br>To repeat, under the first paragraph of Section 18 of RA 6657, the amount of just compensation may be determined by (1) agreement between the landowner and the DAR; or (2) judicial decision. In either case, the computation by the DAR of just compensation, using the formula in DAO No. 5, is merely initial or preliminary. <b>As such, the DAR valuation of just compensation is not binding or mandatory on the landowner or the courts.</b><br><br>Significantly, RA 9700, which took effect on 1 July 2009, amended Section 17 of RA 6657 by adding other factors to be considered and clarifying that:<br><br><blockquote>In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the value of the standing crop, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, the assessments made by government assessors, and seventy percent (70%) of the zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), translated into <b>a basic formula by the DAR shall be considered, subject to the final decision of the proper court</b>. The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property as well as the nonpayment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The clause "a basic formula by the DAR shall be considered, subject to the final decision of the proper court" means that the law requires the courts to consider the DAR formula in determining just compensation, but the courts are not bound by the DAR formula since the determination of just compensation is essentially a judicial function. This amendment recognizes that the DAR adopted a formula under DAO No. 5. However, the amendment also recognizes that any DAR formula is always subject, in the appropriate case, to the final decision of the proper court.<br><br>The phrase "subject to the final decision of the proper court" does not appear in the old Section 17. Congress, in amending Section 17 of RA 6657 and adding such phrase, recognizes and, in fact, emphasizes that the final determination of just compensation rests exclusively with the proper court, which is the SAC in this case. In short, while the courts are statutorily required to consider the DAR formula, the courts are definitely not mandated to adopt such formula in determining just compensation. With the amendment of Section 17 of RA 6657, there can no longer be any doubt whatsoever that the DAR valuation of just compensation is not binding or mandatory on the courts.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the petition and to <b>REMAND</b> the case to the Special Agrarian Court for proper determination of the just compensation.<br><br><br></http:><div align="right"><http: www.dar.gov.ph="" q-and-a-on-carp="" english=""><b>(SGD.)

The core issue is whether or not the DAR-crafted formula is mandatory on the Regional Trial Court (RTC), acting as a Special Agrarian Court (SAC). While jurisprudence on the matter is not consistent, the pre-dominant holding has been that the application of the formula is mandatory. However, this dictum should now be revisited, in consonance with the postulate that the determination of just compensation is basically a judicial function.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br><br>The case started when the government, through the DAR, sought to e propriate two (2) parcels of land in San Juan, Sorsogon City under RA&nbsp; 6657,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law&nbsp; (CARL). The land was originally registered in the name of Cynthia Palomar&nbsp; (Palomar) under Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) Nos. T-21136 and T-23180 consisting of 1.6350 and 26.2284 hectares, respectively.<br><br>Palomar rejected the initial valuation of PhP36,066.27 and PhP792,869.06, respectively, made by the DAR and the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) in accordance with Sec. 17 of RA 6657 and DAO 11, s. of 1994, as amended by DAO No.5. She appealed the valuations thus made to the Provincial Adjudication Board of the DAR in Sorsogon (PARAD), docketed as Land Valuation Case No. 68-01 for TCT No. T-21136 and Land Valuation Case No. 70-01 for TCT No. T-23180. On April 16, 2001, Palomar sold the subject lots to petitioner Ramon Alfonso (Alfonso).<br><br>In separate decisions both dated June 20, 2002<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> the PARAD made a valuation of the parcels of land of PhP103,955.66 and PhP2,314,115.73, respectively, applying this formula: Land Value = (Capitalized Net Income multiplied by 0.9) plus (Market Value per tax declaration multiplied by 0.1).<br><br>From the PARAD decisions, both parties initiated complaints with the RTC of Sorsogon City, Branch 52, SAC, the first docketed as Civil Case No. 2002-7090 filed by Palomar and Alfonso, and the other, Civil Case No. 2002-7073, filed by the LBP.<br><br>For their part, Palomar and Alfonso claim that the PARAD valuation did not take into account the following: (a) actual number of trees planted therein, <i>i.e.,</i> coconut and other fruit and non-fruit bearing trees; (b) other improvements that were introduced on the properties; and (c) their proximity to the commercial centers and establishments, roads and other value enhancing structures and facilities.<br><br>The LBP, on the other hand, insisted on the correctness of its valuation in light of the provisions of DAO No. 11, s. of 1994, as amended by DAO No. 5, s. of 1998.<br><br>The court-appointed commissioner tasked to render a report on the just compensation for the covered parcels used both a Market Data Approach (MDA) and Capitalized Income Approach (CIA) in determining the correct value for the subject lands. In the MDA, the valuation is primarily based on sales and listing of comparable properties in the neighborhood adjusted for time of sale, locations and general characteristics of the properties. The CIA, on the other hand, is based on the potential net benefit that may be derived from the ownership of the property.<br><br>Thereafter, the SAC rendered a consolidated decision dated May 13, 2005<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> fixing the valuation of the properties at PhP442,830.00 for the land covered by TCT No. T-21136 and PhP5,650,680.00 for the lot covered by TCT No. T-23180. In arriving at such valuation, the SAC, stressing that the matter of valuation is a judicial function, wrote:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br><blockquote>After a thorough study of the indications, and considering all factors relating to the market conditions of the subject property and its neighboring area we are of the opinion that the average of the two indications (MDA and CIA) reasonably represented the just compensation (fair market value) of the land with productive coconut trees.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>R.A. 6657 provides that "In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the current value of like property, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations and assessments and the assessments made by government assessors shall be considered. The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and farmworkers and by the government to the property as well as the non-payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine valuation."<br><br>Considering all these factors, the valuation made by the Commissioner and the potentials of the property, the Court considers that the valuation of the Commissioner as the more realistic appraisal which could be the basis for the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from the owner while the Court finds that the valuation of the Petitioner Land Bank as well as the Provincial Adjudicator of Sorsogon in this particular parcels of land for acquisition are unrealistically low.<br><br>The provisions of Section 2, Executive Order No. 228 are not binding upon the Courts. Determination of just compensation is a judicial prerogative. Section 2, EO No. 228, however, "may serve merely as a guiding principle or one of the factors in determining just compensation, but may not substitute the Court's own judgment as to what amount should be awarded and how to arrive at such amount."

(emphasis added)</blockquote><br><br>The fundamental tenet is that jurisdiction can only be granted through legislative enactments,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and once conferred cannot be diminished by the executive branch. It can neither be expanded nor restricted by executive issuances in the guise of law enforcement. Thus, although the DAR has the authority to promulgate its own rules of procedure,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> it cannot modify the <i>"original and exclusive jurisdiction </i>" to settle the issue of just compensation accorded the SACs. Stated in the alternative, the DAR is precluded from vesting upon itself the power to determine the amount of just compensation a landowner is entitled to, notwithstanding the quasi-judicial powers granted the DAR under Sec. 50 of the CARL, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 50. <i>Quasi-judicial Powers of the DAR.</i></b><i> </i>- The DAR is hereby vested with primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform, except those falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) x x x.</blockquote><br><br>We clarified in <i>LBP v. Belista</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> that further excepted from the coverage of the DAR's jurisdiction, aside from those specifically mentioned in Sec. 50, are petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners and the prosecution of all criminal offenses under RA 6657, which are within the jurisdiction of the SACs pursuant to Sec. 57 of the law. As held:<br><br><blockquote>Clearly, under Section 50, DAR has primary jurisdiction to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform, except those falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the DA and the DENR. <b>Further exception to the DAR's original and exclusive jurisdiction are all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners and the prosecution of all criminal offenses under RA No. 6657, which are within the jurisdiction of the RTC sitting as a Special Agrarian Court. Thus, jurisdiction on just compensation cases for the taking of lands under RA No. 6657 is vested in the courts.</b><br><br>In <i>Republic v. CA,</i> the Court explained:<br><br><blockquote>Thus, Special Agrarian Courts, which are Regional Trial Courts, are given original and exclusive jurisdiction over two categories of cases, to wit: (1) "all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners" and (2) "the prosecution of all criminal offenses under [R.A. No. 6657]." The provisions of §50 must be construed in harmony with this provision by considering cases involving <b>the determination of just compensation</b> and criminal cases for violations of R.A. No. 6657 <b>as excepted from the plenitude of power conferred on the DAR.</b> Indeed, there is a reason for this distinction. <b>The DAR is an administrative agency which cannot be granted jurisdiction over cases of eminent domain (for such are takings under R.A. No. 6657)</b> and over criminal cases. Thus, in <i>EPZA v. Dulay </i>and <i>Sumulong v. Guerrero</i> - we held that the valuation of property in eminent domain is essentially a judicial function which cannot be vested in administrative agencies, while in <i>Scoty's Department Store v. Micaller, </i>we struck down a law granting the then Court of Industrial Relations jurisdiction to try criminal cases for violations of the Industrial Peace Act. (emphasis added)</blockquote></blockquote><br><br>Corollary to the above-quoted pronouncement, the rule-making power of the DAR cannot then extend to the determination of just compensation by the SACs. <b>The DAR cannot promulgate rules to cover matters outside of its jurisdiction</b>. At best, it can only serve to govern the internal workings of the administrative agency, but definitely cannot control the court proceedings before the SACs.<br><br>The original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SACs to determine just compensation is further strengthened by the fact that even without completing the process outlined in Sec. 16 of the CARL, the landowner affected by the taking could immediately seek court action to determine the amount he is entitled to.<br><br>In effecting the CARP, the government, through the LBP, makes an initial valuation of the property being taken, which constitutes the initial government offer. Should the landowner reject this offer or otherwise fail to reply, a summary proceeding would ensue. In this proceeding conducted by the DAR, the parties involved, i.e., the landowner and the LBP, submit evidence to justify their claim of the agricultural land's proper valuation. The DAR has thirty (30) days from the date the matter is submitted for decision within which to render a decision. This framework is outlined under Sec. 16 of the CARP.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Its final paragraph reads: <i>"Any party who disagrees&nbsp; with the decision may bring the matter to the court of proper jurisdiction for final determination of just compensation. </i> "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Thus, from the DAR ruling, the landowner has the option of whether or not to accept or reject the recalibrated offer. Should the landowner refuse the offer still, he or she may file the necessary petition for determination of just compensation with the RTC acting as a SAC that has jurisdiction over the property being taken. But as earlier discussed, the administrative procedure before the DAR can be bypassed by the landowner by invoking the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SACs. The Court has applied this holding in numerous cases summarized in <i> Heirs of Vidad v. LBP, </i> to wit:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Wycoco,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the Court upheld the RTCs jurisdiction over Wycoco's petition for determination of just compensation <b>even where no summary administrative proceedings was held before the DARAB</b> which has primary jurisdiction over the determination of land valuation. x x x<br><br>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> the landowner filed an action for determination of just compensation <b>without waiting for the completion of DARABs re-evaluation of the land.</b> x x x<br><br>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Natividad,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> wherein Land Bank questioned the alleged <b>failure of private respondents to seek reconsideration of the DARs valuation,</b> but instead filed a petition to fix just compensation with the RTC x x x.<br><br>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> where the issue was whether the SAC erred in assuming jurisdiction over respondents petition for determination of just compensation <b>despite the pendency of the administrative proceedings before the DARAB</b> x x x. (emphasis added)</blockquote><br><br>In the cited cases, the Court invariably upheld the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SACs over petitions for the determination of just compensation, notwithstanding the seemmg failure to exhaust administrative remedies before the DAR.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>More recently, in <i>LBP v. Montalvan, </i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> therein petitioner argued that the landowner's filing with the SAC of a separate Complaint for the determination of just compensation was premature because the revaluation proceedings in the DAR were still pending. The Court ruled, however, that the pendency of the DAR proceedings could not have ousted the SAC from its original and exclusive jurisdiction over the petition for judicial determination of just compensation since <i>"the function of fixing the award of just compensation is properly lodged with the trial court and is not an administrative undertaking. "</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Thus, even though the landowner was not able to undergo the complete administrative process before the DAR pursuant to Sec. 16 of the CARL, he is not precluded from immediately and directly filing a complaint for just compensation before the SAC. More than being the prevailing interpretation of Sec. 57 of the CARL, this is also in line with the oft-cited ruling that the valuation of property or determination of just compensation in eminent domain proceedings is essentially a judicial function which is vested with the courts and not with administrative agencies.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><b><i>The administrative proceeding before<br>the DAR is merely preliminary and<br>cannot prevail over the judicial<br>determination of just compensation</i></b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In contradistinction with the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SACs under Sec. 57 of the CARL, the valuation process undertaken by DAR under Sec. 16 of the same law is merely <b>preliminary</b> in character. We said as much in <i>LBP v. Listana:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals, </i>private respondent landowner rejected the government's offer of its lands based on LBP's valuation and the case was brought before the PARAD which sustained LBP's valuation. Private respondent then filed a Petition for Just Compensation in the RTC sitting as [SAC]. However, the RTC dismissed its petition on the ground that private respondent should have appealed to the DARAB x x x. Private respondent then filed a petition for certiorari in the CA which reversed the order of dismissal of RTC and remanded the case to the RTC for further proceedings. The government challenged the CA ruling before this Court via a petition for review on certiorari. This Court, affirming the CA, ruled as follows:<br><br><b>Thus, under the law, the Land Bank of the Philippines is charged with the initial responsibility of determining the value of lands placed under land reform and the compensation to be paid for their taking.</b> Through notice sent to the landowner pursuant to §16(a) of R.A. No. 6657, the DAR makes an offer. In case the landowner rejects the offer, a summary administrative proceeding is held and afterward the provincial (PARAD), the regional (RARAD) or the central (DARAB) adjudicator as the case may be, depending on the value of the land, fixes the price to be paid for the land. If the landowner does not agree to the price fixed, he may bring the matter to the RTC acting as Special Agrarian Court. This in essence is the procedure for the determination of compensation cases under R.A. No. 6657. In accordance with it, the private respondent's case was properly brought by it in the RTC, and it was error for the latter court to have dismissed the case. <b>In the terminology of §57, the RTC, sitting as [SAC], has "original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners." It would subvert this "original and exclusive" jurisdiction of the RTC for the DAR to vest original jurisdiction in compensation cases in administrative officials and make the RTC an appellate court for the review of administrative decisions.</b><br><br>Consequently, although the new rules speak of directly appealing the decision of adjudicators to the RTCs sitting as Special Agrarian Courts, it is clear from §57 that the original and exclusive jurisdiction to determine such cases is in the RTCs. Any effort to transfer such jurisdiction to the adjudicators and to convert the original jurisdiction of the RTCs into appellate jurisdiction would be contrary to §57 and therefore would be void. <u><b>What adjudicators are empowered to do is only to determine in a preliminary manner the reasonable compensation to be paid to landowners, leaving to the courts the ultimate power to decide this question.</b></u> (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>This ruling was reiterated in <i>LBP v. Montalvan,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>There is no inherent inconsistency between (a) the primary jurisdiction of the DAR to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and exclusive original jurisdiction over all questions involving the implementation of agrarian reform, including those of just compensation; and (b) the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SAC over all petitions for the determination of just compensation. "The first refers to administrative proceedings, while the second refers to judicial proceedings." The jurisdiction of the SAC is not any less "original and exclusive," because the question is first passed upon by the DAR; as the judicial proceedings are not a continuation of the administrative determination. In <i>LBP v. Escandor, </i>the Court further made the following distinctions:<br><br><blockquote><b>It is settled that the determination of Just compensation is a judicial function. <u>The DAR's land valuation is only preliminary</u> and is not, by any means, final and conclusive upon the landowner or any other interested party. In the exercise of their functions, the courts still have the final say on what the amount of just compensation will be.</b><br><br>Although the DAR is vested with primary jurisdiction under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) of 1988 to determine in a preliminary manner the reasonable compensation for lands taken under the CARP, such determination is subject to challenge in the courts. The CARL vests in the RTCs, sitting as SACs, original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation. This means that the RTCs do not exercise mere appellate jurisdiction over just compensation disputes.<br><br>We have held that the jurisdiction of the RTCs is not any less "original and exclusive" because the question is first passed upon by the DAR. The proceedings before the RTC are not a continuation of the administrative determination. Indeed, although the law may provide that the decision of the DAR is final and unappealable, still a resort to the courts cannot be foreclosed on the theory that courts are the guarantors of the legality of administrative action.</blockquote></blockquote><br><br>The preliminary valuation conducted by the DAR serves very limited purposes, the first of which is the recalibration of the offer to the landowner. The proceeding before the DAR is not for making a binding determination of rights between the parties. Rather, it must be understood as a venue for negotiations between the government and the landowner, allowing the latter to present his counter-offer to the proposed sale, and providing the parties involved with the opportunity to agree on the amount of just compensation.<br><br>The other more significant purpose of the valuation is compliance with the deposit requirement to be granted entry into the property. Significantly, the amount deposited should not be confused with the just compensation to be received by the landowner. It merely serves as an assurance to the landowner that he will receive compensation since the deposit, in a way, can be construed as earnest money for the involuntary sale. It is a form of security that payment of just compensation would actually be made thereafter upon court judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> As explained during the Constitutional Commission deliberations:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><blockquote>MR. REGALADO. It is not correct to state that jurisprudence does not require prior payment. Even the recent presidential decrees of the President always require <b>a partial deposit of a certain percentage and the rest by a guaranteed payment</b>. What I am after here is that, as Commissioner Bernas has said, there must at least be an assurance. That assurance may be in the form of a bond which may be redeemable later. But to say that there has never been a situation where prior payment is not required, that is not so even under the Rules of Court as amended by presidential decrees. <b>Even the government itself, upon entry on the land, has to make a deposit and <u>the rest thereafter will be guaranteed under the judgment of a court</u></b>, but which judgment, as I have pointed out, is not even realizable by executor process. Does it mean to say that the government can take its own time at determining when the payment is to be made? <b>At least simultaneously, there should be an assurance in the form of partial payment</b> in cash or other modes of payment, and the rest thereof being guaranteed by bonds, the issuance whereof should be simultaneous with the transfer. That is my only purpose in saying that there should be prior payment - not payment in cash physically but, at least, contract for payment in the form of an assurance, a guarantee or a promissory undertaking. (emphasis added)</blockquote><br><br>A deposit is likewise required for the government to gain entry in properties expropriated under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court. Sec. 2 of the rule provides that the amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property is deposited, and only from then would the right of the government take possession of the property would commence. The amount deposited, however, is merely an advance to the value of just compensation, which is yet to be determined by the trial court at the second stage of the expropriation proceeding.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> As such, the amount deposited is not necessarily the amount of just compensation that the law requires. <b>In the exercise of their judicial functions, the courts still have the final say on what the amount of just compensation will be.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><b>The same holds true for the taking of private property under RA 6657.</b> In these instances, the government proceeds to take possession of the property subject of the taking, despite the pendency of the just compensation case before the SACs, upon depositing the value of the property as computed by the DAR. Verily, the administrative proceeding before the SACs is a precondition to possess the property but is not necessarily the just compensation contemplated by the Constitution.<br><br>To further highlight the preliminary character of the DAR proceeding, it is noteworthy that DAO No. 5 was not the original issuance on the matter of valuation of expropriated land under RA 6657. The administrative order traces its roots to DAO 6, s. of 1989, or the <i>Rules and Procedures on Land Valuation and Just Compensation.</i> DAO 6 relevantly states in its Statement of Policy portion that:<br><br><blockquote>The final determination of just compensation is a judicial function. However, DAR as the lead implementing agency of the CARP, may <b>initially determine</b> the value of lands covered by the CARP. (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Although DAO 6 had already been repealed, it bears to reiterate that the land valuation formula presented by the DAR was never intended to control the determination of just compensation by the courts.

It cannot have in one part a meaning different from that which appears in the other portion.</b> If, after all, the party whose property is taken will receive the real value of the property on just compensation, that is good enough. Any other qualification would lead to the impression that something else other than that meaning of just compensation is used in other parts of the Constitution.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>MR. RODRIGO.

DAVIDE. If the withdrawal is based on what was supposedly agreed with the Committee, I will still object because we will have the concept of just compensation for the farmers and farm workers more difficult than those in other cases of eminent domain. <b>So, we should not make a distinction as to the manner of the exercise of eminent domain or expropriations and the manner that just compensation should be paid. It should be uniform in all others</b> because if we now allow the interpretation of Commissioner Regalado to be the concept of just compensation, then we are making it hard for the farmers and the farm workers to enjoy the benefits allowed them under the agrarian reform policy.<br><br>MR. BENGZON. Madam President, as we stated earlier, the <b>term "just compensation" is as it is defined by the Supreme Court in so many cases and which we have accepted.

The measure is not the taker's gain, but the owner's loss. The word "just" is used to qualify the meaning of the word "compensation" and to convey thereby the idea that the amount to be tendered for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full and ample.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>There is then neither rhyme nor reason to treat agrarian reform cases differently insofar as the determination of just compensation is concerned.

And as in other cases of eminent domain, <i>"any valuation for just compensation laid down in the statutes may serve only as a guiding principle or one of the factors in determining just compensation but it may not substitute the court's own judgment as to what amount should be awarded and how to arrive at such amount.</i> "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> In <b>all</b> cases of eminent domain proceedings, there should be no mandatory formula for the courts to apply in determining the amount of just compensation to be paid.<br><br><b>To claim that the courts should apply the DAR formula and should rely on the administrative agency tasked to implement the CARL is to undermine the judicial power of the courts.</b> It is incorrect to claim that the SACs do not have the same expertise the DAR has when it comes to calculating just compensation for agricultural lands. For if an agricultural land is expropriated under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court instead of the CARL, the courts could still compute the just compensation the landowner is entitled to and need not refer the issue to the DAR.<br><br>Consider a parcel of agricultural land subjected to CARL expropriated instead under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court. In either situation, the landowner will be entitled to "just compensation" as understood in its jurisprudentially-settled meaning. However, let us assume that the trial court will apply the DAR formula in the: former, while it would exercise a wider latitude of discretion in the latter. Thus, <b>for the same parcel of agricultural land, the compensation fixed by the trial court under Rule 67 may be totally far off from what would have been considered "just" using the DAR formula</b>. Since it is allowed to adopt its own valuation method, not constrained to make use of the weighted averages accorded to the various factors for consideration, the discrepancy between two valuations could prove to be significant but <b>this does not necessarily make the valuation by the court, without applying the DAR formula, "unjust."</b><br><br>There are limitless approaches towards approximating what would constitute just compensation and there are endless criteria for determining what is "just." As the DAR itself emphatically declares:. <i> "<u><b>Land valuation is not an exact science</b></u> but an exercise fraught with inexact estimates requiring integrity, conscientiousness and prudence on the part of those responsible for it. What is important ultimately is that the land value approximates, as closely as possible, what is broadly considered to be just.</i> "<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Thus, <b>while Sec. 17 enumerates the factors to consider in determining just compensation, no mandatory fixed weights should be accorded to them. <u>It is the prerogative of the courts</u></b> to assess the significance of these factors in each individual case, and in the process, assign them weights in determining just compensation. It lies within the discretion of the SACs to determine which valuation method to select<br><br>To recall, the concept of just compensation is uniform in all forms of government taking. On this point, it must be borne in mind that Rule 67 of the Rules of Court on Eminent Domain never prescribed any formula for the valuation of taken property. This undeniable fact only goes to show that the trial courts, with the assistance of its appointed commissioners,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> are competent enough to ascertain the amount of just compensation that the landowner is entitled to without rigidly applying any set formula. <b>There is then no reason to mandatorily apply a valuation formula for one exercise of eminent domain, but not on the other forms.</b><br><br>Associate Justice Arturo D. Brion is correct in pointing out that the appointment of commissioners is not mandatory on the SACs. Pertinently, Sec. 58 of the CARL provides:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 58. <i>Appointment of Commissioners.</i></b> — The Special Agrarian Courts, upon their own initiative or at the instance of any of the parties, <b><u>may</u> appoint one or more commissioners to examine, investigate and ascertain facts</b> relevant to the dispute <b>including the valuation of properties</b>, and to file a written report thereof with the court. (emphasis added)</blockquote><br><br>This could, however, only serve to strengthen the position that the SACs are not bound to apply DAO No. 5. Notwithstanding the prior ruling of the DAR, what is being resolved by the SAC in the exercise of its original and exclusive jurisdiction is a <i>de novo</i> complaint. Therefore, the SACs <b>may</b>, in the exercise of its discretion, disregard the valuations by the DAR and proceed with its own examination, investigation, and valuation of the subject property through its appointed commissioners. Plainly, the SACs are not barred from disregarding the prior findings of the DAR and substituting their own valuation in its stead.<br><br>Nowhere in the law can it be seen that the court-appointed commissioners are precluded from utilizing their own valuation methods. All RA 6657 requires is that the factors in Sec. 17 be considered, but not in any specific way. This was the teaching in the landmark case of <i>Export Processing Zone Authority v. Dulay (Dulay)</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> wherein the Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>The determination of "just compensation" in eminent domain cases is a judicial function. <b>The executive department or the legislature may make the initial determinations but</b> when a party claims a violation of the guarantee in the Bill of Rights that private property may not be taken for public use without just compensation, <b><u>no statute, decree, or executive order can mandate that its own determination shall prevail over the court's findings</u>. Much less can the courts be precluded from looking into the "just-ness" of the decreed compensation.</b> (emphasis added)</blockquote><br><br><i>Dulay</i> involved an expropriation case for the establishment of an export processing zone. There, the Court declared provisions of Presidential Decree Nos. 76, 464, 794, and 1533 as unconstitutional for encroaching on the prerogative of the judiciary to determine the amount of just compensation the affected landowners were entitled to. The Court further held that, at the most, the valuation in the decrees may only serve as guiding principles or factors in determining just compensation, but it may not substitute the court's own judgment as to what amount should be awarded and how to arrive at such amount.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The seminal case of <i>Dulay</i> paved the way for similar Court pronouncements in&nbsp;&nbsp; other expropriation proceedings.

As the lawmakers admitted, the 70% zonal value to be included in the valuation is actually <b>an arbitrary figure,</b> which is not a cause for alarm since, in any case, <b>the courts can modify the valuation afterwards, consistent with their best discretion.</b> Evidently, the phrase <i>"subject to the final determination of the proper court" </i>is a license for the SACs to adjust the valuation by the DAR as they deem fit.<br><br>There would always be extraneous circumstances for the courts to take into account, which were never expressed by the DAR in mathematical terms. This was readily admitted by Congress when RA 9700 expressly included the subject property's zonal value in the enumeration under Sec. 17 of RA 6657, an apparent omission in RA 6657. Even the <i>"social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property" </i>as well as the <i>"nonpayment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land" </i>were never given their formulaic equivalents in DAO No. 5. The phrase only appears after the DAR's mandate to translate the other factors into a basic formula.

As explained, it is not the intention of CARL that the DAR shall peremptorily determine just compensation or set guidelines and formula for the SAC to follow in determining just compensation. RA 6657 merely authorizes the DAR to make an initial valuation of the subject land based on Sec. 17 of the law for purposes of making an offer to the landowner unless accepted by the landowner and other stakeholders. The determination made by DAR is only <b>preliminary</b>, meaning courts of justice will still have the right to review with finality the said determination in the exercise of what admittedly is a judicial function, without being straitjacketed by the DAR formula. Otherwise, the SACs will be relegated to an appellate court, in direct conflict with the express mandate of Sec. 57 of RA 6657 that grants them original and exclusive jurisdiction over the just compensation of lots covered by agrarian reform.<br><br>Applying the foregoing in the case at bar, the CA is, therefore, incorrect in requiring the SAC to observe and comply with the procedure provided in DAO No. 5 and the guidelines therein.<br><br>The determination of just compensation is, as it always has been, a judicial function. <i>Ergo,</i> if the parties to the expropriation do not agree on the amount of just compensation, it shall be subject to the final determination of the courts as provided under Sec. 18 of RA 6657:<br><br><blockquote><b>Section 18. <i> Valuation and Mode of Compensation.</i></b><i> </i> — The LBP shall compensate the landowner in such amounts <b>as may be agreed upon by the landowner and the DAR and the LBP</b>, in accprdance with the criteria provided for in Sections 16 and 17, and other pertinent provisions hereof, <b><u>or</u> as may be finally determined by the court,</b> as the just compensation for the land.

This does not, however, diminish the discretionary power of the courts because deviation from the strict application of the DAR basic formula is still allowed upon justifiable grounds and based on evidence on record. Sec. 17, as amended by RA 9700, is clear that the determination of just compensation shall be "subject to the final decision of the proper court," referring to the SACs.<br><br>Furthermore, the DAR basic formula does not capture all the factors for consideration in determining just compensation under Sec. 17 of the CARL. Guilty of reiteration, the pertinent provision reads:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 17. <i>Determination of Just Compensation. </i>- In determining just compensation, the cost of acquisition of the land, the value of the standing crop, the current value of like properties, its nature, actual use and income, the sworn valuation by the owner, the tax declarations, the assessment made by government assessors, and seventy percent (70%) of the zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), <b>translated into a basic formula by the DAR</b> shall be considered, subject to the final decision of the proper court. <b>The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property as well as the nonpayment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land shall be considered as additional factors to determine its valuation.</b> (emphasis added)</blockquote><br><br><i>"The social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers and by the Government to the property as well as the non­ payment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution," </i> having been placed <b>after</b> the DAR mandate to translate the earlier enumerated factors into a basic formula, are then excluded in the DAR valuation method.

It may also take into consideration formulas provided by an executive issuance or an administrative order pursuant to a provision of law. In doing so, courts have the power to determine whether, given the circumstances of a specific case, the methods of valuation of property taken by the state reasonably approximates fair market value for the owner. Should it arrive at a different method of valuation, the trial court — as in all cases — must show the reasonable fit of the formula it uses based on the facts established by evidence to determine the final value of just compensation.<br><br>Neither the law nor an administrative order may constrict courts from determining just compensation. The formula to be used as well as the amount awarded as fair market value equivalent to the constitutional requirement of just compensation is a present or contemporary value that cannot be fully encompassed by a single formula. Valuation, rather than being a science, is an act that can only be approximated given present conditions. Thus, the constitutional guarantee of payment of just compensation can only be fulfilled by judicial action.<br><br>We are asked to decide which among the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches have the final power to determine the just compensation to be paid to the landowner in agrarian cases. The principal issue is whether legislative and executive issuances setting parameters for the determination of just compensation in expropriation proceedings should be binding or mandatory on our courts.<br><br>The determination of just compensation — a concept provided for clearly in constitutional text — is a judicial function.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The determination of just compensation involves the appreciation of specific facts that can only be inferred from evidence presented in a court tasked to make those determinations. Valuation requires the exercise of judicial discretion to determine the land value appropriate to replace the loss of the landowner's title. Each parcel of land taken for purposes of agrarian reform requires its own unique assessment. The factors that should be considered cannot be limited to what can be normatively prescribed. The formulas provided in statutes or in executive issuances are only recommendatory.

The second is compensation that may be paid by agrarian reform beneficiaries who acquire ownership of the land through certificate of land ownership awards. Section 3 (d) of Republic Act No. 6657 only refers to the second kind of compensation. All matters relating to just compensation by the state to the landowners remains under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the trial court acting as a Special Agrarian Court.

Thus, in <i>Association of Small Landowners v. Hon. Secretary of Agrarian Reform:</i><br><br><blockquote>The market value of the land taken is the just compensation to which the owner of condemned property is entitled, the market value being that sum of money which a person desirous, but not compelled to buy, and an owner, willing, but not compelled to sell, would agree on as a price to be given and received for such property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></blockquote><br><br>This market value is often arrived at through compromise between the buyer and the seller.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Factors affecting market value include the "time and terms of sale, relationship of the parties involved, knowledge [and evaluation] concerning the rights to be conveyed, present and possible potential uses to which the property may be put, and the immediate transferability of good and marketable title."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Just compensation also refers to "the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> It is the "equivalent for the value of the property at the time of its taking.

Thus, when property is taken, full compensation of its value must immediately be paid to achieve a fair exchange for the property and the potential income lost. The just compensation is made available to the property owner so that he may derive income from this compensation, in the same manner that he would have derived income from his expropriated property. If full compensation is not paid for property taken, then the State must make up for the shortfall in the earning potential immediately lost due to the taking, and the absence of replacement property from which income can be derived; interest on the unpaid compensation becomes due as compliance with the constitutional mandate on eminent domain and as a basic measure of fairness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Other factors that may be considered in judicial valuation of property are the "assessed value of the property,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> the "schedule of market values [as] determined by the provincial or city appraisal committee,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> and the "nature and character of the [property] at the time of its taking."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v.

Prompt payment is equally important, thus:<br><br><blockquote>The concept of just compensation embraces not only the correct determination of the amount to be paid to the owners of the land, but also payment within a reasonable time from its taking. Without prompt payment, compensation cannot be considered "just" inasmuch as the property owner is made to suffer the consequences of being immediately deprived of his land while being made to wait for a decade or more before actually receiving the amount necessary to cope with his loss.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In <i>Apo Fruits,</i> we characterized the purpose of qualifying the word, "compensation," found in Article III, Section 9 of the Constitution:<br><br><blockquote>It is not accidental that Section 9 specifies that compensation should be "just" as the safeguard is)here to ensure a balance – property is not to be taken for public use at the expense of private interests; the public, through the State, must balance the injury that the taking of property causes through compensation for what is taken, <b><i>value for value.</i></b><br><br>Nor is it accidental that the Bill of Rights is interpreted liberally in favor of the individual and strictly against the government.

As the buyer, the Department of Agrarian Reform is expected to ensure that the government can purchase the property at the lowest possible price. It would be inequitable if the Department of Agrarian Reform, as the buyer, is allowed to dictate through its issuances the means by which the landowner's property would be valuated.<br><br>The policy of the State to promote social justice is not a justification for the violation of fundamental rights.

In determining the just compensation for this exchange, however, the measure to be borne in mind is not the taker's gain but the owner's loss since what is involved is the takeover of private property under the State's coercive power. . . . <b>in the value-for­ value exchange in an eminent domain situation, the State must ensure that the individual whose property is taken is not shortchanged and must hence carry the burden of showing that the "just compensation" requirement of the Bill of Rights is satisfied.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote><br><br>I agree with the trial court that:<br><br><blockquote>[I]n the pursuit of social justice, it's not only the attainment of the goal of totally emancipating the farmers from their bondage but it is also necessary that in the pursuit of this objective, vigilance over the right of the landowners is equally important because social justice cannot be invoked to trample on the rights of property owners, who under our Constitution and laws, are also entitled to protection.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></blockquote><br><br>The Department of Agrarian Reform Administrative Order No. 5, Series of 1998, acknowledges that properties have particularities that must be considered in determining just compensation. It also acknowledges the inexactness of land valuation as well as the human qualities required in its determination. Notably, its Prefatory Statement provides that just compensation:<br><br><blockquote>[C]annot be an absolute amount disregarding particularities of productivity, distance to the marketplace <b>and so on</b>. Hence, land valuation is not an exact science but an exercise fraught with inexact estimates requiring integrity, conscientiousness and prudence on the part of those responsible for it."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Understandably, therefore, Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657, which contains only a finite enumeration of variables to be considered in determininjust compensation, is characterized as mere "guidance on land valuation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>The law is not particularly exacting on equating just compensation with the economic value of the land. The administrative agencies that were assigned the task of evaluating the value of the land missed several important factors. For instance, Administrative Order No. 5, though more specific than Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657, does not capture all factors necessary to comply with the constitutional mandate of just compensation.<br><br>The Department of Agrarian Reform considers the following formula in determining just compensation:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br><blockquote><i>LV = (CNI x 60%)</i> + <i>(CS x 30%) </i>+ <i>(MV x 10%)</i><br><br>Where:<br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="11%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">LV </div> </td> <td width="9%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">=</div> </td> <td width="80%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Land Value</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">CNI</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">=</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Capitalized Net Income</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">CS</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">=</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Comparable Sales</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">MV</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">=</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Market Value per Tax Declaration</div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><br>The first component in the formula is <i><b>Capitalized Net Income</b>.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> This refers to the difference between annual gross sales and the total cost of operations capitalized at the interest rate of 12%. This is the closest approximation of the <b>productivity</b> of the land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> The annual gross product of the land is multiplied by the average annual selling price. The cost of operation is subtracted from this amount to obtain the <i><b><i>Net Income</i></b>.</i> Net income is divided by the interest rate to arrive at the <i><b>Capitalized Net Income</b>.</i> In formula terms:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="11%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">CNI</div> </td> <td width="9%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">=</div> </td> <td width="80%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Capitalized Net Income </div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">AGP</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">=</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Annual Gross Product </div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">SP</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">=</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Selling Price</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">CO</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">=</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Cost of Operation</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">12%</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">=</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Interest Rate</div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><br>However, <i><b>Capitalized Net Income</b></i> in the Department of Agrarian Reform's formula does not account for the discounted future income stream or the "net present value." This is important because when a landowner lets go of his property, he is not only letting go of income for a year, but he is also letting go of future income. It is possible that this is one major factor why landowners feel that the Department of Agrarian Reform or Land Bank assessment of just compensation is severely undervalued.<br><br>The second component is <i><b>Comparable Sales</b>.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> This component examines prices of sales transactions of other parcels of land within the same <i>barangay </i>that have the same land use and topography. The Department of Agrarian Reform guidelines recommend the average of at least three comparable sales transactions<br><br>The problem with this is that they cannot fully account for the fact that prices per unit of land fluctuate with the size of the total parcel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> The Department of Agrarian Reform also did not give guidelines stating that similar land transactions should be alike in population density as well as the accessibility of the property in terms of road networks and commercial centers.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> The requirement that it should be from the same <i>barangay </i>is less important than land use, population density, and accessibility factors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> A more comparable land transaction might be situated in a different province, which would be a better basis than a land transaction in the same <i>barangay </i>where the property has different intrinsic and extrinsic land conditions. This is a noticeable gap in the formula considering that land size, population density, and accessibility are highly influential factors in price-setting.<br><br>The Department of Agrarian Reform's issuance merely provides for sub-factors or substitutes in the event of insufficient data for comparable sales: first, the <i>acquisition cost </i>of the property; and second, the <i>market value based on mortgage.</i><br><br>The inclusion of acquisition cost in the computation is in keeping with Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657. On the other hand, market value based on mortgage refers to the appraised value in a mortgage contract if the property is mortgaged under certain conditions. Market value based on mortgage is used only to a limited extent.<br><br>Despite the perception that the Department of Agrarian Reform's rules and regulations try to capture the determinants enumerated under Republic Act No. 6657, most of the critical land attributes including productivity, acquisition cost, location, and accessibility factors are only <i>indirectly</i> corporated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Moreover, the assigned weights to the factors included in the Department of Agrarian Reform formula are static. Understandably, these are thought of as "control mechanisms to prevent manipulation."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> However, there is still room for manipulation in the formula itself. For instance, the administrative agency is still given the choice of what land transactions to include in comparable sales.<br><br>We noted in <i>Export Processing Zone Authority v. Dulay</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> that:<br><br><blockquote>[I]n estimating the market value, all the capabilities of the property and all the uses to which it may be applied or for which it is adapted are to be considered and not merely the condition it is in the time and the use to which it is then applied by the owner. All the facts as to the condition of the property and its surroundings, its improvements and capabilities may be shown and considered in estimating its value.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Market value is not fully determined in the Department of Agrarian Reform's formula.<br><br>For agricultural land valuation, many other factors may be considered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup><br><br>For instance, land attributes are important. In some areas, smaller parcels of land may be more costly than larger parcels. Land value per unit of land may decrease as the area of the total land area increases. Topography also matters. Flatlands for specific crops may be more valuable than those that are sloping or are located in higher terrain. Soil types affect price given the kinds of crops planted in the land. The improvements already existing in the land or surrounding it should also be considered. There can already be access to infrastructure like farm to market roads as well as irrigation. The alternative uses of the property other than for agriculture should also be considered.<br><br>A study of agricultural land transactions in the 1980s in Regions IV and IX showed the most significant factors affecting land values: topography, land size, value of improvements, population density, influence of agrarian reform, gross farm mcome, personal mcome, and locational/accessibility factors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>Particularities relating to these factors cannot be addressed using only fixed parameters and formulas. The variables that affect the fair market value of a specific property can only be determined on a case-to-case basis. Each property varies in particularities that may or may not affect its value.<br><br>We cannot declare that the variables enumerated in the law are already exhaustive. It is not beyond imagination that other variables and variable relationships exist, which, due to the limited information about the particular circumstances of each case, remain undiscovered and unconsidered by the Department of Agrarian Reform. Both the law and the Department of Agrarian Reform, with their consistent revisions of formulations for valuation of land to be expropriated for agrarian reform, attest to this.<br><br>Only by considering all relevant factors can just compensation be most closely approximated, and therefore, the fundamental rights of landowners be upheld. Proper valuation of properties is a result of a complex interaction of variables, which may not be encompassed in a single formula. No single formula guarantees a fair property valuation. However, this does not mean that valuation or just compensation cannot be determined.<br><br>This is precisely why the final determination is to be done by a court of law. The judge receives a report from commissioners that were appointed following the procedure outlined in the Rules of Court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> The commissioners deliberate on the required valuation given the peculiarities of the property in question.<br><br>Hence, the trial court cannot be said to have erred when, in determining the just compensation for the subject properties, it adopted an approach different from what was laid out in Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 and Department of Agrarian Reform Administrative Order No. 05, Series of 1998. According to the trial court, its valuation was based on the evidence submitted by both petitioner Alfonso and respondents Land Bank and Department of Agrarian Reform, the report of the appointed commissioner, the location of the property, the current value of like properties, the improvements, its actual use, the social and economic benefits of the land to the community, the Bureau of Internal Revenue zonal values, the assessor's schedule of market values, and community facilities and utilities in the area.<br><br>The trial court's adoption ofthe average of the Market Data Approach and Capitalized Income Approach in computing the just compensation for the subject properties was an exercise of discretion necessary in the performance of its judicial function.<br><br>Having considered the indicators available and deemed as relevant, the trial court did not arbitrarily arrive at a valuation. What the court did was to exercise its duty to determine just compensation in accordance with the available data. It cannot, therefore, be set aside for not adhering to the Department of Agrarian Reform's fixed formula without impairing judicial functions.<br><br>Moreover, we have to recognize that the administrative determination of land value will never be perfected, and not all landowners will settle for the administratively determined offer. Due to the particularities of each case, disagreement as to the valuation of land between the landowner and the expropriator will always exist.<br><br>The judicial determination of just compensation is there to break bargaining deadlocks between buyer and seller when these administrative formulations cannot be modified fast enough to accommodate the exigencies of the situation. Judicial determination will provide more flexibility in order to achieve the ideal where government, as buyer, will pay without coercion, and the landowner, as seller, will accept without compulsion.<br><br>Interpreting Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6657 and Department of Agrarian Reform Administrative Order No. 5 as mandate to the courts is tantamount to underrating the effect of each property's peculiarities. To sanction disregard of these particularities endangers the right of landowners to just compensation. It is even inconsistent with the Prefatory Statement of Administrative Order No. 5, which emphasizes the role of these particularities in the proper determination of just compensation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br><center><b>IV</b></center><br><br>At present, the judiciary's role as guardian of and final arbiter over transgressions of fundamental rights remains. The judiciary cannot effectively exercise such a role if its powers with respect to the determination of just compensation is restricted by laws and issuances dictating how just compensation should be determined.<br><br>We must, therefore, abandon our rulings in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Spouses. Banal</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> and <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> that executive and legislative issuances providing for the proper determination of just compensation must be adhered to by the courts. Mandating strict adherence to these executive and legislative issuances is not only tantamount to an unwarranted abdication of judicial authority, it also endangers rights against undue deprivation of property and to just compensation.<br><br>The policies adhered to by the executive branch may also change with every election period. It would be unwise to mandate that the courts follow a single formula for determining just compensation considering that the current formula of the Department of Agrarian Reform can just as easily be discontinued by another administration.<br><br>While this case should be remanded to the Special Agrarian Court for the determination of just compensation, the court should be allowed to deviate from the Department of Agrarian Reform's formulas if it finds a different method of valuation based on the evidence presented.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to remand Civil Case No. 2002-7073 and Civil Case No. 2002-7090 to the Special Agrarian Court for the determination of just compensation.<br><br><br></http:><div align="right"><http: www.dar.gov.ph="" q-and-a-on-carp="" english=""><b>(SGD.)
