				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Failure of counsel to act upon a client's case resulting in the prescription of available remedies is negligence in violation of Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. The general rule is that notice to counsel is notice to client. This rule remains until counsel notifies the court that he or she is withdrawing his or her appearance, or client informs the court of change of counsel. Untruthful statements made in pleadings filed before courts, to make it appear that the pleadings are filed on time, are contrary to a lawyer's duty of committing no falsehood.<br><br>Atty. Pablo B. Francisco (Atty. Francisco) filed an administrative Complaint<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for violation of Canons 10 and 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility against Atty.

This petition is being filed within sixty days after the petitioners obtained knowledge on June 29, 2009 of the Order/decision dated March 26, 2009 denying the motion for reconsideration and not more than six (6) months after judgment was entered on May 20, 2009[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Atty.

It can not be that petitioners came to know through their lawyer of the Order, dated March 26, 2009 only on June 29, 2009. That allegation is a travesty of facts because on June 3, 2009, respondent [referring to Atty. Francisco] filed his motion for issuance of writ of execution of the RTC decision with the Municipal Trial Court of Binangonan and furnished a copy of said motion to petitioners' counsel [referring to Atty. Flores] on the same day of June 3, 2009. Said motion was heard on June 17, 2009, with Atty. Romeo M.

Flores entered his appearance in SCA Case No. 09-015 on August 20, 2009. Atty. Francisco claims that Atty.

He had given instructions to his staff to furnish copies of all court processes to his clients and to refer all legal matters to either Atty. Leonardo C. Aseoche or Atty. Baltazar O. Abasolo as collaborating counsels, both practicing lawyers in Binangonan, Rizal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Respondent did not state the exact date when he received a copy of the Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Execution. The record shows that he received it on June 3, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Respondent then alleges that he immediately informed the Finezas about the matter, but later on contradicted himself when he stated "that he has no personal knowledge as to when the Fineza[s] learned or had knowledge of the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Respondent's statement that he had no knowledge when the Finezas learned about the denial of their Motion for Reconsideration is also contradicted by the Finezas' allegations in their Petition for Relief from Judgment that:<br><br><blockquote>4. It was only <i>on June 29, 2009 that defendants through their lawyer came to know of the Order dated March 26, 2009</i>[,] denying their "Motion for Reconsideration" of the decision/Order dated January 15, 2009 reversing the Order of Dismissal by the Municipal Trial Court, Branch 2, Binangonan, Rizal[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Further, respondent does not deny complainant's allegation that he and the Finezas were present when the Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Execution was heard by the trial court on June 17 and 24, 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>From the foregoing, it is clear that respondent and the Finezas knew about the trial court's Order denying their Motion for Reconsideration before June 29, 2009.<br><br>While the Complaint is limited to the allegations in the Petition for Relief from Judgment, this court notes that respondent was also not truthful in his Motion for Reconsideration filed before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines. In his Motion for Reconsideration, he alleged that:<br><br><blockquote>The allegation of complainant that respondent received on April 31, 2009 the Order of March 26, 2009 denying his motion for reconsideration is not correct. It was the law office through his staff that received on 26 March 2009 the Order of Denial, per Reg.

He initially claimed that he was on vacation from February 9, 2009 to May 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> He subsequently claimed that his vacation was from February 11, 2009 to June 2009.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>The glaring inconsistencies in respondent's statements are sufficient to show that he is guilty of violating Canon 10, Rule 10.01.<br><br>The importance of Canon 10, Rule 10.01 was extensively discussed in <i>Spouses Umaguing v. De Vera</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> which involved the submission of a falsified affidavit in an electoral protest. This court discussed that:<br><br><blockquote>Fundamental is the rule that in his dealings with his client and with the courts, every lawyer is expected to be honest, imbued with integrity, and trustworthy. These expectations, though high and demanding, are the professional and ethical burdens of every member of the Philippine Bar, for they have been given full expression in the Lawyer's Oath that every lawyer of this country has taken upon admission as a bonafide member of the Law Profession, thus:<br><br><blockquote>I,____________________ , do solemnly swear that I will maintain allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines; I will support its Constitution and obey the laws as well as the legal orders of the duly constituted authorities therein; <u><b>I will do no falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in court</b></u>; I will not wittingly or willingly promote or sue any groundless, false or unlawful suit, nor give aid nor consent to the same. I will delay no man for money or malice, and will conduct myself as a lawyer according to the best of my knowledge and discretion with all good fidelity as well to the courts as to my clients; and I impose upon myself this voluntary obligation without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion. So help me God.<br></blockquote><br>The Lawyer's Oath enjoins every lawyer not only to obey the laws of the land but also to refrain from doing any falsehood in or out of court or from consenting to the doing of any in court, and to conduct himself according to the best of his knowledge and discretion with all good fidelity to the courts as well as to his clients. Every lawyer is a servant of the law, and has to observe and maintain the rule of law as well as be an exemplar worthy of emulation by others. It is by no means a coincidence, therefore, that the core values of honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness are emphatically reiterated by the Code of Professional Responsibility. In this light, Rule 10.01, Canon 10 of the Code of Professional Responsibility provides that "[a] lawyer shall not do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in Court; nor shall he mislead, or allow the Court to be misled by any artifice."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring in the original, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>This court also finds that respondent violated Rule 10.03 of Canon 10, which provides:<br><br><blockquote>Rule 10.03 — A lawyer shall observe the rules of procedure and shall not misuse them to defeat the ends of justice.</blockquote><br>Respondent admitted that he assisted the Finezas "in filing the petition for relief from judgment."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Subsequently, respondent moved to withdraw the Petition for Relief from Judgment after recognizing that it was filed erroneously.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> As stated in the trial court's Order:<br><br><blockquote>Nevertheless, the court interposed clarificatory questions to the petitioners and as a result of the discussion this morning, petitioners' <i>counsel moved for the withdrawal of his Petition for Relieffi'om Judgment after realizing that he erroneously filed the petition</i> before another court and in another case in violation of Section 1 of Rule 38 of the Revised Rules of Court.<br><br>WHEREFORE, on motion of the petitioners through counsel, the Court resolved to consider the instant petition for Relief from Judgment docketed as SCA Case No. 09-015 entitled Ranier [sic] B.

Being the lawyer who filed the Motion for Reconsideration, he should have been prepared for the possibility that his Motion would be acted upon by the trial court during the time that he was on vacation. In addition, he does not deny that his office, through his staff, received by registered mail a copy of the trial court's Order on April 3, 2009.<br><br>Respondent argues that he instructed his staff to inform his clients of court processes and to refer legal matters to Atty. Leonardo C. Aseoche or Atty. Baltazar O. Abasolo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> However, respondent did not present evidence to support his argument.<br><br>Respondent further argues that he was not negligent and explained that in the case docketed as Civil Case 384-B for Quieting of Title with Prayer for Restraining Order/Injunction, he successfully prevented the demolition of the Finezas' family home.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup><br><br>Respondent may not have been negligent in handling Civil Case No. 384-B, but he was negligent in handling SCA No. 08-018. When he allegedly informed the Finezas of the trial court's Order, he should have immediately discussed the matter with his clients. The records of this case show that he did not consult his clients on what legal remedies they would like to avail themselves of after the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br>Respondent attended the hearing on the Motion for Issuance of a Writ of Execution, and that it was allegedly the Finezas, on their own, who filed the Petition for Relief from Judgment. Respondent claims that he merely assisted the Finezas in filing the Petition for Relief, but was not representing them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> He argues that he could not represent the Finezas because "he has no personal knowledge as to when the Fineza[s] learned or had knowledge of the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Respondent also seems to have forgotten the general rule that notice to counsel is also notice to client. Thus, when his office received a copy of the trial court's Order on April 3, 2009, his clients are also deemed as having been notified on the same date. <br><br><i>Manaya v. Alabang Country Club, Inc.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> involved the dismissal of an appeal before the National Labor Relations Commission due to its late filing.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Respondent Alabang Country Club filed a Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals and argued that its lawyer abandoned it, thus, it was "not effectively represented by a competent counsel."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> The Court of Appeals granted the Petition for Certiorari.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Petitioner Fernando G. Manaya then filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari before this court, which was granted.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[95]</sup></font> This court explained that:<br><br><blockquote><i>It is axiomatic that when a client is represented by counsel, notice to counsel is notice to client. In the absence of a notice of withdrawal or substitution of counsel, the Court will rightly assume that the counsel of record continues to represent his client and receipt of notice by the former is the reckoning point of the reglementary period</i>. As heretofore adverted, the original counsel did not file any notice of withdrawal. Neither was there any intimation by respondent at that time that it was terminating the services of its counsel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><br>In <i>Ramirez v. Buhayang-Margallo,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> this court found Atty. Mercedes Buhayang-Margallo guilty of violating Rule 18.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility because she failed to file the appellant's brief within the reglementary period that resulted in the loss of available remedies for her client.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>Assuming that the Finezas learned about the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration only on June 29, 2009, this would further support the allegations in the Complaint that respondent violated Canon 18. Respondent alleges that he learned about the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration when he received a copy of the Motion for Issuance of Writ of Execution. While he did not state the exact date when he received a copy of the Motion, the record shows that he received it on June 3, 2009. If it were true that the Finezas learned about the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration on June 29, 2009, then it shows that respondent did not immediately inform his clients about the status of the forcible entry case. It took him more than 20 days to inform his clients on the matter. Respondent's failure to immediately update his clients and act upon the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration, which resulted in the expiration of the period for filing a Petition for Relief from Judgment, clearly points to negligence on his part.<br><br>This court takes judicial notice that respondent was previously suspended from the practice of law for two years in <i>Serzo v.
