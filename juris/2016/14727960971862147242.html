(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>As accused-appellant committed the act with the qualifying circumstances under Article 266-B(6)(l) and (10), rape is qualified for the second charge.<br><br>For the third charge (sexual violence against a minor through acts of lasciviousness), Republic Act No. 7610 provides the following elements:<br><br><blockquote>Section 5. <i>Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse.</i><br>.....<br><blockquote>(b) Those who commit the act of ... <i>lascivious conduct</i> with a child ... or subject to other sexual abuse; <i>Provided,</i> That when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be: <i>Provided,</i> That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote><br>Article 2(h) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 7610 defines lascivious conduct as:<br><br><blockquote>[T]he intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br></blockquote><br>A careful examination of the records shows that there is nothing that would warrant a reversal of the Decisions of the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals. When a woman, especially a minor,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[65]</sup></font> alleges rape, "she says in effect all that is necessary to mean that she has been raped."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>It is settled that "factual findings of the trial court and its evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are entitled to great respect and will not be disturbed on appeal, unless the trial court is shown to have overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied any fact or circumstance of" weight and substance."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>The prosecution satisfactorily established the elements to prove that accused-appellant raped and sexually abused AAA, a 12-year-old minor with the cognitive ability of a nine-year-old. In <i>People v. Dalipe</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[A] young girl's revelation that she had been raped, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her dignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as mere concoction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></blockquote><br>As pointed out by the Court of Appeals, several circumstances, which have been duly established from the evidence, point to the conclusion that accused-appellant is responsible for the crimes charged against him.<br><br>On the two (2) charges of rape and one (1) charge of child abuse, AAA clearly and consistently communicated how accused-appellant forced or intimidated her into having sexual congress with him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> He put his penis in her mouth (rape through sexual assault) and inserted his penis into her vagina (rape through carnal knowledge).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> He mashed her breasts and kissed her on the lips and on her vagina (child abuse through acts of lasciviousness).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>The lacerations sustained by AAA in her vagina, which, as Dr. Joseph Palermo testified, could have been caused by a penetration, show that carnal knowledge happened.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Lacerations, whether fresh or healed, are the best physical evidence of rape.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>As to the circumstances qualifying rape, the prosecution established that the victim is under 18 years old and that the offender is her guardian.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Dr. Elma Tolentino's testimony and AAA's dental record prove AAA's minority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> AAA's cousin, BBB, also confirmed this on the basis of the birth certificate that BBB obtained from their grandmother,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> which the defense never refuted.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> AAA is accused-appellant's foster daughter. She, her mother (accused-appellant's former live-in partner), and accused-appellant resided in his house. After AAA's mother passed away, accused-appellant took AAA in his custody. Soon, accused-appellant took AAA's aunt, CCC, as his common-law spouse. They all lived together.<br><br>The prosecution also established that accused-appellant knew that AAA was intellectually challenged at the time of the offense. BBB testified that accused-appellant knew that AAA was intellectually challenged "even before the incident."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Accused-appellant himself admitted that he considered AAA his "adopted daughter."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Thus, he would have known of her condition.<br><br>In addition, the Sexual Crime Protocol and Dr. Joseph Palermo's testimony show AAA's mental age to be nine (9) years old. This makes the victim less than 12 years old, in light of our ruling in <i>Quintos</i>. The act is, therefore, classified as statutory rape under Article 266-A(l)(d) of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>The Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals correctly found that the victim's testimony is credible. Given her cognitive "immaturity and lowly intelligence," she "could not have concocted a tale of pure fantasy out of a mere imagination."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> AAA likewise spontaneously cried during direct examination, a tell-tale sign of her credibility.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>As against these details and testimonies, all that accused-appellant offered in defense were denials and alibis, defenses which jurisprudence has long considered weak and unreliable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup><br><br>The Regional Trial Court properly found, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> that the testimonies of AAA, BBB, and the medico-legal officer of the Philippine National Police, among others, were consistent with each other and with the physical evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> There was no showing that the witnesses for the prosecution had ill motives to testify against accused-appellant. Their testimonies are, therefore, accorded full faith and credence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>In sum, the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals did not err in finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of qualified rape and one (1) count of child abuse.<br><br>The Regional Trial Court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> as affirmed by the Court of Appeals,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> imposed an indeterminate penalty of six (6) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i> as minimum to 17 years and 10 months of <i>reclusion temporal</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> We modify this penalty for the second charge (rape through sexual assault) under Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Article 266-B(10) of the Revised Penal Code states that the penalty of <i>reclusion temporal</i> shall be imposed if the rape through sexual assault is committed with <i>any of the 10 aggravating/qualifying circumstances</i> listed in paragraph 6.<br><br>In this case, the aggravating/qualifying circumstances of relationship and minority (Article 266-B(6)(1)) and the offender's knowledge of the victim's intellectual disability (Article 266-B(6)(10)) are present. The rape was committed by a guardian or the common-law spouse of AAA's mother against the offended party's foster child, whom he knew had the cognitive ability of a nine-year-old.<br><br>In view of the aggravating circumstances present, the penalty prescribed by the Revised Penal Code (i.e. <i>reclusion temporal</i>) under Article 266-B(10) shall be in its maximum period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> Therefore, we impose the indeterminate sentence of 12 years of prision mayor as minimum and 20 years of reclusion temporal as maximum.<br><br>Between rape of a minor under the Revised Penal Code and that under Republic Act No. 7610, the higher penalty must be applied for the minor victim's benefit. This Court has held that imposing a lower penalty for the offender "is undeniably unfair to the child victim."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Thus, in <i>People v. Chingh</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> and <i>People v. Ricalde</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> this Court meted the higher penalty stated in Republic Act No. 7610<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> (i.e. <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period) instead of the lower penalty stated in the Revised Penal Code (i.e. <i>prision mayor</i>).<br><br>In this case, there is no need to apply the penalty under Republic Act No. 7610. The penalty for the crime of rape, being qualified pursuant to Article 266-B(6)(1) and (10) of the Revised Penal Code, is already for the minor victim's benefit.<br><br>Unlike in <i>Chingh</i> and <i>Ricalde</i>, this case has aggravating circumstances. Applying these aggravating circumstances qualifies the rape and allows for a higher penalty of <i>reclusion temporal </i>in its maximum period, instead of simply <i>reclusion temporal</i> in the medium period under Republic Act No. 7610.<br><br>In <i>People v. Bonaagua</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It must be clarified . . . that the reasoning expounded by the Court in the recent case of People v. Armando Chingh y Parcia, for imposing upon the accused the higher penalty provided in Section 5 (b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610, has no application in the case at bar.<br>....<br>In the present case, the factual milieu was different since the offender, Ireno [Bonaagua], is the father of the minor victim. Hence, the offenses were committed with the aggravating/qualifying circumstances of <i>minority and relationship,</i> attendant circumstances which were not present in the Chingh case, which in turn, warrants the imposition of the higher penalty of <i>reclusion temporal</i> prescribed by Article 266-B of the R[evised] P[enal] C[ode]. Considering that the R[evised] P[enal] C[ode] already prescribes such penalty, the rationale of unfairness to the child victim that Chingh wanted to correct is absent. Hence, there is no more need to apply the penalty prescribed by R.A. No. 7610.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote><br>We also modify the penalty for the third charge (sexual violence against a minor through acts of lasciviousness) under Republic Act 7610.
