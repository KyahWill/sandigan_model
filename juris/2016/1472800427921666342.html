That person, whom she did not name, showed her the plastic sachets allegedly confiscated from her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Caiz stated that it was the first time she saw the plastic sachets.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>They then went to the office of the Special Operations Group of the Philippine National Police Office in Lingayen. Caiz testified that while she was there, "she was offered a meal and allowed to watch TV."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> After, they proceeded to the Urdaneta City Police Station. Caiz alleged that the seized sachets were marked at the police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> A medical examination was conducted on her at a hospital.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>After two (2) days of incarceration at the police station,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Caiz was brought to the prosecutor's office and was made to sign documents.

She sold "one heat-sealed plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> to PO1 Valle. The sachet was found to contain 0.05 gram of shabu. The seized sachet and the marked money were presented in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The trial court held that the charge against Caiz for illegal possession of dangerous drugs was to be absorbed by the crime of illegal sale, thus:<br><blockquote>As to the charge of illegal possession of dangerous drugs against said accused, the same is already absorbed in the crime of illegal sale. Based on the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, accused was arrested and frisked immediately after the consummation of the sale transaction resulting in the recovery of two more plastic sachets of shabu from her pocket. The fact that the arresting officer recovered other plastic sachets containing shabu from the pocket of the accused during said illegal sale transaction is already immaterial - and will not justify the filing of a separate case of illegal possession as enunciated by the Court in the case of People vs. Lacerna. . . . Possession of prohibited drugs is generally inherent in the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs and that conviction for both offenses is not feasible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The dispositive portion of the Regional Trial Court Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs and the court sentences her to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Php500,000.00.<br><br>The case of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs filed against said accused is hereby DISMISSED.<br><br>The prohibited drugs presented in court as evidence is ordered forfeited in favor of the government and shall be forwarded to the PDEA Office for the proper disposition.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>In her appeal before the Court of Appeals, Caiz argued that there were several procedural lapses committed by the police officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Section 86<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Republic Act No. 9165 requires coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, which the police officers did not do. The place where the seized sachets were marked was not proven because the police officers gave different testimonies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Further, the confiscation receipts prepared by SPO1 Patricio were not signed by Caiz, her representative or counsel, a representative from the media, a representative from the Department of Justice, or any public official.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Caiz was not given a copy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Caiz claimed that there were no photographs of the seized sachets and the booking sheet of accused was prepared on the day after she was arrested.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The police officer who received the request for laboratory examination and the forensic chemist were not presented in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> She also alleged that the prosecution was unable to show "who had the custody and safekeeping of the drugs after their examination and pending their presentation in court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General argued that the trial court correctly convicted Caiz because the prosecution was able to prove that the sale of illegal drugs took place, and the items seized were presented in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>In addition, the required procedure in handling the seized items was substantially complied with. The police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The Office of the Solicitor General likewise argued that non-compliance with Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 "would not necessarily render the evidence obtained from the drug operation as inadmissible, but it would only affect the merit or probative value of such evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General claimed that although there were inconsistencies in the testimonies of PO1 Valle and SPO1 Patricio on where the seized item was marked, the inconsistency "[did] not affect the credibility of the witnesses."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The inconsistencies in their testimonies referred to trivial and insignificant matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>On the confiscation receipts, the Office of the Solicitor-General cited <i>People v. Rosialda</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> in that "[t]he failure of the prosecution to show that the police officers conducted the required physical inventory and photograph of the evidence confiscated pursuant to said guidelines, is not fatal and does not automatically render accused-appellant's arrest illegal or the items seized/confiscated from him inadmissible."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>On the non-presentation of the forensic chemist, the Office of the Solicitor General cited <i>People v. Amansec</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> and argued that the laboratory reports and chemistry reports are sufficient to prove that the chain of custody was not broken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the Regional Trial Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> It held that Caiz failed to present evidence that the chain of custody was broken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> It further held that non-compliance with Article II, Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 does not justify Caiz's acquittal. "What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the foregoing considered, the instant appeal is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> and the appealed Decision dated July 18, 2012 <b>AFFIRMED</b> <i>in toto</i>. No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Caiz filed a Notice of Appeal on September 26, 2014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>The Notice of Appeal was noted and given due course in the Court of Appeals' October 20, 2014 Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> The case records were elevated to this Court on December 1, 2014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> dated January 28, 2015, this Court noted the records forwarded by the Court of Appeals and notified the parties that they could file their respective supplemental briefs within 30 days from notice.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General filed a Manifestation and Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> stating that it would not file a supplemental brief since Caiz did not raise new issues in her appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Counsel for Caiz filed a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> informing this Court that it would no longer file a supplemental brief.<br><br>We resolve the following issues:<br><br>First, whether the guilt of accused-appellant Gloria Caiz y Talvo for violation of Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165 was proven beyond reasonable doubt; and<br><br>Second, whether the rules on the chain of custody of the corpus delicti were observed.<br><br>We find for accused-appellant.<br><br>The prosecution was unable to prove the integrity of the corpus delicti. The non-compliance with the requirements of Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165 was not justified.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>The elements of violation of Section 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> of Republic Act No. 9165 are:<br><blockquote>(1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment.

Dahil</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> has discussed the purpose and importance of marking evidence:<br><blockquote>Marking after seizure is the starting point in the custodial link; hence, it is vital that the seized contraband be immediately marked because succeeding handlers of the specimens will use the markings as reference. The marking of the evidence serves to separate the marked evidence from the <i>corpus</i> of all other similar or related evidence from the time they are seized from the accused until they are disposed of at the end of the criminal proceedings, this, preventing switching, planting or contamination of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Second, the police officers failed to have the confiscation receipts signed by accused-appellant, by her representative or counsel, by a representative from the media, the Department of Justice, or by an elected public official.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> The police officers likewise failed to give a copy of the confiscation receipts to accused-appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> The prosecution does not refute these procedural lapses but argues that substantial compliance with the chain of custody rule is sufficient,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> citing <i>People v.

The same provision clearly states as well, that it must still be shown that there exists justifiable grounds and proof that the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence have been preserved.<br><br>. . . . <br><br>. . . The chain of custody requirement performs the function of ensuring that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved, so much so that unnecessary doubts as to the identity of the evidence are removed.<br><br><i>To be admissible, the prosecution must show by records or testimony, the continuous whereabouts of the exhibit at least between the time it came into possession of the police officers and until it was tested in the laboratory to determine its composition up to the time it was offered in evidence.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>In this case, the integrity of the corpus delicti is in doubt because the police officers cannot even state with certainty where the seized sachets were marked.<br><br>Third, none of the witnesses testified that the seized sachets were photographed.

Rebotazo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> has discussed that Section 86<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> of Republic Act No. 9165 does not state any consequence in case a buy-bust operation is not coordinated with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, thus:<br><blockquote>It is a well-established rule of statutory construction that where great inconvenience will result from a particular construction, or great public interests would be endangered or sacrificed, or great mischief done, such construction is to be avoided, or the court ought to presume that such construction was not intended by the makers of the law, unless required by clear and unequivocal words.</blockquote><blockquote>As we see it, Section 86 is explicit only in saying that the PDEA shall be the "lead agency" in the investigations and prosecutions of drug-related cases. Therefore, other law enforcement bodies still possess authority to perform similar functions as the PDEA as long as illegal drugs cases will eventually be transferred to the latter. Additionally, the same provision states that PDEA, serving as the implementing arm of the Dangerous Drugs Board, "shall be responsible for the efficient and effective law enforcement of all the provisions on any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical as provided in the Act." We find much logic in the Solicitor General's interpretation that it is only appropriate that drugs cases being handled by other law enforcement authorities be transferred or referred to the PDEA as the "lead agency" in the campaign against the menace of dangerous drugs. Section 86 is more of an administrative provision. By having a centralized law enforcement body, <i>i.e.</i>, the PDEA, the Dangerous Drugs Board can enhance the efficacy of the law against dangerous drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup><br></blockquote>This Court has ruled in other cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> that nothing in Section 86 states that non-coordination with the PDEA renders the buy-bust operation invalid.<br><br><center><b>IV</b><br></center><i><br>Mallillin v. People</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> emphasizes why proof of the chain of custody in dangerous drugs cases must be strictly complied with:<br><blockquote>A unique characteristic of narcotic substances is that they are not readily identifiable as in fact they are subject to scientific analysis to determine their composition and nature. The Court cannot reluctantly close its eyes to the likelihood, or at least the possibility, that at any of the links in the chain of custody over the same there could have been tampering, alteration or substitution of substances from other cases — by accident or otherwise — in which similar evidence was seized or in which similar evidence was submitted for laboratory testing. Hence, in authenticating the same, a standard more stringent than that applied to cases involving objects which are readily identifiable must be applied, a more exacting standard that entails a chain of custody of the item with sufficient completeness if only to render it improbable that the original item has either been exchanged with another or been contaminated or tampered with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup><br></blockquote>The law recognizes that there may be instances when exact compliance with the required procedure is not observed. Thus, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Section 21 of Republic Act No. 9165, as amended, provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Implementing Guidelines</i>. — The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:<br><br>. . . .<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">A.1.9. </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Noncompliance, under justifiable grounds, with the requirements of Section 21 (1) of RA No. 9165, as amended, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over the items provided the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A.1.10. </div></td><td><div align="justify">Any justification or explanation in cases of noncompliance with the requirements of Section 21 (1) of RA No. 9165, as amended, shall be clearly stated in the sworn statements/affidavits of the apprehending/seizing officers, as well as the steps taken to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized/confiscated items. Certification or record of coordination for operating units other than the PDEA pursuant to Section 86 (a) and (b), Article IX of the IRR of RA No. 9165 shall be presented.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Here, the prosecution does not offer any explanation why there were several procedural lapses. The prosecution's argument that there is a presumption that "official duty has been regularly performed"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> will not suffice. Thus:<br><blockquote>It needs no elucidation that the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty must be seen in the context of an existing rule of law or statute authorizing the performance of an act or duty or prescribing a procedure in the performance thereof. The presumption, in other words, obtains only where nothing on record suggests that the law enforcers involved deviated from the standard conduct of official duty as provided for in the law. Otherwise, where the official act in question is irregular on its face, an adverse presumption arises as a matter of course.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><i>People v. Garry dela Cruz</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> acquitted the accused as the prosecution failed to establish the corpus delicti due to non-compliance with the rule on the chain of custody:<br><blockquote>Non-compliance is tantamount to failure in establishing identity of corpus delicti, an essential element of the offenses of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs. By failing to establish an element of these offenses, non-compliance will, thus, engender the acquittal of an accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br></blockquote>Courts are reminded to exercise a higher level of scrutiny when deciding cases involving miniscule amounts of dangerous drugs. There should be stricter compliance with the rule on the chain of custody when the amount of the dangerous drug is minute due to the possibility that the seized item was tampered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> We reiterate the words in <i>People v. Holgado</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><blockquote>It is lamentable that while our dockets are clogged with prosecutions under Republic Act No. 9165 involving small-time drug users and retailers, we are seriously short of prosecutions involving the proverbial "big fish." We are swamped with cases involving small fry who have been arrested for miniscule amounts. While they are certainly a bane to our society, small retailers are but low-lying fruits in an exceedingly vast network of drug cartels. Both law enforcers and prosecutors should realize that the more effective and efficient strategy is to focus resources more on the source and true leadership of these nefarious organizations. Otherwise, all these executive and judicial resources expended to attempt to convict an accused for 0.05 gram of <i>shabu</i> under doubtful custodial arrangements will hardly make a dent in the overall picture. It might in fact be distracting our law enforcers from their more challenging task: to uproot the causes of this drug menace.
