				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal filed by Jerry Pepino (<i>Pepino</i>) and Preciosa Gomez (<i>Gomez</i>) assailing the June 16, 2006 decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 02026.<br><br><u><center><b>ANTECEDENTS</b><br></center></u><br>The prosecution evidence showed that at 1:00 p.m., on June 28, 1997, two men and a woman entered the office of Edward Tan at Kilton Motors Corporation in Sucat, Paranaque City, and pretended to be customers. When Edward was about to receive them, one of the men, eventually identified as Pepino, pulled out a gun. Thinking that it was a holdup, Edward told Pepino that the money was inside the cashier's box. Pepino and the other man looted the cashier's box, handcuffed Edward, and forced him to go with them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> From the hallway, Jocelyn Tan (mentioned as "Joselyn" in some parts of the record), Edward's wife, saw Pepino take her husband. She went to the adjoining room upon Edward's instructions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Pepino brought Edward to a metallic green Toyota Corolla where three other men were waiting inside. The woman (later identified as Gomez) sat on the front passenger seat.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> The abductors then placed surgical tape over Edward's eyes and made him wear sunglasses. After travelling for two and a half hours, they arrived at an apartment in Quezon City. The abductors removed the tape from Edward's eyes, placed him in a room, and then chained his legs. Pepino approached Edward and asked for the phone number of his father so that he could ask for ransom for his (Edward's) liberty. Edward told Pepino to negotiate with his wife, but the latter insisted on talking to his father.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>At around 5:00 p.m. of the same day, the kidnappers called Edward's father and demanded a P40 million ransom for his release. Edward's father told the kidnappers that he did not have that amount. The abductors negotiated with Jocelyn who eventually agreed to a P700,000.00 ransom. The kidnappers told Jocelyn to pack the money into two packages and to drop these at a convenience store in front of McDonald's at Mindanao Avenue. They further demanded that Edward's vehicle be used to bring the money.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>After four days, or on July 1, 1997, Antonio Gepiga (the family driver) brought the agreed amount to the 7-Eleven convenience store at Mindanao Avenue as instructed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> That evening, three men and Gomez blindfolded Edward, made him board a car, and drove around for 30 minutes. Upon stopping, they told Edward that he could remove his blindfold after five minutes. When Edward removed his blindfold, he found himself inside his own car parked at the UP Diliman Campus. He drove home and reported his kidnapping to Teresita Ang See, a known anti-crime crusader.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>After five months, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) informed Edward that they had apprehended some suspects, and invited him to identify them from a lineup consisting of seven persons: five males and two females. Edward positively identified Pepino, Gomez, and one Mario Galgo.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Jocelyn likewise identified Pepino.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Pepino and Gomez did not testify for their defense. The defense instead presented Zeny Pepino, Reynaldo Pepino, NBI Special Investigator Marcelo Jadloc and P/Sr. Insp. Narciso Quano (mentioned as "Qano" in some parts of the record).<br><br>Zeny testified that she and her husband, Jerry Pepino, were inside their house in Cebu City on December 7, 1997, when about 20 heavily armed men entered their house looking for Jerry. When Jerry asked them if they had a warrant of arrest, one of the men pointed a gun at him and handcuffed him; the armed men then hit him with the butt of an armalite and punched him. The men also took Pepino's wristwatch and wallet, as well as Zeny's bag and watch. Some of the armed men searched the second floor of the house, and found a .45 caliber gun. The armed men brought Zeny and Pepino outside their house where Zeny saw Renato Pepino and Larex Pepino already handcuffed. The armed men brought them to the Cebu City Police Headquarters before bringing them to the NBI Headquarters in Manila. The following day, Jerry, Renato, and Larex were brought to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Zeny, on the other hand, was released after being detained at the NBI for three (3) days.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Reynaldo's testimony was summarized by the CA as follows:<br><br><blockquote>x x x On December 6, 1997, he accompanied accused-appellant Gomez to his brother's sister-in-law who happens to work in a recruitment agency. While they were inside the latter's house at Lot 2, Block 15, Marikina Heights, Marikina City, they heard a noise at the gate. When he peeped through the window, he saw two (2) motorcycles and two (2) Vannette vans. Shortly thereafter, someone kicked the back door and several armed men emerged therefrom and announced their arrest. When he asked them if they had any warrant, they replied: "<i>Walang warrant, warrant. Walang search, search." </i>They were then hogtied and made to lie face down. Five (5) of them then went upstairs and seized his personal belongings together with his briefcase which contained P45,000.00, documents of accused-appellant Gomez, and his .45 caliber pistol as well as his license and permit to carry the same. No receipts were issued for their personal effects which were confiscated. They were subsequently brought to Camp Crame and subjected to torture. The following day, they were brought to the Department of Justice and a case for kidnapping was filed against him. Upon reinvestigation, however, he was discharged from the Information and the court dismissed the case against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote><br>SI Jadloc and Police Senior Inspector Quano, Jr. were presented as hostile witnesses.<br><br>Jadloc declared on the witness stand that NBI Assistant Director Edmundo Arugay dispatched a team to Cebu City to investigate a kidnap-for-ransom case. The team immediately conducted surveillance operations when they arrived at Calle Rojo, Lahug, Cebu City. One of the team members saw Renato and Larex Pepino with guns tucked in their waists. When the team approached them, the two men ran inside their house. The team went after them and on entering the house, they saw Jerry in possession of a .45 caliber gun. The team arrested Jerry, Renato and Larex, and then brought them to the NBI Headquarters in Manila.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Quano testified that he was designated as the leader of a team tasked to arrest members of a kidnap-for-ransom group at their safe house in Lot 2, Block 50, Marikina Heights, Marikina City. When they arrived there, they introduced themselves as police officers. The police forcibly opened the door after the occupants of the house refused to open the ground floor door. During their search at the second floor, the operatives found an armalite and a .45 caliber gun. The members of the team handcuffed Gomez and Reynaldo, and then brought them to Camp Crame.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The prosecution charged Preciosa Gomez, Jerry Pepino, Reynaldo Pepino, Jessie Pepino, George Curvera, Boy Lanyujan, Luisito "Tata" Adulfo, Henriso Batijon (a.k.a. Dodoy Batijon), Nerio Alameda, and an alias Wilan Tan with kidnapping for ransom and serious illegal detention before the Regional Trial Court {RTC), Branch 259, Paranaque City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Reynaldo was subsequently discharged after reinvestigation. Only Pepino, Gomez, and Batijon were arraigned; their other co-accused remained at large.<br><br>In its May 15, 2000 decision, the RTC convicted Pepino and Gomez of kidnapping and serious illegal detention under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code (as amended) and sentenced them to suffer the death penalty. The RTC also ordered them to pay Edward P700,000.00 representing the amount extorted from him; P50,000.00 as moral damages; and P50,000 as exemplary damages. The trial court acquitted Batijon for insufficiency of evidence.<br><br>The RTC held that Edward positively identified Pepino and Gomez as two of the persons who forcibly abducted him at gunpoint inside Kilton Motors, and who consequently detained him somewhere in Quezon City for four (4) days until he was released inside the UP Diliman Campus after the payment of ransom. The RTC added that Jocelyn corroborated Edward's testimony on material points. It also pointed out that Edward identified both Pepino and Gomez at the lineup conducted inside the NBI compound, although Jocelyn only recognized Gomez.<br><br>The RTC further ruled that the accused were already estopped from questioning the validity of their arrest after they entered their respective pleas.<br><br>The case was automatically elevated to this Court in view of the death penalty that the RTC imposed. We referred the case to the CA for intermediate review pursuant to our ruling in <i>People v. Mateo.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In its decision dated June 16, 2006, the Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC decision with the modification that the amounts of moral and exemplary damages were increased from P300,000.00 and P100,000.00, respectively.<br><br>The CA held that Pepino and Gomez were deemed to have waived any objection to the illegality of their arrests when they did not move to quash the information before entering their plea, and when they participated at the trial.<br><br>The CA further ruled that Pepino and Gomez conspired with each other to attain a common objective, <i>i.e.</i>, to kidnap Edward in exchange for ransom.<br><br>While the case was under review by the Supreme Court, Pepino filed an urgent motion to withdraw his appeal, which the Court granted.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[17] </sup></font>Only Gomez's appeal is now pending before us.<br><br>In her brief<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and supplemental brief,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Gomez maintained that it was impossible for Edward to have seen her in the front seat of the getaway car because he (Edward) was blindfolded. She also alleged that the prosecution failed to prove that she had conspired with the other accused.<br><br>Gomez further claimed that Edward's identification of her during trial "may have been preconditioned x x x by suggestive identification"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> made at the police lineup. She further argued that the death penalty imposed on her is no longer proper due to the enactment of Republic Act No. 9346.<br><br><u><center><b>THE COURT'S RULING</b><br></center></u><br><b>We affirm Gomez's conviction, but we modify the penalty imposed and the awarded indemnities.<br></b><br><br><u><b>Illegality of the Arrest</b></u><br><br>We point out at the outset that Gomez did not question before arraignment the legality of her warrantless arrest or the acquisition of RTC's jurisdiction over her person. Thus, Gomez is deemed to have waived any objection to her warrantless arrest.<br><br>It is settled that [a]ny objection to the procedure followed in the matter of the acquisition by a court of jurisdiction over the person of the accused must be opportunely raised before he enters his plea; otherwise, the objection is deemed waived.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> As we held in <i>People v. Samson</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[A]ppellant is now estopped from questioning any defect in the manner of his arrest as he failed to move for the quashing of the information before the trial court. Consequently, any irregularity attendant to his arrest was cured when he voluntarily submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the trial court by entering a plea of "not guilty" and by participating in the trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote><br>At any rate, the illegal arrest of an accused is not sufficient cause for setting aside a valid judgment rendered upon a sufficient complaint after a trial free from error. Simply put, the illegality of the warrantless arrest cannot deprive the State of its right to prosecute the guilty when all other facts on record point to their culpability. It is much too late in the day to complain about the warrantless arrest after a valid information had been filed, the accused had been arraigned, the trial had commenced and had been completed, and a judgment of conviction had been rendered against her.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[24]</sup></font><br><br><u><b>Sufficiency of the Prosecution Evidence</b></u><br><br><b>a. Elements of kidnapping proved</b><br><br>The elements of kidnapping and serious illegal detention under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, are: (1) the offender is a private individual; (2) he kidnaps or detains another or in any other manner deprives the latter of his liberty; (3) the act of detention or kidnapping must be illegal; and (4) in the commission of the offense, any of the following circumstances is present: (a) the kidnapping or detention lasts for more than three (3) days; or (b) it is committed by simulating public authority; or (c) serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained or threats to kill him are made; or (d) the person kidnapped or detained is a minor, female, or a public officer. If the victim of kidnapping and serious illegal detention is a minor, the duration of his detention is immaterial. Likewise, if the victim is kidnapped and illegally detained for the purpose of extorting ransom, the duration of his detention is also of no moment and the crime is qualified and becomes punishable by death even if none of the circumstances mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 4 of Article 267 is present.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[25]</sup></font><br><br>All these elements have been established by the prosecution. Edward positively identified Gomez and Pepino - both private individuals - as among the three persons who entered his office and pretended to be Kilton Motors' customers. He further declared that Pepino pointed a gun at him, and forcibly took him against his will.

co-accused brought him to a safe house in Quezon City; detained him there for four (4) days; and <i>demanded ransom</i> from his (Edward's) family.<br><br>It is settled that the crime of serious illegal detention consists not only of placing a person in an enclosure, but also in detaining him or depriving him of his liberty in any manner. For there to be kidnapping, it is enough that the victim is restrained from going home. Its essence is the actual deprivation of the victim's liberty, coupled with indubitable proof of the intent of the accused to effect such deprivation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Notably, Jocelyn corroborated Edward's testimony on the following points: Pepino poked a handgun at Edward while they were on the second floor of Kilton; Pepino and his companion brought him downstairs and out of the building, and made him board a car; and the kidnappers demanded ransom in exchange for Edward's release.<br><br>Both the RTC and the CA found the respective testimonies of Edward and Jocelyn credible and convincing. We affirm the credibility accorded by the trial court (and affirmed by the CA) to these prosecution witnesses, in the absence of any showing that this factual finding had been arbitrarily arrived at. There is nothing in the records that would put the testimonies of Edward and Jocelyn under suspicion. We recall that Edward had close contacts with Pepino at Kilton Motors and at the safe house. He also saw Gomez (a) seated at the front seat of the getaway Toyota Corolla vehicle; (b) at the safe house in Quezon City; and (c) inside the car before the kidnappers released him.<br><br>Jocelyn, for her part, stated that she was very near Pepino while he was taking away her husband.<br><br>In<i> People v. Pavillare</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the Court found the testimonies of the private complainant Sukhjinder Singh and his cousin, Lakhvir Singh, to be credible and convincing, and reasoned out as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Both witnesses had ample opportunity to observe the kidnappers and to remember their faces. The complainant had close contact with the kidnappers when he was abducted and beaten up, and later when the kidnappers haggled on the amount of the ransom money. His cousin met Pavillare face to face and actually dealt with him when he paid the ransom money. The two-hour period that the complainant was in close contact with his abductors was sufficient for him to have a recollection of their physical appearance. Complainant admitted in court that he would recognize his abductors if he sees them again and upon seeing Pavillare he immediately recognized him as one of the malefactors as he remembers him as the one who blocked his way, beat him up, haggled with the complainant's cousin and received the ransom money, x x x It bears repeating that the finding of the trial court as to the credibility of witnesses is given utmost respect and as a rule will not be disturbed on appeal because it had the opportunity to closely observe the demeanor of the witness in court.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote><br>b. <b>Admissibility of Identification</b><br><br>We find no merit in Gomez's claim that Edward's identification of her during trial might have been preconditioned by the "suggestive identification" made during the police lineup.<br><br>In <i>People v. Teehankee, Jr.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Court explained the procedure for out-of-court identification and the test to determine the admissibility of such identifications in this manner:<br><br><blockquote>Out-of-court identification is conducted by the police in various ways. It is done thru <b>show-ups</b> where the suspect alone is brought face to face with the witness for identification. It is done thru mug shots where photographs are shown to the witness to identify the suspect. It is also done thru lineups where a witness identifies the suspect from a group of persons lined up for the purpose x x x In resolving the admissibility of and relying on out-of-court identification of suspects, courts have adopted the <b>totality of circumstances</b> test where they consider the following factors, viz: (1) the witness' opportunity to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witness' degree of attention at that time; (3) the accuracy of any prior description given by the witness; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the identification; (5) the length of time between the crime and the identification; and (6) the suggestiveness of the identification procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>Applying the totality-of-circumstances test, we find Edward's out-of-court identification to be reliable and thus admissible. To recall, when the three individuals entered Edward's office, they initially pretended -to be customers,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and even asked about the products that were for sale.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The three had told Edward that they were going to pay, but Pepino "pulled out a gun" instead.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[34]</sup></font> After Pepino's companion had taken the money from the cashier's box, the malefactors handcuffed Edward and forced him to go down to the parked car. From this sequence of events, there was thus ample opportunity for Edward - before and after the gun had been pointed at him -to view the faces of the three persons who entered his office. In addition, Edward stated that Pepino had talked to him "[a]t least once a day"<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[35]</sup></font> during the four days that he was detained.<br><br>Edward also saw Gomez seated at the front seat of the getaway metallic green Toyota Corolla vehicle. In addition, the abductors removed the tape from Edward's eyes when they arrived at the apartment, and among those whom he saw there was Gomez. According to Edward, he was able to take a good look at the occupants of the car when he was about to be released.<br><br>On the part of Jocelyn, she was firm and unyielding in her identification of Pepino as the person who pointed a gun at her husband while going down the stairs, and who brought him outside the premises of Kilton Motors. She maintained that she was very near when Pepino was taking away her husband; and that she could not forget Pepino's face.

In these cases, however, it had been clearly shown that the identification procedure was suggestive.<br><br>In <i>People v. Pineda</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the Court acquitted Rolando Pineda because the police suggested the identity of the accused by showing only the photographs of Pineda and his co-accused Celso Sison to witnesses Canilo Ferrer and Jimmy Ramos. According to the Court, "there was impermissible suggestion because the photographs were only of appellant and Sison, focusing attention on the two accused."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Similarly, the Court in <i>People v.

We thus held that the appellant's in-court identification proceeded from, and was influenced by, impermissible suggestions in the earlier photographic identification.<br><br>The lack of a prior description of the kidnappers in the present case should not lead to a conclusion that witnesses' identification was erroneous. The lack of a prior description of the kidnappers was due to the fact that Jocelyn (together with other members of Edward's family), for reasons not made known in the records, opted to negotiate with the kidnappers, instead of immediately seeking police assistance. If members of Edward's family had refused to cooperate with the police, their refusal could have been due to their desire not to compromise Edward's safety.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In the same manner, Edward, after he was freed, chose to report the matter to Teresita Ang See, and not to the police.<br><br>Given these circumstances, the lack of prior description of the malefactors in this case should not in any way taint the identification that Edward and Jocelyn made.<br><br><b>c. The Right to Counsel</b><br><br>The right to counsel is a fundamental right and is intended to preclude the slightest coercion that would lead the accused to admit something false. The right to counsel attaches upon the start of the investigation, i.e., when the investigating officer starts to ask questions to elicit information and/or confessions or admissions from the accused.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Custodial investigation commences when a person is taken into custody and is singled out as a suspect in the commission of the crime under investigation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> As a rule, a police lineup is <i>not</i> part of the custodial investigation; hence, the right to counsel guaranteed by the Constitution cannot yet be invoked at this stage. The right to be assisted by counsel attaches only during custodial investigation and cannot be claimed by the accused during identification in a police lineup.<br><br>Our ruling on this point in <i>People v. Lara</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> is instructive:<br><br><blockquote>x x x The guarantees of Sec. 12(1), Art. Ill of the 1987 Constitution, or the so-called <i>Miranda</i> rights, may be invoked only by a person while he is under custodial investigation. Custodial investigation starts when the police investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect taken into custody by the police who starts the interrogation and propounds questions to the person to elicit incriminating statements. Police line-up is not part of the custodial investigation; hence, the right to counsel guaranteed by the Constitution cannot yet be invoked at this stage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote><br>Defense witness Reynaldo, however, maintained that Pepino and Gomez were among those<i><b> already presented to the media as kidnapping suspects</b></i> by the DOJ a day before the police lineup was made. In this sense, the appellants were already the focus of the police and were thus deemed to be already under custodial investigation when the out-of-court identification was conducted.<br><br>Nonetheless, <b>the defense did not object to the in-court identification for having been tainted by an irregular out-of-court identification in a police lineup</b>. They focused, instead, on the legality of the appellants' arrests.<br><br>Whether Edward and Jocelyn could have seen Pepino and Gomez in various media fora that reported the presentation of the kidnapping suspects to the media is not for the Court to speculate on. The records merely show that when defense counsel, Atty. Caesar Esturco, asked Jocelyn during cross-examination whether she was aware that there were several kidnap-for-ransom incidents in Metro Manila, the latter answered that she "can read in the newspapers."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> At no time did Jocelyn or Edward ever mention that they saw the appellants from the news reports in print or on television.<br><br>At any rate, the appellants' respective convictions in this case were based on an <b>independent in-court identification made by Edward and Jocelyn, and not on the out-of-court identification during the police lineup.</b> We reiterate that the RTC and the CA found the court testimonies of these witnesses to be positive and credible, and that there was no showing that their factual findings had been arrived at arbitrarily. The in-court identification thus cured whatever irregularity might have attended the police lineup.<br><br>As the Court ruled in<i> People v. Algarme</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> the appellants' out-of-court identification was defective, their subsequent identification in court cured any flaw that may have initially attended it. We emphasize that the "inadmissibility of a police lineup identification x x x should not necessarily foreclose the admissibility of an independent in-court identification." We also stress that all the accused-appellants were positively identified by the prosecution eyewitnesses during the trial.</blockquote><br>It is also significant to note that despite the overwhelming evidence adduced by the prosecution, Pepino and Gomez did not even testify for their respective defenses.<br><br><b>d. The Presence of Conspiracy</b><br><br>Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a crime and decide to commit it. It may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence consisting of acts, words, or conduct of the alleged conspirators before, during and after the commission of the felony to achieve a common design or purpose.<br><br>Proof of the agreement does not need to rest on direct evidence, as the agreement may be inferred from the conduct of the parties indicating a common understanding among them with respect to the commission of the offense. Corollarily, it is not necessary to show that two or more persons met together and entered into an explicit agreement setting out the details of an unlawful scheme or the details by which an illegal objective is to be carried out.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the records establish the following facts: Pepino, Gomez, and another man entered Edward's office, and initially pretended to be customers; the three told Edward that they were going to pay, but Pepino pulled out a gun. After Pepino's companion took the money from the cashier's box, the malefactors handcuffed him and forced him to go down to the parked car; Gomez sat at the front passenger seat of the car which brought Edward to a safe house in Quezon City; the abductors removed the tape from Edward's eyes, placed him in a room, and then chained his legs upon arrival at the safe house; the abductors negotiated with Edward's family who eventually agreed to a P700,000.00 ransom to be delivered by the family driver using Edward's own car; and after four days, three men and Gomez blindfolded Edward, made him board a car, drove around for 30 minutes, and left him inside his own car at the UP Diliman campus.<br><br>The collective, concerted, and synchronized acts of the accused before, during, and after the kidnapping constitute undoubted proof that Gomez and her co-accused conspired with each other to attain a common objective,<i> i.e.</i>, to kidnap Edward and detain him illegally in order to demand ransom for his release.<br><br><u><b>The Proper Penalty:</b></u><br><br>Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, mandates the imposition of the death penalty when the kidnapping or detention is committed for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other person. Ransom, as employed in the law, is so used in its common or ordinary sense; meaning, a sum of money or other thing of value, price, or consideration paid or demanded for redemption of a kidnapped or detained person, a payment that releases one from captivity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the malefactors not only demanded but received ransom for Edward's release. The CA thus correctly affirmed the RTC's imposition of the death penalty on Pepino and Gomez.<br><br>With the passage of Republic Act No. 9346, entitled "<i>An Act Prohibiting the Imposition of Death Penalty in the Philippines</i>" (signed into law on June 24, 2006), the death penalty may no longer be imposed. We thus sentence Gomez to the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> without eligibility for parole pursuant to A.M. No. 15-08-02-SC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The reduced penalty shall likewise apply to the non-appealing party, Pepino, since it is more favorable to him.<br><br><u><b>The Awarded Indemnities:</b></u><br><br>In the case of <i>People v. Gambao</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (also for kidnapping for ransom), the Court set the minimum indemnity and damages where facts warranted the imposition of the death penalty if not for prohibition thereof by R.A. No. 9346, as follows: (1) P100,000.00 as civil indemnity; (2) P100,000.00 as moral damages which the victim is assumed to have suffered and thus needs no proof; and (3) PI00,000.00 as exemplary damages to set an example for the public good. These amounts shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of the finality of the Court's Resolution until fully paid.<br><br>We thus reduce the moral damages imposed by the CA from P300,000.00 to P100,000.00 to conform to prevailing jurisprudence on kidnapping cases. This reduced penalty shall apply to Pepino for being more favorable to him. However, the additional monetary award (<i>i.e</i>., P100,000.00 civil indemnity) imposed on Gomez shall not be applied to Pepino.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>We affirm the P700,000.00 imposed by the courts below as restitution of the amount of ransom demanded and received by the kidnappers.

One mode of out-of-court identification is the police line-up where the witness selects a "suspect from a group of persons lined up[.]"34 Another mode of identification is the show-up.

Courts use the <b>totality of circumstances test</b> to ensure the reliability of any of the modes of out-of-court identification. The test was originally used in the United States<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> but was introduced in this jurisdiction in the 1995 case of <i>People v. Teehankee, Jr.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> In determining the validity of the out-of-court identification, the following factors are considered:<br><br><blockquote>(1) the witness' opportunity to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witness' degree of attention at that time; (3) the accuracy of any prior description given by the witness; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the identification; (5) the length of time between the crime and the identification; and, (6) the suggestiveness of the identification procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br><br><i>Teehankee, Jr.</i> involved a high-profile murder. One of the eyewitnesses was the surviving victim who identified the accused, first, through mug shots while he was still at the hospital<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and, second, through a line-up of several individuals.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The accused claimed that the line-up was irregular because it was conducted in a private residence and not at the NBI. He also argued that the witness already saw the pictures of the accused in media reports tying him to the crime, and that the witness' initial description of the perpetrator was never put in writing. Finally, he argued that the witness only had five minutes of exposure time to the perpetrator and was inebriated by alcohol at the time of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>This court ruled that the identification still passed the totality of circumstances test. First, the location of the line-up did not create an irregularity to the actual line-up. Second, during his testimony in court, the eyewitness stated that since he was hospitalized from the time of the shootings until the photographic identification, he did not see news reports regarding the shootings. Third, the NBI could not obtain the witness' testimony at an earlier time because the witness' tongue was injured then, and no rule in evidence requires the rejection of a testimony if it was not previously reduced to writing. Finally, this court ruled that the witness had ample opportunity to see the perpetrator because the area was well-lit, there was close proximity between the witness and the perpetrator, and the incident occurred for five whole minutes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>The motives of the witness were also considered by this court in <i>Teehankee, Jr.</i> The absence of an ill motive for the witness to testify against an accused and the ability to be "unshaken" during vigorous cross-examination lend to the credibility of the witness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> This concept of the absence of an ill motive to testify was also used in <i>People v. Verzosa</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Several cases have since used the totality of circumstances test in determining the veracity of an out-of-court identification made by a witness. In light of the events in this case, it is proper to review each circumstance with depth.<br><br>Courts have paid close attention to <i>the witness' opportunity to view the criminal at the time of the crime and the witness' degree of attention at that time. </i>Courts make an assessment of a witness' credibility based on the conditions of visibility and the amount of time the witness was exposed to the perpetrators. In <i>People v. Pavillare</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Both witnesses had ample opportunity to observe the kidnappers and to remember their faces. The complainant had close contact with the kidnappers when he was abducted and beaten up, and later when the kidnappers haggled on the amount of the ransom money. His cousin met Pavillare face to face and actually dealt with him when he paid the ransom money. The two-hour period that the complainant was in close contact with his abductors was sufficient for him to have a recollection of their physical appearance. Complainant admitted in court that he would recognize his abductors if he s[aw] them again and upon seeing Pavillare he immediately recognized him as one of the malefactors as he remember[ed] him as the one who blocked his way, beat him up, haggled with the complainant's cousin and received the ransom money. As an indicium of candor the private complainant admitted that he d[id] not recognize the co-accused, Sotero Santos for which reason the case was dismissed against him.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote><br>The majority in this case also cited <i>Pavillare</i> because it is instructive of the opportunity to adequately see and remember the facial features of a perpetrator not personally known to the victim or witness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In <i>Pavillare</i>, the witness' several opportunities for interaction with the perpetrators of the crime meant that the witness would remember what the perpetrators looked like. In <i>Teehankee, Jr.,</i> the five-minute incident on a well-lit street in the evening was deemed as sufficient time for the witness to remember the face of the perpetrator.<br><br>On the other hand, in<i> People v. Gamer</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the crime occurred at 8:30 p.m., and the prosecution's evidence was inconsistent on whether the crime scene was lit or not. Hence, this court ruled that the out-of-court identification was not reliable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Aside from exposure time, extraordinary capabilities of the witness in recalling events should also be considered. In <i>People v. Sanchez,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> this court took note of important details about the witness that indicated his capability to recall. Sanchez involved the theft of an armoured car, and the witness, a trained guard, was presumed to have the ability to be alert about his surroundings during an attack.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The importance of the attentiveness of a witness was underscored by Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio's Dissenting Opinion in <i>Lumanog, et al. v. People</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> The case involved an ambush.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The witness, a security guard, was instructed by one of the perpetrators to stay low.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[57]</sup></font> Nevertheless, the witness testified to have seen the incident and identified in court six (6) perpetrators.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The majority affirmed the credibility of the witness.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> However, in Justice Carpio's Dissenting Opinion, he stated:<br><br><blockquote>We agree with the accused that the swiftness by which the crime was committed and the physical impossibility of memorizing the faces of all the perpetrators of the crime whom the witness saw for the first time and only for a brief moment under life-threatening and stressful circumstances incite disturbing doubts as to whether the witness could accurately remember the identity of the perpetrators of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br></blockquote><br><center>II</center><br>Advances in cognitive psychology and studies on eyewitness testimonies show that the degree of a witness' attentiveness in perceiving an event is influenced by various factors, including exposure time, frequency of exposure, level of violence of the event, the witness' stress levels and expectations, and the witness' activity during the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>The level of violence of the event tends to influence the witness' stress levels. One area of continuous psychological research is the effect of the presence of a weapon on the attention of an individual to an incident. Since the 1970s, psychologists hypothesized that the presence of a weapon captures a witness' attention and reduces the witness' ability to pay attention to peripheral details (such as the facial features of the individuals brandishing the weapon).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The research model often involves two groups: a group that witnesses an incident where a gun is used, and another group that sees the same incident but with no weapon used (usually a pencil or syringe is used in lieu of a gun). Both groups are asked to identify the perpetrator in a line-up. Results would show that the presence of a weapon makes a statistically significant difference in the accuracy of eyewitness identification:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[T]he influence of [a weapon focus] variable on an eyewitness's performance can only be estimated post hoc. Yet the data here do offer a rather strong statement: To not consider a weapon's effect on eyewitness performance is to ignore relevant information. The weapon effect does reliably occur, particularly in crimes of short duration in which a threatening weapon is visible. Identification accuracy and feature accuracy of eyewitnesses are likely to be affected, although, as previous research has noted . . . there is not necessarily a concordance between the two.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></blockquote><br>The results of these scientific studies conducted on weapon focus have not yet permeated into some of this court's decisions. In <i>People v. Sartagoda:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[T]he most natural reaction for victims of criminal violence [is] to strive to see the looks and faces of their assailants and observe the manner in which the crime was committed. Most often the face of the assailant and body movements thereof, create a lasting impression which cannot easily be erased from their memory.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[66]</sup></font></blockquote><br>We should now start taking greater caution in applying <i>Sartagoda</i> and other related cases that proclaim that victims have a natural propensity to remember the faces of their assailants. The stress experienced by victims and witnesses during the commission of a crime might not always affect their perception positively. Hence, it is important for courts to evaluate the totality of circumstances in the identification process.<br><br>Aside from the opportunity and ability of the witness to perceive the crime and the identifying features of the assailant, the <i>accuracy of any prior description given by the witness </i>to investigators must be considered by courts. A witness is considered more credible when his or her initial description of the accused, either through words or through a cartographic sketch, matches the actual appearance of a suspect selected during a photograph or corporeal line-up. This court, however, has exercised leniency in testing this condition.<br><br>In <i>Lumanog, et al</i>, this court allowed discrepancies between the description provided by the main prosecution witness in an affidavit executed immediately after the crime and the actual appearance of the suspects. This court stated that estimate of age cannot be made accurately. It was possible that the accused was exposed to sunlight due to his occupation, which was why he appeared to the witness older than his actual age. The majority also accepted the explanation of the prosecution that the reason why the other accused was fair-skinned, contrary to the initial description of the witness that he was dark-skinned, was because of the prolonged incarceration of the accused before trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> <br><br>Another circumstance to be considered is the <i>level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the identification.</i> The level of certainty must be demonstrated at the<i> initial identification </i>made by the witness during investigation. It is not the certainty of the witness during trial that courts should pay attention to.<br><br>Certainty of the witness is often tested during cross-examination. Thus, in many cases, this court finds a witness credible because of a straight and candid recollection of the incident that remains unhampered by the rigors of cross-examination.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>However, this circumstance should never be evaluated in a vacuum. A witness who is certain about seeing the crime but uncertain about the facial features of its perpetrators may sound certain about both the crime and the identity of the perpetrator during trial. This is because by the time a witness takes the witness stand, he or she has already narrated the incident to the police, the public prosecutor and, at times, private prosecutors and members of the press. <i>He or she becomes "certain" not because of the ability to perceive at the time of the incident, but because he or she has become an experienced storyteller of the narrative and has already confronted questions that may arise during cross-examination with rehearsed answers. The ability of the witness to consistently identify the perpetrator throughout trial does not necessarily mean that he or she correctly identified the perpetrator at the start of the investigation.</i><br><br>Another circumstance that is evaluated is the <i>length of time between the crime and the identification</i>. People's memories tend to fade through time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> It is ideal that prosecution witnesses identify the suspect immediately after the crime. An identification made two (2) days after the criminal incident is found to be acceptable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> This court found that a corporeal identification made five and a half months might not be as reliable.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Memory is not affected only by the mere passage of time. It is also affected by the interactions of the witness with other individuals relating to the event.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Information acquired by the witness after the incident can reconstruct the way the witness recalls the event. According to Elizabeth F. Loftus, a cognitive psychologist, "[p]ost[-]event information can not only enhance existing memories but also change a witness's memory and even cause nonexistent details to become incorporated into a previously acquired memory."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Hence, the last circumstance of <i>suggestiveness of the identification procedure </i>should have a great influence whether courts should admit an out-of-court identification. Both verbal and non-verbal information might provide improper suggestions to a witness:<br><br><blockquote>A police officer may tell a witness that a suspect has been caught and the witness should look at some photographs or come to view a lineup and make an identification. Even if the policeman does not explicitly mention a suspect, it is likely that the witness will believe he is being asked to identify a good suspect who will be one of the members of the lineup or set of photos. . . . If the officer should unintentionally stare a bit longer at the suspect, or change his tone of voice when he says, "Tell us whether you think it is number one, two, THREE, four, five, or six," the witness's opinion might be swayed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></blockquote><br>In evaluating suggestiveness of the out-of-court identification, this court considers prior or contemporaneous<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> actions of law enforcers, prosecutors, media, or even fellow witnesses.<br><br>In <i>People v.

Witnesses, like other people, are motivated by a desire to be correct and to avoid looking foolish. By arranging a lineup, the police have evidenced their belief that they have caught the criminal; witnesses, realizing this, probably will feel foolish if they cannot identify anyone and therefore may choose someone despite residual uncertainty. Moreover, the need to reduce psychological discomfort often motivates the victim of a crime to find a likely target for feelings of hostility.<br><br>Finally, witnesses are highly motivated to behave like those around them. This desire to conform produces an increased need to identify someone in order to show the police that they, too, feel that the criminal is in the lineup, and makes the witnesses particularly vulnerable to any clues conveyed by the police or other witnesses as to whom they suspect of the crime.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)</blockquote><br>In <i>People v.

The list is not exhaustive but complements the totality of circumstances rule.

The witness tagged the man in the photo as one of the perpetrators. This court stated that despite the in-court identification made by the witness, it was influenced by the impermissible suggestion through the photographic identification that had preceded the trial. This court ruled that a suggestive identification violates the right of the accused to due process because the accused becomes denied of a fair trial:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The greatest care should be taken in considering the identification of the accused especially, when this identification is made by a sole witness and the judgment in the case totally depends on the reliability of the identification.

In the context of this case, the investigators might not have been fair to Rodrigo if they themselves, purposely or unwittingly, fixed in the mind of Rosita, or at least actively prepared her mind to, the thought that Rodrigo was one of the robbers. Effectively, this act is no different from coercing a witness in identifying an accused, varying only with respect to the means used.

Thus, at that time, the faces of the accused were regularly splashed all over the newspapers and on television screens in news reports. <b>Alejo could not have missed seeing the faces of the accused before he identified them in court. To rule otherwise strains credulity.</b><br><br>Alejo, as the star witness in this case, must naturally be interested to look, or even stare, at the faces of the alleged killers to make sure he identifies them in court. Assuming Alejo failed to personally see the faces of the accused in the newspapers or television, which is highly improbable, if not totally impossible, his family and friends, if not the police, would have provided him with photographs of the accused from the newspapers for easier identification later in court. Surely, Alejo had ample time to memorize and familiarize himself with the faces of the accused before he testified in court and identified Lumanog, Santos, Rameses, Joel, and Fortuna as the killers of Abadilla.<br>. . . .<br><br>. . . The media exposure of the accused casts serious doubts on the integrity of Alejo's testimony on the identification of the murderers. Such doubts are sufficient to rule that Alejo's in-court identification of the accused as the perpetrators of the crime is neither positive nor credible. "It is not merely any identification which would suffice for conviction of the accused.

Hence, if police officers are needed to supplement the line-up composition, they must wear civilian clothes.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup> The suspected individual should not be handcuffed<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup> or be in a detainee's uniform unless identification is made inside a jail cell occupied by other detainees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup><br><br>Fifth, courts must check if the police officers or NBI agents have communicated any information that may suggest that one of the individuals in the line-up is a suspect.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup><br><br>Sixth, courts should be aware of how several witnesses identify the accused. Ideally, if there is more than one witness, witnesses should identify the perpetrator from the line-up one at a time. A witness should not be privy to the other witness' identification; otherwise, this may taint his or her perception.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup><br><br>These rules will help courts determine if there has been suggestiveness in the out-of-court corporeal identifications. This court recognizes that not all out-of-court corporeal identifications are made through line-ups. While the witness is being interviewed and another individual is brought to the police station, the witness may immediately recognize the other individual as the perpetrator. There are no undue suggestions in this example because an individual being brought to the station can either be a suspect or witness, and no external influence prompts the witness to point at the individual as the perpetrator.<br><br>Prevalence of kidnapping instills fear among citizens, a type of fear that makes citizens curtail their own personal liberties to provide for their own security. However, the habit of presenting the accused to the media immediately after arrest poses an equal threat to the personal liberty—which is protected by our Constitution—of an individual who may be accused of committing a crime that he or she did not do. Police officers should improve their standards and protocols in order to improve the proper prosecution of those accused of committing deplorable crimes like kidnapping, as well as to balance the interests of victims and of the accused.<br><br>Gomez is entitled to an acquittal. On the other hand, Pepino's withdrawal of his appeal makes it unnecessary for this court to rule on his guilt.
