YMCA</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> to support its conclusion that revenues however generated are covered by the constitutional exemption, provided that, the revenues will be used for educational purposes or will be held in reserve for such purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On the contrary, the Commissioner posits that a tax-exempt organization like DLSU is exempt only from property tax but not from income tax on the rentals earned from property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Thus, DLSU's income from the leases of its real properties is not exempt from taxation even if the income would be used for educational purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Second, the Commissioner insists that DLSU did not prove the fact of DST payment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and that it is not qualified to use the <i>On-Line Electronic DST Imprinting Machine</i>, which is available only to certain classes of taxpayers under RR No. 9-2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br><i>Finally</i>, the Commissioner objects to the admission of DLSU's supplemental offer of evidence. The belated submission of supplemental evidence reopened the case for trial, and worse, DLSU offered the supplemental evidence only after it received the unfavorable CTA Division's original decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In any case, DLSU's submission of supplemental documentary evidence was unnecessary since its rental income was taxable regardless of its disposition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><b><i>G.R. No. 198841</i></b><br><br>DLSU argues as that:<br><br><i>First</i>, RMO No. 43-90 prohibits the practice of issuing a LOA with any indication of <i>unverified prior years</i>. A LOA issued contrary to RMO No. 43-90 is void, thus, an assessment issued based on such defective LOA must also be void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>DLSU points out that the LOA issued to it covered the <i>Fiscal Year Ending 2003 and Unverified Prior Years</i>. On the basis of this defective LOA, the Commissioner assessed DLSU for deficiency income tax, VAT and DST for taxable years 2001, 2002 and 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> DLSU objects to the CTA <i>En Banc</i>'s conclusion that the LOA is valid for taxable year 2003. According to DLSU, when RMO No. 43-90 provides that:<br><blockquote>The practice of issuing [LOAs] covering audit of '<i>unverified prior years</i>' is hereby prohibited.<br></blockquote>it refers to the LOA which has the format "<i>Base Year</i> + <i>Unverified Prior Years</i>." Since the LOA issued to DLSU follows this format, then any assessment arising from it must be <i>entirely</i> voided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, DLSU invokes the principle of <i>uniformity in taxation</i>, which mandates that for similarly situated parties, the <i>same set of evidence</i> should be appreciated and weighed in the same manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The CTA <i>En Banc</i> erred when it did not similarly appreciate DLSU's evidence as it did to the pieces of evidence submitted by Ateneo, also a non-stock, non-profit educational institution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br><b><i>G.R. No. 198941</i></b><br><br>The issues and arguments raised by the Commissioner in G.R. No. 198941 petition are <i>exactly the same</i> as those she raised in her: (1) petition docketed as G.R. No. 196596 and (2) comment on DLSU's petition docketed as G.R. No. 198841.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br><center><b>Counter-arguments</b><br></center><br><b><i>DLSU's Comment on G.R. No. 196596</i></b><br><br><i>First</i>, DLSU questions the defective verification attached to the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, DLSU stresses that Article XIV, Section 4 (3) of the Constitution is clear that <i>all assets and revenues</i> of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes are exempt from taxes and duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>On this point, DLSU explains that: (1) the tax exemption of non­stock, non-profit educational institutions is <i>novel</i> to the <b>1987 Constitution</b> and that Section 30 (H) of the <b>1997 Tax Code</b> cannot amend the <b>1987 Constitution</b>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> (2) Section 30 of the 1997 Tax Code is almost an exact replica of Section 26 of the <b>1977 Tax Code</b> - with the addition of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions to the list of tax-exempt entities; and (3) that the <b>1977 Tax Code</b> was promulgated when the <b>1973 Constitution</b> was still in place.<br><br>DLSU elaborates that the tax exemption granted to a private educational institution under the 1973 Constitution was only for <i>real property tax</i>. Back then, the special tax treatment on <i>income</i> of private educational institutions only emanates from statute, <i>i.e.</i>, the 1977 Tax Code. Only under the 1987 Constitution that exemption from tax of all the <i>assets and revenues</i> of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes, was expressly and categorically enshrined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>DLSU thus invokes the doctrine of constitutional supremacy, which renders any subsequent law that is contrary to the Constitution void and without any force and effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Section 30 (H) of the 1997 Tax Code insofar as it subjects to tax the income of whatever kind and character of a non­stock and non-profit educational institution from any of its properties, real or personal, or from any of its activities conducted for profit <i>regardless of the disposition made of such income</i>, should be declared <i>without force and effect</i> in view of the constitutionally granted tax exemption on "all revenues and assets of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>DLSU further submits that it complies with the requirements enunciated in the <i>YMCA</i> case, that for an exemption to be granted under Article XIV, Section 4 (3) of the Constitution, the taxpayer must prove that: (1) it falls under the classification non-stock, non-profit educational institution; and (2) the income it seeks to be exempted from taxation is used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Unlike YMCA, which is <i>not</i> an educational institution, DLSU is undisputedly a non-stock, non-profit educational institution. It had also submitted evidence to prove that it actually, directly and exclusively used its income for educational purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>DLSU also cites the deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission where they recognized that the tax exemption was granted "to incentivize private educational institutions to share with the State the responsibility of educating the youth."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br><i>Third</i>, DLSU highlights that both the CTA <i>En Banc</i> and Division found that the bank that handled DLSU's loan and mortgage transactions had remitted to the BIR the DST through an imprinting machine, a method allowed under RR No. 15-2001.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> In any case, DLSU argues that it cannot be held liable for DST owmg to the exemption granted under the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><i>Finally</i>, DLSU underscores that the Commissioner, despite notice, did not oppose the formal offer of supplemental evidence. Because of the Commissioner's failure to timely object, she became bound by the results of the submission of such supplemental evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br><b><i>The CIR's Comment on G.R. No. 198841</i></b><br><br>The Commissioner submits that DLSU is estopped from questioning the LOA's validity because it failed to raise this issue in both the administrative and judicial proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> That it was asked on cross­examination during the trial does not make it an issue that the CTA could resolve.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> The Commissioner also maintains that DLSU's rental income is not tax-exempt because an educational institution is only exempt from property tax but not from tax on the income earned from the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br><b><i>DLSU's Comment on G.R.

We thus sustain the CTA <i>En Banc</i>'s findings that:<br><ol type="a"><br><li>DLSU proved that a portion of its rental income was used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes; and<br><br></li><li>DLSU proved the payment of the DST through its bank's on-line imprinting machine.<br></li></ol></li></ol><span style="font-weight: bold;">I. The revenues and assets of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions proved to have been used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes are exempt from duties and taxes.</span><br><br>DLSU rests it case on Article XIV, Section 4 (3) of the 1987 Constitution, which reads:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(3) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"><u>All revenues and assets</u> of <em><strong>non-stock, non-profit educational institutions</strong></em> <strong>used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes</strong> shall be <u><strong>exempt from taxes and duties</strong></u>. Upon the dissolution or cessation of the corporate existence of such institutions, their assets shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law. <em><strong>Proprietary educational institutions</strong></em>, including those cooperatively owned, <strong>may likewise be entitled to such exemptions subject to the <u>limitations provided by law</u></strong> including restrictions on dividends and provisions for reinvestment [underscoring and emphasis supplied]</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Before fully discussing the merits of the case, we observe that:<br><br><i>First</i>, the constitutional provision refers to two kinds of educational institutions: (1) non-stock, non-profit educational institutions and (2) proprietary educational institutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, DLSU falls under the first category. Even the Commissioner admits the status of DLSU as a non-stock, non-profit educational institution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br><i>Third</i>, while DLSU's claim for tax exemption arises from and is based on the Constitution, the Constitution, in the same provision, also imposes certain conditions to avail of the exemption. We discuss below the import of the constitutional text vis-a-vis the Commissioner's counter-arguments.<br><br><i>Fourth</i>, there is a marked distinction between the treatment of non­stock, non-profit educational institutions and proprietary educational institutions. The tax exemption granted to non-stock, non-profit educational institutions is conditioned only on the actual, direct and exclusive use of their revenues and assets for educational purposes. While tax exemptions may also be granted to proprietary educational institutions, these exemptions may be subject to limitations imposed by Congress.<br><br>As we explain below, the marked distinction between a non-stock, non-profit and a proprietary educational institution is crucial in determining the nature and extent of the tax exemption granted to non-stock, non-profit educational institutions.<br><br>The Commissioner opposes DLSU's claim for tax exemption on the basis of Section 30 (H) of the Tax Code. The relevant text reads:<br><blockquote>The following organizations <b>shall not be taxed under this Title</b> [<i>Tax on Income</i>] in respect to income received by them as such:<br><br><center>xxxx<br></center><br><b>(H) A non-stock and non-profit educational institution</b><br><br><center>xxxx<br></center><br>Notwithstanding the provisions in the preceding paragraphs, the <b><u>income</u> of whatever kind and character</b> of the foregoing organizations from any of their properties, real or personal, or <b>from any of their activities conducted for profit <u>regardless of the disposition made of such income</u> shall be subject to tax imposed under this Code</b>. [underscoring and emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote>The Commissioner posits that the 1997 Tax Code qualified the tax exemption granted to non-stock, non-profit educational institutions such that the revenues and income they derived from their assets, or from any of their activities conducted for profit, are taxable <i>even if</i> these revenues and income are used for educational purposes.<br><br><i>Did the 1997 Tax Code qualifY the tax exemption <u>constitutionally-granted</u> to non-stock, non-profit educational institutions?</i><br><br>We answer in the negative.<br><br>While the present petition appears to be a case of first impression,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> the Court in the <i>YMCA</i> case had in fact already analyzed and explained the meaning of Article XIV, Section 4 (3) of the Constitution.

The Court ruled that the last paragraph of Section 27 unequivocally subjects to tax the rent income of the YMCA from its property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>In short, the YMCA is exempt only from property tax but not from income tax.<br><br>As a last ditch effort to avoid paying the taxes on its rental income, the YMCA invoked the tax privilege granted under Article XIV, Section 4 (3) of the Constitution.<br><br>The Court denied YMCA's claim that it falls under Article XIV, Section 4 (3) of the Constitution holding that the term <i>educational institution</i>, when used in laws granting tax exemptions, refers to the school system (synonymous with formal education); it includes a college or an educational establishment; it refers to the hierarchically structured and chronologically graded learnings organized and provided by the formal school system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>The Court then significantly laid down the requisites for availing the tax exemption under Article XIV, Section 4 (3), namely: (1) the taxpayer falls under the classification <b>non-stock, non-profit educational institution</b>; and (2) the <b>income</b> it seeks to be exempted from taxation is <b>used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>We now adopt <i>YMCA</i> as precedent and hold that:<br><ol><li>The last paragraph of Section 30 of the Tax Code is without force and effect with respect to non-stock, non-profit educational institutions, <i>provided</i>, that the non-stock, non-profit educational institutions prove that its assets and revenues are used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes.<br><br></li><li>The tax-exemption constitutionally-granted to non-stock, non­ profit educational institutions, is not subject to limitations imposed by law.<br></li></ol><b>The tax exemption granted by the Constitution to non-stock, non-profit educational institutions is conditioned only on the actual, direct and exclusive use of their assets, revenues and income</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> <b>for educational purposes.</b><br><br>We find that unlike <b>Article VI, Section 28 (3)</b> of the Constitution (pertaining to charitable institutions, churches, parsonages or convents, mosques, and non-profit cemeteries), which exempts from tax <i>only</i> the <i><b>assets</b>, i.e.</i>, "all <b><u>lands, buildings, and improvements</u></b>, actually, directly, and exclusively used for religious, charitable, or educational purposes...," <b>Article XIV, Section 4 (3)</b> categorically states that "<b>[a]ll <i><u>revenues</u></i> and assets</b>... used actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes shall be exempt from taxes and duties."<br><br>The addition and express use of the word <i>revenues</i> in Article XIV, Section 4 (3) of the Constitution is not without significance.<br><br>We find that the text demonstrates the policy of the 1987 Constitution, discernible from the records of the 1986 Constitutional Commission<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> to provide broader tax privilege to non-stock, non-profit educational institutions as recognition of their role in assisting the State provide a public good.

The phrase <i>all revenues</i> is unqualified by any reference to the source of revenues. Thus, so long as the revenues and income are used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes, then said revenues and income shall be exempt from taxes and duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>We find it helpful to discuss at this point the taxation of <i>revenues</i> versus the taxation of <i>assets</i>.<br><br><i>Revenues</i> consist of the amounts earned by a person or entity from the conduct of business operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> It may refer to the sale of goods, rendition of services, or the return of an investment.

In Philippine taxation, the fair market value of real property is a component of the tax base in real property tax (<i>RPT</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> Also, the landed cost of imported goods is a component of the tax base in VAT on importation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> and tariff duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br><br>Thus, when a non-stock, non-profit educational institution proves that it uses its <i>revenues</i> actually, directly, and exclusively for educational purposes, it shall be exempted from income tax, VAT, and LBT. On the other hand, when it also shows that it uses its assets in the form of real property for educational purposes, it shall be exempted from RPT.<br><br>To be clear, proving the actual use of the taxable item will result in an exemption, but the specific tax from which the entity shall be exempted from shall depend on whether the item is an item of revenue or asset.<br><br>To illustrate, if a university leases a portion of its school building to a bookstore or cafeteria, the leased portion is <i>not actually, directly and exclusively</i> used for educational purposes, even if the bookstore or canteen caters only to university students, faculty and staff.<br><br>The leased portion of the building may be subject to <b><i>real property tax</i></b>, as held in <i>Abra Valley College, Inc. v. Aquino</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> We ruled in that case that the test of exemption from taxation is the use of the property for purposes mentioned in the Constitution. We also held that the exemption extends to facilities which are incidental to and reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the main purposes.<br><br>In concrete terms, the lease of a portion of a school building for commercial purposes, removes such asset from the <b><i>property tax</i></b> exemption granted under the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> There is no exemption because the <i>asset is <u>not</u> used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes</i>. The commercial use of the property is also not incidental to and reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the main purpose of a university, which is to educate its students.<br><br>However, if the university <i>actually, directly and exclusively uses for educational purposes</i> the <i>revenues</i> earned from the lease of its school building, such revenues shall be exempt from taxes and duties. The tax exemption no longer hinges on the use of the asset from which the revenues were earned, but on <i>the actual, direct and exclusive use of the revenues for educational purposes</i>.<br><br>Parenthetically, income and revenues of non-stock, non-profit educational institution <i>not</i> used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes are not exempt from duties and taxes. To avail of the exemption, the taxpayer must <b><i>factually prove</i></b> that it used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes the revenues or income sought to be exempted.<br><br>The crucial point of inquiry then is on the <b><i>use of the assets</i></b> or on the <b><i>use of the revenues</i></b>. These are two things that must be viewed and treated separately. But so long as the assets or revenues are <i>used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes</i>, they are exempt from duties and taxes.<br><br><b>The tax exemption granted by the Constitution to non-stock, non-profit educational institutions, unlike the exemption that may be availed of by proprietary educational institutions, is not subject to limitations imposed by law.</b><br><br>That the Constitution treats non-stock, non-profit educational institutions differently from proprietary educational institutions cannot be doubted. As discussed, the privilege granted to the former is conditioned only on the actual, direct and exclusive use of their revenues and assets for educational purposes. In clear contrast, the tax privilege granted to the latter may be subject to limitations imposed by law.<br><br>We spell out below the difference in treatment if only to highlight the privileged status of non-stock, non-profit educational institutions compared with their proprietary counterparts.<br><br>While a non-stock, non-profit educational institution is classified as a tax-exempt entity under Section 30 (<i>Exemptions from Tax on Corporations</i>) of the Tax Code, a proprietary educational institution is covered by Section 27 (<i>Rates of Income Tax on Domestic Corporations</i>).<br><br>To be specific, Section 30 provides that exempt organizations like non-stock, non-profit educational institutions shall not be taxed on income received by them as such.<br><br>Section 27 (B), on the other hand, states that [p]roprietary educational institutions...which are nonprofit shall pay a tax of ten percent (10%) on their taxable income...<i>Provided</i>, that if the gross income from unrelated trade, business or other activity exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the total gross income derived by such educational institutions...[the regular corporate income tax of 30%] shall be imposed on the entire taxable income...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>By the Tax Code's clear terms, a proprietary educational institution is entitled only to the reduced rate of 10% corporate income tax.

The LOA commences the audit process<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> and informs the taxpayer that it is under audit for possible deficiency tax assessment.<br><br>Given the purposes of a LOA, is there basis to completely nullify the LOA issued to DLSU, and consequently, disregard the BIR and the CTA's findings of tax deficiency for taxable year 2003?<br><br>We answer in the negative.<br><br>The relevant provision is Section C of RMO No. 43-90, the pertinent portion of which reads:<br><blockquote><ol start="3"><li>A Letter of Authority [LOA] should cover a taxable period not exceeding one taxable year.

RMO 43-90 does not say that a LOA which contains unverified prior years is void. It merely prescribes that if the audit includes more than one taxable period, the other periods or years must be specified. The provision read as a whole requires that if a taxpayer is audited for more than one taxable year, the BIR must specify each taxable year or taxable period on separate LOAs.<br><br>Read in this light, the requirement to specify the taxable period covered by the LOA is simply to inform the taxpayer of the extent of the audit and the scope of the revenue officer's authority.

While the taxpayers in the cited cases claimed <i>refund</i> of excess tax payments based on the Tax Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> DLSU is claiming <i>tax exemption</i> based on the Constitution.

Hence, this portion of the rental income, being the substantiated disbursements of the CF-CPA Account, was considered by the Special First Division as used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes. Since for fiscal year 2003, the total disbursements per voucher is P6,259,078.3 (Exhibit "LL-25-C"), and the total disbursements per subsidiary ledger amounts to P23,463,543.02 (Exhibit "LL-29-C"), the ratio of substantiated disbursements for fiscal year 2003 is 26.68% (P6,259,078.30/P23,463,543.02). <u>Thus, the substantiated portion of CF-CPA Disbursements for fiscal year 2003, arrived at by multiplying the ratio of 26.68% with the total rent income added to and used in the CF-CPA Account in the amount of P6,602,655.00 ts P1,761,588.35.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> (emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>For better understanding, we summarize the CTA's computation as follows:<br><ol><li>The CTA subtracted the rent income used in the construction of the Sports Complex (P4,007,724.00) from the rental income (P10,610,379.00) earned from the abovementioned concessionaries.

The CTA's reasoning is flawed because it required DLSU to substantiate an amount that is greater than the rental income deposited in the CF-CPA Account in 2003.<br><br>To reiterate, to be exempt from tax, DLSU has the burden of proving that the proceeds of its rental income (which amounted to a total of P10.61 million)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> were used for educational purposes. This amount was divided into two parts: (a) the P4.01 million, which was used to pay the loan obtained for the construction of the Sports Complex; and (b) the P6.60 million,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> which was transferred to the CF-CPA account.<br><br>For year 2003, the total disbursement from the CF-CPA account amounted to P23.46 million.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> These figures, read in light of the constitutional exemption, raises the question: <b>does DLSU claim that the whole total CF-CPA disbursement of P23.46 million is tax-exempt so that it is required to prove that all these disbursements had been made for educational purposes?</b><br><br>We answer in the negative.<br><br>The records show that DLSU never claimed that the total CF-CPA disbursements of P23.46 million had been for educational purposes and should thus be tax-exempt; DLSU only claimed P10.61 million for tax­exemption and should thus be required to prove that this amount had been used as claimed.<br><br>Of this amount, P4.01 had been proven to have been used for educational purposes, as confirmed by the Independent CPA. The amount in issue is therefore the balance of P6.60 million which was transferred to the CF-CPA which in turn made disbursements of P23.46 million for various general purposes, among them the P6.60 million transferred by DLSU.<br><br>Significantly, the Independent CPA confirmed that the CF-CPA made disbursements for educational purposes in year 2003 in the amount P6.26 million. Based on these given figures, the CTA concluded that the expenses for educational purposes that had been coursed through the CF-CPA should be prorated so that only the portion that P6.26 million bears to the total CF­-CPA disbursements should be credited to DLSU for tax exemption.<br><br>This approach, in our view, is flawed given the constitutional requirement that revenues <i>actually and directly used</i> for educational purposes should be tax-exempt. As already mentioned above, DLSU is not claiming that the whole P23.46 million CF-CPA disbursement had been used for educational purposes; it only claims that P6.60 million transferred to CF-CPA had been used for educational purposes. This was what DLSU needed to prove to have actually and directly used for educational purposes.<br><br>That this fund had been first deposited into a separate fund (the CF­-CPA established to fund capital projects) lends peculiarity to the facts of this case, but does not detract from the fact that the deposited funds were DLSU revenue funds that had been confirmed and proven to have been actually and directly used for educational purposes <i>via</i> the CF-CPA. That the CF-CPA might have had other sources of funding is irrelevant because the assessment in the present case pertains only to the rental income which DLSU indisputably earned as revenue in 2003. That the proven CF-CPA funds used for educational purposes should not be prorated as part of its total CF-­CPA disbursements for purposes of crediting to DLSU is also logical because no claim whatsoever had been made that the totality of the CF-CPA disbursements had been for educational purposes. No prorating is necessary; to state the obvious, exemption is based on <i>actual and direct use</i> and this DLSU has indisputably proven.<br><br>Based on these considerations, DLSU should therefore be liable only for the difference between what it claimed and what it has proven. In more concrete terms, DLSU <i>only</i> had to prove that its rental income for taxable year 2003 (P10,610,379.00) was used for educational purposes. Hence, while the total disbursements from the CF-CPA Account amounted to P23,463,543.02, DLSU only had to substantiate its P10.6 million rental income, part of which was the P6,602,655.00 transferred to the CF-CPA account. Of this latter amount, P6.259 million was substantiated to have been used for educational purposes.<br><br>To summarize, we thus revise the tax base for deficiency income tax and VAT for taxable year 2003 as follows:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="50%">&nbsp;</td><td width="25%"><div align="center">CTA Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup></div></td><td width="25%"><div align="center"><strong>Revised</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td>Rental income</td><td><div align="center">10,610,379.00</div></td><td><div align="center">10,610,379.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>Less: Rent income used in construction of the Sports Complex</td><td><div align="center"><u>4,007,724.00</u></div></td><td><div align="center"><u>4,007,724.00</u></div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td><div align="center"></div></td></tr><tr><td>Rental income deposited to the CF-CPA Account</td><td><div align="center">6,602,655.00</div></td><td><div align="center">6,602.655.00</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td><div align="center"></div></td></tr><tr><td><u>Less</u>: Substantiated portion of CF-CPA disbursements</td><td><div align="center"><u>1,761,588.35</u></div></td><td><div align="center"><u>6,259,078.30</u></div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td><div align="center"></div></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tax base for deficiency income tax and VAT</strong></td><td><div align="center">4,841,066.65</div></td><td><div align="center"><u><strong>343,576.70</strong></u></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>On DLSU's argument that the CTA should have appreciated its evidence in the same way as it did with the evidence submitted by Ateneo in <i>another separate case</i>, the CTA explained that the issue in the Ateneo case was not the same as the issue in the present case.<br><br>The issue in the Ateneo case was whether or not Ateneo could be held liable to pay income taxes and VAT under certain BIR and Department of Finance issuances<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> that required the educational institution to <i>own and operate</i> the canteens, or other commercial enterprises within its campus, as condition for tax exemption. The CTA held that the Constitution does not require the educational institution to own or operate these commercial establishments to avail of the exemption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br><br>Given the lack of complete identity of the issues involved, the CTA held that it had to evaluate the separate sets of evidence differently. The CTA likewise stressed that DLSU and Ateneo gave distinct defenses and that its wisdom "cannot be equated on its decision on <i>two different cases with two different issues</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup><br><br>DLSU disagrees with the CTA and argues that the entire assessment must be cancelled because it submitted similar, if not stronger sets of evidence, as Ateneo. We reject DLSU's argument for being <i>non sequitur</i>. Its reliance on the concept of uniformity of taxation is also incorrect.<br><br><i>First</i>, even granting that Ateneo and DLSU submitted <i>similar evidence</i>, the <b><i>sufficiency and materiality</i></b> of the evidence supporting their respective claims for tax exemption would necessarily differ because their attendant issues and facts differ.<br><br>To state the obvious, the amount of income received by DLSU and by Ateneo during the taxable years they were assessed <b><i>varied</i></b>. The amount of tax assessment also <i>varied</i>. The amount of income proven to have been used for educational purposes also varied because <i><u>the amount substantiated varied</u></i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> Thus, the amount of tax assessment cancelled by the CTA <i>varied</i>.<br><br>On the one hand, the BIR assessed DLSU a total tax deficiency of <b><i>P17,303,001.12</i></b> for taxable years 2001, 2002 and 2003. On the other hand, the BIR assessed Ateneo a total deficiency tax of <b><i>P8,864,042.35</i></b> for the same period. Notably, DLSU was assessed deficiency DST, while Ateneo was not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup><br><br>Thus, although both Ateneo and DLSU claimed that they used their rental income actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes by submitting similar evidence, <i>e.g.</i>, the testimony of their employees on the use of university revenues, the report of the Independent CPA, their income summaries, financial statements, vouchers, etc., the fact remains that <i>DLSU failed to prove that a portion of its income and revenues had indeed been used for educational purposes</i>.<br><br><i>The CTA significantly found that some documents that could have fully supported DLSU's claim were not produced in court.</i> Indeed, the Independent CPA testified that some disbursements had not been proven to have been used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup><br><br>The final nail on the question of evidence is DLSU's own <i>admission</i> that the original of these documents <i><u>had not in fact been produced before the CTA</u></i> although it claimed that there was no bad faith on its part.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> To our mind, this admission is a good indicator of how the Ateneo and the DLSU cases varied, resulting in DLSU's failure to substantiate a portion of its claimed exemption.<br><br>Further, DLSU's invocation of Section 5, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules on Evidence, that the contents of the missing supporting documents were proven by its recital in some <i>other authentic documents</i> on record,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup> can no longer be entertained at this late stage of the proceeding. The CTA did not rule on this particular claim. The CTA also made no finding on DLSU's assertion of lack of bad faith. Besides, it is not our duty to go over these documents to test the truthfulness of their contents, this Court not being a trier of facts.<br><br><i>Second</i>, DLSU misunderstands the concept of uniformity oftaxation. Equality and uniformity of taxation means that all taxable articles or kinds of property of the same class shall be taxed at the same rate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> A tax is uniform when it operates with the same force and effect in every place where the subject of it is found.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> The concept requires that all subjects of taxation similarly situated should be <i>treated alike and placed in equal footing</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup><br><br>In our view, the CTA placed Ateneo and DLSU in equal footing. The CTA treated them alike because their income <i>proved</i> to have been used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes were exempted from taxes. The CTA equally applied the requirements in the <i>YMCA</i> case to test if they indeed used their revenues for educational purposes.<br><br>DLSU can only assert that the CTA violated the rule on uniformity if it can show that, despite <i>proving</i> that it used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes its income and revenues, the CTA still affirmed the imposition of taxes. That the DLSU secured a different result happened because it failed to <i>fully</i> prove that it used actually, directly and exclusively for educational purposes its revenues and income.<br><br>On this point, we remind DLSU that the rule on uniformity of taxation does <i>not</i> mean that subjects of taxation similarly situated are treated in <i>literally</i> the same way in all and every occasion. The fact that the Ateneo and DLSU are both non-stock, non-profit educational institutions, does not mean that the CTA or this Court would similarly decide every case for (or against) both universities. Success in tax litigation, like in any other litigation, depends to a large extent on the sufficiency of evidence. DLSU's evidence was wanting, thus, the CTA was correct in not fully cancelling its tax liabilities.<br><br><i>b. DLSU proved its payment of the DST</i><br><br>The CTA affirmed DLSU's claim that the DST due on its mortgage and loan transactions were paid and remitted through its bank's <i>On-Line Electronic DST Imprinting Machine</i>. The Commissioner argues that DLSU is not allowed to use this method of payment because an educational institution is excluded from the class of taxpayers who can use the <i>On-Line Electronic DST Imprinting Machine</i>.<br><br>We sustain the findings of the CTA. The Commissioner's argument lacks basis in both the Tax Code and the relevant revenue regulations.<br><br>DST on documents, loan agreements, and papers shall be levied, collected and paid for by the person making, signing, issuing, accepting, or transferring the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> The Tax Code provides that whenever one party to the document enjoys exemption from DST, the other party not exempt from DST shall be directly liable for the tax. Thus, it is clear that DST shall be payable by any party to the document, such that the payment and compliance by one shall mean the full settlement of the DST due on the document.<br><br>In the present case, DLSU entered into mortgage and loan agreements with banks. These agreements are subject to DST.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup> For the purpose of showing that the DST on the loan agreement has been paid, DLSU presented its agreements bearing the imprint showing that DST on the document has been paid by the bank, its counterparty. The imprint should be sufficient proof that DST has been paid. Thus, DLSU cannot be further assessed for deficiency DST on the said documents.<br><br>Finally, it is true that educational institutions are not included in the class of taxpayers who can pay and remit DST through the <i>On-Line Electronic DST Imprinting Machine</i> under RR No. 9-2000. As correctly held by the CTA, this is irrelevant because it was not DLSU who used the <i>On-Line Electronic DST Imprinting Machine</i> but the bank that handled its mortgage and loan transactions. RR No. 9-2000 expressly includes banks in the class of taxpayers that can use the <i>On-Line Electronic DST Imprinting Machine</i>.<br><br>Thus, the Court sustains the finding of the CTA that DLSU proved the payment of the assessed DST deficiency, except for the unpaid balance of <b>P13,265.48</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, we <b>DENY</b> the petition of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in G.R.

This already constituted an undue intrusion into the affairs of DLSU to its prejudice. DLSU was at the mercy of the revenue officers with no adequate protection or defense.<br><br>As early as 1933, this Court in <i>Sy Jong Chuy v. Reyes</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> held that the extraordinary inquisitorial power conferred by law upon collectors of internal revenue must be strictly construed. The power should be limited to books and papers relevant to the subject of investigation, which should be mentioned with reasonable certainty. Although the case particularly referred to the use of "<i>subpoena duces tecum</i>" by internal revenue officers, its discussion is apropos:<br><blockquote>The foregoing discussion will disclose that there are two factors involved in the correct solution of the question before us. The first fact which must be made to appear by clear and unequivocal proof, as a condition precedent to the right of a court, and, by analogy, an internal revenue officer, to require a person to deliver up for examination by the court or an internal revenue officer his private books and papers, is their relevancy; and the second fact which must be established in the same manner is the specification of documents and an indication of them with as much precision as is fair and feasible[.]<br><br>Speaking to the fact of relevancy, there is absolutely no showing of the nature of any official investigation which is being conducted by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and this is a prerequisite to the use of the power granted by section 436 of the Administrative Code. Moreover, when the production under a <i>subpoena duces tecum</i> is contested on the ground of irrelevancy, it is for the movant or the internal revenue officer to show facts sufficient to enable the court to determine whether the desired documents are material to the issues. And here, all that we have to justify relevancy is the typewritten part of a mimeographed form reading: "it being necessary to use them (referring to the books) in an investigation now pending under the Income Tax and Internal Revenue Laws." This is insufficient.<br><br>But it is in the second respect that the subpoena is most fatally defective. It will be recalled that it required the production of "all the commercial books or any other papers on which are recorded your transactions showing income and expenses for the years 1925, 1926, 1927, 1928 inclusive", that these books numbered fifty-three in all, and that they are needed in the business of the corporation. In the parlance of equity, the subpoena before us savored of a fishing bill, and such bills are to be condemned. That this is so is shown by the phraseology of the subpoena which is a general command to produce all of the books of account for four years. This, it seems to us, made the subpoena unreasonably broad in scope. The internal revenue officer had it within his power to examine any or all of the books of the corporation in the offices of the corporation and then having ascertained what particular books were necessary for an official investigation had it likewise within his power to issue a <i>subpoena duces tecum</i> sufficiently explicit to be understood and sufficiently reasonable not to interfere with the ordinary course of business. But this method was not followed. Obviously, if the special deputy could in 1930 call for the production of the books of the corporation for 1925, 1926, 1927, and 1928, the officer could have called for the production of the books for the year just previous, or 1929, and for the books of the current year, and if this could be done, the intrusion into private affairs with disastrous paralyzation of business can easily be visualized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>This Court held that the <i>subpoena duces tecum</i> issued by a special deputy of the Collector of Internal Revenue, which commanded a Chinese merchant to appear at the Internal Revenue Office and produce for investigation all commercial books or papers showing his transactions for four (4) years (from 1925 to 1928) was "unreasonably broad in scope." This Court further held that the subpoena was not properly issued because the Collector failed to show the relevance of the Chinese books and to specify the particular books desired, and its sweeping scope clashed with the constitutional prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. Thus:<br><blockquote>Generally speaking, there are two readily understandable points of view of the question at issue. The first is the viewpoint of the tax collecting officials. Taxation is a necessity as all must agree. It is for the officials who have to enforce the revenue laws to see to it that there is no evasion of those laws and that there is an equal distribution of the tax burden. To accomplish their duty it will often be incumbent upon the internal revenue officers, for the efficient administration of the service, to inspect the books of merchants and even require the production of those books in the offices of the inspecting officials. The right of a citizen to his property becomes subservient to the public welfare. All [these] we are the first to concede. In proper cases, the officers of the Bureau of Internal Revenue should receive the support of the courts when these officers attempt to perform in a conscientious and lawful manner the duties imposed upon them by law. The trouble is that the particular subpoena under scrutiny neither shows its relevancy nor specifies with the particularity required by law the books which are to be produced.<br><br>The second viewpoint is not that of the government on which is imposed the duty to collect taxes, but is the viewpoint of the merchant. A citizen goes into business, and in so doing provides himself with the necessary books of account. He cannot have government officials on a mere whim or a mere suspension taking his books from his offices to the offices of the government for inspection. To permit that would be to place a weapon in the hands of a miscellaneous number of government employees some of whom might use it improperly and others of whom might use it improperly. With an understanding of the obligations of the government to protect the citizen, the constitution and the organic law have done so by throwing around him a wall which makes his home and his private papers his castle. It should be our constant purpose to keep a <i>subpoena duces tecum</i> from being of such a broad and sweeping character as to clash with the constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.<br><br>Answering the question at issue, we do so without vacillation by holding that the <i>subpoena duces tecum</i> was not properly issued in accordance with law because the showing of relevancy was not sufficient to justify enforcing the production of the Chinese books; because the <i>subpoena duces tecum</i> failed to specify the particular books desired, and because a ruling should be avoided which in any manner appears to sanction an unreasonable search and seizure. In the absence of a showing of materiality, and in the absence of all particularity in specifying what is wanted by a <i>subpoena duces tecum</i>, the refusal of a merchant to obey a subpoena, commanding him to produce his commercial books, will be sustained. The courts function to protect the individual citizen of whatever class or nationality against an unjust inquisition of his books and papers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>If we were to uphold the validity of a letter of authority covering a base year plus unverified prior years, we would in essence encourage the unscrupulous practice of issuing letters of authority even without prior compliance with the procedure that the Commissioner herself prescribed. This would not help .in curtailing inefficiencies and abuses among revenue officers in the discharge of their tasks. There is nothing more devious than the scenario where government ignores as much its own rules as the taxpayer's constitutional right against the unreasonable examination of its books and papers.<br><br>In <i>Viduya v. Berdiago</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><blockquote>It is not for this Court to do less than it can to implement and enforce the mandates of the customs and revenue laws. The evils associated with tax evasion must be stamped out - <i>without any disregard, it is to be affirmed, of any constitutional right</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The inevitability and indispensability of taxation is conceded. Under the law, the Bureau of Internal Revenue has access to all relevant or material records and data of the taxpayer for the purpose of collecting the correct amount of tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> However, this authority must be exercised reasonably and under the prescribed procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The Commissioner and revenue officers must strictly comply with the requirements of the law and its own rules,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> with due regard to taxpayers' constitutional rights.

It simply stated that DLSU failed to sufficiently account for the unsubstantiated disbursements. Although it considered the other additional documentary evidence (Exhibits "VV" and "WW") formally offered by DLSU, Exhibits "XX," "YY," "ZZ," and "AAA" were brushed aside without citing any reason or discussing the probative value or weight of these additional pieces of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Thus:<br><blockquote>With regard the unsubstantiated disbursements from the CF-CPA, Petitioner alleged that the supporting documents were inadvertently misplaced due to migration of accounts to its new accounting software used sometime in 2001. In lieu thereof, petitioner submitted downloaded copies of the Schedule of Disbursement Vouchers from its accounting software.<br><br>The Court is not convinced.<br><br>According to ICPA's findings, the petitioner was able to show only the disbursements from the CF-CPA amounting to P7,305,104.71, P8,747,116.40 and P6,259,078.30 for the fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Tax Appeals First Division concluded that only the portion of the rental income pertaining to the substantiated disbursements of the CF-CPA would be considered as actually, directly, and exclusively used for educational purposes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> This portion was computed by multiplying the ratio of substantiated disbursements to the total disbursements per subsidiary ledgers to the total rental income, thus:<br><blockquote>Using the amounts determined for the Fiscal Year 2003,<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="16%"><div align="center">P6,259,078.30</div></td><td width="3%">&nbsp;</td><td width="35%">&nbsp;</td><td width="46%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">------------------</div></td><td>= </td><td colspan="2">26.68% x P6,602,655.00 = P1,761,588.35</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">P23,463,543.02</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp; </td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Hence, for 2003, the portion of the rental income that was not sufficiently proven to have been used for educational purposes amounted to P4,841,066.65. This amount was used as base for computing the deficiency income tax and value-added tax.<br><br>On appeal, the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc simply ruled that "petitioner again failed to fully account for and substantiate all the disbursements from the CF-CPA Account."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> The Court of Tax Appeals En Banc heavily relied on the findings of the ICPA that "the [substantiated] disbursements from the CF-CPA Account for fiscal year 2003 amounts to P6,259,078.30."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> However, these findings of the ICPA were made when Exhibits "XX," "YY," "ZZ," and "AAA" had not yet been submitted. The additional exhibits were offered by DLSU to address the findings of the ICPA with regard to the unsubstantiated disbursements. Unfortunately, nowhere in the Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc was there a discussion on the probative value or weight of these additional exhibits.<br><br>As a rule, factual findings of the Court of Tax Appeals are entitled to the highest respect and will not be disturbed on appeal. Some exceptions that have been recognized by this Court are: (1) when a party shows that the findings are not supported by substantial evidence or there is a showing of gross error or abuse on the part of the tax court;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> (2) when the judgment is premised on a misapprehension of facts;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> or (3) when the tax court failed to notice certain relevant facts that, if considered, would justify a different conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The third exception applies here.<br><br>The Court of Tax Appeals should have considered the additional pieces of evidence, which have been duly admitted and formed part of the case records. This is a requirement of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The right to be heard, which includes the right to present evidence, is meaningless if the Court of Tax Appeals can simply ignore the evidence.<br><br>In <i>Edwards v. McCoy</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><blockquote>[T]he object of a hearing is as much to have evidence considered as it is to present it. The right to adduce evidence, without the corresponding duty to consider it, is vain. Such right is conspicuously futile if the person or persons to whom the evidence is presented can thrust it aside without notice or consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> this Court similarly ruled that "not only must the party be given an opportunity to present his case and to adduce evidence tending to establish the rights which he asserts but the tribunal must consider the evidence presented."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The Rules of Court allows the presentation of secondary evidence:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 130<br>Rules of Admissibility<br></center><br>....<br><br>Section 5. <i>When original document is unavailable</i>. - When the original document has been lost or destroyed, or cannot be produced in court, the offeror, upon proof of its execution or existence and the cause of its unavailability without bad faith on his part, may prove its contents by a copy, or by a recital of its contents in some authentic document, or by the testimony of witnesses in the order stated.<br></blockquote>For secondary evidence to be admissible, there must be satisfactory proof of: (a) the execution and existence of the original; (b) the loss and destruction of the original or its non-production in court; and (c) the unavailability of the original not being due to bad faith on the part of the offeror. The admission by the Court of Tax Appeals First Division-which the En Banc affirmed of these pieces of evidence presupposes that all three prerequisites have been established by DLSU, that is, that DLSU had sufficiently explained its non-production of the disbursement vouchers, and the cause of unavailability is without bad faith on its part.<br><br>There can be no just determination of the present action if we ignore Exhibits "XX," "YY," "ZZ," and "AAA," which were submitted before the Court of Tax Appeals and which supposedly contained the same information embodied in the unlocated disbursement vouchers. Exhibits "YY," "ZZ," and "AAA" were the downloaded copies of the Schedule of Disbursement Vouchers from DLSU's accounting software. The Commissioner did not dispute the veracity or correctness of the detailed entries in these documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Her objection to the additional pieces of evidence was based on the ground that "DLSU was indirectly reopening the trial of the case" and the additional exhibits were "not newly discovered evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> An examination of these exhibits shows that the disbursements from the CF-CPA Account were used for educational purposes.<br><br>These additional pieces of evidence, taken together with the findings of the ICPA, corroborate the findings of the Court of Tax Appeals in its January 5, 2010 Decision that DLSU uses "fund accounting" to ensure that the utilization of an income (i.e., rental income) is restricted to a specified purpose (educational purpose):<br><blockquote>Petitioner's Controller, Mr. Francisco De La Cruz, stated the following in his judicial affidavit:<br><blockquote>Q: You mentioned that one of your functions as Controller is to ensure that [petitioner]'s utilization of income from all sources is consistent with existing policies. What are some of [petitioner]'s policies regarding utilization of its income from all sources?<br><br>A: Of particular importance are the following:<br><ol><li>[Petitioner] has a long-standing policy to obtain funding for all disbursements for educational purposes primarily from rental income earned from its lease contracts, present and future;<br><br></li><li>In funding all disbursements for educational purposes, [petitioner] first exhausts its rental income earned from its lease contracts before it utilizes income from other sources; and<br><br></li><li>[Petitioner] extends regular financial assistance by way of grants, donations, dole-outs, loans and the like to St. Yon for the latter's pursuit of its purely educational purposes stated in its AOI.<br></li></ol></blockquote>The evaluation of petitioner's audited financial statements for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003 shows that it uses fund accounting. The Notes to Financial Statements disclose:<br><blockquote>2.6 <u><i>Fund Accounting</i></u><br><br>To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of resources available to the [Petitioner], the accounts of the [Petitioner] are maintained in accordance with the principle of fund accounting. This is the procedure by which resources for various purposes are classified for accounting and financial reporting purposes into funds that are in accordance with specified activities and objectives. Separate accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accompanying financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been combined into fund groups. Accordingly, all financial transactions have been recorded and reported by fund group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the Petition of De La Salle University, Inc. and to <b>SET ASIDE</b> the deficiency assessments issued against it.<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> TAX CODE, sec. 13 provides:<br><br>Section 13.
