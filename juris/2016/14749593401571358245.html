Almonte (Almonte), meanwhile, was the Division Manager of DCWD's Engineering and Construction Department, while Alfonso E. Laid (Laid) was the Assistant General Manager for Administration (collectively, the petitioners).<br><br>In Board Resolution No. 97-248<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> adopted on November 21, 1997, the DCWD Board of Directors approved the recommendation of DCWD General Manager Wilfredo A. Carbonquillo (Carbonquillo) to undertake the Cabantian Water Supply System Project stage by stage, with a budgetary cost of Thirty-Three Million Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P33,200,000.00). Initial activities for the project were the simultaneous drilling of two wells separately located in Cabantian (identified as VES 15 Project) and Communal (identified as VES 21 Project) in Davao City, both estimated at Four Million Pesos (P4,000,000.00) each. Included in Carbonquillo's recommendation was the direct negotiation of the well drilling phase of the project to Hydrock Wells, Inc. (Hydrock).<br><br>On November 24, 1997, Hydrock President Roberto G. Puentespina (Puentespina) wrote Carbonquillo informing DCWD that his company is "willing to take the risk of undertaking the project to test the availability of water by drilling the pilot hole so that electric logging could be done."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Puentespina also wrote that they were willing to undertake the drilling even without the approval of DCWD as their crew and equipment were idle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, in Resolution No. 05-97<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> approved on November 25, 1997, the PBAC-B resolved to dispense with the advertisement requirement in the conduct of the bidding and instead, opted to send letters to accredited well drillers and invited their participation in the VES 15 and VES 21 well drilling projects. Invited were Hydrock, AMG Drilling and Construction, Inc. (AMG) and Drill Mechanics Incorporated (DMI).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Only Hydrock and AMG responded favorably by submitting their respective quotations for the projects:<br><blockquote><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="30%"><div align="center">Project</div></td><td width="35%"><div align="center">Hydrock</div></td><td width="35%"><div align="center">AMG</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">VES 15</div></td><td><div align="center">P2,807,100.00</div></td><td><div align="center">P3,080,000.00</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">VES 21</div></td><td><div align="center">P2,349,180.00</div></td><td><div align="center">P2,596,900.00</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>AMG, however, requested that the project be implemented in July 1998 due to the unavailability of its equipment at the time of the invitation. DMI, for its part, sent its "regrets" as its drilling rigs are not available for immediate use.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, in Resolution No. 06-97<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated December 16, 1997, the PBAC-B resolved, "due to the urgency, importance and necessity of the well drilling project," to endorse the matter to the head of agency for approval, with a "recommendation that the project be pursued by a negotiated agreement contract with [HYDROCK] taking into account its track record, efficiency of performance, and quoted price."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The PBAC-B's recommendation was well-taken by the DCWD Board of Directors, and in Resolution No. 98-27<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> dated February 13, 1998, it resolved to award to Hydrock the VES 15 Project at P2,807,100.00, and the VES 21 Project at P2,349,180.00. On the same date, February 13, 1998, Carbonquillo issued a notice of award to Hydrock, informing the latter that the contract for the VES 21 Project has been awarded to it at the cost of P2,244,780.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Notice to proceed was then issued on February 20, 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>After more than six years, or on January 12, 2005, the respondents filed a joint Affidavit-Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> with the Ombudsman, charging the petitioners<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> with Violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 3019, or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, for the alleged non-observance of the proper bidding procedure in the VES 21 Project and for allegedly giving Hydrock unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the "surreptitious" grant of the contract to it. The case was docketed as OMB-M-C-05-0051-A.<br><br>Two weeks after, or on January 26, 2005, the respondents filed another joint Affidavit-Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> with the Ombudsman, likewise chargmg the petitioners with Violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, this time for the VES 15 Project, docketed as OMB-M-C-05-0054-A.<br><br>Less than two months later, the respondents filed two separate joint Affidavit-Complaints<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> with the Ombudsman, administratively charging the petitioners with Grave Misconduct, Grave Abuse of Authority, Dishonesty and Gross Negligence. The respondents adopted the allegations in the separate criminal complaints they filed with the Ombudsman against the petitioners in OMB-M-C-05-0051-A and OMB-M-C-05-0054-A as bases for the administrative charges. For the VES 21 Project, the administrative case against the petitioners was docketed as <b>OMB-M-A-05-093-C</b>, while the administrative case for the VES 15 Project was docketed as <b>OMB-M-A-05-104-C</b>.<br><br>The pertinent allegations in the Affidavit-Complaint filed on January 12, 2005 in OMB-M-C-05-0051-A, are as follows:<br><blockquote>14. That the awarding of the said contract is riddled with irregularities and anomalies from its inception up to the actual execution of the same;<br><br>15. That for one, the Resolution No. 05-97 of the [PBAC-B] x x x is a systemic violation of the P.D. No. 1594 as amended. x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>16. That the act of the PBAC-B in passing Resolution No. 06-97 x x x is in flagrant violation of the requirement of P.D. 1594, IB-10.4.2, which requires that there must be two failure of bidding before negotiated contract may be entered into;<br><br>17. That the urgency, importance and necessity of the drilling, which was then cited by the PBAC-B as a reason in resorting to negotiated contract and in not observing the rules in case of failure of bidding as provided by P.D. 1594 were merely interposed by the members of the PBAC-B x x x to mislead the Board of the DCWD into approving the said project, because up to this date VES No. 15, which was simultaneously drilled with VES 21 remained to be unused;<br><br>18. That x x x, in fact the entire bidding process was just a mere farce to put a color of legitimacy to an otherwise illegal drilling of VES 21;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>20. That as borne out by the Project Inspector's Daily Report dated December 29, 1997, x x x the [Hydrock] had actually started drilling VES 21 as early as December 29, 1997. x x x;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>22. That undeniably, during the time (December 29, 1997) [Hydrock] started the drilling of VES 21, its contract was then still in the stage of negotiation. Parenthetically, we can conclude that the project has already been pre-awarded by the members of the PBAC-B, x x x;<br><br>23. That it is quite obvious that there exists a complicity among the members of the [PBAC-B] x x x;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>25. That per Project Inspector's Daily Report, the drilling of VES 21 has already been completed on February 24, 1998. x x x;<br><br>26. That despite its completion on February 24, 1998, [Hydrock] submitted on March 10, 1998, a request for Change Order, requesting for the increase of the contract cost by Php 64,745.00, x x x;<br><br>27. The above mentioned request for change order was absurd, because how can the cost of VES #21 be changed when the same has already been completed;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>30. That, however, despite of the knowledge of the Department Manager of the SIA, [Navales], of the anomalies surrounding the transactions concerning the drilling of VES 21, he even defended the same and prepared a report, which in effect affirms the said anomalies and much worse recommended for the approval of the said Change Order No. 1. x x x;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>32. That to justify the said Change Order, the project was made to appear, through the conspiracy x x x, to have been completed on July 2, 1998, but the final billing was submitted only by the contractor [Hydrock] on October 1998;<br><br>33. That through the said final billings, it was made to appear that the drilling was still on progress on the dates between February 24 till July 2, 1998 and that certain percentage of the cost of contract is due to the contractor based on the accomplished work, when in truth and in fact the same had already been completed on February 24, 1998 x x x; the same is designed primarily to deceive the Board of Directors, the entire DCWD and the general public at large, x x x;<br><br>34. That [o]n January 27, 1999, a Certificate of Completion and Acceptance was issued supposedly by [Carbonquillo], but was signed by [Laid], who was then the Assistant General Manager for Administration, certifying to the effect that the Drilling of Production Well VES #21 has been physically completed on February 24, 1998 and that whatever withheld retentions be released, x x x;<br><br>35. That to a reasonable mind, the only conclusion that can be drawn in issuing the said Certificate of Completion x x x is that [Laid] was aware that the drilling of VES 21 has already been completed as early as February 24, 1998[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br></blockquote>Meanwhile, the Affidavit-Complaint filed on January 26, 2005 in OMB-M-C-05-0054-A contained essentially the same allegations as that filed in OMB-M-C-05-0051-A, albeit it referred to the VES 15 Project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The petitioners filed their Joint Counter-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> on April 15, 2005 to the administrative charges, adopting as defenses the contentions in their Joint Counter-Affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> dated February 22, 2005 in OMB-M-C-05-0051-A.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27] </sup>In the said Joint Counter-Affidavit, the petitioners denied the respondents' accusations and alleged, among others, that:<br><blockquote><blockquote>14.e The recourse of PBAC-B to adopt limited source bidding is allowed by law. The law applicable is Executive Order No. 164 x x x[.]<br><br>x x x x<br><br>14.f It may help that we let this Honorable Office know that there was a public outcry for water in the areas of Buhangin, Cabantian, Lanang, Sasa and Panacan during the time PBAC-B deliberated on whether to proceed with the usual advertisement in a newspaper or adopt a simplified bidding. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>16. x x x Thus, considering that the time was of essence in the prosecution of the project, and considering that only Hydrock can timely respond and meet the needs of DCWD at that moment, we, Yamson, Chavez, Navales, and Guillen x x x declared a failure of bidding as there was only one bidder that qualified and recommended for negotiated contract to Hydrock. PBAC-B could have awarded the project to Hydrock being the only responsive evaluated bidder at the price the latter had offered. Yet, PBAC-B recommended a negotiated contract with Hydrock because it was more advantageous to DCWD as it could haggle more for a cheaper contract price through negotiation taking into account Section 5 (3) of Executive Order No. 164 x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>17. Thus, on December 16, 1997, PBAC-B passed Resolution No. 06-97, in which, it declared a failure of bidding and recommended for a negotiated contract with Hydrock. From December 16, 1997, our participation, x x x, as PBAC-B members in relation to the project (VES 21) officially ended, as it has in fact ended.<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>19.a I, [Yamson], do hereby declare that I was personally instructed by [Carbonquillo] x x x to send personnel to the project site on December 29, 1997 for inspection purposes. As I understood things up, [Carbonquillo] again made a verbal notice to proceed to Hydrock as what he did earlier in Production Wells Nos. 30, 31 and 32. I asked [Carbonquillo] whether the award of the project was already approved by the Board but I was cut-off and told to do things as instructed - no more questions asked as he took full responsibility of the project. Thus, in my capacity as Assistant General Manager for Operations, I instructed [Chavez], x x x, to send his men to the project site on December 29, 1997 per instruction of [Carbonquillo].<br><br>19.b I[,] [Chavez], was instructed by [Yamson] to send ECD personnel to the project site on December 29, 1997 per instruction of [Carbonquillo]. With what I went through with [Carbonquillo] when I tried to suspend the sealing of Production Well No. 30 (<i>please see subparagraphs 13.b and 13.b</i>), I just complied the marching order and instructed [Almonte] to do the things per construction.<br><br>19.c I, [Almonte], in compliance with the instruction of [Chavez], had in turn instructed Jose David Colindres to proceed to the project site on December 29, 1997. Being an employee of DCWD, I am bound to protect the interest of the DCWD. At that time, it was not within my power to suspend the prosecution of the drilling project. Thus, the most that I can do was to verify, check and evaluate the drilling procedure undertaken by Hydrock. x x x.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote>21. The implementation of the change order for VES 21 happened before its completion on February 24, 1998. In fact, I, [Navales], had been straightforward and transparent on this matter in my communication to the Board, x x x[.]<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>[21].e In fact, in a much earlier date, I, [Navales], has reported the matter to the Board and advised [Carbonquillo] to defer any payment thereon and secure first the approval of the Board, x x x.<br></blockquote>x x x x<br><br>23. With respect to the non-use of VES 15, the same is the result to the rotation of department managers of the DCWD following the dismissal of [Carbonquillo].<br><br>x x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioners' allegations and defenses in OMB-M-C-05-0054-A are likewise similar to the foregoing allegations and defenses in OMB-M-A-05-104-C.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><center><b>OMB-M-A-05-093-C (VES 21 Project)</b><br></center><br>In its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> dated November 28, 2007, the Ombudsman found the petitioners administratively liable for grave misconduct and ordered their dismissal from service. The dispositive portion of the decision provides:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Office finds substantial evidence to hold [the petitioners] administratively liable for Grave Misconduct pursuant to Rule IV, Section 52, par.

Thus, the Ombudsman found the petitioners guilty of Grave Misconduct, ruling that: (1) the petitioners failed to conduct the required public bidding; (2) the project was implemented by Hydrock ahead of the contract award, with the knowledge and approval of Carbonquillo, and with the cooperation of the petitioners; (3) the petitioners' justification that Carbonquillo was responsible for the mobilization of Hydrock prior to contract award is self-serving considering that the petitioners hold managerial positions and should not follow orders blindly; and (4) the change order was allowed even before proper documentation was accomplished, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br><center><b>OMB-M-A-05-104-C (VES 15 Project)</b><br></center><br>The petitioners were likewise found guilty of grave misconduct by the Ombudsman for the VES 15 Project in its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated October 26, 2007.

Thus, it ruled that the VES 15 Project did not fall under the exceptions to competitive bidding in Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1594,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and that the VES 15 Project was riddled with irregularities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br><center><b>Ruling of the CA</b><br></center><br>The petitioners' separate appeals to the CA were consolidated, and in the assailed Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated December 6, 2010, the petitioners' dismissal from service was affirmed, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions for review are <b>DISMISSED</b>.

No. 07 (dated September 7, 2003) of the Ombudsman, which prescribed the filing of a certificate of non-forum shopping. The petitioners also insist that the respondents in this case violated the rule on forum shopping when they filed the administrative complaints separately, given that these arose from the same set of facts involving identical rights asserted and prayed for the same relief, and thus, entitling the dismissal of the cases. The petitioners also decry the splitting of the prosecution for the VES 15 and VES 21 Projects, arguing that the essence of the respondents' complaint is based actually on the same set of facts.<br><br>With regard to their culpability for the acts complained of, the petitioners argue that it was not the PBAC-B that approved the negotiation of the contract but the DCWD's Board of Directors, as evidenced by Board Resolution No. 97-248 dated November 21, 1997. What the PBAC-B merely did was recommend the negotiation of the contract to Hydrock and the ultimate decision to approve its recommendation was still with the Board of Directors. The petitioners attribute: (1) bad faith on the part of the CA when it allegedly failed to even mention the existence of Board Resolution No. 97-248; and (2) conspiracy on the part of the respondents and Ombudsman when they deliberately "hid" the contents of Board Resolution No. 97-248 to make it appear that it was the PBAC-B that unilaterally decided the award of the contract to Hydrock.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br><b><i>Forum shopping</i></b><br><br>Generally, the rule on forum shopping applies only to judicial cases or proceedings, and not to administrative cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Nonetheless, A.O. No. 07, as amended by A.O. No. 17, explicitly removed from the ambit of the rule the administrative cases filed before it when it required the inclusion of a Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping in complaints filed before it. Thus, Section 3 of Rule III (Procedure in Administrative Cases) provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 3. <i>How initiated</i>. - An administrative case may be initiated by a written complaint under oath accompanied by affidavits of witnesses and other evidence in support of the charge. <b>Such complaint shall be accompanied by a Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping duly subscribed and sworn to by the complainant or his counsel.</b> An administrative proceeding may also be ordered by the Ombudsman or the respective Deputy Ombudsman on his initiative or on the basis of a complaint originally filed as a criminal action or a grievance complaint or request for assistance. (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>The respondents in this case attached a Certificate of Non-Forum Shopping to their separate Affidavit-Complaints,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> which amounts to an express admission on their part of the applicability of the rule in the administrative cases they filed against the petitioners. But compliance with the certification requirement is separate from, and independent of, the avoidance of forum shopping itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Both constitute grounds for the dismissal of the case, in that non-compliance with the certification requirement constitutes sufficient cause for the dismissal without prejudice to the filing of the complaint or initiatory pleading upon motion and after hearing, while the violation of the prohibition is a ground for summary dismissal thereof and for direct contempt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The respondents' compliance, thus, does not exculpate them from violating the prohibition against forum shopping.<br><br>The rule against forum shopping prohibits the filing of multiple suits involving the same parties for the same cause of action, either simultaneously or successively for the purpose of obtaining a favorable judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Forum shopping may be committed in three ways: (1) <b>through <i>litis pendentia</i></b> - filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action and with the same prayer, the previous case not having been resolved yet; 2) <b>through <i>res judicata</i></b> - filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action and the same prayer, the previous case having been finally resolved; and 3) <b>splitting of causes of action</b> - filing multiple cases based on the same cause of action but with different prayers - the ground to dismiss being either <i>litis pendentia</i> or <i>res judicata</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Common in these is the identity of causes of action.

On this score, the non-inclusion of Guillen in <b>OMB-M-A-05-104-C</b> is inconsequential because the rule does not require absolute identity of parties; only substantial identity of parties is sufficient to qualify under the first requisite.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>There is also no denying the identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for in these cases.<br><br>The administrative complaint filed in <b>OMB-M-A-05-093-C</b> was based on the criminal complaint filed in OMB-M-C-05-0051-A for the VES 21 Project.

Notwithstanding the difference in location, it should be noted that there was only one procedure carried out by the PBAC-B in undertaking the negotiated procurement of the VES 15 and VES 21 Projects. Note, too, that the actions on these two projects were contained in the same resolutions - the PBAC-B's <u>Resolution No. 05-97</u> approved on November 25, 1997 resolved to dispense with the advertisement requirement and opted to send letters to well drillers "for the proposed Well Drilling Projects in Communal and Cabantian;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> the PBAC-B's <u>Resolution No. 06-97</u> dated December 16, 1997 recommended the negotiated procurement of the VES 15 and VES 21 Projects to Hydrock;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and pursuant to the PBAC-B's recommendation, the DCWD Board of Directors issued <u>Resolution No. 98-27</u> dated February 13, 1998, awarding the VES 15 and VES 21 Projects to Hydrock.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Clearly, the identity of these two cases is such that judgment in one administrative case would amount to <i>res judicata</i> in the other administrative case.

Records show that these cases were premised on the two criminal complaints for Violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, which were separately filed <u>and</u> entertained by the Ombudsman. At the most, <b>OMB-M-A-05-104-C</b> (VES 15 Project), which was filed subsequent to <b>OMB-M-A-05-093-C</b> (VES 21 Project), should be, and is hereby, dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>In view of the dismissal of <b>OMB-M-A-05-104-C</b> (VES 15 Project), the Court will only resolve the petitioners' respective administrative liabilities in <b>OMB-M-A-05-093-C</b> (VES 21 Project).<br><br><b><i>P.D.

The query lies in the conclusion that is to be derived from these antecedent facts, that is, whether the petitioners are liable for grave misconduct.<br><br>P.D. No. 1594, and even the subsequent laws on procurement, set the order of priority in the procurement of government construction projects.

But as correctly concluded by both the Ombudsman and the CA, such "public outcry for water" does not qualify as an <i>emergency arising from natural calamities</i>, as required by both P.D. No. 1594 and E.O. No. 164. Natural calamities, as opposed to man-made calamities, usually refer to catastrophic events that result from the natural processes of the earth and which give rise to loss of lives or property or both. These include floods, earthquakes, storms and other similar natural events.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Water shortage, clearly, does not belong to the list of natural calamities. In fact, the "public outcry for water" relied upon by the petitioners was brought about by insufficient water supply connections in the affected areas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Records also show that as early as May 1997, residents of the affected area have already been demanding for the improvement in their water supply system;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> yet, it was only in November 1997 that DCWD started to act on the matter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> and apparently, only after the clamour has been publicized in the local newspapers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> This contradicts the petitioners' claim of urgency given the lapse of time that it took the DCWD to address the situation.

The pertinent provisions of PBAC-B's Resolution No. 06-97 dated December 16, 1997 state:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREAS</b>, an urgent meeting was called by the PBAC-B to evaluate <b>the letter proposal[s]</b> of the well drillers, <b>who were invited to participate in the bidding</b> of the proposed well drilling project at Communal and Cabantian, [Davao] [C]ity.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>With the foregoing, a <b>failure of competitive bidding is the result</b>. Meanwhile, the urgency of the project is of extreme importance. This Committee is in fact aware of the street demonstration, and public outcry of the residents in the affected area.

As reported by Navales in his Audit Report dated March 26, 1998, there was no detailed engineering that was carried out for the project.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Such detailed engineering design is a preliminary requirement before any bidding or award may be made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> The petitioners also admit that there was no posting of the invitation to bid, which is necessary in a competitive public bidding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> Instead, they directly sent out letter-invitations to "[accredited [w]ell [d]rillers as provided by Local Water Utilities Administration, and known and capable well drillers in the city"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> and it was from those who submitted their proposals that the PBAC-B eventually recommended Hydrock. These circumstances show that the procedure undertaken by the petitioners did not conform to the procedure provided in the IRR for competitive public bidding; hence, there was no failure of competitive bidding to speak of such that the PBAC-B may resort to a negotiated procurement.<br><br>To restate, before the petitioners can resort to a negotiated procurement through sealed canvass of at least three qualified contractors, whether under Section II, IB 10.6.2 of the IRR of P.D. No. 1594 or Section 5 of E.O. No. 164, there must first be a failure of a competitive public bidding undertaken in accordance with the IRR of P.D. No. 1594. In this regard, the Court has emphasized that "violation of the provisions of the IRR of [P.D.

The CA affirmed the Ombudsman's fmding that the petitioners are liable for grave misconduct, relying mainly on the Audit Report dated March 26, 1998 submitted by Navales stating the following findings and observations:<br><blockquote><ol><li>The detailed engineering which is a basic requirement prior to bidding/awarding of any project was not carried out. x x x.<br><br></li><li>There was no bidding conducted prior to the awarding of the projects. x x x.<br><br></li><li>The project was awarded to the contractor by way of negotiation by the General Manager himself. x x x.<br></li><br><li>The contractor started the project without an approved contract confirmed by the Board nor that there was an authority for the General Manager to sign the Contract. x x x.<br><br></li><li>The Board Resolution approving the project dated February 13, 1998 is just a week-prior to the completion of the project - February 23, 1998. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>The Ombudsman, meanwhile, found that there was no competitive bidding conducted prior to the negotiated contract with Hydrock; the drilling for VES 21 Project was started by Hydrock even before they were informed by Carbonquillo to proceed; and the change order for the VES 21 Project was allowed even without proper documentation and came ahead of the awarding of the contract to Hydrock, among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Misconduct is defined as a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer.

There is also no evidence showing that they benefited from the procurement of the project. Much less was there any evidence that petitioners Almonte and Laid, who were not even members of the PBAC-B, conspired with their co-petitioners and the other bidding participants in the procurement of the VES 21 Project.

AMG and DMI were likewise invited by the PBAC-B, only that it was Hydrock's acceptable proposal and track record that clinched the award. And even then, the role of the PBAC-B was only to recommend the award of the project to Hydrock.

At most, it is only petitioners Yamson, Chavez, Navales and Guillen, as members of the PBAC-B, who should be held individually accountable for their failure to strictly comply with the procurement procedure laid down in P.D.

According to the Ombudsman, these irregularities were with the knowledge and approval of petitioners Yamson, Chavez and Almonte, and that Laid, despite knowledge of these irregularities, signed the Certificate of Completion without objection, effectively releasing Hydrock's retention money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>Note should be made that these alleged infractions do not pertain anymore to petitioners Yamson and Chavez's functions as members of the PBAC-B; rather these already refer to their, including Almonte and Laid's, functions as employees and officials of the implementing agency itself, which in this case is DCWD. And as was previously established, it was Carbonquillo who was predisposed to award the VES 21 Project to Hydrock without the benefit of a public bidding. Records also show that Hydrock, in fact, commenced with the drilling of the pilot hole as early as December 1997, prior to the award of the contract, issuance of the notice of award and the notice to proceed in its favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> The Court, however, cannot agree with the Ombudsman's conclusion that petitioners Yamson, Chavez and Almonte colluded with Carbonquillo in the premature implementation of the VES 21 Project.<br><br>As borne by the records, Carbonquillo instructed Yamson to inspect the project site on December 29, 1997. Yamson, in turn, instructed Chavez, who then instructed Almonte to conduct the inspection. At this point, the procurement for the VES 21 Project was still ongoing and yet to be awarded to Hydrock. As it turned out, the drilling was already ongoing at that time. But these facts, without more, are not sufficient to support the conclusion that the petitioners were in conspiracy with Carbonquillo, or as the respondents claimed, that the contract has already been pre-awarded to Hydrock. As the Court has ruled, for Grave Misconduct to attach, it must be shown that the acts of the petitioners were tainted with corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of an established rule, which must be proven by substantial evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, the petitioners cannot put the blame entirely on Carbonquillo. It behooved the petitioners to exercise diligence in the performance of their official duties. Had they been circumspect to begin with, it would not have been possible for Carbonquillo to commit these acts with impunity. The petitioners must be reminded that in the discharge of duties, a public officer must use prudence, caution, and attention which careful persons use in the management of their affairs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> <b>Thus, petitioners Yamson and Chavez, together with Almonte, are individually liable for Simple Misconduct.</b><br><br>With regard to the change order, it was also established that this was implemented for the VES 21 Project even before proper documentation was accomplished. This was admitted by petitioner Navales when he stated that:<br><blockquote>21. The implementation of the change of order for VES 21 happened before its completion on February 24, 1998. In fact, I, [Navales], had been straightforward and transparent on this matter in my communication to the Board. This was embodied in the Report dated August 20, 1998 x x x, quoted as follows:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>8. The implementation of this change order occurred on January 30, 1998 and [was] completed on February 19, 1998, presented as Annex "G".<br><br>9. <b>Presentation of documents for the change order for Board approval was made only on June 22, 1998</b>, presented as Annex "H".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote></blockquote>In <i>Office of the Ombudsman v. Agustino</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> the Court held that a change order could only be performed by the contractor once it was confirmed and approved by the appropriate officials. Economic viability, and the DCWD's Board of Directors' and the Commission on Audit's acceptance of their explanation regarding the delayed documentation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> are not exculpatory reasons for non-compliance with P.D. No. 1594 and its IRR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> <b>Navales, likewise, should therefore be individually held accountable for Simple Misconduct.</b><br><br>Finally, Laid was held liable for grave misconduct for affixing his signature on the Certificate of Completion despite his alleged knowledge of the irregularities attending the procurement and implementation of the VES 21 Project. The Ombudsman stated:<br><blockquote>Having known of the completion of the physical works on 24 February 1998, [Laid] would have been aware of the irregularities attending the awarding of the VES 21 [P]roject contract to [Hydrock], its implementation and the issues attending the change order. Yet, [Laid] signed a Certificate of Completion without evident objection. This effectively released the withheld retention money to [Hydrock].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court, however, cannot find any substantiation in the records of this case that will justify the conclusion that Laid had prior knowledge of the irregularities attending the VES 21 Project. All Laid did was certify that the VES 21 Project has been completed on February 24, 1998. There is nothing on record that will show Laid's direct and active participation during the planning, procurement and implementation of the VES 21 Project such that he should be aware of its surrounding circumstances. There is also no showing that his official duties as Assistant General Manager for Administration involved active participation in the project or that his act in certifying the date of completion was tainted with corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of an established rule. <b>If at all, Laid should be individually liable only for Simple Misconduct for his failure to exercise the necessary prudence to ensure that the completion of the VES 21 Project was above board.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup><br><br><b><i>Imposable penalties and service thereof</i></b><br><br>Under Section 52(B) of Revised Uniform Rules in Administrative Cases in the Civil Service,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> Simple Neglect of Duty and Simple Misconduct are classified as less grave offenses, punishable by suspension of one (1) month and one (1) day suspension to six (6) months for the first offense; and dismissal from the service for the second offense.

In <i>Civil Service Commission v. Cruz</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[122]</sup> the Court already definitively settled the issue of a government employee's entitlement to backwages/back salaries. Thus, it was held that before a government employee may be entitled to back salaries, two conditions must be met, to wit: a) the employee must be found innocent of the charges, and b) his suspension must be unjustified. To be considered innocent of the charges, the Court explained that there must be complete exoneration of the charges levelled against the employee. According to the Court:<br><blockquote>[I]f the exoneration of the employee is relative (as distinguished from complete exoneration), an inquiry into the factual premise of the offense charged and of the offense committed must be made. If the administrative offense found to have been actually committed is of lesser gravity than the offense charged, the employee cannot be considered exonerated if the factual premise for the imposition of the lesser penalty remains the same. The employee found guilty of a lesser offense may only be entitled to back salaries when the offense actually committed does not carry the penalty of more than one month suspension or dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>Unjustified suspension, on the other hand, meant that the employee's separation from service is not warranted under the circumstances because there was no cause for suspension or dismissal, <i>e.g.</i>, where the employee did not commit the offense charged, punishable by suspension or dismissal (total exoneration); or the government employee is found guilty of another offense for an act different from that for which he was charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup><br><br>These conditions were clearly not met in this case. For one, the petitioners were not completely exonerated of the charges against them. Indeed, they were found culpable of lesser offenses - Simple Neglect of Duty and Simple Misconduct; nevertheless, these emanated from the same acts that were the basis of the original charges against them - Grave Misconduct, Grave Abuse of Authority, Dishonesty and Gross Negligence -only that the Court does not find any element of corruption or bad faith. For another, Simple Neglect of Duty and Simple Misconduct carry with them the penalty of more than one month suspension.<br><br>In the same vein, their suspension (preventive suspension pending appeal) finds sufficient basis in this case. As earlier found, they were not completely exonerated of the charges against them and the lesser offense, which they were eventually found guilty of, merited a suspension of more than one month. Petitioners Chavez, Navales, Almonte and Laid, therefore, are not entitled to backwages.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated December 6, 2010 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
