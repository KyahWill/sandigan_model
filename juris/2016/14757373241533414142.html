SP No. 00013.<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b></center><br>The instant case arose from the conduct of field trials for "bioengineered eggplants," known as <i>Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) eggplant (<i>Bt talong</i>),</i> administered pursuant to the Memorandum of Undertaking<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (MOU) entered into by herein petitioners University of the Philippines Los Banos Foundation, Inc. (UPLBFI) and International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications, Inc. (ISAAA), and the University of the Philippines Mindanao Foundation, Inc. (UPMFI), among others. <i><i>Bt talong</i></i> contains the crystal toxin genes from the soil bacterium <i>Bt</i>, which produces the <i>Cry1Ac</i> protein that is toxic to target insect pests. The <i>Cry1Ac</i> protein is said to be highly specific to <i>lepidopteran larvae</i> such as the fruit and shoot borer, the most destructive insect pest to eggplants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>From 2007 to 2009, petitioner University of the Philippines Los Baiios (UPLB), the implementing institution of the field trials, conducted a contained experiment on <i>Bt talong</i> under the supervision of the National Committee on Biosafety of the Philippines (NCBP).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The NCBP, created under Executive Order No. (EO) 430,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> is the regulatory body tasked to: (a) "identify and evaluate potential hazards involved in initiating genetic engineering experiments or the introduction of new species and genetically engineered organisms and recommend measures to minimize risks";

(b) an ECC was not required for the field trials as it will not significantly affect the environment nor pose a hazard to human health; (c) there is a plethora of scientific works and literature, peer-reviewed, on the safety of <i>Bt talong</i> for human consumption; (d) at any rate, the safety of <i>Bt talong</i> for human consumption is irrelevant because none of the eggplants will be consumed by humans or animals and all materials not used for analyses will be chopped, boiled, and buried following the conditions of the Biosafety Permits; and (e) the precautionary principle could not be applied as the field testing was only a part of a continuing study to ensure that such trials have no significant and negative impact on the environment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On July 10, 2012, the Court issued a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> referring the case to the Court of Appeals for acceptance of the return of the writ and for hearing, reception of evidence, and rendition of judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In a hearing before the CA on August 14, 2012, UPLB was impleaded as a party to the case and was furnished by respondents a copy of their petition. Consequently the CA directed UPLB to file its comment to the petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> and, on August 24, 2012, UPLB filed its Answer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> adopting the arguments and allegations in the verified return filed by UPLBFI. On the other hand, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated February 13, 2013, the CA discharged UPMFI as a party to the case pursuant to the Manifestation and Motion filed by respondents in order to expedite the proceedings and resolution of the latter's petition.<br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated May 17, 2013, the CA ruled in favor of respondents and directed petitioners to permanently cease and desist from conducting the <i>Bt talong</i> field trials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> At the outset, it did not find merit in petitioners' contention that the case should be dismissed on the ground of mootness, noting that the issues raised by the latter were "capable of repetition yet evading review" since the <i>Bt talong</i> field trial was just one of the phases or stages of an overall and bigger study that is being conducted in relation to the said genetically-modified organism<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It then held that the precautionary principle set forth under Section I,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Rule 20 of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> is relevant, considering the Philippines' rich biodiversity and uncertainty surrounding the safety of <i>Bt talong</i>. It noted the possible irreversible effects of the field trials and the introduction of <i>Bt talong</i> to the market, and found the existing regulations issued by the DA and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) insufficient to guarantee the safety of the environment and the health of the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioners separately moved for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> However, in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> dated September 20, 2013, the CA denied the same and remarked that introducing genetically modified plant into the ecosystem is an ecologically imbalancing act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Anent UPLB's argument that the Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> violated its right to academic freedom, the CA emphasized that the writ did not stop the research on <i>Bt talong</i> but only the procedure employed in conducting the field trials, and only at this time when there is yet no law ensuring its safety when introduced to the environment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, petitioners filed their respective petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> before this Court.<br><br><center><b>The Proceedings Before the Court</b></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dated December 8, 2015, the Court denied the petitions and accordingly, affirmed with modification the ruling of the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Agreeing with the CA, the Court held that the precautionary principle applies in this case since the risk of harm from the field trials of <i>Bt talong</i> remains uncertain and there exists a possibility of serious and irreversible harm. The Court observed that eggplants are a staple vegetable in the country that is mostly grown by small-scale farmers who are poor and marginalized; thus, given the country's rich biodiversity, the consequences of contamination and genetic pollution would be disastrous and irreversible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>The Court likewise agreed with the CA in not dismissing the case for being moot and academic despite the completion and tennination of the <i>Bt talong</i> field trials, on account of the following exceptions to the mootness principle: (a) the exceptional character of the situation and the paramount public interest is involved; and (b) the case is capable of repetition yet evading review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Further, the Court noted that while the provisions of DAO 08-2002 were observed, the National Biosafety Framework (NBF) established under EO 514, series of 2006<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> which requires public participation in all stages-of biosafety decision-making, pursuant to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> which was acceded to by the Philippines in 2000 and became effective locally in 2003, was not complied with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Moreover, the field testing should have been subjected to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), considering that it involved new technologies with uncertain results.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Thus, the Court permanently enjoined the field testing of <i>Bt talong</i>. In addition, it declared DAO 08-2002 null and void for failure to consider the provisions of the NBF. The Court also temporarily enjoined any application for contained use, field testing, propagation, commercialization, and importation of genetically modified organisms until a new administrative order is promulgated in accordance with law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issues Presented in the Motions for Reconsideration</b></center><br>Undaunted, petitioners moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> arguing, among others, that: (a) the case should have been dismissed for mootness in view of the completion and termination of the <i>Bt talong</i> field trials and the expiration of the Biosafety Permits;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> (b) the Court should not have ruled on the validity of DAO 08-2002 as it was not raised as an issue;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> and (c) the Court erred in relying on the studies cited in the December 8, 2015 Decision which were not offered in evidence and involved <i>Bt corn</i>, not <i>Bt talong</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>In their Consolidated Comments,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> respondents maintain, in essence, that: (a) the case is not mooted by the completion of the field trials since field testing is part of the process of commercialization and will eventually lead to propagation, commercialization, and consumption of <i>Bt talong</i> as a consumer product;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (b) the validity of DAO 08-2002 was raised by respondents when they argued in their petition for Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> that such administrative issuance is not enough to adequately protect the Constitutional right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> and (c) the Court correctly took judicial notice of the scientific studies showing the negative effects of Bt technology and applied the precautionaiy principle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center><br>The Court grants the motions for reconsideration on the ground of mootness.<br><br>As a rule, the Court may only adjudicate actual, ongoing controversies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The requirement of the existence of a "case" or an "actual controversy" for the proper exercise of the power of judicial review proceeds from Section 1, Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution:<br><blockquote>Section 1. The judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as may be established by law.<br><br>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice <b>to settle actual</b> controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Accordingly, the Court is not empowered to decide moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue in the case before it. In other words, when a case is moot, it becomes non-justiciable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>An action is considered "moot" when it no longer presents a justiciable controversy because the issues involved have become academic or dead or when the matter in dispute has already been resolved and hence, one is not entitled to judicial intervention unless the issue is likely to be raised again between the parties. There is nothing for the court to resolve as the determination thereof has been overtaken by subsequent events.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Nevertheless, case law states that the Court will decide cases, otherwise moot, if: <i>first,</i> there is a grave violation of the Constitution; <i>second,</i> the exceptional character of the situation and the paramount public interest are involved; <i>third,</i> when the constitutional issue raised requires formulation of controlling principles to guide the bench, the bar, and the public; and <i>fourth,</i> the case is capable of repetition yet evading review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Thus, jurisprudence recognizes these four instances as exceptions to the mootness principle.<br><br>In the December 8, 2015 Decision of the Court, it was held that (a) the present case is of exceptional character and paramount public interest is involved, and (b) it is likewise capable of repetition yet evading review. Hence, it was excepted from the mootness principle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> However, upon a closer scrutiny of the parties' arguments, the Court reconsiders its ruling and now finds merit in petitioners' assertion that the case should have been dismissed for being moot and academic, and that the aforesaid exceptions to the said rule should not have been applied.<br><br><center><b><u>I. On the paramount public interest exception.</u></b></center><br>Jurisprudence in this jurisdiction has set no hard-and-fast rule in determining whether a case involves paramount public interest in relation to the mootness principle. However, a survey of cases would show that, as a common guidepost for application, there should be some perceivable benefit to the public which demands the Court to proceed with the resolution of otherwise moot questions.<br><br>In <i>Gonzales v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> an action for declaratory judgment assailing the validity of Republic Act No. (RA) 4880,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> which prohibits the early nomination of candidates for elective offices and early election campaigns or partisan political activities became moot by reason of the holding of the 1967 elections before the case could be decided. Nonetheless, the Court treated the petition as one for prohibition and rendered judgment in view of the paramount public interest and the undeniable necessity for a ruling, the national elections [of 1969] being barely six months away."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>In <i>De Castro v. Commission on Elections,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> the Court proceeded to resolve the election protest subject of that case notwithstanding the supervening death of one of the contestants. According to the Court, in an election contest, there is a paramount need to dispel the uncertainty that beclouds the real choice of the electorate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>In <i>David v. Macapagal-Arroyo,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> the Court ruled on the constitutionality of Presidential Proclamation No. 1017, s. 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> which declared a state of National Emergency, even though the same was lifted before a decision could be rendered. The Court explained that the case was one of exceptional character and involved paramount public interest, because the people's basic rights to expression, assembly, and of the press were at issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>In <i>Constantino v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> both of the accused were found guilty of graft and corrupt practices under Section 3 (e) of RA 3019.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> One of the accused appealed the conviction, while the other filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the Court. While the appellant died during the pendency of his appeal, the Court still ruled on the merits thereof considering the exceptional character of the appeals in relation to each other, i.e., the two petitions were so intertwined that the absolution of the deceased was determinative of the absolution of the other accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>More recently, in <i>Funa v. Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO),</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> the petitioner prayed that the Commission on Audit (COA) be ordered to audit the MECO which is based in Taiwan, on the premise that it is a government-owned and controlled corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> The COA argued that the case is already moot and should be dismissed, since it had already directed a team of auditors to proceed to Taiwan to audit the accounts of MECO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> Ruling on the merits, the Court explained that the case was of paramount public interest because it involved the COA's performance of its constitutional duty and because the case concerns the legal status of MECO, i.e., whether it may be considered as a government agency or not, which has a direct bearing on the country's commitment to the One China Policy of the People's Republic of China.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>In contrast to the foregoing cases, no perceivable benefit to the public - whether rational or practical - may be gained by resolving respondents' petition for Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> on the merits.<br><br>To recount, these cases, which stemmed from herein respondents petition for Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i>, were mooted by the undisputed expiration of the Biosafety Permits issued by the BPI and the completion and tennination of the <i>Bt talong</i> field trials subject of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> These incidents effectively negated the necessity for the reliefs sought by respondents in their petition for Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> as there was no longer any field test to enjoin. Hence, at the time the CA rendered its Decision dated May 17, 2013, the reliefs petitioner sought and granted by the CA were no longer capable of execution.<br><br>At this juncture, it is important to understand that the completion and termination of the field tests do not mean that herein petitioners may inevitably proceed to commercially propagate <i>Bt talong</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> There are three (3) stages before genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) may become commercially available under DAO 08-2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> and each stage is distinct, such that "[subsequent stages can only proceed if the prior stage/s [is/]are completed and clearance is given to engage in the next regulatory stage."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Specifically, before a genetically modified organism is allowed to be propagated under DAO 08-2002: (a) a permit for propagation must be secured from the BPI; (b) it can be shown that based on the field testing conducted in the Philippines, the regulated article will not pose any significant risks to the environment; (c) food and/or feed safety studies show that the regulated article will not pose any significant risks to human and animal health; and (d) if the regulated article is a pest-protected plant, its transformation event has been duly registered with the FPA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>As the matter never went beyond the field testing phase, none of the foregoing tasks related to propagation were pursued or the requirements therefor complied with. Thus, there are no guaranteed after-effects to the already concluded <i>Bt talong</i> field trials that demand an adjudication from which the public may perceivably benefit. Any future threat to the right of herein respondents or the public in general to a healthful and balanced ecology is therefore more imagined than real.<br><br>In fact, it would appear to be more beneficial to the public to stay a verdict on the safeness of <i>Bt talong</i> - or GMOs, for that matter - until an actual and justiciable case properly presents itself before the Court. In his Concurring Opinion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> on the main, Associate Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen (Justice Leonen) had aptly pointed out that "the findings [resulting from the <i>Bt talong</i> field trials] should be the material to provide more rigorous scientific analysis of the various claims made in relation to <i>Bt talong</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> True enough, the concluded field tests - like those in these cases - would yield data that may prove useful for future studies and analyses. If at all, resolving the petition for Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> would unnecessarily arrest the results of further research and testing on <i>Bt talong</i>, and even GMOs in general, and hence, tend to hinder scientific advancement on the subject matter.<br><br>More significantly, it is clear that no benefit would be derived by the public in assessing the merits of field trials whose parameters are not only unique to the specific type of <i>Bt talong</i> tested, but are now, in fact, rendered obsolete by the supervening change in the regulatory framework applied to GMO field testing. To be sure, DAO 08-2002 has already been superseded by Joint Department Circular No. 1, series of 2016<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> (JDC 01-2016), issued by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), the DA, the DENR, the Department of Health (DOH), and the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), which provides a substantially different regulatory framework from that under DAO 08-2002 as will be detailed below. Thus, to resolve respondents' petition for Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> on its merits, would be tantamount to an unnecessary scholarly exercise for the Court to assess alleged violations of health and environmental rights that arose from a past test case whose bearings do not find any - if not minimal - relevance to cases operating under today's regulatory framework.<br><br>Therefore, the paramount public interest exception to the mootness rule should not have been applied.<br><br><center><b><u>II. The case is not one capable of repetition vet evading review.</u></b></center><br>Likewise, contrary to the Court's earlier ruling,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> these cases do not fall under the "capable of repetition yet evading review" exception.<br><br>The Court notes that the petition for Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> specifically raised issues only against the field testing of <i>Bt talong</i> under the premises of DAO 08-2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> <i>i.e.,</i> that herein petitioners failed to: (a) fully inform the people regarding the health, environment, and other hazards involved;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> and (b) conduct any valid risk assessment before conducting the field trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> As further pointed out by Justice Leonen, the reliefs sought did not extend far enough to enjoin the use of the results of the field trials that have been completed. Hence, the petition's specificity prevented it from falling under the above exception to the mootness rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>More obviously, the supersession of DAO 08-2002 by JDC 01-2016 clearly prevents this case from being one capable of repetition so as to warrant review despite its mootness. To contextualize, JDC 01-2016 states that:<br><blockquote>Section 1. Applicability. This Joint Department Circular shall apply to the research, development, handling and use, transboundary movement, release into the environment, and management of genetically-modified plant and plant products derived from the use of modern technology, included under "regulated articles."</blockquote>As earlier adverted to, with the issuance of JDC 01-2016, a new regulatory framework in the conduct of field testing now applies.<br><br>Notably, the new framework under JDC 01-2016 is substantially different from that under DAO 08-2002. In fact, the new parameters in JDC 01-2016 pertain to provisions which prompted the Court to invalidate DAO 08-2002. In the December 8, 2015 Decision of the Court, it was observed that: (a) DAO 08-2002 has no mechanism to mandate compliance with international biosafety protocols;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> (b) DAO 08-2002 does not comply with the transparency and public participation requirements under the NBF;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> and (c) risk assessment is conducted by an informal group, called the Biosafety Advisory Team of the DA, composed of representatives from the BPI, Bureau of Animal Industry, FPA, DENR, DQH, and DOST.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br>Under DAO 08-2002, no specific guidelines were used in the conduct of risk assessment, and the DA was allowed to consider the expert advice of, and guidelines developed by, relevant international organizations and regulatory authorities of countries with significant experience in the regulatory supervision of the regulated article.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> However, under JDC 01-2016, the CODEX <i>Alimentarius</i> Guidelines was adopted to govern the risk assessment of activities involving the research, development, handling and use, transboundary movement, release into the environment, and management of genetically modified plant and plant products derived from the use of modern biotechnology.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Also, whereas DAO 08-2002 was limited to the DA's authority in regulating the importation and release into the environment of plants and plant products derived from the use of modern biotechnology,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> under JDC 01-2016, various relevant government agencies such as the DOST, DOH, DENR, and the DILG now participate in all stages of the biosafety decision-making process, with the DOST being the central and lead agency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup><br><br>JDC 01-2016 also provides for a more comprehensive avenue for public participation in cases involving field trials and requires applications for permits and permits already issued to be made public by posting them online in the websites of the NCBP and the BPI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> The composition of the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) has also been modified to include an elected local official in the locality where the field testing will be conducted as one of the community representatives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Previously, under DAO 08-2002, the only requirement for the community representatives is that they shall not be affiliated with the applicant and shall be in a position to represent the interests of the communities where the field testing is to be conducted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>JDC 01-2016 also prescribes additional qualifications for the members of the Scientific and Technical Review Panel (STRP), the pool of scientists that evaluates the risk assessment submitted by the applicant for field trial, commercial propagation, or direct use of regulated articles.

In this regard, it cannot be said that the present case is one capable of repetition yet evading review.<br><br>The essence of cases capable of repetition yet evading review was succinctly explained by the Court in <i>Belgica v. Ochoa, Jr.,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> where the constitutionality of the Executive Department's lump-sum, discretionary funds under the 2013 General Appropriations Act, known as the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), was assailed. In that case, the Court rejected the view that the issues related thereto had been rendered moot and academic by the reforms undertaken by the Executive Department and former President Benigno Simeon S. Aquino Ill's declaration that he had already "abolished the PDAF." Citing the historical evolution of the ubiquitous Pork Barrel System, which was the source of the PDAF, and the fact that it has <i>always</i> been incorporated in the national budget which is enacted annually, the Court ruled that it is one capable of repetition yet evading review, thus:<br><blockquote>Finally, the application of the fourth exception [to the rule on mootness] is called for by the <b>recognition that the preparation and passage of the national budget is, by constitutional imprimatur, an affair of annual occurrence.</b> The relevance of the issues before the Court does not cease with the passage of a "PDAF-free budget for 2014." <b>The evolution of the "Pork Barrel System," by its multifarious iterations throughout the course of history, lends a semblance of truth to petitioners' claim that "the same dog will just resurface wearing a different collar."</b> In <i>Sanlakas v. Executive Secretary,</i> the government had already backtracked on a previous course of action yet the Court used the "capable of repetition but evading review" exception in order "[t]o prevent similar questions from re-emerging." The situation similarly holds true to these cases. Indeed, the myriad of issues underlying the manner in which certain public funds are spent, if not resolved at this most opportune time, are capable of repetition and hence, must not evade judicial review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>Evidently, the "frequent" and "routinary" nature of the Pork Barrel Funds and the PDAF are wanting herein. To reiterate, the issues in these cases involve factual considerations which are peculiar only to the controversy at hand since the petition for Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> is specific to the field testing of <i>Bt talong</i> and does not involve other GMOs.<br><br>At this point, the Court discerns that there are two (2) factors to be considered before a case is deemed one capable of repetition yet evading review: (1) the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration; and (2) there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action.<br><br>Here, respondents cannot claim that the duration of the subject field tests was too short to be fully litigated. It must be emphasized that the Biosafety Permits for the subject field tests were issued on March 16, 2010 and June 28, 2010, and were valid for two (2) years. However, as aptly pointed out by Justice Leonen, respondents filed their petition for Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> only on April 26, 2012 -just a few months before the Biosafety Permits expired and when the field testing activities were already over.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Obviously, therefore, the cessation of the subject field tests before the case could be resolved was due to respondents' own inaction.<br><br>Moreover, the situation respondents complain of is not susceptible to repetition. As discussed above, DAO 08-2002 has already been superseded by JDC 01-2016. Hence, future applications for field testing will be governed by JDC 01-2016 which, as illustrated, adopts a regulatory framework that is substantially different from that of DAO 08-2002.<br><br>Therefore, it was improper for the Court to resolve the merits of the case which had become moot in view of the absence of any valid exceptions to the rule on mootness, and to thereupon rule on the objections against the validity and consequently nullify DAO 08-2002 under the premises of the precautionary principle.<br><br>In fact, in relation to the latter, it is observed that the Court should not have even delved into the constitutionality of DAO 08-2002 as it was merely <b><u>collaterally challenged</u></b> by respondents, based on the constitutional precepts of the people's rights to information on matters of public concern, to public participation, to a balanced and healthful ecology, and to health.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup> A cursory perusal of the petition for Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> filed by respondents on April 26, 2012 before the Court shows that they essentially assail herein petitioners' failure to: (a) fully inform the people regarding the health, environment, and other hazards involved;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> and (b) conduct any valid risk assessment before conducting the field trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> However, while the provisions of DAO 08-2002 were averred to be inadequate to protect (a) the constitutional right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology since "said regulation failed, among others, to anticipate '<i>the public implications caused by the importation of GMOs in the Philippines"</i>';<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> and (b) "the people from the potential harm these genetically modified plants and genetically modified organisms may cause human health and the environment, [and] thus, x x x fall short of Constitutional compliance,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> respondents merely prayed for its <b><u><i>amendment</i></u></b>, as well as that of the NBF, to define or incorporate "an independent, transparent, and comprehensive scientific and socio-economic risk assessment, public information, consultation, and participation, and providing for their effective implementation, in accord with international safety standards[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> This attempt to assail the constitutionality of the public information and consultation requirements under DAO 08-2002 and the NBF constitutes a collateral attack on the said provisions of law that runs afoul of the well-settled rule that the constitutionality of a statute cannot be collaterally attacked as constitutionality issues must be pleaded directly and not collaterally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> Verily, the policy of the courts is to avoid ruling on constitutional questions and to presume that the acts of the political departments are valid, absent a clear and unmistakable showing to the contraiy, in deference to the doctrine of separation of powers. This means that the measure had first been carefully studied by the executive department and found to be in accord with the Constitution before it was finally enacted and approved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup><br><br>All told, with respondents' petition for Writ of <i>Kalikasan</i> already mooted by the expiration of the Biosafety Permits and the completion of the field trials subject of these cases, and with none of the exceptions to the mootness principle properly attending, the Court grants the instant motions for reconsideration and hereby dismisses the aforesaid petition.

In my view, a more becoming appreciation of the judiciary's role in the entire constitutional order should always give pause to go beyond the issues crystallized by an actual case with a real, present controversy. Going beyond the parameters of a live case may be an invitation to participate in the crafting of policies properly addressed to the other departments and organs of government.
