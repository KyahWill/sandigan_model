CR No. 24871, which affirmed the conviction of petitioner Paz Cheng <i>y</i> Chu (Cheng) for three (3) counts of the crime of <i>Estafa</i> defined and penalized under Article 315 (1) (b) of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).<br><br><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center><br>The instant case arose from the filing of three (3) separate Informations<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> charging Cheng of the crime of <i>Estafa</i> defined and penalized under Article 315 (1) (b) of the RPC before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 226 (RTC), docketed as Criminal Case Nos. Q-98-75440, Q-98-75441, and Q-98-75442. According to the prosecution, private complainant Rowena Rodriguez (Rodriguez) and Cheng entered into an agreement whereby Rodriguez shall deliver pieces of jewelry to Cheng for the latter to sell on commission basis. After one month, Cheng is obliged to either: (<i>a</i>) remit the proceeds of the sold jewelry; or (<i>b</i>) return the unsold jewelry to the former. On different dates (<i>i.e.</i>, July 12, 1997, July 16, 1997, and August 12, 1997), Rodriguez delivered various sets of jewelry to Cheng in the respective amounts of P18,000.00, P36,000.00, and P257,950.00. Upon delivery of the last batch of jewelry, Cheng issued a check worth P120,000.00 as foil security for the first two (2) deliveries and as partial security for the last. When Cheng failed to remit the proceeds or to return the unsold jewelry on due date, Rodriguez presented the check to the bank for encashment, but was dishonored due to insufficient funds. Upon assurance of Cheng, Rodriguez re-deposited the check, but again, the same was dishonored because the drawee account had been closed. Rodriguez then decided to confront Cheng, who then uttered "<i>Akala mo, babayaran pa kita?</i>" Thus, Rodriguez was constrained to file the instant charges.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In defense, Cheng denied receiving any jewelry from Rodriguez or signing any document purporting to be contracts of sale of jewelry, asserting that Rodriguez is a usurious moneylender. She then admitted having an unpaid loan with Rodriguez and that she issued a check to serve as security for the same, but was nevertheless surprised of her arrest due to the latter's filing of <i>Estafa </i>charges against her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br><center><b>The RTC Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated December 7, 2000, the RTC found Cheng guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of <i>Estafa</i> and, accordingly, sentenced her as follows: (<i>a</i>) for the first count, Cheng is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty ranging from four (4) years, two (2) months, and one (1) day to six (6) years, eight (8) months, and twenty-one (21) days to eight (8) years of <i>prision correccional</i> in its maximum period to <i>prision mayor</i> in its minimum period (maximum); (<i>b</i>) for the second count, Cheng is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty ranging from six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year, eight (8) months, and twenty (20) days of <i>prision correccional</i> in its minimum and medium periods to six (6) years, eight (8) months, and twenty-one (21) days to eight (8) years of <i>prision correctional</i> in its maximum period to <i>prision mayor </i>in its minimum period (maximum); and (c) for the third count, Cheng is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty ranging from six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year, eight (8) months, and twenty (20) days of <i>prision correctional </i>in its minimum and medium periods to four (4) years, two (2) months, and one (1) day to five (5) years, five (5) months, and ten (10) days of <i>prision correctional</i> in its maximum period to <i>prision mayor </i>in its minimum period (minimum).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The RTC found that the prosecution has sufficiently proven through documentary and testimonial evidence that: (<i>a</i>) Rodriguez indeed gave Cheng several pieces of jewelry for the latter to either sell and remit the proceeds or to return said jewelry if unsold to the former; and (<i>b</i>) Cheng neither returned the jewelry nor remitted their proceeds to Rodriguez within the specified period despite the latter's demands.

In such cases, and in connection with the accessory penalties which may be imposed and for the purpose of the other provisions of this Code, the penalty shall be termed <i>prision mayor</i> or <i>reclusion temporal</i>, as the case may be[.]<br><br>x x x x<br><br>1. With unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence, namely:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(b) By misappropriating or converting, to the prejudice of another, money, goods or any other personal property received by the offender in trust, or on commission, or for administration, or under any other obligation involving the duty to make delivery of, or to return the same, even though such obligation be totally or partially guaranteed by a bond; or by denying having received such money, goods, or other property;<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>The elements of <i>Estafa</i> under this provision are as follows: (1) the offender's receipt of money, goods, or other personal property in trust, or on commission, or for administration, or under any other obligation involving the duty to deliver, or to return, the same; (2) misappropriation or conversion by the offender of the money or property received, or denial of receipt of the money or property; (3) the misappropriation, conversion or denial is to the prejudice of another; and (4) demand by the offended party that the offender return the money or property received.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[17]</sup></font> In the case of <i>Pamintuan v. People</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the Court had the opportunity to elucidate further on the essence of the aforesaid crime, as well as the proof needed to sustain a conviction for the same, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><b>The essence of this kind of <i>[E]stafa </i>is the appropriation or conversion of money or property received to the prejudice of the entity to whom a return should be made.</b> The words "convert" and "misappropriate" connote the act of using or disposing of another's property as if it were one's own, or of devoting it to a purpose or use different from that agreed upon. To misappropriate for one's own use includes not only conversion to one's personal advantage, but also every attempt to dispose of the property of another without right.<u><b> In proving the element of conversion or misappropriation, a legal presumption of misappropriation arises when the accused fails to deliver the proceeds of the sale or to return the items to be sold and fails to give an account of their whereabouts</b></u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>In this case, a judicious review of the case records reveals that the elements of <i>Estafa,</i> as defined and penalized by the afore-cited provision, are present, considering that: (<i>a</i>) Rodriguez delivered the jewelry to Cheng for the purpose of selling them on commission basis; (<i>b</i>) Cheng was required to either remit the proceeds of the sale or to return the jewelry after one month from delivery; (<i>c</i>) Cheng failed to do what was required of her despite the lapse of the aforesaid period; (<i>d</i>) Rodriguez attempted to encash the check given by Cheng as security, but such check was dishonored twice for being drawn against insufficient funds and against a closed account; (<i>e</i>) Rodriguez demanded that Cheng comply with her undertaking, but the latter disregarded such demand; (<i>f</i>) Cheng's acts clearly prejudiced Rodriguez who lost the jewelry and/or its value.<br><br>In a desperate attempt to absolve herself from liability, Cheng insists that Rodriguez admitted in her own testimony that the transaction between them is not an agency on commission basis, but a plain sale of jewelry with Rodriguez as the seller and Cheng as the buyer. As such, Cheng's non­payment of the purchase price of the jewelry would only give rise to civil liability and not criminal liability.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The pertinent portion of Rodriguez's testimony is as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Q. After the delivery of these several items totaling P257,950.00, what happened next?<br><br>A. She issued a check worth P120,000.00.<br><br>Q. What check is that?<br><br>A. PDCP Bank, sir.<br><br>Q. What is this check for, Ms. Witness?<br><br>A. <u><i>As payment for the first and second transactions, sir, for P18,000.00 and P36,000.00 and the excess amount is applied for the third transaction.</i></u><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Q. So, all in all, you have sixty (60) days period with respect to this item, and the first delivery expired I am referring to July 12, 1997 worth P18,000.00 which will mature on September 11, so, from September 11, what happened?<br><br>A. <u><b>These were considered paid because she issued me a check for the period of August 13, so I was expecting that.</b></u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Essentially, Cheng posits that since Rodriguez "admitted" in her testimony that the check issued by the former in the amount of P120,000.00 constituted full payment for the first and second batch of jewelry and partial payment for the last batch, the transactions entered into by the parties should be deemed in the nature of a sale.<br><br>Cheng is sadly mistaken.<br><br>The foregoing "admission" on the part of Rodriguez did not change the fact that her transactions with Cheng should be properly deemed as an agency on a commission basis whereby Rodriguez, as the owner of the jewelry, is the principal, while Cheng is the agent who is tasked to sell the same on commission. In the eyes of the Court, Rodriguez merely accepted the check as full security for the first and second batches of jewelry and as partial security for the last batch. It was only when Cheng defaulted in her undertaking pursuant to their agreement that Rodriguez was constrained to treat the check as the former's remittance of the proceeds of the sale of jewelry - albeit deficient - by presenting it for encashment on October 20, 1997, or more than two (2) months after the delivery of the last batch of jewelry.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> However, the check was dishonored for being drawn against insufficient funds.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> This notwithstanding and with the assurance from Cheng that the check will be cleared, Rodriguez presented such check for the second time on November 4, 1997; but it was again dishonored - this time for being drawn against a closed account.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> As such, the fact that Rodriguez loosely used the words "payment" and "paid" should not be taken against her and should not in any way change the nature of her transactions with Rodriguez from an agency on a commission basis to a full-fledged sale. Moreover, even Cheng does not consider such check as payment for the jewelry, but rather, as security for the loan she allegedly obtained from Rodriguez.<br><br>Indisputably, there is no reason to deviate from the findings of the RTC and the CA as they have fully considered the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense, and they have adequately explained the legal and evidentiary reasons in concluding that Cheng is indeed guilty beyond reasonable doubt of three (3) counts of<i> Estafa</i> by misappropriation defined and penalized under Article 315 (1) (b) of the RPC. It is settled that factual findings of the RTC, when affirmed by the CA, are entitled to great weight and respect by this Court and are deemed final and conclusive when supported by the evidence on record,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> as in this case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED.</b> The Decision dated March 28, 2006 and the Resolution dated June 26, 2006 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.

(bold emphasis supplied)<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>The elements of <i>estafa</i> through misappropriation are: (<i>a</i>) that personal property is received in trust, on commission, for administration or under any other circumstances involving the duty to make delivery of or to return the same, even though the obligation is guaranteed by a bond; (<i>b</i>) that there is conversion or diversion of such property by the person who has so received it or a denial on her part that she received it; (<i>c</i>) that such conversion, diversion or denial is to the injury of another; and (<i>d</i>) that there be demand for the return of the property.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>According to the CA, the Prosecution established the petitioner's commission of <i>estafa</i> through misappropriation, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>All these elements were duly proven by the Prosecution.<br><br>The 2 written agreements <i>stipulated</i> that the pieces of jewelry were delivered to Accused-Appellant to be sold on commission basis or to be returned if unsold within 1 month. Clearly, the jewelry delivered to Accused-Appellant was for a specific purpose, that is, for Accused-Appellant to sell them, and in the event that it cannot be sold, to return the same to Private Complainant.<br><br>Accused-appellant, however, insisted that the Prosecution "<i>failed to prove the existence of misappropriation" as there was no proof that the accused-appellant kept the proceeds of the sale</i>."<br><br><i>We disagree.</i><br><br>The words '"convert" and "misappropriate" as used in Article 315 connote an act of using or disposing of another's property as if it were one's own or of devoting it to a purpose or use different from that agreed upon. To "misappropriate" a thing of value for one's own use or benefit, not only the conversion to one's personal advantage but also every attempt to dispose of the property of another without a right. Misappropriation or conversion may be proved by the prosecution by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence. <u>Failure to account, upon demand, for funds or property held in trust, is circumstantial evidence of misappropriation</u>.<br><br>Demand need not be formal. It may be verbal. A query as to the whereabouts of the money, such as the one proven in the case at bench, is tantamount to a demand. In this case, despite repeated demands from Private Complainant, Accused-Appellant still failed to return the jewelry or to remit the proceeds of the sale to the prejudice of Private Complainant. Accused-Appellant's failure to account for the jewelry entrusted to her by Private Complainant constitutes misappropriation. Accused-Appellant is, thus, liable for conversion under Art. 315, par. 1 (b) of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote><br>The Majority concur with the CA.<br><br>However, I cannot join my distinguished Brethren in the conclusion that the CA correctly affirmed the conviction of the petitioner. My assiduous and thorough review of the records of the trial convinces me that the real agreement between the parties was a <i>sale</i> of the items of jewelry, not the supposed agency to sell such items on commission basis as the RTC and the CA concluded.<br><br>It is conceded that the text of Exhibits A, Exhibit A-l and Exhibit A-2 - the documents <i>evidencing </i>the transactions - seemed to allude to the petitioner's obligation as one of agency to sell the items of jewelry on commission basis. Under ordinary circumstances, the literal terms of such documents would control and be regarded as the manifestation of the true intention of the parties. But to give outright credence to the interpretation of the evidence as the CA did would be to ignore and disregard what complainant Rowena Rodriguez had herself declared to be the true nature of the transactions with the petitioner.<br><br>Rodriguez testified as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" align="CENTER" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="10%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Q. </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">After the delivery of these several items totaling P257,950.00, what happened next?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">She issued a check worth P120,000.00.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q.</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">What check is that?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">PDCP Bank, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">What is this check for, Ms. Witness?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">A. </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>As payment for the first and second transactions, sir, for P18,000.00 and P36,000.00 and the excess amount is applied for the third transaction.</b><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">x x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">So, all in all, you have sixty (60) days period with respect to this item, and the first delivery expired.

Thus, the petitioner was the buyer of Rodriguez, not an agent on commission basis.<br><br>The right to a commission only establishes the relation of principal and agent, with the agent coming under the obligation to turn over to the principal the amount collected minus such commission. If the agent should retain more than the commission, she would be guilty of <i>estafa </i>through misappropriation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Yet, because the transaction between Rodriguez and the petitioner was a sale, the former effectively transferred to the latter the possession and the ownership of the items of jewelry.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Once the ownership of the jewelry became vested in the latter,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> she could not misappropriate the items of jewelry.<br><br>The foregoing excerpts of testimony further showed Rodriguez to have "considered [the items of jewelry] paid" by the petitioner. We should consider and regard such express declaration as a confirmation of the true nature of her agreement with the petitioner as a sale of the jewelry. The CA erroneously ignored the testimony despite its being a forthright judicial admission in the context of Section 4, Rule 129 of the <i>Rules of Court.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Although Rodriguez had described the petitioner's PDCP Check No. 003626 for PI 20,000.00 (Exhibit B) as the <i>security</i> for the items of jewelry listed under Exhibits A and Exhibit A-l, and as the <i>partial payment</i> for the last delivery listed under Exhibits A-2, her presenting the check to the drawee bank for payment or collection of the <i>entire amount</i> of the check indicated that the check was always intended as payment. This finding is still consistent with holding the transactions as sales of the items of jewelry. Indeed, the presentment of the check to the drawee bank as the person primarily liable was antithetical to the notion of having the check serve as mere security.<br><br>Clearly, the CA had no basis to hold the written text of Exhibits A, Exhibit A-l and Exhibit A-2 as controlling. In contracts the intent of the parties always prevails over the written form.<br><br>Did the dishonor of PDCP Check No. 003626 affect the character of the transactions between the petitioner and Rodriguez as sales of the items of jewelry?<br><br>I submit that the dishonor did not alter the character of the transactions as sales but only rendered Rodriguez an unpaid seller. The relationship between them resulting from the dishonor was that of a creditor-and-debtor. In a purely debtor-and-creditor relationship, the debtor who merely refuses to pay or denies the indebtedness cannot be held liable for <i>estafa</i> by misappropriation. The reason is readily apparent. To convict a person of <i>estafa</i> under Article 315, par 1(b) of the <i>Revised Penal Code,</i> the State must prove that she has the obligation to deliver or return the same money, goods or personal property received.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Considering that the petitioner already became the owner of the pieces of jewelry, she could dispose of the same, and her disposal of them would not amount to the misappropriation thereof.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In short, the petitioner did not thereby violate any trust or other obligation to account for the items of jewelry that she already owned.<br><br>Considering that the Prosecution did not establish the petitioner's guilt for the crimes of estafa through misappropriation beyond reasonable doubt, she was entitled to acquittal,18 for it is always indispensable for the valid conviction of the accused that the State shall prove the existence of all the essential elements of the offense charged beyond reasonable doubt. With less than all the elements of the offense charged having been established, it is unwarranted and unjust to still find her criminally liable.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo,</i> pp. 3 1-45; penned by Presiding Judge Leah S.
