This resulted to over-recoveries amounting to PhP4,192,972.00 and PhP4,047,598.00, respectively[;]<br><br></li><li>NEECO I failed to comply with the [IRR] of R.A. No. 7832 which provides that the pilferage recoveries should be deducted from the total purchased power cost used in the PPA computation.

No. 7832 is unconstitutional for being an <i>ex post facto</i> law; and (i) the policies issued by ERC are unenforceable because they were not published in a newspaper of general circulation neither were they furnished to the University of the Philippines (U.P.)

Failure to comply therewith shall be a sufficient ground for the outright dismissal of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>However, it is also equally settled that while merely statutory in nature, the right to appeal is an essential part of our judicial system such that courts should proceed with caution so as not to deprive a party of the right to appeal, but rather, ensure that every party-litigant has the amplest opportunity for the proper and just disposition of his cause, freed from the constraints of technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The Court has thus pronounced that, before an appeal may be denied due course outright for lack of copies of essential pleadings and portions of the case record, the sufficiency of the documents actually accompanying the petition must be first assessed by the CA to determine whether they sufficiently substantiate the allegations in the petition. If they do, then the petitioner is deemed to have substantially complied with the rules.<br><br>In <i>Galvez v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> the Court held:<br><blockquote>[T]he mere failure to attach copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition for review is not necessarily fatal as to warrant the outright denial of due course when the clearly legible duplicate originals or true copies of the judgments or final orders of both lower courts, certified correct by the clerk of court of the RTC, and other attachments of the petition sufficiently substantiate the allegations.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x [T]he significant determinant of the sufficiency of the attached documents is whether the accompanying documents support the allegations of the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court espoused a similar reasoning in <i>Posadas-Moya and Associates Construction Co., Inc. v. Greenfield Development Corporation</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><blockquote>Without a doubt, the CA had sufficient basis to actually and completely dispose of the case. The other documents that respondents insist should have been appended to the Petition will not necessarily determine whether the CA can properly decide the case. Besides, these documents were already part of the records of this case and could have easily been referred to by the appellate court if necessary.<br><br>Time and time again, this Court has reiterated the doctrine that the rules of procedure are mere tools intended to facilitate rather than to frustrate the attainment of justice. A strict and rigid application of the rules must always be eschewed if it would subvert their primary objective of enhancing fair trials and expediting justice. Technicalities should never be used to defeat the substantive rights of the other party. Parties or litigants must be accorded the amplest opportunity for the proper and just determination of their causes, free from the constraints of technicalities.<br><br>In denying due course to the Petition, the appellate court gave premium to form and failed to consider the important rights of the parties. At the very least, petitioner substantially complied with the procedural requirements of Section 6 of Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (Citation omitted)<br></blockquote>The Court also adjudged the petitioner in <i>Silverio v.

In short, the failure to attach the MTC decision did not adversely affect the sufficiency of the petition because it was, in any event, accompanied by the RTC decision sought to be reviewed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>National Homing Authority v.

Only those which are relevant and pertinent must accompany it. The test of relevancy is whether the document in question will support the material allegations in the petition, whether said document will make out a <i>prima facie</i> case of grave abuse of discretion as to convince the court to give due course to the petition.<br><br><i>Second</i>, even if a document is relevant and pertinent to the petition, it need not be appended if it is shown that the contents thereof can also be found in another document already attached to the petition. Thus, if the material allegations in a position paper are summarized in a questioned judgment, it will suffice that only a certified true copy of the judgment is attached.<br><br><i>Third</i>, a petition lacking an essential pleading or part of the case record may still be given due course or reinstated (if earlier dismissed) upon showing that the petitioner later submitted the documents required, or that it will serve the higher interest of justice that the case be decided on the merits.<br><br>According to the CA, without the petition filed before the ERB, the responsive pleadings thereto and other supporting documents, it had no basis to determine whether NEECO I's appeal was impressed with merit or not.<br><br>The Court disagrees. A scrutiny of the ERC issuances annexed to NEECO I's petition with the CA shows that they were ample enough to enable the appellate court to still act on the appeal despite.the deficient pleadings and documents. The ERC Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated February 19, 1997 confirmed the background facts of the case as alleged in NEECO I's petition. The Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated July 27, 2006, substantially summarized the ERC policy on PPA confirmation process upon which the factual findings on NEECO I's over-recoveries were based. The rest of the attached issuances<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> extensively recapitulated the events preceding the controversy elevated to the CA. These attachments adequately provided the CA with the necessary information it needed to pass upon assigned errors in NEECO I's appeal and to determine their merit <i>sans</i> the initiatory pleadings and documents from the defunct ERB. The CA thus committed grave error in denying the appeal and depriving NEECO I the right to be heard.<br><br>The CA likewise erred in concluding that CLECA had to be impleaded as a respondent to the petition. The rulings for which the CA's review was sought were issued by the ERC and not CLECA, which was the representative organization of NEECO I in the ERC proceedings. Also, to include CLECA as a petitioner or even to furnish it with a copy of the CA petition was unnecessary since the ERC Orders dated July 27, 2006 and May 9, 2007 only concerned NEECO I and not all of the rural electric cooperatives in Central Luzon as represented by CLECA.<br><br>Although the subsequent procedural step will be a remand of the case to the CA, it will be more judicious to resolve the substantive merits of NEECO I's appeal in present recourse in view of the Court's supervening pronouncements in the ASTEC case and in <i>Surigao del Norte Electric Coop., Inc. (SURNECO) v. ERC</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> involving rural electric cooperatives similarly ordered by the ERC to refund their over-recoveries based on the same ERC policy on PPA confirmation process as laid down in its Orders dated June 17, 2003 and January 14, 2005. The arguments advanced by NEECO I in support of its averment of nullity, of the ERC Orders dated July 27, 2006 and May 9, 2007 were already exhaustively traversed and definitively settled by the Court in the said cases.<br><br><u>On the use of the multiplier scheme as a method to recover system loss</u><br><br>In <i>SURNECO</i>, the Court held that NEA Memorandum No. 1-A which authorized rural electric cooperatives to use the multiplier scheme as a method to recover system loss was a mere administrative issuance that cannot prevail against and is deemed repealed by the legislative enactment in Section 10 of R.A. No. 7832 imposing caps on the recoverable rate of system loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>The Court also held that Section 10 of R.A. No. 7832 was self-executory and did not require the issuance of enabling set of rules or any action by the ERC. The caps should have therefore been applied as of January 17, 1995 when R.A. No. 7832 took effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>NEECO I cannot thus insist on the continued validity of the multiplier scheme it has been adopting pursuant to the NEA Memorandum No. 1-A.<br><br><u>On whether Section 10 of R.A. No. 7832 was superseded and repealed by EPIRA Law</u><br><br>NEECO I anchored its argument on Section 43(f) of the EPIRA Law which reads:<br><blockquote>In the public interest, establish and enforce a methodology for setting transmission and distribution wheeling rates and retail rates for the captive market of a distribution utility, taking into account all relevant considerations, including the efficiency or inefficiency of the regulated entities. The rates must be such as to allow the recovery of just and reasonable costs and a reasonable return on rate base (RORB) to enable the entity to operate viably. The ERC may adopt alternative forms of internationally-accepted rate-setting methodology as it may deem appropriate. The rate-setting methodology so adopted and applied must ensure a reasonable price of electricity. The rates prescribed shall be non-discriminatory. <b>To achieve this objective and to ensure the complete removal of cross subsidies, the cap on the recoverable rate of system losses prescribed in Section 10 of [R.A.] No. 7832, is hereby amended and shall be replaced by caps which shall be determined by the ERC based on load density, sales mix, cost of service, delivery voltage and other technical considerations it may promulgate.</b> The ERC shall determine such form or rate-setting methodology, which shall promote efficiency. x x x (Emphasis ours)<br></blockquote>The Court interpreted the provision in <i>SURNECO</i> to mean that the EPIRA Law actually allowed the caps imposed by Section 10 of R.A. No. 7832 to remain until they are replaced by the ERC pursuant to its delegated authority to prescribe new system loss caps, based on technical parameters such as load density, sales mix, cost of service, delivery voltage, and other technical considerations it may promulgate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>The imposable system loss caps are thus within the discretion of the ERC and, until and unless it decrees new caps, those imposed by Section 10 of R.A. No. 7832 shall subsist. From the provision, it can also be deduced that the ERC, upon evaluating the technical parameters stated in Section 43 of EPIRA Law, may actually adopt and maintain the prevailing caps in Section 10 of R.A. No. 7832 if it finds them consistent with its mandate to ensure reasonable rates of electricity.<br><br><u>On whether: (a) the cap on the recoverable rate of system loss prescribed in Section 10 of R.A. No. 7832 is arbitrary and violative of the non-impairment clause; and (b) the PPA computation based on the cost of power net of discount is illegal and unconstitutional for being an unlawful taking of property</u><br><br>The regulation of rates imposed by public utilities such as electricity distributors is an exercise of the State's police power. The Court reiterated this tenet in <i>SURNECO</i>, thus:<br><blockquote>The regulation of rates to be charged by public utilities is founded upon the police powers of the State and statutes prescribing rules for the control and regulation of public utilities are a valid exercise thereof. When private property is used for a public purpose and is affected with public interest, it ceases to be <i>juris privati</i> only and becomes subject to regulation. The regulation is to promote the common good. Submission to regulation may be withdrawn by the owner by discontinuing use; but as long as use of the property is continued, the same is subject to public regulation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>As the State agency mandated to regulate and to approve rates imposed by electric cooperatives, the ERC merely exercised its task of protecting the public interest imbued in the rates imposed by NEECO I when it directed the latter to refund its over-recoveries to its consumers. The ERC was ensuring that the PPA mechanism remains a purely cost-recovery mechanism and not a revenue-generating scheme for the electric cooperatives,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> which are organized under P.D. No. 269 to engage in the distribution of electricity on a <b>non-profit basis</b>.<br><br>Verily then, no unlawful taking of property can also result from the imposition of the "net of discount" principle in the PPA computation as it merely preserves the true nature of the PPA formula as an adjustment mechanism strictly for the purpose of recovering the costs actually incurred in the purchase of electricity.<br><br>"[I]f the PPA is computed without factoring the discounts given by power suppliers to electric cooperatives, electric cooperatives will impermissibly retain or even earn from the implementation of the PPA."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>The Court articulated this fact in <i>ASTEC</i>, and held that the nature of the PPA formula precludes an interpretation that includes discounts in the computation of the cost of purchased power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Rural electric cooperatives cannot therefore incorporate in the PPA formula costs that they did not incur. Consumers must not shoulder the gross cost of purchased power; otherwise, rural electric cooperatives will unjustly profit from discounts extended to them by power suppliers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>The police power of the State to regulate the rates imposed by public utilities is also the same reason why the caps set in R.A. No. 7832 cannot be deemed to have impaired the loan agreement between NEA and the Asian Development Bank imposing a 15% system loss cap and providing a "power cost adjustment clause." All private contracts must yield to the superior and legitimate measures taken by the State to promote public welfare. The police power legislation adopted by the State in R.A. No. 7832 to promote the general welfare of the people must imperatively prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><u>On whether NEECO I was deprived of due process</u><br><br>The Court has resolved in <i>SURNECO</i> that the ERC observed administrative due process when it enjoined electric cooperatives to refund their over-recoveries. They were duly informed of the need for their monthly documentary submissions and were allowed to submit them accordingly. Hearings and exit conferences with the representatives of electric cooperatives were also conducted. These conferences entailed discussions on preliminary figures and their further verification to determine and correct any inaccuracies. The electric cooperatives were also allowed to file motions for reconsideration of the ERC orders respectively directing them to make the refunds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> The Court thus emphasized that:<br><blockquote>Administrative due process simply requires an opportunity to explain one's side or to seek reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of. It means being given the opportunity to be heard before judgment, and for this purpose, a formal trial-type hearing is not even essential. It is enough that the parties are given a fair and reasonable chance to demonstrate their respective positions and to present evidence in support thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>NEECO I underwent the same administrative procedure and was accorded similar opportunities to present its side and objections. It attended the conferences conducted by the ERC on January 8, 2004 and on November 8, 2005.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> It was also allowed to file documentary submissions and seek a reconsideration of the ERC Order dated July 27, 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br><u>On whether the ERC Orders dated June 17, 2003 and January 14, 2005 as supplements to the IRR of R.A. No. 7832 were void because they were not published in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation</u><br><br>The Court held in <i>ASTEC</i> that the ERC Orders dated June 17, 2003 and January 14, 2005 containing the policy guidelines on the treatment of discounts extended by power suppliers did not: modify, amend or supplant R.A.

However, by way of exception, interpretative regulations need not comply with the publication requirement set forth in Section 18, Chapter 5, Book I,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> and the filing requirement in Sections 3 and 4, Chapter 2, Book VII,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> of the Administrative Code. Interpretative regulations add nothing to the law and do not affect substantial rights of any person;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> hence, in this case, they need to be subjected to the procedural due process of publication or filing before electric cooperatives may be ordered to abide by them.<br><br><u>On whether the PPA formula was invalid for having been applied retroactively</u><br><br>This issue was likewise comprehensively settled in <i>ASTEC</i>, in this wise:<br><blockquote>Petitioners further assert that the policy guidelines are invalid for having been applied retroactively. According to petitioners, the ERC applied the policy guidelines to periods of PPA implementation prior to the issuance of its 14 January 2005 Order. x x x [B]asic [is the] rule "that no statute, decree, ordinance, rule or regulation (or even policy) shall be given retrospective effect unless explicitly stated so." A law is retrospective if it "takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation and imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in respect of transactions or consideration already past."<br><br>The policy guidelines of the ERC on the treatment of discounts extended by power suppliers are not retrospective. The policy guidelines did not take away or impair any vested rights of the rural electric cooperatives. The usage and implementation of the PPA formula were provisionally approved by the ERB in its Orders dated 19 February 1997 and 25 April 1997. The said Orders specifically stated that the provisional approval of the PPA formula was subject to review, verification and confirmation by the ERB. Thus, the rural electric cooperatives did not acquire any vested rights in the usage and implementation of the provisionally approved PPA formula.<br><br>Furthermore, the policy guidelines of the LiRC did not create a new obligation and impose a new duty, nor did it attach a new disability. x x x [T]he policy guidelines merely interpret R.A. No. 7832 and its IRR, particularly on the computation of the cost of purchased power. The policy guidelines did not modify, amend or supplant the IRR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote><b>NEECO I is, nevertheless, entitled to a re-computation of its over-recoveries.</b><br><br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount of over-recoveries ascertained by the ERC must be re-computed in view of the invalid grossed-up factor mechanism utilized in the ERC Order dated July 27, 2006, which states that one cause of the over-recovery was the failure of NEECO I to use the new grossed-up factor mechanism adopted by the ERC which provided a true-up mechanism that allows the DUs to recover the actual cost of purchased power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>This is pursuant to the Court's findings in <i>ASTEC</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote>[T]he grossed-up factor mechanism <b>amends</b> the IRR of R.A. No. 7832 as it serves as an <b>additional numerical standard</b> that must be observed and applied by rural electric cooperatives in the implementation of the PPA. While the IRR explains, and stipulates, the PPA formula, the IRR neither explains nor stipulates the grossed-up factor mechanism. The reason is that the grossed-up factor mechanism is admittedly "<b>new</b>" and provides a "<b>different result</b>," having been formulated only <b><i>after</i></b> the issuance of the IRR.<br><br>The grossed-up factor mechanism is not the same as the PPA formula provided in the IRR of R.A. No. 7832. Neither is the grossed-up factor mechanism subsumed in any of the five variables of the PPA formula. Although both the grossed-up factor mechanism and the PPA formula account for system loss and use of electricity by cooperatives, they serve different quantitative purposes.<br><br>The grossed-up factor mechanism serves as a threshold amount to which the PPA formula is to be compared. According to the ERC, any amount collected under the PPA that exceeds the Recoverable Cost computed under the grossed-up factor mechanism shall be refunded to the consumers. The Recoverable Cost computed under the grossed-Up factor mechanism is "the maximum allowable cost to be recovered from the electric cooperative's customers for a given month." <b>In effect, the PPA alone does not serve as the variable rate to he collected from the consumers.</b> The PPA formula and the grossed-up factor mechanism will both have to be observed and applied in the implementation of the PPA.<br><br>Furthermore, the grossed-up factor mechanism accounts for a variable that is not included in the five variables of the PPA formula. In particular, the grossed-up factor mechanism accounts for the amount of power sold in proportion to the amount of power purchased by a rural electric cooperative, expressed as the Gross-Up Factor. It appears that the Gross-Up Factor limits the Recoverable Cost by allowing recovery of the Cost of Purchased Power only in proportion to the amount of power sold. This is shown by integrating the formula of the Gross-Up Factor with the formula of the Recoverable Cost, thus:<br><br>The grossed-up factor mechanism consists of the following formulas:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="10%">&nbsp;</td><td width="20%"><div align="center"><em><b>Kwh Sales + Coop Use</b></em></div></td><td width="70%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><em><b>Gross-Up Factor</b></em> =</td><td><div align="center">----------------------------------------</div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="center"><em><b>Kwh Purchased (1-% System Loss)</b></em></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote><b>Recoverable Cost = Gross-Up Factor x Cost of Purchased Power</b><br><br>Integrating the above-stated formulas will result in the following formula:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="10%">&nbsp;</td><td width="21%"><div align="center"><strong><em>Kwh Sales + Coop Use</em></strong></div></td><td width="1%">&nbsp;</td><td width="68%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><span class="style1">Recoverable Cost</span> =</td><td><div align="center">----------------------------------------</div></td><td>x</td><td><em><strong>Cost of Purchased Power</strong></em></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="center"><strong><em>Kwh Purchased (1-% System Loss)</em></strong></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>On the other hand, the PPA formula provided in the IRR of R.A. No. 7832 does not account for the amount of power sold. It accounts for the amount of power purchased and generated, expressed as the variable "B" in the following PPA formula:<br><br>Purchased Power Adjustment Clause<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="5%">&nbsp;</td><td width="2%">&nbsp;</td><td width="14%"><div align="center"><em>A</em></div></td><td width="79%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>(PPA)</td><td>=</td><td><div align="center">----------------------------</div></td><td>- <em>E</em> </td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="center"><em>B - (C + D)</em></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Where:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="4%"><div align="justify">A </div></td><td width="3%"><div align="justify">= </div></td><td width="93%"><div align="justify">Cost of electricity purchased and generated for the previous month</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">B</div></td><td><div align="justify">= </div></td><td><div align="justify"> <b>Total Kwh purchased and generated for the previous month</b></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">C </div></td><td><div align="justify">=</div></td><td><div align="justify"> The actual system loss but not to exceed the maximum recoverable rate of system loss in Kwh plus actual company use in Kwhrs but not to exceed 1% of total Kwhrs purchased and generated</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">D</div></td><td><div align="justify">= </div></td><td><div align="justify"> Kwh consumed by subsidized consumers</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">E</div></td><td><div align="justify">= </div></td><td><div align="justify"> Applicable base cost of power equal to the amount incorporated into their basic rate per Kwh</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In light of these, the grossed-up factor mechanism does not merely interpret R.A. No. 7832 or its IRR. It is also not merely internal in nature. <b>The grossed-up factor mechanism amends the IRR by providing an additional numerical standard that must be observed and applied in the implementation of the PPA.</b> The grosscd-up factor mechanism is therefore an administrative rule that should be published and submitted to the U.P. Law Center in order to be effective.<br><br>x x x [Since] it does not appear from the records that the grossed-up factor mechanism was published and submitted to the U.P. Law Center[,] x x x it is ineffective and may not serve as a basis for the computation of over-recoveries. The portions of the over-recoveries arising from the application of the mechanism are therefore invalid.<br><br>Furthermore, the application of the grossed-up factor mechanism to periods of PPA implementation prior to its publication and disclosure renders the said mechanism invalid for having been applied retroactively. The grossed-up factor mechanism imposes an additional numerical standard that clearly "creates a new obligation and imposes a new duty xxx in respect of transactions or consideration already past."<br><br>Rural electric cooperatives cannot be reasonably expected to comply with and observe the grossed-up factor mechanism without its publication. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> (Citations omitted and emphasis in the original)<br><br>The principle of <i>stare decisis</i> enjoins adherence to the foregoing judicial precedents set forth in <i>ASTEC</i> and <i>SURNECO</i>.
