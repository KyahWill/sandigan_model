This would entail compliance with the strict requirements under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. Aggrieved parties would have to prove that the order was issued without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction and that there is neither appeal nor any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>This notwithstanding, a special civil action for certiorari is not the only remedy that aggrieved parties may take against an interlocutory order, since an interlocutory order may be appealed in an appeal of the judgment itself.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> In <i>Investments, Inc. v.

It did not finally dispose of the case because the appellate court still had to determine whether the deeds of sale executed by Anatolia were valid. Rather than availing of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari under Rule 65, petitioners opted to wait for the Court of Appeals to render its decision before challenging the July 25, 2006 Resolution.<br><br>Petitioners did not commit any procedural infirmity in assailing the interlocutory order in an appeal of the Court of Appeals' decision. Though petitioners could have filed a petition for certiorari, they would have been burdened to prove that the Court of Appeals: committed grave abuse of discretion in denying their motion to remand. Moreover, petitioners still had the option to assail the July 25, 2006 Resolution in an appeal of the Court of Appeals' final decision.<br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br><br>As regards the first substantive issue raised, this Court finds that the Court of Appeals correctly treated petitioners' motion to remand as a motion for new trial under Rule 53 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Essentially, petitioners sought the introduction of evidence pursuant to the Court of Appeals' expanded power under Section 9 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, as amended.<br><br>Originally, Section 9, of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, otherwise known as Judiciary Reorganization Act, provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 9. <i>Jurisdiction.</i> — The Intermediate Appellate Court shall exercise:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">(1)</div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Original jurisdiction to issue writs of <i>mandamus, </i>prohibition, <i>certiorari, habeas corpus, </i>and <i>quo warranto, </i>and auxiliary writs or processes, whether or not in aid of its appellate jurisdiction;</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(2)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Exclusive original jurisdiction ,over actions for annulment of judgments of Regional Trial Courts; and</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(3)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">Exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders, or awards of Regional Trial Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards, or commissions, except those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution, the provisions of ,this Act, and of subparagraph (1) of the third paragraph and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948.</div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><br><b><i>The Intermediate Appellate Court shall have the power to try cases and conduct hearings, receive evidence and perform any and all acts necessary to resolve factual issues raised in cases falling within its original and appellate jurisdiction, including 'the power to grant and conduct new trials or further proceedings.</i></b><br><br>These provisions shall not apply to decisions and interlocutory orders issued under the Labor Code of the Philippines and by the Central Board of Assessment Appeals.

In <i>Maralit v. Philippine National Bank: </i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In a special civil action for certiorari, the Court of Appeals has ample authority to receive new evidence and perform any act necessary to resolve factual issues. Section 9 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, as amended, states that, "The Court of Appeals shall have the power to try cases and conduct hearings, receive evidence and perform any and all acts necessary to resolve factual issues raised in cases falling within its original and appellate jurisdiction, including the power to grant and conduct new trials or further proceedings."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> (Emphasis omitted)<br></blockquote><br>Thus, the 2009 Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> provide:<br><br><blockquote><blockquote>SECTION 3. <i>Power of the Court to Receive Evidence. – <b>The Court may receive evidence in the following cases:</b></i><br><br><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">(a)</div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY"><b><i>In actions falling within its original jurisdiction, such as: (1) certiorari, prohibition and mandamus under Rules 46 and 65 of the Rules of Court;</i></b> (2) annulment of judgment or final order; (3) quo <i>warranto; </i> (4) <i>habeas corpus; </i> (5) <i>amparo; </i>(6) <i>habeas data; </i>(7) <i>anti-money laundering </i>and (8) <i>application for judicial authorization under the Human Security Act of 2007. </i>(Emphasis supplied) </div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote></blockquote><br><br>As may be gleaned from above, in actions falling within the original jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, such as a special civil action for certiorari, the Court of Appeals' power to receive evidence is unqualified. This does not hold true with respect to appeals in civil cases, criminal cases, as well as appeals involving claims for damages.<br><br>In this case, petitioners filed an ordinary appeal from the Regional Trial Court's Decision dated February 16, 1996. At the time the Court of Appeals ruled on petitioners' motion to remand,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> the 2002 Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> was in effect:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 3. <i>Power of the Court to Receive Evidence. </i>- The Court may receive evidence in the following cases:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">(a)</div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">In actions falling within its original jurisdiction, such as: (1) <i>certiorari, prohibition </i>and <i>mandamus </i>under Rules 46 and 65 of the Rules of Court; (2) action for annulment of judgment or final order under Rule 46 of the Rules of Court; (3) quo <i>warranto </i>under Rule 66 of the Rules of Court; (4) <i>habeas corpus </i>under Sections 2 and 12, Rule 102 of the Rules of Court;</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(b)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"><b><i>In appeals in civil cases where the court grants a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence pursuant to Sec. 3, Rule 53 of the Rules of Court;</i></b></div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(c)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">In appeals in criminal cases where the court grants a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence pursuant to Section 12, Rule 124 of the Rules of Court; and</div> </td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(d)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">In appeals involving claims for: damages arising from provisional remedies.

The Court of Appeals cannot simply accept additional evidence from the parties. If the interpretation were otherwise, then there would be no end to litigation.<br><br>Hence, in appeals in civil cases, the Court of Appeals may only receive evidence when it grants a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.<br><br>This notwithstanding, the Court of Appeals cannot accept any kind of evidence in a motion for new trial. A motion for new trial under Rule 53 is limited to newly discovered evidence:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Period for filing; ground. </i>– At any time after the appeal from the lower court has been perfected and before the Court of Appeals loses jurisdiction over the case, a party may file a motion for new trial <b><i>on the ground of newly discovered evidence which could not have been discovered prior to the trial in the court below by the exercise of due diligence and which is of such character as would probably change the result. </i></b>The motion shall be accompanied by affidavits showing the facts constituting the grounds therefor and the newly discovered evidence. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>The document petitioners seek to present before the appellate court does not fall under the concept of newly discovered evidence.<br><br>Newly discovered evidence has a specific meaning under the law. Under Rule 53 of the Rules of Court, the following criteria must be satisfied for evidence to be considered newly discovered: (a) the evidence could not have been discovered prior to the trial in the court below by exercise of due diligence; and (2) it is of such character as would probably change the result.<br><br>The document denominated as Confirmation of Previous Sales was allegedly executed on January 15, 1998, three years after the Regional Trial Court rendered its decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Hence, it could not have been discovered by petitioners prior to trial by the exercise of due diligence.<br><br>However, the document is not of such character that would probably change the lower court's judgment. The nature of the deeds of sale executed would not have been affected even if the Confirmation of Previous Sales was admitted in evidence since the validity of a contract is determined by law and not by the stipulation of the parties. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals can determine whether the deeds of sale were valid independent of said document. Thus, the Court of Appeals correctly denied petitioners' motion to have the Confirmation of Previous Sales admitted in evidence.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
