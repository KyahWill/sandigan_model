Moreover, they claimed to have been in possession of the subject premises since 1968 or some 35 years ago, thus plaintiffs action cannot be one for ejectment or unlawful detainer, but <i>accion publiciana</i> which must be filed before the RTC.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, Ho, Returta, Salas, and Malonzo, herein respondents, maintained that they have been in possession of the subject premises for 37 years without any rentals being paid to any landlord or his agents, and that there are no existing lease contracts between respondents and petitioners. In fact, in separate letters to petitioners, in response to the latter's demand letters, respondents categorically denied renting the subject premises.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Respondents also asserted that they have started possessing said property in 1966 by building residential houses, and that they have been in continuous possession since then. Additionally, respondents claimed that petitioners presented only photocopies of the subject TCTs and that when they presented such to the Register of Deeds of Quezon City for verification as to how such were transferred from the mother titles TCT Nos. 12505 and 12506, said office informed them that there is no single transaction recorded in the aforesaid mother titles.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Lastly, respondents argued that even assuming that petitioners' titles are authentic, their cause of action should have been <i>accion publiciana </i>considering that respondents are in possession and that no lease contract exists between the parties.<br><br>After trial, the MeTC-Branch 40, Quezon City ruled in favor of petitioners. As regards defendants, the MeTC held that they impliedly admitted the existence of lease contracts between them and petitioners and, as such, they cannot deny the consequent lessor-lessee relationship following the rule that a tenant is not permitted to deny the title of his landlord. As regards respondents, on the other hand, the MeTC ruled that since petitioners were able to show that the property in question was registered under their name, and since respondents merely denied the existence of a lessor-lessee relationship between them and petitioners, petitioners' averments must prevail following the tenet that in weighing contradictory declarations and statements, greater weight must generally be given to positive testimony.<br><br>Thus, the MeTC disposed of the case in this manner:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the herein plaintiffs TAN S1U KUAN &amp;

According to the RTC, the "defendant's common defense is that the complaint states no cause of action against them on the grounds that plaintiffs are [C]hinese nationals, hence, not entitled to own real properties in the Philippines; occupancy since 1968, hence, the action should have been <i>accion publiciana</i>; and absence of lessor/lessee relationship."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Said court then went on to address these issues, as follows: "Relative to the first three assigned errors, the Court finds that the matters have been thoroughly and judiciously passed upon by the court <i>a quo</i> in arriving at the subject decision, hence, this Court finds no compelling reason to disturb the same."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Thus, the RTC ruled:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In sum, the Court finds no reversible error in the decision of the court <i>a quo </i>and hereby affirms the same <i>en toto</i>.<br><br>Costs against the defendant. SO ORDERED.<br></blockquote><br>On motion, the RTC issued a Writ of Execution dated January 16, 2006.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> On February 24, 2006, the subject premises were turned over to petitioners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, on November 18, 2005, respondents timely filed their appeal before the CA, questioning the jurisdiction of the MeTC over the consolidated cases, the finding of a lessor-lessee relationship between petitioners and respondents in. violation of the principle of <i>res inter alios acta,</i> and the non-dismissal of the case despite the failure of petitioners and their counsel to attend the pre-trial conference.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Petitioners, on the other hand, averred that the assailed decision has already become final and executory for failure to file the Joint Motion for Reconsideration of the RTC Decision within the prescribed period and, in fact, a writ of execution has already been issued. Alternatively, they argued that since respondents refused to pay their rentals from 1997 to present, and since non-payment of rent is a valid ground for ejectment, then the lower courts were correct in ruling in their favor.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>After evaluating the merits of the case, the CA reversed the RTC. Although the CA upheld the jurisdiction of the MeTC, saying that the allegations in the complaints make a case for unlawful detainer and that the complaints were filed within one year from respondents' receipt of the demand letters, it nevertheless agreed with respondents that petitioners have materially failed to prove their right to eject respondents on the strength of being lessors. Moreover, the CA sustained respondents' invocation of the principle of <i>res inter alios acta.</i><br><br>Thus, the CA held:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the <i>Consolidated Decision</i> dated May 6, 2005 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 87, Quezon City is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE.</b> In its stead, a <b>new one is entered</b> dismissing the actions for unlawful detainer for lack of merit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (Citation omitted.)<br></blockquote><br><u><center><b>The Present Petition</b></center></u><br><br>Petitioners filed the present petition for review on<i> certiorari</i>, raising the following issues:<br><br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li> THE CONSOLIDATED DECISION DATED 6 MAY 2005 OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY BRANCH 87 IN CIVIL CASE NOS. 04-53507, 53508, 04-53510 and 04-53511, WHICH AFFIRMED IN TOTO THE EARLIER JOINT DECISION DATED 8 JULY 2004 OF THE METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT, QUEZON CITY IN CIVIL CASE NOS. 30272 TO 30278 HAD BECOME FINAL AND EXECUTORY FOR FAILURE OF RESPONDENTS TO FILE THEIR JOINT MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION WITHIN THE REGLEMENTARY PERIOD OF FIFTEEN (15) DAYS FROM RECEIPT OF THE DECISION.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br></li><li>THE TENANCY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PETITIONERS AND RESPONDENTS WAS PROPERLY ESTABLISHED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><br><u><center><b>The Ruling of the Court</b></center></u><br><br>Petitioners' arguments do not persuade.<br><br>Anent the first issue of whether the Joint Motion for Reconsideration of the RTC Decision was timely filed, a close review of the records yields the finding that it was.<br><br>Indeed, as capitalized on by petitioners, respondents stated in their Joint Motion for Reconsideration that they received the Decision dated May 6, 2005 on May 15, 2005, and that they filed the Joint Motion for Reconsideration only on June 29, 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> However, as explained by respondents, the statement that they received the RTC Decision on May 15, 2005 was inadvertent and erroneous.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The records, particularly the certified true copies of the registry return slips from the RTC,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> show that the RTC Decision was simultaneously mailed by the RTC to the parties only on June 7, 2005. Thus, as correctly maintained by respondents, they could not have received the RTC Decision on May 15, 2005 or before the said decision was mailed to them.&nbsp; Respondents then clarified that they received the RTC Decision on June 15, 2005.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> As such, the filing of the Joint Motion for Reconsideration on June 29, 2005 was timely and the RTC Decision was not yet final and executory.<br><br>As to the second issue of whether a lessor-lessee relationship between the parties was properly established, the evidence on record generates a negative conclusion.<br><br>Except for petitioners' bare claims, they have not shown any evidence of a lease between them and respondents, be it express or implied. As keenly observed by the CA, there was no mention of how and when the alleged contract of lease started, there was no proof of prior payment of rentals or any prior demand for such payment considering petitioners' allegation that respondents failed to pay rentals since 1997 and that the case was instituted only in 2003.<br><br>Moreover, there is merit in respondents' invocation of the principle of <i>res inter alios acta </i>or that principle which states that "the right of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration or omission of another, except as hereinafter provided, among which are: (1) admission by third party, (2) admission by co-partner or agent, (3) admission by conspirator, and (4) admission by privies."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In the case of <i>Tamargo v. Awingan</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Court expounded on the rationale behind the principle of res inter alios acta. Citing<i> People v. vda. De Ramos</i>, the Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>(O)n a principle of good faith and mutual convenience, a man's own acts are binding upon himself, and are evidence against him. So are his conduct and declarations. Yet it would not only be rightly inconvenient, but also manifestly unjust, that a man should be bound by the acts of mere unauthorized strangers; and if a party ought not to be bound by the acts of strangers, neither ought their acts or conduct be used as evidence against him.<br></blockquote><br>In the present case, petitioners failed to establish that the defendants'<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> alleged implied admission of a lessor-lessee relationship falls under the exceptions to the principle of <i>res inter alios acta</i> as to make such admission binding upon respondents. Although defendants and respondents were all defendants in the complaints for unlawful detainer filed by petitioners, it is very clear that defendants and respondents espoused different defenses. Contrary to defendants' position, respondents, as early as the filing of their response to petitioners' demand letter, firmly and consistently denied the existence of any lease contract between them and petitioners over the subject land.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no reversible error in the assailed rulings, the Court resolves to <b>DENY</b> the present petition. Accordingly, the Decision dated June 29, 2006 and the Resolution dated October 17, 2006 of the Court of Appeals are hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b> and the complaints for unlawful detainer filed by petitioners Tan Siu Kuan and Pute Ching against respondents Felicisimo "Boy" Ho, Rodolfo Returta, Vicente Salas, and Lolita Malonzo are <b>DISMISSED.</b><br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Peralta,</i> and <i>Reyes,&nbsp; JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Jardeleza, J.</i>, on wellness leave.<br><br><hr align="CENTER" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><br><br><div align="right"><b><u>March 9, 2016</u></b><br></div><br><br><center><b>N O T I C E OF J U D G M E N T</b></center><br><br>Sirs/Mesdames:<br><br>Please take notice that on ___<u><b>June 1, 2016</b></u>___ a Decision, copy attached hereto, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on June 13, 2016 at 1:45 p.m.<br><br><br><center>Very truly yours,<br><b>(SGD)<br>WILFREDO V.
