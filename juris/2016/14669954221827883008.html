Calabocal (Judge Calabocal), Judge-Designate of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Roxas, Oriental Mindoro, Branch 43, and the Province of Oriental Mindoro and the Municipality of Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro (respondents).<br><br>The case before the Court stems from a dispute between the Province of Antique and the Province of Oriental Mindoro for "territorial jurisdiction, dominion, control and administration"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> over Liwagao Island,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> a 114-hectare island located between the two provinces.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> This dispute led to Civil Case No. C-566, a petition for "Recovery and Declaration of Political Jurisdiction/Dominion and Mandamus"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> filed by respondents against petitioners before the RTC of Roxas, Oriental Mindoro. Assailed in this petition are the Orders issued by Judge Calabocal on 23 April 2013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> denying petitioners' affirmative defense of lack of jurisdiction, and on 17 July 2013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> denying their subsequent motion for reconsideration.<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></center><br>Based on the petition filed by respondents before the RTC, sometime between the years 1978 and 1979, Dolores Bago (Mayor Bago), then Mayor of the Municipality of Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro, agreed to lend the administration of Liwagao Island to Oscar Lim (Mayor Lim), then Mayor of the Municipality of Caluya, Antique.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The agreement was made orally and without executing any formal documents to this effect. The condition attached to the agreement was that the island would be returned upon termination of either party's terms in office.<br><br>The terms of both mayors ended in 1987. Mayor Lim allegedly returned Liwagao Island to the Municipality of Bulalacao. However, the Municipality of Caluya continued to exercise administration over the island.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On 15 April 2002, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Oriental Mindoro passed a resolution confirming its jurisdictional rights and dominion over Liwagao Island.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> However, according to respondents, the Municipality of Caluya and the Province of Antique continued to claim and exercise authority over Liwagao Island.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Respondents claim that despite the fact that it is the Province of Oriental Mindoro and the Municipality of Bulalacao that provide government services to the island, petitioners "continued collecting real property taxes" from Liwagao's inhabitants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On 20 February 2012, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Oriental Mindoro passed Resolution No. 1454-2012 entitled <i>Resolution Calling for the Conduct of a Joint Session between the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of the Province of Oriental Mindoro and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of the Province of Antique for the Settlement of Jurisdictional Claim over the Island of Liwagao.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Upon receiving a copy of Resolution No. 1454-2012, the Vice Governor of Antique wrote the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Oriental Mindoro of her willingness to conduct a joint session to settle the boundary dispute. However, on 25 May 2012, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Antique issued Resolution No. 142-2012 informing Oriental Mindoro that it was not amenable to any form of settlement over the jurisdiction of Liwagao Island and asserted that the same rightfully belongs to their province.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Oriental Mindoro issued a resolution directing the Provincial Legal Office to file the necessary legal action to claim Liwagao Island.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Thus, on 12 September 2012, respondents filed their petition before the RTC of Roxas, Oriental Mindoro.<br><br>On the other hand, in their Answer before the RTC, petitioners claimed that "the maps of [NAMRIA] and DENR show Liwagao Island to be part of Caluya, Antique."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Petitioners asserted that "all national agencies of the government have always considered the island to be part of Caluya." Likewise, the people living there have always recognized Caluya's jurisdiction over the island as evidenced by the fact that they have "registered their births, paid real property taxes and voted in Caluya, Antique."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the same Answer, petitioners set up the defense of lack of jurisdiction of the RTC. They argued that "under Section 118, paragraph (c) of the Local Government Code, jurisdiction over boundary disputes between municipalities of different provinces is vested on the Sangguniang Panlalawigans of the provinces involved."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Orders of the RTC</u></b><br></center><br>The RTC issued the first of its assailed orders on 23 April 2013 ruling on the special and affirmative defenses invoked by the Province of Antique and the Municipality of Caluya. Specifically, petitioners argued that the case involved a boundary dispute that should have first been brought to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan concerned for settlement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The RTC disagreed:<br><blockquote>The respondent claimed that the subject government unit is a part of its territory. Clearly, the issue revolves and gravitates on who between the petitioner and respondent is the owner of sitio Liwagao, barangay Maasim, and not merely a boundary dispute because both parties claim the whole government unit of sitio Liwagao and not merely a part thereof to constitute it as boundary dispute to fall under Section 118, paragraph c of the Local Government Code.<br><br>The respondent claims that it should have been brought first to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan concern (sic) for settlement. The court is not in accord with such contention because the Sanggunian of Antique already issued Resolution No. 142-2012 dated May 25, 2012 to the effect that it categorically declared that the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Antique is not amenable to any form of settlement on the alleged dispute of jurisdiction or dominion over the Island of Liwagao. Such resolution of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Antique absolutely slammed or closed the door to any amicable settlement with the petitioners. Hence, the court believes that it would be an exercise in futility for the petitioners to agree with respondents' argument.<br><br>As correctly pointed out by Atty. Kristine Grace L. Suarez in her memorandum, that there is no law precluding a party to a case from availing of any legal remedies available. In this case, the petitioners logically opted to institute this case which is an action for recovery and declaration of jurisdiction/dominion.<br><br>ACCORDINGLY, the instant affirmative defense of lack of jurisdiction is hereby DENIED. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration. The RTC denied the motion in its second assailed Order of 17 July 2013, holding that:<br><blockquote>x x x The real issue in this case is not a boundary dispute between the petitioners and respondents but whether or not the former can recover back what it had lent to the latter. The respondents were just trying to complicate the issue by making it appear that it is a boundary dispute which it had already closed the door for any settlement.<br><br>Since time immemorial, Liwagao Island was under the peaceful and exclusive territorial and political jurisdiction by the Municipality of Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro. In fact, voluminous documents clearly show that Liwagao is within the Municipality of Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro. This alone strongly indicates that the issue in this case is not a boundary dispute because these documents indicate that Liwagao Island is within the Municipality of Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro. If it is true as claimed by the respondents that Liwagao Island is within its territorial and political jurisdiction, why would then Mayor Lim of Caluya, Antique still need to secure the consent of the then Mayor Bago of Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro to temporarily exercise jurisdiction over the Island of Liwagao. To the mind of this court, this is an admission on the part of the respondent that the subject island is within the Municipality of Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote><u><b>Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and TRO</b></u><br><br>Petitioners subsequently filed the present petition praying for:<br><blockquote>a) A temporary restraining order and writ of preliminary injunction be immediately issued enjoining all proceedings of the court a quo and of the respondent judge during the pendency of the case;<br><br>b) A writ of certiorari be issued, reversing the questioned Orders of the respondent judge dated April [23], 2013 and July 17, 2013 in Civil Case No. C-566, and dismissing Civil Case No. C-566, and<br><br>c) A writ of prohibition be issued permanently enjoining respondent judge from taking cognizance of this case[.]<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court, in a Resolution dated 14 October 2013, issued a temporary restraining order "enjoining the respondents, the RTC, Branch 43, Roxas, Oriental Mindoro, their representatives, agents or other persons acting on their behalf from further proceeding with the enforcement of the Orders dated 23 April 2013 and 17 July 2013 of the RTC, Branch 43, Roxas, Oriental Mindoro in Civil Case No. C-566 during the pendency of the instant case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Petitioners' Arguments</u></b><br></center><br>In the case at bar, petitioners aver that, <i>first</i>, the RTC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when it ruled that the case does not involve a boundary dispute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Petitioners insist that the case involves a boundary dispute, which simply refers to when "two entities disagree as to where the boundary between them lies."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> They further assert that "it does not matter whether what is involved in said dispute is the whole or only a part of a local government unit. What determines whether there is a boundary dispute is that there is disagreement as to whether the boundary lies between two territories."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, petitioners assert that the RTC erred in assuming jurisdiction over respondents' petition because "the Sangguniang Panlalawigans of both the provinces of Antique and Oriental Mindoro, sitting jointly, have primary, original and exclusive jurisdiction over this boundary dispute."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> They contend that under the Local Government Code, "a boundary dispute between municipalities of different provinces shall be referred first for settlement to the sanggunians of the provinces jointly" and if no settlement is reached, the case shall be jointly tried by the sanggunians concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> After trial, the aggrieved party may appeal the decision to the RTC having jurisdiction over the area.<br><br><i>Third</i>, petitioners argue that the "RTC only has jurisdiction over an appeal from the decision of the Sangguniang Panlalawigans in a boundary dispute in accordance with Sec. 119 of the Local Government Code." They aver that the petition filed with the RTC was not an appeal but an original complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> which alleges that the parties concerned failed to settle the dispute. It is clear, petitioners claim, that "the respondents brought this action in the RTC as a result of the failure of settlement between the parties, not as an appeal from a decision of both the Sangguniang Panlalawigans of Antique and Oriental Mindoro."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><i>Lastly</i>, the RTC "cannot exercise appellate jurisdiction over [respondents' petition] since there was no petition [for the adjudication of the boundary dispute] that was filed and decided by the Sangguniang Panlalawigans of Antique and Oriental Mindoro."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Such petition should be in the form of a resolution and filed with either of the two sanggunians.

Nothing in this provision excludes a dispute over an island. So long as the island is being claimed by different local government units, there exists a boundary dispute.<br><br>The allegations in the complaint filed before the RTC point to a boundary dispute, as defined under the Local Government Code.<br><br>Respondents are asserting their lawful jurisdiction over Liwagao Island as against another local government unit that currently has jurisdiction over the same. Therefore, whether the case is denominated as recovery of possession or claim of ownership, respondents' objective is the same: for respondents to regain their alleged territorial jurisdiction over Liwagao Island.<br><br>Respondent Province of Oriental Mindoro itself acknowledges that the conflict is a "boundary row" between itself and the Province of Antique.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> As stated in Resolution No. 1454-2012, the Province of Oriental Mindoro claims to "adhere to the basic principle of amicably settling said boundary dispute, as laid down in the provision of the Local Government Code of 1991[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>Thus, they are bound by their own assertions and cannot now claim that the conflict does not involve a boundary dispute.<br><br><center><b>Settlement of Boundary Disputes Governed By Local Government Code of 1991</b><br></center><br>Having established that the case involves a boundary dispute, the procedure to resolve the same is that established under the Local Government Code.
