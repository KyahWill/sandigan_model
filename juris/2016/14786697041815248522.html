The trial court did not give much credence to his denial in the light of AAA's positive declaration that Librias had held her against her will and raped her. Accordingly, applying Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, the RTC imposed the more serious penalty for rape, which is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, and ordered him to pay AAA P50,000.00 for civil indemnity and P15,000.00 for moral damages.<br><br>On appeal, the CA affirmed Librias' conviction <i>in toto</i> after finding no compelling reason to depart from the factual findings of the trial court. Simply, it held that AAA's version of what transpired was more credible and believable. The appellate court was likewise not persuaded by Librias' assertion that AAA could have easily shouted for help because her reaction to the force and intimidation could have varied and that she could have been paralyzed with fear. Like the trial court, the CA found Librias' denial unacceptable considering that denial is an inherently weak defense, and that it was not buttressed by strong evidence of non-culpability.<br><br><center><b>OUR RULING</b><br></center><br>We hold that the accused should be acquitted.<br><br>By their very nature, crimes against chastity, as well as the crime of rape, usually involve only two persons: the victim-complainant and the alleged offender. As a consequence, the conviction or acquittal of the accused depends almost entirely on the credibility of the complainant's testimony as seldom is there an eyewitness, other than those involved, to the commission of the offense. It is for this reason that we should examine with greatest care the complainant's story and subject it to a thorough scrutiny to determine its veracity <i>in the light of human nature and experience</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Aballe</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> we said:<br><blockquote>It is the peculiarity of rape cases that conviction or acquittal of the accused depends almost entirely on the credibility of the complaining witness. It may well then be that the testimony of the victim, to bear upon its face the brand of moral certainty demanded by the due process clause, <b>must involve <u>a narrative that is plausible</u> under the circumstances as recounted before the court</b>. The mere fact that there are contradictions and inconsistencies in her testimony will not in itself acquit an accused as long as the story of the complaining witness is not inherently impossible or suspect of prejudice and ill motive. Still and all, credence should only be given to trustworthy testimonies capable of supporting a guilty verdict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> [emphasis and underscoring ours]<br></blockquote>We likewise emphasized in <i>People v. Fabito</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> that in reviewing rape cases on appeal, we consider the reality that rape is a very serious accusation and, at the same time, a charge is not that hard to lay against another, to <i>wit</i>:<br><blockquote>The review of a criminal case opens up the case in its entirety. The totality of the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defense are weighed, thus, avoiding general conclusions based on isolated pieces of evidence. <i>In the case of rape, a review begins with the reality that rape is a very serious accusation that is painful to make; at the same time, it is a charge that is not hard to lay against another by one with malice in her mind.</i> Because of the private nature of the crime that justifies the acceptance of the lone testimony of a credible victim to convict, it is not easy for the accused, although innocent, to disprove his guilt. These realities compel us to approach with great caution and to scrutinize the statements of a victim on whose sole testimony conviction or acquittal depends.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> [citations omitted; italics ours]<br></blockquote>Contrary to the findings of the lower courts, we find AAA's testimony - which the prosecution heavily relied on - that raise serious doubts in the truthfulness of her statements.<br><br>We are reminded that the quantum of proof required in criminal cases is proof beyond reasonable doubt in order to convict the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Because of the constitutional presumption of innocence, the burden, therefore, lies with the prosecution to meet this quantum of proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> In the case at bar, the prosecution failed to discharge this burden since AAA's testimony was not credible enough to establish with moral certainty that Librias abducted AAA and raped her.<br><br><i>First</i>, AAA's narration that Librias forcibly took her from Mandaue Plaza to a house on Colon Street, Cebu City, is very unlikely considering that AAA could have easily escaped or, at least, have called for help. After reviewing the records of the case, we discovered that Librias did not have a weapon nor did he threaten to use one should AAA not accede to his demands. Without a weapon of any sort, AAA could have broken free and run away - without any risk to her life - as the plaza was an open space where she could have run in any direction.<br><br>Admittedly, the plaza was not completely deserted as AAA testified that there were a few people around, thus:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q.</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> You said that on September 14, 2003, you went to the plaza here in Mandaue City? </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A. </div></td><td><div align="justify">Yes.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q.</div></td><td> <div align="justify">What time was that? </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A. </div></td><td><div align="justify">8:00 [P.M.]</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="center">x x x x</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td><td><div align="justify">So, what were,you doing when you arrived at the Mandaue Plaza? </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A. </div></td><td><div align="justify">I was roaming around.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td><td><div align="justify">You were alone?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A. </div></td><td> <div align="justify">Yes. </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q.</div></td><td><div align="justify"> You would agree with me that there were many others who were also doing the same thing as you were walking around the plaza at that time?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"><strong>A.</strong></div></td><td><div align="justify"><strong> There were only few.</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"><strong>Q.</strong></div></td><td><div align="justify"><strong> When you arrived at around 8:00 [P.M.] there were still many people at that time?</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"><strong>A. </strong></div></td><td><div align="justify"><strong> Yes.</strong></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td><td><div align="justify">Where exactly at the plaza did you go? </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A.</div></td><td> <div align="justify">Near city hall.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td><td><div align="justify">You walked around for about how many minutes? </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">A. <strong></strong></div></td><td><div align="justify"><strong>Around two hours.</strong><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> [emphases ours]</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>From her testimony, we gather that AAA could have called for help and anyone around the vicinity would have noticed. In fact, any person at the plaza could have easily noticed that she was in some kind of danger had she tried to struggle to break free. Hence, the foregoing statements would suggest that AAA was not really held against her will.<br><br>The lower courts' conclusion that AAA could think of a way to escape because she was afraid is a <i>mere conjecture</i> that cannot support a conviction. As a general rule, we are bound by the trial court's findings of fact and evaluation of the credibility of witnesses, especially when affirmed by the appellate court. However, this time-honored doctrine admits exceptions, such as when the trial court overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied facts or circumstances of weight and substance that would affect the result of the case.<br><br>Faced with two conflicting versions, we are guided by the equipoise rule: <i>where the evidence in a criminal case is evenly balanced, the constitutional presumption of innocence tilts the scale in favor of the accused</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Thus, where the inculpatory facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his guilt, then the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty and is not sufficient to support a conviction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Applying this rule in the present case would properly lead us to conclude that AAA did not try to escape or call for help because <b><u>she wanted to go</u></b> to wherever Librias was planning to bring her.<br><br><i>Second</i>, AAA gave different statements as to how she was held back by Librias during the taxi ride going to Colon Street, Cebu City. In her direct testimony, she said that Librias was holding her hands the whole time while he was flagging down a taxi cab and when he pushed her inside it, <i>viz</i>:<blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">In the last hearing you testified that while you were at the Mandaue City plaza somebody held your hand and said, "kuyog ka nako."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">Was this correct?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Is that all he said?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q.</div></td> <td><div align="justify"> So, what happened after that?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">He flagged down a taxi.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">While he flagged down a taxi what did he do to you?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">He was holding on me.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Was he able to flag down a taxi?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Then what happened after that?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">He opened the door of the taxi and pushed me inside.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">So, what happened after you were pushed inside the taxi?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td><div align="justify">I told the driver of the taxi to go back to Ibabao.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">So the taxi then moved on? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td><div align="justify">A.

Holding her arms and tying them are completely different ways of restricting a person's movements. Thus, for AAA to narrate that Librias was simply holding her, then later say that her arms were tied with a towel is very unusual for a person who is supposed to be telling the truth. While rape victims are not required or expected to remember all the details of their harrowing experience, this inconsistency drawn from AAA's contradicting testimonies cannot be considered as minor that would not affect her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>Also, AAA again could have easily asked help from the taxi driver if she was really being held against her will. We find it strange that AAA asked the taxi driver to take her to a specific place when she could have simply said she was being taken away by Librias. The close proximity of the taxi driver should have already triggered AAA's instinct to call for help.<br><br><i>Third</i>, AAA's version on how she was raped likewise raises doubt as to whether the sexual intercourse initiated by Librias was against her will. Allegedly, Librias was able to insert his penis inside AAA's vagina at the same time he was using his hands to restrain her hands and his legs to hold her down. This means that AAA's legs were pinned underneath the legs of Librias. To our mind, this position would make it very difficult to insert a man's penis inside a woman's vagina when the entry to the latter would be closed with her legs supposedly pinned and thus restrained from opening.<br><br>While we generally do not disturb the factual findings of the lower courts, we cannot help but examine AAA's testimony critically and, based on this examination, conclude that what she had declared was not the entire and actual truth.<br><br>What we have in this case is a double plus in favor of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The first plus factor is the weakening of the prosecution's case for almost solely relying on the testimony of AAA which, as discussed above, has raised serious doubts that would not support a conviction. The second plus for the defense is Librias' denial, which was straightforward and needed no elaborate analysis to understand. He was walking around Mandaue Plaza where he met this girl who caught his attention. They were initially attracted to each other; hence, they started flirting. Not long after, they did not want the night to end so soon and wanted to take their newly found attraction further. This is simply a case of a one-night stand that went bad. Given these facts and the shaky evidence presented by the prosecution, Librias' denial is all that is needed to acquit him.<br><br>All told, we conclude that the evidence for the prosecution does not prove beyond reasonable doubt that Librias is guilty of the crime charged. On the other hand, Librias' evidence for his defense - <i>i.e.</i>, his testimony which, to our mind, is more sensible and real — raises serious questions as to the credibility of AAA's allegations. Given that the prosecution failed to meet the degree of moral certainty required, acquittal becomes our constitutional duty, for fear that we be tortured with the thought that we could possibly imprison an innocent man.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, we <b>REVERSE</b> and <b>SET ASIDE the</b> May 22, 2013 decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
