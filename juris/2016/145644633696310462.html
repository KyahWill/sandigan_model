SP No. 44521  G.R. No. 143416)</i><br><br>On October 1, 1990, Carriedo filed a Complaint for Ejectment and Collection of Unpaid Rentals against Mendoza before the Provincial Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (PARAD) of Tarlac docketed as DARAB Case No. 163-T-90. He subsequently filed an Amended Complaint on October 30, 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In a Decision dated June 4, 1992,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the PARAD ruled that Mendoza had knowledge of the sale, hence, he could not deny the feet nor assail the validity of the conveyance.

In a Decision dated February 8, 1996,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the DARAB affirmed the PARAD Decision <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span>. The DARAB ruled that ownership of the land belongs to Carriedo. That the deed of sale was unregistered did not affect Carriedo's title to the land. By virtue of his ownership, Carriedo was subrogated to the rights and obligation of the former landowner, Roman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Mendoza then filed a Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals (CA). The case was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 44521. In a Decision dated September 7, 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the CA affirmed the DARAB decision <i>in toto</i>. The CA ruled that Mendoza's reliance on Section 6 of RA No. 6657 as ground to nullify the sale between De Jesus and Carriedo was misplaced, the section being limited to retention limits. It reiterated that registration was not a condition for the validity of the contract of sale between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Mendoza's Motions for Reconsideration and New Trial were subsequently denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Mendoza thus filed a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> with this Court, docketed as G.R. No. 143416. In a Resolution dated August 9, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> this Court denied the petition for failure to comply with the requirements under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. An Entry of judgment was issued on October 25, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> In effect, the Decision of the CA was affirmed, and the following issues were settled with finality:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) Carriedo is the absolute owner of the five (5) hectare land;<br><br>2) Mendoza had knowledge of the sale between Carriedo and Mario De Jesus, hence he is bound by the sale; and<br><br>3) Due to his failure and refusal to pay the lease rentals, the tenancy relationship between Carriedo and Mendoza had been terminated.<br></div><br>Meanwhile, on October 5, 1999, the landholding covered by TCT No. 17680 with an area of 12.1065 hectares was divided into sub-lots. 7.1065 hectares was transferred to Bernabe Buscayno <i>et al</i>. through a Deed of Transfer<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> under PD No. 27.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Eventually, TCT No. 17680 was partially cancelled, and in lieu thereof, emancipation patents (EPs) were issued to Bernabe, Rod and Juanito, all surnamed Buscayno.

In an Order dated January 15, 2001,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the PARAD dismissed his petition on the grounds of&nbsp; this pendentia and lack of the required certification against forum-shopping. It dismissed the petition so that the pending appeal of DARAB Case No. 163-T-90 (the ejectment case discussed above) with the CA can run its full course, since its outcome partakes of a prejudicial question determinative of the tenability of Mendoza's right to redeem the land under tenancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Mendoza appealed to the DARAB which reversed the PARAD Order in a Decision dated November 12, 2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> The DARAB granted Mendoza redemption rights over the land. It ruled that at the time Carriedo filed his complaint for ejectment on October 1, 1990, he was no longer the owner of the land, having sold the land to PLFI in June of 1990. Hence, the cause of action pertains to PLFI and not to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It also ruled that Mendoza was not notified of the sale of the land to Carriedo and of the latter's subsequent sale of it to PLFI. The absence of the mandatory requirement of notice did not stop the running of the 180 day-period within which Mendoza could exercise his right of redemption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Carriedo's Motion for Reconsideration was subsequently denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Carriedo filed a Petition for Review with the CA. In a Decision dated December 29, 2006,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the CA reversed the DARAB Decision. It ruled that Carriedo's ownership of the land had been conclusively established and even affirmed by this Court. Mendoza was not able to substantiate his claim that Carriedo was no longer the owner of the land at the time the latter filed his complaint for ejectment. It held that the DARAB erred when it ruled that Mendoza was not guilty of forum-shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Mendoza did not appeal the decision of the CA.<br><br><i>The Coverage Case<br>(ADM Case No. A-9999-03-CV-008-03 | CA-G.R.

They claimed that they had been in physical and material possession of the land as tenants since 1956, and made the land productive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> They prayed (1) that an order be issued placing the land under Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP); and (2) that the DAR, the Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer (PARO) and the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer (MARO) of Tarlac City be ordered to proceed with the acquisition and distribution of the land in their favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The petition was granted by the Regional Director (RD) in an Order dated October 2, 2002,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, the petition for coverage under CARP filed by Pablo Mendoza, et al[.], is given due course.

He alleged that he was not notified of the filing of the Petition for Coverage, and became aware of the same only upon receipt of the challenged Order.<br><br>On October 24, 2002, Carriedo received a copy of a Notice of Coverage dated October 21, 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> from MARO Maximo E. Santiago informing him that the land had been placed under the coverage of the CARP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> On December 16, 2002, the RD denied Carriedo's protest in an Order dated December 5, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> Carriedo filed an appeal to the DAR-CO.<br><br>In an Order dated February 22, 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the DAR-CO, through Secretary Rene C. Villa, affirmed the Order of the RD granting coverage. The DAR-CO ruled that Carriedo was no longer allowed to retain the land due to his violation of the provisions of RA No. 6657. His act of disposing his agricultural landholdings was tantamount to the exercise of his retention right, or an act amounting to a valid waiver of such right in accordance with applicable laws and jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> However, it did not rule whether Mendoza was qualified to be a farmer-beneficiary of the land. The dispositive portion of the Order reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the instant appeal is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of merit. Consequently, the Order dated 2 October 2002 of the Regional Director of DAR III, is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>Carriedo filed a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> with the CA assailing the DAR-CO Order. The appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 88935. In a Decision dated October 5, 2006, the CA reversed the DAR-CO, and declared the land as Carriedo's retained area. The CA ruled that the right of retention is a constitutionally-guaranteed right, subject to certain qualifications specified by the legislature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> It serves to mitigate the effects of compulsory land acquisition by balancing the rights of the landowner and the tenant by implementing the doctrine that social justice was not meant to perpetrate an injustice against the landowner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> It held that Carriedo did not commit any of the acts which would constitute waiver of his retention rights found under Section 6 of DAR Administrative Order No. 02, S.2003.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered and pursuant to applicable law and jurisprudence on the matter, the present Petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>. Accordingly, the assailed Order of the Department of Agrarian Reform-Central Office, Elliptical Road, Diliman, Quezon City (dated February 22, 2005) is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b> and a new one entered—<b>DECLARING</b> the subject landholding as the Petitioner's retained area. No pronouncements as to costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition.<br></blockquote>Petitioners maintain that the CA committed a reversible error in declaring the land as Carriedo's retained area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>They claim that Paragraph 4, Section 6 of RA No. 6657 prohibits any sale, disposition, lease, management contract or transfer of possession of private lands upon effectivity of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Thus, Regional Director Renato Herrera correctly observed that Carriedo's act of disposing his agricultural property would be tantamount to his exercise of retention under the law. By violating the law, Carriedo could no longer retain what was left of his property. "To rule otherwise would be a roundabout way of rewarding a landowner who has violated the explicit provisions of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>They also assert that Carriedo waived his right to retain for failure or neglect for an unreasonable length of time to do that which he may have done earlier by exercising due diligence, warranting a presumption that he abandoned his right or declined to assert it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Petitioners claim that Carriedo has not filed an Application for Retention over the subject land over a considerable passage of time since the same was acquired for distribution to qualified farmer beneficiaries.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Lastly, they argue that Certificates of Land Ownership Awards (CLOAs) already generated in favor of his co-petitioners Corazon Mendoza and Rolando Gomez cannot be set aside. CLOAs under RA No. 6657 are enrolled in the Torrens system of registration which makes them indefeasible as certificates of title issued in registration proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><center><b>The Issue</b><br></center><br>The sole issue for our consideration is whether Carriedo has the right to retain the land.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>We rule in the affirmative. Carriedo did not waive his right of retention over the land.<br><br>The 1987 Constitution expressly recognizes landowner retention rights under Article XIII, Section 4, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 4. The State shall, by law, undertake an agrarian reform program founded on the right of farmers and regular farmworkers, who are landless, to own directly or collectively the lands they till or, in the case of other farmworkers, to receive a just share of the fruits thereof. <b>To this end, the State shall encourage and undertake the just distribution of all agricultural lands, subject to such priorities and reasonable retention limits as the Congress may prescribe</b>, taking into account ecological, developmental, or equity considerations, and subject to the payment of just compensation. In determining retention limits, the State shall respect the right of small landowners. The State shall further provide incentives for voluntary land-sharing. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>RA No. 6657 implements this directive, thus:<br><blockquote>Section 6. <i>Retention Limits</i>. — Except as otherwise provided in this Act, no person may own or retain, directly or indirectly, any public or private agricultural land, the size of which shall vary according to factors governing a viable family-size farm, such as commodity produced, terrain, infrastructure, and soil fertility as determined by the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) created hereunder, <b>but in no case shall retention by the landowner exceed five (5) hectares</b>.<br><br>xxx<br><br>The right to choose the area to be retained, which shall be compact or contiguous, shall pertain to the landowner: Provided, however, That in case the area selected for retention by the landowner is tenanted, the tenant shall have the option to choose whether to remain therein or be a beneficiary in the same or another agricultural land with similar or comparable features. In case the tenant chooses to remain in the retained area, he shall be considered a leaseholder and shall lose his right to be a beneficiary under this Act. In case the tenant chooses to be a beneficiary in another agricultural land, he loses his right as a leaseholder to the land retained by the landowner. The tenant must exercise this option within a period of one (1) year from the time the landowner manifests his choice of the area for retention. In all cases, the security of tenure of the farmers or farmworkers on the land prior to the approval of this Act shall be respected. xxx (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>In <i>Danan v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> we explained the rationale for the grant of tine right of retention under agrarian reform laws such as RA No. 6657 and its predecessor PD No. 27, to wit:<br><blockquote>The right of retention is a constitutionally guaranteed right, which is subject to qualification by the legislature. It serves to mitigate the effects of compulsory land acquisition by balancing the rights of the landowner and the tenant and by implementing the doctrine that social justice was not meant to perpetrate an injustice against the landowner. A retained area, as its name denotes, is land which is not supposed to anymore leave the landowner's dominion, thus sparing the government from the inconvenience of taking land only to return it to the landowner afterwards, which would be a pointless process. For as long as the area to be retained is compact or contiguous and does not exceed the retention ceiling of five (5) hectares, a landowner's choice of the area to be retained must prevail. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br></blockquote>To interpret Section 6 of RA No. 6657, DAR issued Administrative Order No. 02, Series of 2003 (DAR AO 02-03) Section 6 of DAR AO 02-03 provides for the instances when a landowner is deemed to have waived his right of retention, to wit:<br><blockquote>Section 6. <i>Waiver of the Right of Retention</i>. - The landowner waives his right to retain by committing any of the following act or omission:<br><br> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">6.1 </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Failure to manifest an intention to exercise his right to retain within sixty (60) calendar days from receipt of notice of CARP coverage.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">6.2 </div></td><td><div align="justify">Failure to state such intention upon offer to sell or application under the [Voluntary Land Transfer (VLT)]/[Direct Payment Scheme (DPS)] scheme.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">6.3</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Execution of any document stating that he expressly waives his right to retain.

At the time when the Order was rendered, up to the time when it was affirmed by the DAR-CO in its Order dated February 22, 2005, the applicable law is Section 6 of DAR 02-03. Section 6 clearly shows that the disposition of agricultural land is not an act constituting waiver of the right of retention.<br><br>Thus, as correctly held by the CA, Carriedo "[n]ever committed any of the acts or omissions above-stated (DAR AO 02-03). Not even the sale made by the herein petitioner in favor of PLFI can be considered as a waiver of his right of retention. Likewise, the Records of the present case is bereft of any showing that the herein petitioner expressly waived (in writing) his right of retention as required under sub-section 6.3, section 6, DAR Administrative Order No. 02-S.2003."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Petitioners claim that Carriedo's alleged failure to exercise his right of retention alter a long period of time constituted a waiver of his retention rights, as envisioned in Item 6.7 of DAR AO 02-03.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>Laches is defined as the failure or neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which by exercising due diligence could or should have been done earlier; it is negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting a presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to assert it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Where a party sleeps on his rights and allows laches to set in, the same is fatal to his case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Section 4 of DAR AO 02-03 provides:<br><blockquote>Section 4. <i>Period to Exercise Right of Retention under RA 6657</i><br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">4.1 </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">The landowner may exercise his right of retention at any time before receipt of notice of coverage.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">4.2</div></td><td><div align="justify"> Under the Compulsory Acquisition (CA) scheme, the landowner shall exercise his right of retention within sixty (60) days from receipt of notice of coverage.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">4.3 </div></td><td><div align="justify">Under the Voluntary Offer to Sell (VOS) and the Voluntary Land Transfer (VLT)/Direct Payment Scheme (DPS), the landowner shall exercise his right of retention simultaneously at the time of offer for sale or transfer.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The foregoing rules give Carriedo any time before receipt of the notice of coverage to exercise his right of retention, or if under compulsory acquisition (as in this case), within sixty (60) days from receipt of the notice of coverage. The validity of the notice of coverage is the very subject of the controversy before this court. Thus, the period within which Carriedo should exercise his right of retention cannot commence until final resolution of this case.<br><br>Even assuming that the period within which Carriedo could exercise his right of retention has commenced, Carriedo cannot be said to have neglected to assert his right of retention over the land. The records show that per Legal Report dated December 13, 1999<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> prepared by Legal Officer Ariel Reyes, Carriedo filed an application for retention which was even contested by Pablo Mendoza's son, Fernando.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> Though Carriedo subsequently withdrew his application, his act of filing an application for retention belies the allegation that he abandoned his right of retention or declined to assert it.<br><br>In their Memorandum<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> however, petitioners, <i>for the first time</i>, invoke estoppel, citing DAR Administrative Order No. 05 Series of 2006<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> (DAR AO 05-06) to support their argument that Carriedo waived his right of retention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> DAR AO 05-06 provides for the rules and regulations governing the acquisition and distribution of agricultural lands subject of conveyances under Sections 6, 70<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> and 73 (a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> of RA No. 6657. Petitioners particularly cite Item no. 4 of the Statement of Policies of DAR AO 05-06, to wit:<br><blockquote>II. Statement of Policies<br><br>4. Where the transfer/sale involves more than the five (5) hectares retention area, the transfer is considered violative of Sec. 6ofR.A. No. 6657.<br><br>In case of multiple or series of transfers/sales, the first five (5) hectares sold/conveyed without DAR clearance and the corresponding titles issued by the Register of Deeds (ROD) in the name of the transferee shall, <b>under the principle of estoppel, be considered valid and shall he treated as the transferor/s' retained area</b> but in no case shall the transferee exceed the five-hectare landholding ceiling pursuant to Sections 6, 70 and 73(a) of R.A. No. 6657. Insofar as the excess area is concerned, the same shall likewise be covered considering that the transferor has no right of disposition since CARP coverage has been vested as of 15 June 1988. Any landholding still registered in the name of the landowner after earlier dispositions totaling an aggregate of five (5) hectares can no longer be part of his retention area and therefore shall be covered under CARP. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Citing this provision, petitioners argue that Carriedo lost his right of retention over the land because he had already sold or disposed, after the effectivity of RA No. 6657, more than fifty (50) hectares of land in favor of another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>In his Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Carriedo maintains that petitioners cannot invoke any administrative regulation to defeat his right of retention. He argues that "administrative regulation must be in harmony with the provisions of law otherwise the latter prevails."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>We cannot sustain petitioners' argument. Their reliance on DAR AO 05-06 is misplaced. As will be seen below, nowhere in the relevant provisions of RA No. 6657 does it indicate that a multiple or series of transfers/sales of land would result in the loss of retention rights. Neither do they provide that the multiple or series of transfers or sales amounts to the waiver of such right.<br><br>The relevant portion of Section 6 of RA No. 6657 referred to in Item no. 4 of DAR AO 05-06 provides:<br><blockquote>Section 6. <i>Retention Limits</i>. - Except as otherwise provided in this Act, no person may own or retain, directly or indirectly, any public or private agricultural land, the size of which shall vary according to factors governing a viable family-size farm, such as the commodity produced, terrain, infrastructure, and soil fertility as determined by the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) created hereunder, but in no case shall retention by the landowner exceed five (5) hectares. xxx<br><br>Upon the effectivity of this Act, <b>any sale, disposition, lease, management, contract or transfer of possession of private lands executed by the original landowner in violation of the Act <u>shall be null and void</u>:</b> Provided, however, That those executed prior to this Act shall be valid only when registered with the Register of Deeds within a period of three (3) months after the effectivity of this Act. Thereafter, all Registers of Deeds shall inform the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) within thirty (30) days of any transaction involving agricultural lands in excess of five (5) hectares. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Section 70 of RA No. 6657, also referred to in Item no. 4 of DAR AO 05-06 partly provides:<br><blockquote>The sale or disposition of agricultural lands retained by a landowner as a consequence of Section 6 hereof shall be valid as long as the total landholdings that shall be owned by the transferee thereof inclusive of the land to be acquired shall not exceed the landholding ceilings provided for in this Act. <b>Any sale or disposition of agricultural hinds after the effectivity of this Act found to be contrary to the provisions hereof <u>shall be null and void</u>.</b> xxx (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Finally, Section 73 (a) of RA No. 6657 as referred to in Item No. 4 of DAR AO 05-06 provides,<br><blockquote>Section 73. <i>Prohibited Ads and Omissions</i>. - The following are prohibited: <br>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">The ownership or possession, for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this Act, of agricultural lands in excess of the total retention limits or award ceilings by any person, natural or juridical, except those under collective ownership by farmer-beneficiaries; xxx</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Sections 6 and 70 are clear in stating that any sale and disposition of agricultural lands in violation of the RA No. 6657 shall be null and void. Under the facts of this case, the reasonable reading of these three provisions in relation to the constitutional right of retention should be that the consequence of nullity pertains to the area/s which were sold, or owned by the transferee, in excess of the 5-hectare land ceiling. Thus, the CA was correct in declaring that the land is Carriedo's retained area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Item no. 4 of DAR AO 05-06 attempts to defeat the above reading by providing that, under the principle of <i>estoppel</i>, the sale of the first five hectares is valid. But, it hastens to add that the first five hectares sold corresponds to the transferor/s' retained area. Thus, since the sale of the first five hectares is valid, therefore, the landowner loses the five hectares because it happens to be, at the same time, the retained area limit. In reality, Item No. 4 of DAR AO 05-06 operates as a forfeiture provision in the guise of <i>estoppel</i>. It punishes the landowner who sells in excess of five hectares. Forfeitures, however, partake of a criminal penalty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup><br><br>In <i>Perez v. LPG Refillers Association of the Philippines, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> this Court said that for an administrative regulation to have the force of a penal law, (1) the violation of the administrative regulation must be made a crime by the delegating statute itself; and (2) the penalty for such violation must be provided by the statute itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Sections 6, 70 and 73 (a) of RA No. 6657 clearly do not provide that a sale or disposition of land in excess of 5 hectares results in a forfeiture of the five hectare retention area. Item no. 4 of DAR AO 05-06 imposes a penalty where none was provided by law.<br><br>As this Court also held in <i>People v. Maceren</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>The reason is that the Fisheries law does not expressly prohibit electro fishing. As electro fishing is not banned under the law, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Natural Resources and the Commissioner of Fisheries are powerless to penalize it. In other words, Administrative Order Nos. 84 and 84-1, in penalizing electro fishing, are devoid of any legal basis.<br><br>Had the lawmaking body intended to punish electro fishing, a penal provision to that effect could have been easily embodied in the old Fisheries Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br></blockquote>The repugnancy between the law and Item no. 4 of DAR AO 05-06 is apparent by a simple comparison of their texts. The conflict undermines the statutorily-guaranteed right of the landowner to choose the land he shall retain, and DAR AO 05-06, in effect, amends RA No. 6657.<br><br>In <i>Romulo, Mabanta, Buenaventura, Sayoc &amp; De Los Angeles</i> (RMRSA) <i>v. Home Development Mutual Fund</i> (HDMF),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> this Court was confronted with the issue of the validity of the amendments to the rules and regulations implementing PD No. 1752.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> In that case, PD No. 1752 (as amended by RA No. 7742) exempted RMBSA from the Pag-Ibig Fund coverage for the period January 1 to December 31, 1995. In September 1995, however, the HDMF Board of Trustees issued a board resolution amending and modifying the rules and regulations implementing RA No. 7742. As amended, the rules now required that for a company to be entitled to a waiver or suspension of fund coverage, it must have a plan providing for both provident/retirement <i>and</i> housing benefits superior to those provided in the Pag-Ibig Fund. In ruling against the amendment and modification of the rules, this Court held that—<br><blockquote>In the present case, when the Board of Trustees of the HDMF required in Section 1, Rule VII of the 1995 Amendments to the Rules and Regulations Implementing R.A. No. 7742 that employers should have both provident/retirement and housing benefits for all its employees in order to qualify for exemption from the Fund, <u>it effectively amended Section 19 of P.P. No. 1752</u>. And when the Board subsequently abolished that exemption through the 1996 Amendments, <u>it repealed Section 19 of P.P. No. 1752. Such amendment and subsequent repeal of Section 19 are both invalid, as they are not within the delegated power of the Board</u>. The HDMF cannot, in the exercise of its rule-making power, issue a regulation not consistent with the law it seeks to apply. Indeed, administrative issuances must not override, supplant or modify the law, but must remain consistent with the law they intend to carry out. Only Congress can repeal or amend the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> (Citations omitted; underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>Laws, as well as the issuances promulgated to implement them, enjoy the presumption of validity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> However, administrative regulations that alter or amend the statute or enlarge or impair its scope are void, and courts not only may, but it is their obligation to strike down such regulations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Thus, in this case, because Item no. 4 of DAR AO 05-06 is patently null and void, the presumption of validity cannot be accorded to it. The invalidity of this provision constrains us to strike it down for being <i>ultra vires</i>.<br><br>In <i>Conte v. Commission on Audit</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> the sole issue of whether the Commission on Audit (COA) acted in grave abuse of discretion when it disallowed in audit therein petitioners' claim of financial assistance under Social Security System (SSS) Resolution No. 56 was presented before this Court. The COA disallowed the claims because the financial assistance under the challenged resolution is similar to a separate retirement plan which results in the increase of benefits beyond what is allowed under existing laws. This Court, sitting <i>en banc</i>, upheld the findings of the COA, and invalidated SSS Resolution No. 56 for being <i>ultra vires</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote>xxx Said Sec. 28 (b) as amended by RA 4968 in no uncertain terms bars the creation of any insurance or retirement plan — other than the GSIS — for government officers and employees, in order to prevent the undue and [iniquitous] proliferation of such plans. <u>It is beyond cavil that Res. 56 contravenes the said provision of law and is therefore invalid, void and of no effect.</u> xxx<br><br>We are not unmindful of the laudable purposes for promulgating Res. 56, and the positive results it must have had xxx. But it is simply beyond dispute that the SSS had no authority to maintain and implement such retirement plan, particularly in the face of the statutory prohibition. <u>The SSS cannot, in the guise of rule-making legislate or amend laws or worse, render them nugatory.</u><br><br>It is doctrinal that in case of conflict between a statute and an administrative order, the former must prevail. A rule or regulation must conform to and be consistent with the provisions of the enabling statute in order for such rule or regulation to be valid. The rule-making power of a public administrative body is a delegated legislative power, which it may not use either to abridge the authority given it by the Congress or the Constitution or to enlarge its power beyond the scope intended. xxx Though well-settled is the rule that retirement laws are liberally interpreted in favor of the retiree, nevertheless, there is really <i>nothing to interpret</i> in either RA 4968 or Res. 56, and correspondingly, <b>the absence of any doubt as to the <i>ultra-vires</i> nature and illegality of the disputed resolution constrains us to rule against petitioners</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> (Citations omitted; emphasis and underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>Administrative regulations must be in harmony with the provisions of the law for administrative regulations cannot extend the law or amend a legislative enactment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Administrative issuances must not override, but must remain consistent with the law they seek to apply and implement.

The effect of such a forfeiture is to transfer the title to the specific thing from the owner to the sovereign power. (23 Am.
