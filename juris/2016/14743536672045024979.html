It found that several similarities existed between the complaint filed before it and that in Civil Case No. 10-323 pending in the RTC-Makati, <i>i.e.</i>, (<i>a</i>) both complaints dealt with the same collaterals under the MTI, and (<i>b</i>) both cases involved substantially the same parties as the individual plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 10-323 (herein Sherwyn, <i>et al.</i>) and the corporation plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 543-M-2010 (herein petitioners) represented a common interest adverse to EBC, Allied, and Security.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> In this light, the RTC-Malolos concluded that the determination of the validity of foreclosure would necessarily be intertwined with the issue of whether or not Sherwyn, <i>et al.</i> should be subrogated to the rights of BDO under the MTI - an issue already pending before the RTC-Makati.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioners appealed to the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br><center><b>The CA Ruling</b><br></center><br>In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated May 22, 2013, the CA upheld the RTC-Malolos's dismissal of Civil Case No. 543-M-2010 on the ground of forum shopping. It held that the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> are attendant in the said case, considering that: (<i>a</i>) there is a community of interests between the parties in the cases pending before the RTC-Malolos and the RTC-Makati, in that the aforesaid cases were instituted to protect the alleged respective rights of the individual and corporation plaintiffs over the collaterals and both sought the identical relief of enjoining the foreclosure thereof;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (<i>b</i>) although both cases differ in form or nature, they alleged the same facts and the same evidence would be required to substantiate the parties' claim, considering that the resolution of both cases would be based on the right of Sherwyn, <i>et al</i>. to be subrogated to BDO's rights under the MTI;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and (c) the resolution of said issue in one case would amount to <i><i>res judicata</i></i> in the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Undaunted, petitioners moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> dated December 27, 2013; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The core issue in this case is whether or not the CA correctly upheld the dismissal of Civil Case No. 543-M-2010 pending before the RTC-Malolos on the ground of forum shopping in the concept of <i>litis pendentia</i>.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>At the outset, it must be emphasized that "[forum shopping] is the act of a litigant who repetitively availed of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues, either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court, to increase his chances of obtaining a favorable decision if not in one court, then in another. <b><u><i>What is important in determining whether [forum shopping] exists is the vexation caused the courts and parties-litigants by a party who asks different courts and/or administrative agencies to rule on the same or related causes and/or grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, in the process creating the possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered by the different fora upon the same issues.</i></u></b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In <i>Heirs of Sotto v. Palicte</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Court held that "[t]he test to determine the existence of forum shopping is whether the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> are present, or whether a final judgment in one case amounts to <i>res judicata</i> in the other. <b><u>Thus, there is forum shopping when the following elements are present, namely: (<i>a</i>) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions; (<i>b</i>) identity of rights asserted and reliefs prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and (<i>c</i>) the identity of the two preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amounts to <i>res judicata</i> in the action under consideration.</u></b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In reference to the foregoing, <i>litis pendentia</i> is a Latin term, which literally means "a pending suit" and is variously referred to in some decisions as <i>lis pendens</i> and <i>auter action pendant</i>. As a ground for the dismissal of a civil action, it refers to the situation where two actions are pending between the same parties for the same cause of action, so that one of them becomes unnecessary and vexatious. It is based on the policy against multiplicity of suits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Anent the first requisite of forum shopping, "[t]here is identity of parties where the parties in both actions are the same, or there is privity between them, or they are successors-in-interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity. Absolute identity of parties is not required, shared identity of interest is sufficient to invoke the coverage of this principle. Thus, it is enough that there is a community of interest between a party in the first case and a party in the second case even if the latter was not impleaded in the first case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>With respect to the second and third requisites of forum shopping, "[h]ornbook is the rule that identity of causes of action does not mean absolute identity; otherwise, a party could easily escape the operation of <i>res judicata</i> by changing the form of the action or the relief sought. The test to determine whether the causes of action are identical is to ascertain whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action. Hence, a party cannot, by varying the form of action or adopting a different method of presenting his case, escape the operation of the principle that one and the same cause of action shall not be twice litigated between the same parties or their privies. Among the several tests resorted to in ascertaining whether two suits relate to a single or common cause of action are: (1) whether the same evidence would support and sustain both the first and second causes of action; and (2) whether the defenses in one case may be used to substantiate the complaint in the other. Also fundamental is the test of determining whether the cause of action in the second case existed at the time of the filing of the first complaint."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Here, it cannot be said that there is an identity of parties between Civil Case No. 10-323 pending before RTC-Makati and Civil Case No. 543-M-2010 pending before RTC-Malolos because the plaintiffs in the former, herein Sherwyn, <i>et al.</i>, represent substantially different interests from the plaintiffs in the latter, herein petitioners. This is because in Civil Case No. 10-323, Sherwyn, <i>et al.</i>'s interest is to be subrogated into the shoes of BDO as one of the creditors under the MTI; on the other hand, petitioners' interest in Civil Case No. 543-M-2010 is the enforcement of their rights as debtors to the MTI, <i>i.e.</i>, ensuring that the foreclosure proceedings were in accord with the foreclosure provisions of the MTI.<br><br>Secondly, the underlying circumstances surrounding the causes of action in both cases are likewise substantially different in that: (<i>a</i>) in Civil Case No. 10-323, the cause of action arose from EBC's alleged unjust refusal to subrogate Sherwyn, <i>et al</i>. to the rights of BDO; while (<i>b</i>) in Civil Case No. 543-M-2010, the cause of action stemmed from EBC's purported breach of Section 6.05<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> of the MTI which provides that it should first secure a written instruction from the Majority Creditors<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> before commencing foreclosure proceedings against the collaterals.<br><br>Finally, a judgment in Civil Case No. 10-323 will not necessarily result in <i>res judicata</i> in Civil Case No. 543-M-2010. Being principally a subrogation case which is an action <i>in personam</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> a judgment in Civil Case No. 10-323 will not bind any non-parties to it, such as the corporation plaintiffs and the other defendants (aside from EBC) in Civil Case No. 543-M-2010 that represent interests separate and distinct from the parties in Civil Case No. 10-323.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> At the most, a judgment in Civil Case No. 10-323 may only constitute the <i>factum probans</i> (or evidentiary facts) by which the <i>factum probandum</i> (or the ultimate fact) sought to be proven by petitioners in Civil Case No. 543-M-2010, <i>i.e.</i>, EBC's non-compliance with the foreclosure provisions of the MTI, could be established.<br><br>In sum, both the RTC-Malolos and the CA erred in dismissing Civil Case No. 543-M-2010 on the ground of forum shopping and/or <i>litis pendentia</i>. Hence, Civil Case No. 543-M-2010 stands to be reinstated and remanded to the court <i>a quo</i> for further proceedings.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
