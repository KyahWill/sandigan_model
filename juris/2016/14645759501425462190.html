				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"><u><center><b>The Case</b><br></center></u><br>This is a petition for review on certiorari<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> assailing the Amended Decision dated 13 September 2013<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 00012.<br><br><u><center><b>The Facts</b><br></center></u><br>Petitioner LNL Archipelago Minerals, Inc. (LAMI) is the operator of a mining claim located in Sta. Cruz, Zambales. LAMI's mining area is covered by Mineral Production Sharing Agreement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> No. 268-2008-III dated 26 August 2008 by virtue of an Operating Agreement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated 5 June 2007 with Filipinas Mining Corporation.<br><br>LAMI embarked on a project to build a private, non-commercial port in Brgy. Bolitoc, Sta. Cruz, Zambales. A port is a vital infrastructure to the operations of a mining company to ship out ores and other minerals extracted from the mines and make the venture economically feasible. Brgy. Bolitoc, about 25 kilometers away from the mine site, makes it an ideal location to build a port facility. In the area of Sta. Cruz, Shangfil Mining and Trading Corporation (Shangfil)/A3Una Mining Corporation (A3Una) and DMCI Mining Corporation, have been operating their own ports since 2007.<br><br>LAMI secured the following permits and compliance certificates for the port project: (1) Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Environmental Compliance Certificate<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (ECC) R03-1104-182 dated 2 May 2011 covering the development of causeway, stockpile and related facilities on LAMI's property with an area of 18,142 sq.m.; (2) DENR provisional foreshore lease agreement with LAMI;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> (3) Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) Clearance to Develop a Port;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (4) PPA Permit to Construct a Port;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> (5) PPA Special Permit to Operate a Beaching Facility;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and (6) Tree Cutting Permit/Certification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> from the Community Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) of the DENR.<br><br>The Zambales Alliance, a group of other mining companies operating in Sta. Cruz, Zambales which do not have their own port, namely Eramen Minerals, Inc.; Zambales Diversified Metals Corporation; Zambales Chromite Mining Corporation, Inc.; BenguetCorp Nickel Mines, Inc., supported the port project of LAMI and issued Letters<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> of Intent to use the port facilities of LAMI upon completion.<br><br>The Bolitoc community - the <i>barangay</i>, its officials and residents -gave several endorsements<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> supporting the project. Even the <i>Sangguniang Bayan</i> of Sta. Cruz gave its consent to the construction of the port.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>However, LAMI allegedly encountered problems from the local government of Sta. Cruz, headed by Mayor Luisito E. Marty (Mayor Marty). LAMI stated that Mayor Marty unduly favored some mining companies in the municipality and allegedly refused to issue business and mayor's permits and to receive payment of occupation fees from other mining companies despite the necessary national permits and licenses secured by the other mining companies.<br><br>On 24 April 2012, Mayor Marty issued an order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> directing LAMI to refrain from continuing with its clearing works and directed the Sta. Cruz Municipal Police Chief Generico Binan to implement his order. On 26 April 2012, LAMI responded through a letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> explaining that Mayor Marty's order was illegal and baseless. Chief Binan, together with two of his deputies, went to LAMI's port site to demand that LAMI cease its clearing works. LAMI's supervisor showed Chief Binan all of LAMI's permits. In a Memorandum dated 3 May 2012, Chief Binan made a report to his supervisor, S/Supt. Francisco DB Santiago, Jr. (S/Supt. Santiago), Zambales Police Provincial Director, that there was no leveling of a mountain on the port site. On 6 May 2012, S/Supt. Santiago made a Special Report re: Police Assistance<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> to the Philippine National Police (PNP) Regional Director citing the findings of Chief Bi√±an.<br><br>Thereafter, Rep. Dan Fernandez, a member of the Committee on Ecology of the House of Representatives, passed House Resolution No. 117 (HR 117) entitled "Resolution Directing the Committee on Ecology to Conduct an Inquiry, in Aid of Legislation, on the Implementation of Republic Act No. 7942, Otherwise Known as the Philippine Mining Act of 1995, Particularly on the Adverse Effects of Mining on the Environment." HR 117 was issued in order to conduct an alleged ocular inspection of the port site in aid of legislation. On 21 May 2012, the Committee on Ecology conducted an ocular inspection of the LAMI port site, as well as the other ports adjacent to LAMI's - those of Shangfil/A3Una and D.M. Consunji, Inc. The Committee allegedly never visited any mining site in the area of Sta. Cruz.<br><br>Meanwhile, on 30 April 2012, the DENR Environmental Management Bureau in Region III (DENR-EMB R3) received a letter dated 27 April 2012 from Mayor Marty inquiring if the ECC the DENR issued in favor of LAMI allowed LAMI to cut trees and level a mountain.<br><br>On 25 May 2012, representatives from the DENR Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) in Zambales and the local government of Sta. Cruz conducted an ECC compliance monitoring of LAMI's property. The DENR PENRO team found that LAMI violated some of its conditions under the ECC. Accordingly, a Notice of Violation (NOV) dated 1 June 2012 was issued against LAMI for violation of certain conditions of the ECC with a cease and desist order from further constructing and developing until such time that the ECC conditions were fully complied.<br><br>On 8 June 2012, a technical conference was held where LAMI presented its reply to the NOV. The DENR-EMB R3 ascertained that LAMI's violations of the four conditions of its ECC constitute minor violations since they only pertain to non-submission of documents. However, the leveling of the elevated portion of the area was a major violation. A penalty was consequently imposed on LAMI, and the DENR-EMB R3 directed LAMI to (1) immediately cause the installation of mitigating measures to prevent soil erosion and siltation of the waterbody, and (2) submit a rehabilitation plan.<br><br>On 11 June 2012, LAMI wrote a letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> to the DENR-EMB R3 regarding the commitments agreed upon during the technical conference. LAMI signified compliance with the conditions of DENR-EMB R3. Attached to the letter were: (1) Official Receipt of payment of penalties under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1586, (2) Matrix of Mitigation and Rehabilitation Plan, (3) Designation of Pollution Control Officer dated 6 May 2011, and (4) Tree Cutting Permit dated 17 April 2012 issued by DENR R3 CENRO.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On 20-21 June 2012, the DENR composite team, composed of DENR-EMB R3, Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) R3 and PENRO Zambales, conducted an investigation to determine whether mitigating measures done by LAMI were sufficient. The composite team found that LAMI's activities in its property would not result to any environmental damage to its surrounding communities.<br><br>Thereafter, the DENR-EMB R3 lifted the cease and desist order after LAMI was found to have complied with the requirements. In a Letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> dated 24 October 2012, Lormelyn E. Claudio (Dir. Claudio), the Regional Director of DENR-EMB R3 wrote:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>The violated ECC conditions have been rectified and clarified while the penalty corresponding to such violation was fully paid and the required rehabilitation and mitigating measures were already implemented as committed. As such, the matter leading to the issuance of the NOV is now resolved.<br><br>As ECC holder, you are enjoined to ensure the effective carrying out of your Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Meanwhile, earlier, or on 6 June 2012, respondent Agham Party List (Agham), through its President, former Representative Angelo B. Palmones (Rep. Palmones), filed a Petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> for the issuance of a Writ<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> of Kalikasan against LAMI, DENR, PPA, and the Zambales Police Provincial Office (ZPPO).<br><br>Agham alleged that LAMI violated: (1) Section 68<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[23]</sup></font> of PD No. 705,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> as amended by Executive Order No. III,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> or the Revised Forestry Code; and (2) Sections 57<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and 69<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> of Republic Act No. 7942,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> or the Philippine Mining Act of 1995 (Philippine Mining Act). Agham added that LAMI cut mountain trees and flattened a mountain which serves as a natural protective barrier from typhoons and floods not only of the residents of Zambales but also the residents of some nearby towns located in Pangasinan.<br><br>On 13 June 2012, this Court remanded the petition<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> to the Court of Appeals for hearing, reception of evidence and rendition of judgment.<br><br>On 25 June 2012, LAMI filed its Verified Return dated 21 June 2012, controverting Agham's allegations. LAMI stated that it did not and was not violating any environmental law, rule or regulation. LAMI argued that: (1) LAMI had the necessary permits and authorization to cut trees in the port site; (2) LAMI had the necessary permits to construct its port; (3) LAMI consulted with and obtained the support of the Sangguniang Barangay and residents of Barangay Bolitoc; (4) LAMI's port site is located on private and alienable land; (5) there is no mountain on the port site; (6) the Philippine Mining Act is irrelevant and inapplicable to the present case; and (7) the other allegations of Agham that LAMI violated environmental laws, rules or regulations are likewise baseless, irrelevant and false. LAMI stated further that there is no environmental damage of such magnitude as to prejudice the life, health, or property of inhabitants in two or more cities and provinces.<br><br>Public respondents DENR, PPA and ZPPO, filed with the Court of Appeals their Pre-Trial Brief dated 1 August 2012. In the Pre-Trial Brief, public respondents stated that they will present the following witnesses: (1) Dir. Claudio, Regional Director, DENR-EMB R3; two from the PPA - (2) Engineer Marieta G. Odicta (Engr. Odicta), Division Manager, Engineering Services Division, Port District Office, Manila, Northern Luzon; and (3) Emma L. Susara (Ms. Susara), Department Manager, Commercial Services of the PPA (NCR); and (4) S/Supt. Santiago, Provincial Director of the ZPPO.<br><br>The witnesses of public respondents submitted their Judicial Affidavits dated 6 August 2012.

On the same hearing, LAMI presented its witness, Felipe E.

The appellate court found that the government, through the CENRO, authorized LAMI to cut trees and LAMI strictly followed the proper guidelines stated in the permit. The appellate court also stated that there can be no flattening of a mountain when there is no mountain to speak of. Thus, for failing to comply with the requisites necessary for the issuance of a Writ of Kalikasan, the Court of Appeals resolved to deny the petition. The dispositive portion of the Decision states:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is hereby DENIED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote><br>Agham filed a Motion for Reconsideration with the Court of Appeals. In its Motion for Reconsideration, Agham argued that the alleged leveling of the subject hill by LAMI: (1) was not sanctioned by the DENR since LAMI allegedly had no ECC from the DENR; (2) affected the ecological balance of the affected towns and provinces since such leveling was done without the concurrence of its residents; and (3) instigated the gradual eradication of the strip of land mass in Sta.

Agham then filed its Reply dated 21 February 2013.<br><br>In a Resolution dated 6 March 2013, the Court of Appeals declared that Agham's Motion for Reconsideration was submitted for resolution. Subsequently, Agham filed a Supplemental Reply dated 29 April 2013 reiterating the same arguments.<br><br>In a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> dated 31 May 2013, the Court of Appeals set Agham's Motion for Reconsideration for hearing on 13 June 2013. At the hearing, all parties were given time to argue their case. Thereafter, the Motion for Reconsideration was submitted for resolution.<br><br>Agham then filed a Manifestation dated 17 June 2013 summarizing its arguments. On 4 July 2013, LAMI filed a Motion to Expunge with Ad Cautelam Comment/Opposition. On 11 July 2013, the Court of Appeals, for the last and third time, submitted the Motion for Reconsideration for resolution.<br><br>In an Amended Decision dated 13 September 2013, the Court of Appeals reversed and set aside its original Decision dated 23 November 2012. The dispositive portion of the Decision states;<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Decision dated November 23, 2012 is hereby RECONSIDERED and SET ASIDE and, in lieu thereof, another judgment is rendered GRANTING the petition for WRIT OF KALIKASAN as follows, to wit:<br><br>(1) respondent LNL Archipelago Minerals, Inc. (LAMI) is directed to PERMANENTLY CEASE and [DESIST] from scraping off the land formation in question or from performing any activity/ies in violation of environmental laws resulting in environmental destruction or damage;<br><br>(2) the respondent LAMI as well as the Secretary of Department of Environment and Natural Resources and/or their representatives are directed to PROTECT, PRESERVE, REHABILITATE and/or RESTORE the subject land formation including the plants and trees therein;<br><br>(3) the Secretary of DENR and/or his representative is directed to MONITOR strict compliance with the Decision and Orders of the Court; and make PERIODIC REPORTS on a monthly basis on the execution of the final judgment.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></blockquote><br>Hence, the instant petition.<br><br><u><center><b>The Issues</b></center></u><br>The issues for our resolution are (1) whether LAMI violated the environmental laws as alleged by Agham, and (2) whether LAMI flattened any mountain and caused environmental damage of such magnitude as to prejudice the life, health or property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces.<br><br><u><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b></center></u><br>Petitioner contends that it has the necessary permits and authorization to cut trees on the port site, controverting the allegation of Agham that it violated Section 68 of the Revised Forestry Code, as amended. Petitioner also insists that it did not violate nor is it violating the Mining Act as alleged by Agham. Petitioner argues that it is not conducting any mining activity on the port site since the mine site is about 25 kilometers away from the port site. Further, petitioner adds that after filing its Verified Return dated 21 June 2012, Agham never mentioned again the alleged violation of the Revised Forestry Code, as amended, and the Philippine Mining Act. Instead, Agham changed its position and later claimed that LAMI was flattening a mountain on the port site which was allegedly illegal per se. Petitioner insists that Agham did not even present evidence to establish any environmental damage which is required for the issuance of the privilege of the Writ of Kalikasan.<br><br>Respondents, on the other hand, assert that even if the subject land formation is not a mound, hill or mountain, the fact remains that the scraping and leveling done by petitioner caused serious environmental damage which affects not only the municipality of Sta.

In the permit, LAMI was allowed to cut 37 trees with a total volume of 7.64 cubic meters within the port site, subject to the condition that the trees cut shall be replaced with a ratio of 1-30 fruit and non-bearing fruit trees. Thereafter, the Forest Management Service and Forest Utilization Unit, both under the DENR, issued a Post Evaluation Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> dated 3 May 2012 stating that LAMI properly followed the conditions laid down in the permit.

There are forty four (44) various species of miscellaneous trees counted and left with a computed volume of 6.04 cubic meters.</blockquote>Relative the above findings and in compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit issued, the company should be reminded to replace the trees cut therein as specified in support with the environmental enhancement program of the DENR.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>Since LAMI strictly followed the permit issued by the CENRO and even passed the evaluation conducted after the issuance of the permit, then clearly LAMI had the authority to cut trees and did not violate Section 68 of the Revised Forestry Code, as amended.<br><br>Next, Agham submitted that LAMI allegedly violated Sections 57 and 69 of the Philippine Mining Act.<br><br>Sections 57 and 69 of the Philippine Mining Act state:<br><br><blockquote>Section 57. Expenditure for Community Development and Science and Mining Technology - A contractor shall assist in the development of its mining community, the promotion of the general welfare of its inhabitants, and the development of science and mining technology.<br><br>Section 69. Environmental Protection - Every contractor shall undertake an environmental protection and enhancement program covering the period of the mineral agreement or permit. Such environmental program shall be incorporated in the work program which the contractor or permittee shall submit as an accompanying document to the application for a mineral agreement or permit. The work program shall include not only plans relative to mining operations but also to rehabilitation, regeneration, revegetation and reforestation of mineralized areas, slope stabilization of mined-out and tailings covered areas, aquaculture, watershed development and water conservation; and socioeconomic development.</blockquote><br>These two provisions are inapplicable to this case. First, LAMI is not conducting any mining activity on the port site. LAMI's mine site is about 25 kilometers away from the port site. Second, LAMI secured all the necessary permits and licenses for the construction of a port and LAMI's activity was limited to preparatory works for the port's construction. The Philippine Mining Act deals with mining operations and other mining activities. Sections 57 and 69 deal with the development of a mining community and environmental protection covering a mineral agreement or permit.<br><br>Here, Agham reasoned that LAMI was destroying the environment by cutting mountain trees and leveling a mountain to the damage and detriment of the residents of Zambales and the nearby towns of Pangasinan. Agham simply submitted a picture taken on 4 June 2012 where allegedly the backhoes owned by LAMI were pushing the remnants of the mountain to the sea.<br><br>This explanation, absent any concrete proof, is untenable.<br><br>Clearly, Agham did not give proper justifications for citing Sections 57 and 69 of the Philippine Mining Act. Agham did not even present any evidence that LAMI violated the mining law or any mining undertakings in relation to LAMI's construction of a port facility. Agham only alleged in very general terms that LAMI was destroying the environment and leveling a mountain without conducting any scientific studies or submitting expert testimonies that would corroborate such allegations.<br><br>Section 2(c), Rule 7, Part III of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 2. Contents of the petition. - The verified petition shall contain the following:<br><br>(c) The environmental law, rule or regulation violated or threatened to be violated, the act or omission complained of, and the environmental damage of such magnitude as to prejudice the life, health or property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces.<br></blockquote><br>The Rules are clear that in a Writ of Kalikasan petitioner has the burden to prove the (1) environmental law, rule or regulation violated or threatened to be violated; (2) act or omission complained of; and (3) the environmental damage of such magnitude as to prejudice the life, health or property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces.<br><br>Even the Annotation to the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases states that the magnitude of environmental damage is a condition<i> sine qua non </i>in a petition for the issuance of a Writ of Kalikasan and must be contained in the verified petition.<br><br>Agham, in failing to prove any violation of the Revised Forestry Code, as amended, and the Philippine Mining Act, shifted its focus and then claimed that LAMI allegedly flattened or leveled a mountain.<br><br>The mountain, according to Agham, serves as a natural protective barrier from typhoons and floods to the residents of Zambales and nearby towns of Pangasinan. Thus, Agham argues that once such natural resources are damaged, the residents of these two provinces will be defenseless and their life, health and properties will be at constant risk of being lost.<br><br>However, Agham, in accusing that LAMI allegedly flattened a mountain, did not cite any law allegedly violated by LAMI in relation to this claim. Agham did not present any proof to demonstrate that the local residents in Zambales, and even the nearby towns of Pangasinan, complained of any great danger or harm on the alleged leveling of the land formation which may affect their lives, health or properties. Neither was there any evidence showing of a grave and real environmental damage to the <i>barangay</i> and the surrounding vicinity.<br><br>To belie Agham's contentions, the records, from the testimonies of those experts in their fields, show that there is in fact no mountain in Brgy. Bolitoc, Sta. Cruz, Zambales.<br><br>First, in the Judicial Affidavit<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[47]</sup></font> dated 6 August 2012, the Regional Director of DENR EMB R3, Dir.

The Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB), Regional Office No. Ill, through the OIC of the Geosciences Division, issued a Memorandum dated June 26, 2012 proving that there is no mountain in LAMI's property. The proper description of the landform, according to the said memorandum, is an "elongated mound"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></blockquote><br>Second, LAMI, through the Judicial Affidavit<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> dated 3 August 2012 of Felipe E.

The findings and conclusion of the report provide:<br><br><blockquote>FINDINGS<br><br>1. The Bolitoc LAMI Port Facility is approximately centered at the intersection of geographic coordinates 15¬∞45'00.4" north latitude and 119¬∞53' 19.9" east longitude, x x x. It is bounded on the north by the West Philippine Sea (Bolitoc Bay), on the west and east by the continuation of the elevated landform, and to the south by an unnamed creek and a concrete barangay road connecting the Brgy. Bolitoc to the Zambales National Highway.<br><br>Brgy. Bolitoc also hosts the port facilities of the DMCI and the Shangfil Corporation both of which occupy the former loading site of the defunct Acoje Mining Corporation.<br><br>2. The landform of interest is characterized by a roughly east-west trending elevated and elongated landmass. Within the LAMI site, the elevated landform measures 164 meters in length and about 94 meters in width and is almost parallel to the coastline. It has a maximum elevation located at its eastern end of 26 meters above mean sea level more or less. Its western end has an elevation of 23 meters above mean sea level more or less xxx.

Cruz, Zambales but also the nearby towns of Zambales and Pangasinan.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, in granting the Motion for Reconsideration embodied in its Amended Decision dated 13 September 2013, held that what LAMI did was not to simply level the subject land formation but scrape and remove a small mountain and, thereafter, reclaim a portion of the adjacent waters with the earth it took therefrom, making out of the soil gathered to construct a seaport. The Court of Appeals stated that the scraping off or the cutting of the subject land formation by LAMI would instigate the gradual eradication of the strip of land mass in Brgy. Bolitoc which serves as protective barrier to floods brought about by the swelling or surging of the coastal water moving inward reaching other towns of Zambales and Pangasinan. The Court of Appeals added that the port site is prone to frequent visits of tropical depression and that the coastal portions of the "Sta. Cruz Quadrangle - Zambales and Pangasinan province" are touted to be highly susceptible to landslide and flooding.<br><br>We do not subscribe to the appellate court's view.<br><br>First, the Court of Appeals did not provide any basis, in fact and in law, to support the reversal of its original decision. Agham, in its Motion for Reconsideration, did not present new evidence to refute its claim that LAMI leveled a "mountain" or that there was an environmental damage of considerable significance that will harm the life, health and properties of the residents of the municipality of Sta. Cruz and its neighboring towns or cities, or even the provinces of Zambales and Pangasinan. The pleadings and documents submitted by Agham were just a reiteration of its original position before the original Court of Appeals' decision was promulgated on 23 November 2012.<br><br>It is well-settled that a party claiming the privilege for the issuance of a Writ of Kalikasan has to show that a law, rule or regulation was violated or would be violated. In the present case, the allegation by Agham that two laws - the Revised Forestry Code, as amended, and the Philippine Mining Act - were violated by LAMI was not adequately substantiated by Agham. Even the facts submitted by Agham to establish environmental damage were mere general allegations.<br><br>Second, Agham's allegation that there was a "mountain" in LAM's port site was earlier established as false as the "mountain" was non-existent as proven by the testimonies of the witnesses and reports made by environmental experts and persons who have been educated and trained in their respective fields.<br><br>Third, contrary to Agham's claim that LAMI had no ECC from the DENR, the DENR restored LAMI's ECC. After LAMI was issued a Notice of Violation of its ECC dated 1 June 2012 by the DENR-EMB R3, LAMI complied with all the requirements and its ECC had been reinstated. In the Letter<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> dated 24 October 2012, Dir.

Its Report<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> on the Topographical, Geomorphological and Climatological Characterization of the LAMI Port undertaken in September 2012 stated:<br><br><blockquote>6.0 Findings in Relation to the Petition for Writ of Kalikasan <br><br>x x x x<br><br>1. <i>The LAMI Port is partly situated in a hill and not a mountain</i>. The topographic and geologic maps of NAMRIA and the MGB do not show the presence of a mountain where the port is partly located. The detailed topographic survey moreover indicates that this hill had an original elevation of 23 m.MSL in the portion where it was excavated to accommodate the access road leading to the wharf.<br><br>Mountains attain much higher elevations than 23 m.MSL. Kendall et al. (1967), defines a mountain as having a height of at least 900 meters and are usually characterized by a vertical zonation of landscape and vegetation due to increasing elevations.<br><br>2.<i> No leveling of a mountain was done.</i> The construction of the access road required a V-cut through the hill that lowered it from 23 m.MSL to 7.5 m.MSL. This elevation is still much higher than the flat land surrounding the hill. The hill had an original length of 600 meters through which the V-cut, which has an average width of 26.5 meters, was excavated. Only a small portion of the hill was therefore altered.<br><br>The topographic survey further reveals that the total volume of earth material removed is 24,569 cubic meters, which would fit a room that has a length, width and height of 29 meters. This amount of earth material does not constitute the volume of a mountain.<br><br>3. <i>The hill is too small and not in the right location to protect against typhoons.</i> The hill cannot serve as a natural protective barrier against typhoons in Zambales and some towns of Pangasinan because it is too small compared to the magnitude of typhoons. Typhoons approach the country from east and move in a west to northwest direction through Zambales Province as clarified in Figure 7. They are even able to cross the Sierra Madre Range and the Zambales Range before reaching Zambales Province. Since the port is situated at the western coastline of Zambales, it would be the last thing a typhoon would pass by as it moves through Zambales.<br><br>4. <i>The hill is too small to protect against the Southwest Monsoon</i>. The hill does not shield any area from the heavy rains that batter the country during the Southwest Monsoon. It is too small to alter the effect of the Southwest Monsoon in the way that the Sierra Madre Range forces the Northwest Monsoon to rise over it and release much of its moisture as orographic precipitation on the windward side of the range such that the leeward side is drier.<br><br>5.<i> The hill is not in the right location to protect against flooding due to heavy rains</i>. The hill does not protect against the floods that occur from heavy rains. Since Zambales regionally slopes down to the west, flood water during heavy rains will move from east to west following the flow direction of rivers in the area. Flood water from the Zambales Range will inundate the coastal plain first before reaching the coastline where the hill is situated. Figure 11 depicts the flow direction of flood water in the municipality.<br><br>6. <i>The hill is too small to protect against floods due to storm surges</i>. Storm surges appear as large waves that are caused by the pushing of the wind on the surface of the sea or ocean during storm events. Since the hill has a present length of only 420 meters, it is too small to prevent flooding due to storm surges. The large waves will just skirt the hill and sweep through the low-lying coastland to the west and east of the hill.<br><br>The hill shields against the direct impact of large, south-moving waves to several homes located immediately south of the hill. Since the V-cut of the access road is small compared to the rest of the hill and terminates at a relatively high 7.5 m.MSL, this protection offered by the hill is not significantly diminished.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></blockquote><br>Further, the DENR composite team, in its Report of Investigation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> conducted on 20-21 June 2012 on LAMI's port site to ensure that LAMI undertook mitigating measures in its property, found that LAMI's activities posed only a minimal or insignificant impact to the environment. The relevant portions of the Report state:<br><br><blockquote>Findings and Observations:<br><br>The composite team gathered data and the following are the initial observations:<br><br>1. Site preparation which includes site grading/surface stripping, low ridge cut and fill and reclamation works were observed to have been undertaken within the project area;<br><br>2. A total volume of approximately 11,580 cubic meters of soil cut/stripped from low ridge was noted being used for causeway construction. Part of the discarded soil with a volume of 5,843 cubic meters was already used for causeway preparation while the remaining 5,735 cubic meters was noted still on stockpile area;<br><br>3. Discarded soil generated from ridge cut and fill consists of clay with sandstone and shale;<br><br>4. The partial low ridge cut and fill poses minimal or insignificant impact to the environment due to threats of storm surges, strong winds and flooding because the protective natural barriers against northeast monsoon are the mountain ranges in the eastern part of Zambales and Pangasinan which are geologically and historically effective as in the case of the adjoining and operational ports of the DMCI and Shang Fil.<br><br>5. The height of the low ridge is still maintained at an elevation of 23.144 meters above sea level while the constructed access road to the causeway has an elevation of 7.46 meters with a width of 8 meters and length of 80-100 meters only.<br>Remarks and Recommendation:<br><br><b>The construction of the access road on the low ridge does not pose adverse environmental impact to the adjoining communities more so to the larger areas or the entire province of Zambales and Pangasinan.</b><br><br>It was determined as a result of our verification and based on the above findings supported with field GPS reading that <b>there had been no leveling of the mountain undertaken in the project site as there is no mountain existing inside the area</b> covered by the ECC issued by EMB-Region 3. The landform claimed by Mayor Marty to be a mountain is actually an elongated low ridge with a peak of approximately 23 meters above sea level which is located in a private land falling under Block 1, Alienable and Disposable Land per LC Map 635 with Lot No. 2999 originally owned by Mr. Severo Monsalud which was transferred to Sta. Cruz Mineral Port Corporation with a Contract of Lease with LAMI (data provided by CENRO Masinloc through a Memorandum dated June 4, 2012). The proponent (LAMI) only implemented road cutting of low ridge in the middle to make an access way to the proposed marine loading facility. More so, tree cutting done by LAMI is covered by a Permit to Cut issued by DENR-Region 3-CENRO, Masinloc which is responsible for the inventory and monitoring of cut trees.<br><br>x x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63] </sup>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, from all the foregoing, we agree with the appellate court, in its original Decision dated 23 November 2012, when it denied the petition for a Writ ofKalikasan:<br><br><blockquote>As between the too general and very hypothetical allegation of large-scale environmental damage at one hand, and the remarks of government experts on the other, We are inclined to give more credit to the latter.
