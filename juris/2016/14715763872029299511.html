				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">To sustain a conviction for cattle-rustling, the identity of the stolen cattle must be proven with certainty. Otherwise, the accused must be acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt.<br><br>Further, a "request for appearance" issued by law enforcers to a person identified as a suspect is akin to an "invitation." Thus, the suspect is covered by the rights of an accused while under custodial investigation. Any admission obtained from the "request for appearance" without the assistance of counsel is inadmissible in evidence.<br><br>Petitioner Ariel Lopez (Lopez) was charged with violation of Presidential Decree No. 533.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The accusatory portion of the Information reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about July 17, 2002, in the City of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-mentioned accused, with intent to gain with grave abuse of confidence and without the knowledge and consent of the complainant, wilfully, unlawfully, and feloniously took, stole and carried away one (1) female carabao valued at <b>Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos</b>, more or less, belonging to <b>Teresita D. Perez</b>, to the latter's damage and prejudice in the aforesaid amount.<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Lopez pleaded not guilty during his arraignment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>During trial, Mario Perez (Perez) testified that he purchased the female carabao from a certain Enrique Villanueva. The purchase was evidenced by a Certificate of Transfer of Large Cattle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Perez narrated that he tied his carabao to a coconut tree located inside the property of a certain Constancio Genosas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Around 5:00 a.m. on July 17, 2002, Perez discovered that the female carabao was missing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Perez claimed that he searched for his carabao for over a month. After, he went to the Barangay Captain of Wines to ask for assistance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Prosecution witness Felix Alderete (Alderete) testified that he worked as an errand boy for Lopez from 2000 to 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Alderete claimed that he slept at Lopez's house on July 17, 2002. Around 3:45 a.m. of the next day, Alderete and Lopez went to Constancio Genosas' property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Lopez untied the carabao and allegedly told Alderete that he would "bring the carabao to his boss named Boy Platan at Malagos."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> He ordered Alderete to deliver the carabao to Malagos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Alderete, not knowing whether the carabao was owned by Lopez, followed Lopez's instructions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Lopez and Boy Platan met Alderete in Malagos. From there, the carabao was loaded on a vehicle headed to Davao City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The next day, Alderete learned that there was a commotion in Wines, Baguio District, regarding Perez's lost carabao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Afraid of being accused for the loss of the carabao, Alderete sought help from the barangay police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Teresita Perez (Teresita) testified that Barangay Police Moralde informed her and Perez, her husband, that Lopez stole their carabao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Subsequently, a confrontation took place at the barangay police station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> During the confrontation, Lopez admitted to taking the carabao and promised to pay indemnification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Police Officer III Leo Lozarito (PO3 Lozarito) corroborated Teresita's testimony and stated that a request for Lopez's appearance was issued, but no custodial investigation was conducted. He claimed that he simply allowed Lopez and Teresita to "confront each other."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> He also stated that Lopez wanted to settle by paying for the carabao, but the parties were unable to agree on the price.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>The defense presented Lopez as a witness during trial. Lopez denied stealing the carabao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> He also denied knowing Alderete. He stated that he was a farmer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and that at the time the offense was committed, he was working at his home in Wines, Baguio District, Davao City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Lopez testified that he knew Teresita because she "used to borrow rice and feeds from his parents."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> He was surprised that she accused him of stealing her carabao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Lopez also testified that he went to the police station where he denied stealing any carabao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> After his appearance at the police station, he went home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The defense presented another witness, Marvin Bongato, who claimed to have seen a certain "Edoy" riding a carabao in the morning of July 17, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> He denied seeing Alderete riding a carabao on the same date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The trial court found Lopez guilty of cattle-rustling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> It gave credence to Alderete's testimony that Lopez ordered him to bring the carabao to Malagos.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The trial court also noted Alderete's statement that "he knew Lopez was engaged in the buy and sell of large cattle."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In addition, the trial court discussed that Lopez's defense of denial had no credence because during the meeting at the police station, Lopez offered to reimburse the value of the carabao and even knelt in front of Teresita to ask for forgiveness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the trial court's ruling states:<br><blockquote>In view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered finding Ariel Lopez GUILTY of the crime charged. He is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from TEN (10) years and ONE (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i> maximum to FOURTEEN (14) years, EIGHT (8) months and ONE (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium.<br><br>He is likewise ordered to pay Mario and Teresita Perez the sum of FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P5,000.00) representing the value of the stolen carabao.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Lopez filed before the Court of Appeals an appeal arguing that the prosecution was unable to prove that the carabao allegedly stolen was the same carabao owned by Mario and Teresita Perez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> He argued that the "request for appearance . . . issued by PO3 Lozarito was in violation of his custodial rights."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals ruled<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> that the Certificate of Transfer of Large Cattle and Alderete's testimony were sufficient to prove the ownership of the lost carabao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Further, the Court of Appeals held that there was no violation of Lopez's custodial rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> PO3 Lozarito did not ask questions, and Lopez was not compelled to make any admissions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Lopez negotiated for a settlement with Mario and Teresita Perez, which could not be considered as custodial investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>However, the Court of Appeals modified the penalty imposed by the trial court. It discussed that Presidential Decree No. 533 is not a special law, but an amendment of Article 310 of the Revised Penal Code. Hence, Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code should apply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals Decision reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the RTC is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>, with the modification that appellant Ariel G. Lopez is hereby <b>SENTENCED</b> to suffer an indeterminate prison term of four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day of <i>prision correccional</i> maximum, as <i>minimum</i>, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium, as maximum.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Lopez moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> but the Motion was denied in the Resolution dated March 6, 2014.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>Petitioner Ariel Lopez, through counsel, filed before this Court a Petition for Review on Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> on April 30, 2014.<br><br>In the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> dated July 28, 2014, this Court required respondent to comment and directed the Court of Appeals Clerk of Court to elevate the records of this case.<br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General filed its Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> on December 1, 2014.<br><br>In the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> dated February 2, 2015, this Court noted the Office of the Solicitor General's Comment and required petitioner to file a reply.<br><br>On July 7, 2015, counsel for petitioner filed a Manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> informing this Court that when he received a copy of the February 2, 2015 Resolution, he had yet to receive a copy of respondent's Comment. He subsequently realized that he might have received it, but it could have been among the documents that were burned when the Hall of Justice of Cagayan de Oro was razed by fire. In any case, petitioner would no longer file a reply because petitioner's arguments on why he should be acquitted were discussed in the appeal brief, in the Motion for Reconsideration, as well as in the Petition for Review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>In his Petition for Review on Certiorari, petitioner reiterates the arguments raised in his appeal before the Court of Appeals. Petitioner argues that the prosecution failed to prove Mario and Teresita Perez's ownership of the lost carabao. Alderete had no personal knowledge of the lost carabao's appearance, or where it grazed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Petitioner alleges that he is "engaged in raising livestock, like pigs, chickens and carabaos."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> He also alleges that the area where the carabao was taken is "a rural and agricultural area, where the abundance of carabaos is not uncommon."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>In addition, Alderete himself doubted whether theft was committed. Prosecution witness Urcesio Moralde testified:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">And, specifically, what Felix did say [sic] with respect to his participation in the alleged carabao theft?

Alderete testified "that the carabao he and petitioner allegedly untied and brought to Malagos was still pregnant[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> On the other hand, Perez testified "that the carabao had an offspring, indicating that the carabao was not pregnant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>Alderete also testified that the carabao was taken 3:45 a.m., while his affidavit states that the carabao was taken at night.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>Further, Alderete claimed that he heard about a stolen carabao the following day; hence, "he immediately reported the incident to the barangay police."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> He was allegedly told by the police that they would notify the Barangay Captain and the carabao's owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>However, Perez testified that he had been looking for his carabao for a month before he reported the loss to the Barangay Captain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> This shows that Perez was not immediately informed by the barangay police regarding Alderete's statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>Petitioner avers that the date when the carabao was allegedly stolen was not proven with certainty. Teresita was unable to cite what year the carabao was stolen. She only testified that the carabao was stolen at 5:00 a.m. of July 27. She explained that she learned of the loss from her husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Perez, Teresita's husband, testified "that the carabao was lost on July 17, 2002."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, the police blotter states that the carabao was stolen on July 15, 2002, "at 5:30 in the morning."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Petitioner further argues that his alleged admission is inadmissible in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> He was summoned by the police because he was suspected of stealing a carabao.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Petitioner points out that custodial investigation includes:<br><blockquote>the practice of issuing an "invitation" to a person who is investigated in connection with an offense he is suspected to have committed, without prejudice to the liability of the "inviting" officer for any violation of law. And any uncounselled confession or admission obtained by the accused on such occasion shall be inadmissible against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br></blockquote>On the other hand, respondent cites Perez's testimony and argues that it established ownership over the carabao:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">Q: </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">You said the carabao was lost.

As provided under Rule 45, Section 1 of the Rules of Court:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 45 <br>APPEAL BY CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT<br></center><br>SECTION 1. <i>Filing of petition with Supreme Court</i>. — A party desiring to appeal by certiorari from a judgment or final order or resolution of the Court of Appeals, the Sandiganbayan, the Court of Tax Appeals, the Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by law, may file with the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>. The petition may include an application for a writ of preliminary injunction or other provisional remedies and shall raise only questions of law, which must be distinctly set forth. The petitioner may seek the same provisional remedies by verified motion filed in the same action or proceeding at any time during its pendency.<br></blockquote>However, there are instances when this Court allows questions of fact in a Rule 45 petition for review. These instances include the following:<br><blockquote>(1) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (2) when the findings are ground&amp;d on speculations; (3) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken; (4) when the judgment of the Court of Appeals is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the factual findings are conflicting; (6) when the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case and its findings are contrary to the admissions of the parties; (7) when the Court of Appeals overlooked undisputed facts which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; (8) when the findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (9) when the facts set forth by the petitioner are not disputed by the respondent; and (10) when the findings of the Court of Appeals are premised on the absence of evidence and are contradicted by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br></blockquote>There is a question of law "when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> and there is a question of fact "when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>In this case, petitioner asks this Court to review the evidence and argues that the prosecution was unable to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Thus, petitioner raises a question of fact. Nevertheless, this Court gives due course to the Petition because it falls under the exceptions as to when this Court may entertain questions of fact. A review of the record shows that the trial court and the Court of Appeals misapprehended the facts, and their findings are contradicted by the evidence presented.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>The prosecution failed to prove one of the elements of cattle-rustling, specifically, that the lost carabao of Mario and Teresita Perez is the same carabao allegedly stolen by petitioner.<br><br>Presidential Decree No. 533 defines cattle-rustling as:<br><blockquote><b>Section 2.</b> <i>Definition of terms</i> - The following terms shall mean and be understood to be as herein defined:<br><br>. . . .<br><br>c. Cattle rustling is the taking away by any means, method or scheme, without the consent of the owner/raiser, of any of the abovementioned animals whether or not for profit or gain, whether committed with or without violence against or intimidation of any person or force upon things. It includes the killing of large cattle, or taking the meat or hide without the consent of the owner/raiser.<br></blockquote>The elements of cattle-rustling are:<br><blockquote>(1) large cattle is taken; (2) it belongs to another; (3) the taking is done without the consent of the owner or raiser; (4) the taking is done by any means, method or scheme; (5) the taking is done with or without intent to gain; and (6) the taking is accomplished with or without violence or intimidation against persons or force upon things.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br></blockquote>Not all of the elements of cattle-rustling were proven by the prosecution.

Alderete did not mention any distinguishing mark on the carabao that petitioner allegedly stole. In other cases involving cattle-rustling, the identity of the stolen cattle was proven with certainty because of distinguishing marks on the cattle.<br><br>In <i>Pil-ey v.

Thus, the identity of the stolen cow was proven.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Perez claims that he owns the carabao allegedly taken by petitioner because he has a "<i>Katibayan ng Paglilipat ng Pagmamay-ari ng Malalaking Baka</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> However, the Certificate only proves that he owns a carabao.
