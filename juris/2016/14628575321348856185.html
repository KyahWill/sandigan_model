Ambassador Romulo also formally expressed the conformity of the Philippine Government to the approval of said act to the American Senate prior to its approval.

The evidentiary value of the said order and the corresponding exhibit duly published in the Official Gazette which, as mentioned, are official records of a duty especially enjoined by laws in force at the time of its issuance, must be sustained in the absence of strong, complete and conclusive proof of its falsity or nullity,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> and must prevail over the questioned certificate.<br><br>Notably, these findings should not be taken as an adjudication on the ownership of the subject lands. As priorly intimated, they are but determinations of whether or not the certificate of title sought to be reconstituted is authentic, genuine, and in force and effect at the time it was lost or destroyed, which, based on case law, are central to resolving petitions for reconstitution of title. Clearly, a reconstitution of title proceeding involves only the re-issuance of a new certificate of title lost or destroyed in its original form and condition.

If the President shall not so order within sixty days after the filing of such application or if the claimant shall have filed the notice as above required and shall have made no application to the President, said claimant may institute a suit in equity in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court of the United States for the district in which such claimant resides, or, if a corporation, where it has its principal place of business (to which suit the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States, as the case may be, shall be made a party defendant), to establish the interest, right, title, or debt so claimed, and if so established the court shall order the payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery to said claimant of the money or other property so held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States or the interest therein to which the court shall determine said claimant is entitled.
