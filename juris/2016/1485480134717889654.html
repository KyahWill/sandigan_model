Thus, when complainant accessed the same, she violated his constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy.<br><br>The defense is untenable.<br><br>Facebook is currently the most popular social media site, having surpassed one (1) billion registered accounts and with 1.71 billion monthly active users.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> <i> Social media </i> are web-based platforms that enable online interaction and facilitate users to generate and share content. There are various classifications<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> of social media platforms and one can be classified under the "social networking sites" such as Facebook.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>Facebook is a "voluntary social network to which members subscribe and submit information. x x x It has a worldwide forum enabling friends to share information such as thoughts, links, and photographs, with one another."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Users register at this site, create a personal profile or an open book of who they are, add other users as friends, and exchange messages, including automatic notifications when they update their profile.

In <i>H v.

This intention can materialize in cyberspace through the utilization of Facebook's privacy tools. In other words, utilization of these privacy tools is the manifestation, in the cyber world, of the user's invocation of his or her right to informational privacy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>The bases of the instant complaint are the Facebook posts maligning and insulting complainant, which posts respondent insists were set to private view. However, the latter has failed to offer evidence that he utilized any of the privacy tools or features of Facebook available to him to protect his posts, or that he restricted its privacy to a select few. Therefore, without any positive evidence to corroborate his statement that the subject posts, as well as the comments thereto, were visible only to him and his circle of friends, respondent's statement is, at best, self-serving, thus deserving scant consideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Moreover, even if the Court were to accept respondent's allegation that his posts were limited to or viewable by his "Friends" only, there is no assurance that the same - or other digital content that he uploads or publishes on his Facebook profile - will be safeguarded as within the confines of privacy, in light of the following:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="5%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">(1)</div> </td> <td width="95%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Facebook "allows the world to be more open and connected by giving its users the tools to interact and share in any conceivable way";</div> </td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(2)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">A good number of Facebook users "befriend" other users who are total strangers;</div> </td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(3)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">The sheer number of "Friends" one user has, usually by the hundreds; and</div> </td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top"><br></td><td valign="top"><br></td></tr><tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY"></div> <br></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">(4)</div> </td> <td> <div align="JUSTIFY">A user's Facebook friend can "share" the former's post, or "tag" others who are not Facebook friends with the former, despite its being visible only to his or her own Facebook friends.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></div> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br><br>Thus, restricting the privacy of one's Facebook posts to "Friends" does not guarantee absolute protection from the prying eyes of another user who does not belong to one's circle of friends. The user's own Facebook friend can share said content or tag his or her own Facebook friend thereto, regardless of whether the user tagged by the latter is Facebook friends or not with the former. Also, when the post is shared or when a person is tagged, the respective Facebook friends of the person who shared the post or who was tagged can view the post, the privacy setting of which was set at "Friends."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Under the circumstances, therefore, respondent's claim of violation of right to privacy is negated.<br><br>Neither can the Court accept the argument that the subject remarks were written in the exercise of his freedom of speech and expression.<br><br>Time and again, it has been held that the freedom of speech and of expression, like all constitutional freedoms, is not absolute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> While the freedom of expression and the right of speech and of the press are among the most zealously protected rights in the Constitution, every person exercising them, as the Civil Code stresses, is obliged to act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> As such, the constitutional right of freedom of expression may not be availed of to broadcast lies or half-truths, insult others, destroy their name or reputation or bring them into disrepute.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>A punctilious scrutiny of the Facebook remarks complained of disclosed that they were ostensibly made with malice tending to insult and tarnish the reputation of complainant and BMGI. Calling complainant a "quack doctor," <i>"Reyna ng Kaplastikan," "Reyna ng Payola," </i>and <i>"Reyna ng Kapalpakan," </i>and insinuating that she has been bribing people to destroy respondent smacks of bad faith and reveals an intention to besmirch the name and reputation of complainant, as well as BMGI. Respondent also ascribed criminal negligence upon complainant and BMGI by posting that complainant disfigured (<i>"binaboy") </i>his client Norcio, labeling BMGI a "Frankenstein Factory," and calling out a boycott of BMGI's services all these despite the pendency of the criminal cases that Norcio had already filed against complainant. He even threatened complainant with conviction for criminal negligence and <i>estafa </i>which is contrary to one's obligation "to act with justice."Â·<br><br>In view of the foregoing, respondent's inappropriate and obscene language, and his act of publicly insulting and undermining the reputation of complainant through the subject Facebook posts are, therefore, in complete and utter violation of the following provisions in the Code of Professional Responsibility:<br><br><blockquote>Rule 7.03 - A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor shall he, whether in public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal profession.<br><br>Rule 8.01 - A lawyer shall not, in his professional dealings, use language which is abusive, offensive or otherwise improper.<br><br>Rule 19.01 - A lawyer shall employ only fair and honest means to attain the lawful objectives of his client and shall not present, participate in presenting or threaten to present unfounded criminal charges to obtain an improper advantage in any case or proceeding.</blockquote><br><br>By posting the subject remarks on Facebook directed at complainant and BMGI, respondent disregarded the fact that, as a lawyer, he is bound to observe proper decorum at all times, be it in his public or private life. He overlooked the fact that he must behave in a manner befitting of an officer of the court, that is, respectful, firm, and decent. Instead, he acted inappropriately and rudely; he used words unbecoming of an officer of the law, and conducted himself in an aggressive way by hurling insults and maligning complainant's and BMGI's reputation.<br><br>That complainant is a public figure and/or a celebrity and therefore, a public personage who is exposed to criticism<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[72]</sup></font> does not justify respondent's disrespectful language. It is the cardinal condition of all criticism that it shall be <i>bona fide, </i>and shall not spill over the walls of decency and propriety.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> In this case, respondent's remarks against complainant breached the said walls, for which reason the former must be administratively sanctioned.<br><br>"Lawyers may be disciplined even for any conduct committed in their private capacity, as long as their misconduct reflects their want of probity or good demeanor, a good character being an essential qualification for the admission to the practice of law and for continuance of such privilege. When the Code of Professional Responsibility or the Rules of Court speaks of conduct or misconduct, the reference is not confined to one's behavior exhibited in connection with the performance of lawyers' professional duties, but also covers any misconduct, whichâ€”albeit unrelated to the actual practice of their professionâ€”would show them to be unfit for the office and unworthy of the privileges which their license and the law invest in them."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Accordingly, the Court finds that respondent should be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year, as originally recommended by the IBP-CBD, with a stem warning that a repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> respondent Atty.
