Manuel were purchasers in good faith.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is partly granted.<br><br>Preliminarily, the rule is settled that the remedy of appeal by <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court contemplates only questions of law, not of fact. While it is not the function of the Court to re-examine, winnow and weigh anew the respective sets of evidence of the parties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> there are, however, recognized exceptions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> one of which is when the inference drawn from the facts was manifestly mistaken, as in this case.<br><br>It is undisputed that at the time the Real Estate Mortgage was constituted on July 1, 1991, Roque was already deceased. Upon his death on April 17, 1991, the conjugal partnership between him and his spouse, Susana, was dissolved pursuant to Article 126 (1)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> of the Family Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and an implied ordinary co-ownership arose among Susana and the other heirs of Roque with respect to his share in the assets of the conjugal partnership pending liquidation. The ensuing implied ordinary co-ownership is governed by Article 493 of the Civil Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote>Art. 493. Each co-owner shall have the full ownership of his part and of the fruits and benefits pertaining thereto, and he may therefore alienate, assign or mortgage it, and even substitute another person in its enjoyment, except when personal rights are involved. But <b>the effect of the alienation or the mortgage, with respect to the co-owners, shall be limited to the portion which may be allotted to him in the division upon the termination of the co-ownership</b>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, although Susana is a co-owner with her children with respect to Roque's share in the conjugal partnership, she could not yet assert or claim title to any specific portion thereof without an actual partition of the property being first done either by agreement or by judicial decree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> While she herself as co-owner had the right to mortgage or even sell her undivided interest in the subject property, she could not mortgage or otherwise dispose of the same in its entirety without the consent of the other co-owners. Consequently, the validity of the subject Real Estate Mortgage and the subsequent foreclosure proceedings therefor conducted in favor of respondent bank should be limited only to the portion which may be allotted to it, as Susana's successor-in-interest, in the event of partition, thereby making it a co-owner<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> with petitioners pending partition. Thus, in <i>Rural &amp; Bank of Cabadbaran, Inc. v. Melecio-Yap</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the Court held:<br><blockquote>While Erna, as herself a co-owner, by virtue of Article 493 of the Civil Code, had the right to mortgage or even sell her undivided interest in the said properties, she, could not, however, dispose of or mortgage the subject properties in their entirety without the consent of the other co-owners. Accordingly, the validity of the subject real estate mortgage and the subsequent foreclosure proceedings therefor conducted in favor of RBCI <b>should be limited only to the portion which may be allotted to it (as the successor-in-interest of Erna) in the event of partition</b>. In this relation, the CA's directive to remand the case to the RTC in order to determine the exact extent of the respective rights, interests, shares and participation of respondents and RBCI over the subject properties, and thereafter, effect a final division, adjudication and partition in accordance with law remains in order. Meanwhile, the writ of possession issued in favor of RBCI, and all proceedings relative thereto should be set aside considering that the latter's specific possessory rights to the said properties remain undetermined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Moreover, although the Court concurs with the CA's finding that respondent bank was a mortgagee in bad faith for having failed to exercise greater care and due diligence in verifying the ownership of the subject property,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> contrary to the CA, the Court finds that Sps. Manuel are not innocent purchasers for value who can acquire title to the subject entire property.<br><br>While the rule is that every person dealing with registered land may safely rely on the correctness of the certificate of title issued therefor and the law will in no way oblige him to go beyond the certificate to determine the condition of the property, <b>where the land sold is in the possession of a person other than the vendor, <i>as in this case</i>, the purchaser must go beyond the certificate of title and make inquiries concerning the actual possessor</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> As this Court explained in the case of <i>Sps. Mathay v. CA</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><blockquote>Although it is a recognized principle that a person dealing [with] a registered land need not go beyond its certificate of title, it is also a firmly settled rule that where there are circumstances which would put a party on guard and prompt him to investigate or inspect the property being sold to him, such as the presence of occupants/tenants thereon, <b>it is, of course, expected from the purchaser of a valued piece of land to inquire first into the status or nature of possession of the occupants</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, whether or not the occupants possess the land <i>en concepto de dueño</i>, in concept of owner. As is the common practice in the real estate industry, an ocular inspection of the premises involved is a safeguard a cautious and prudent purchaser usually takes. <u>Should he find out that the land he intends to buy is occupied by anybody else other than the seller who, as in this case, is not in actual possession, it would then be incumbent upon the purchaser to verify the extent of the occupant's possessory rights.</u> <b>The failure of a prospective buyer to take such precautionary steps would mean negligence on his part and would thereby preclude him from claiming or invoking the rights of a "purchaser in good faith."</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Here, petitioners were in possession of the subject property when Sps. Manuel bought the same on February 19, 1997 (and even up to the filing of the amended complaint before the RTC on September 3, 2007).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> However, records do not show that Sps. Manuel inspected the property and inquired into the nature of petitioners' possession and/or the extent of their possessory rights as a measure of precaution which may reasonably be required of a prudent man in a similar situation, and thereby discover the irregularity in the acquisition of title by the respondent bank. Sps. Manuel, therefore, failed to exercise the diligence required in protecting their rights; as such, the Court cannot ascribe good faith to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, as correctly pointed out<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> by petitioners, the claim that one is an innocent purchaser for value is a matter of defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Hence, while petitioners alleged that Sps. Manuel were purchasers in bad faith,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> the rule is that he who asserts the status of a purchaser in good faith and for value has the burden of proving the same, and this <i>onus probandi</i> cannot be discharged by mere invocation of the legal presumption of good faith, <i>i.e.</i>, that everyone is presumed to act in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Besides, the fact that respondent bank succeeded in consolidating ownership over the subject property in its name did not terminate the existing co-ownership between it and petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> In <i>Nufable v. Nufable</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> the Court had the occasion to rule:<br><blockquote>[A] co-owner does not lose his part ownership of a co-owned property when his share is mortgaged by another co-owner without the former's knowledge and consent as in the case at bar. It has likewise been ruled that the mortgage of the inherited property is not binding against co-heirs who never benefitted.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x [W]hen the subject property was mortgaged by Angel Custodio, he had no right to mortgage the entire property but only with respect to his 1/4 <i><i>pro indiviso</i></i> share as the property was subject to the successional rights of the other heirs of the late Esdras. Moreover, <b>in case of foreclosure, a sale would result in the transmission of title to the buyer which is feasible only if the seller can be in a position to convey ownership of the things sold</b>. And in one case, it was held that a foreclosure would be ineffective unless the mortgagor has title to the property to be foreclosed. Therefore, <b>as regards the remaining 3/4 <i>pro indiviso</i> share, the same was held in trust for the party rightfully entitled thereto</b>, who are the private respondents herein.<br><br>Pursuant to Article 1451 of the Civil Code, when land passes by succession to any person and he causes the legal title to be put in the name of another, a trust is established by implication of law for the benefit of the true owner. Likewise, under Article 1456 of the same Code, if property is acquired through mistake or fraud, the person obtaining it is, by force of law, considered a trustee of an implied trust for the benefit of the person from whom the property comes. In the case of <i>Noel vs. [CA]</i>, this Court held that "<b>a buyer of a parcel of land at a public auction to satisfy a judgment against a widow acquired only one-half interest on the land corresponding to the share of the widow and the other half belonging to the heirs of her husband became impressed with a constructive trust in behalf of said heirs</b>."<br><br>Neither does the fact that DBP succeeded in consolidating ownership over the subject property in its name terminate the existing co­ ownership. Registration of property is not a means of acquiring ownership. When the subject property was sold to and consolidated in the name of DBP, it being the winning bidder in the public auction, DBP merely held the 3/4 portion in trust for the private respondents. <b>When petitioner Nelson purchased the said property, he merely stepped into the shoes of DBP and acquired whatever rights and obligations appertain thereto.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote>In light of the foregoing, Sps. Manuel merely stepped into the shoes of respondent bank and acquired only the rights and obligations appertaining thereto. Thus, while they have been issued a certificate of title over the entire property, they shall: (<i>a</i>) only acquire what validly pertains to respondent bank as successor-in-interest of Susana in the event of partition; and (<i>b</i>) hold the shares therein pertaining to the co-owners who did not consent to the mortgage, <i>i.e.</i>, petitioners, in trust for the latter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> pending partition.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>PARTLY GRANTED</b>. The Decision dated February 14, 2014 and the Resolution dated October 2, 2014 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 99519 are hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>. A new judgment is <b>ENTERED</b> as follows:<br><br>(1) <b>DECLARING</b> the Real Estate Mortgage dated July 1, 1991 <b>VOID</b> with respect to the share of deceased Roque Magsano;<br><br>(2) <b>DECLARING</b> respondents-spouses Eddie V.

I believe this is inaccurate. Article 493 provides:<br><blockquote>ART. 493. Each co-owner shall have the full ownership of his part and of the fruits and benefits pertaining thereto, and he may therefore alienate, assign or mortgage it, and even substitute another person in its enjoyment, except when personal rights are involved. But the effect of the alienation or mortgage, with respect to the co-owners, shall be limited to the portion which may be allotted to him in the division upon the termination of the co-ownership.<br></blockquote>This article recognizes the absolute ownership by a co-owner of his aliquot or undivided share and his right to alienate, assign or mortgage and even substitute another person in its enjoyment. However, the co-owner's right to alienate is limited to only his undivided share and does not in any way affect any definite portion of the thing owned in common since before partition a co-owner will not know what portion of the property will actually belong to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The situation in this case involved Susana, the surviving spouse, executing a mortgage over the entire subject conjugal property without the consent of the other heirs of Roque, Susana's deceased husband. This is a situation different from Article 493 because, clearly, Susana did not mortgage only her pro-indiviso share therein, but the entire property. That being the case, the ruling of the Supreme Court in <i>Estoque v. Pajimula</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> through Justice J. B. L. Reyes, observed:<br><blockquote>x x x The deed of sale to Estoque x x x clearly specifies the object sold as the southeastern third portion of Lot 802 of the Rosario Cadastre, with an area of 840 square meters, more or less. Granting that the seller, Crispina Perez Vda. de Aquitania could not have sold this particular portion of the lot owned in common by her and her two brothers, Lorenzo and Ricardo Perez, by no means does it follow that she intended to sell to appellant Estoque her 1/3 undivided interest in the lot aforementioned. There is nothing in the deed of sale to justify such inference. That the seller could have validly sold her one-third undivided interest to appellant is no proof that she did choose to sell the same. <i>Ab posse ad actu non valet illatio</i>.<br></blockquote>In <i>Estoque</i>, a specific portion of a co-owned property was sold, albeit a specific portion of a land that was owned in common. I believe that this is no different from the situation of Susana who sold the entire co-owned property, that is, a specific parcel of land when she only had an undivided interest therein. Stated differently, the rationale for not recognizing the effectivity of the disposition over a specific portion equally applies to the disposition by a co-owner of the entire co-owned or undivided property that is more than the undivided share rightfully pertaining to the disposing co-owner.<br><br><i>Estoque</i> characterizes the contract entered into by the disposing co­owner as "ineffective, for lack of power in the vendor to sell the specific portion described in the deed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> This characterization makes room for a subsequent ratification of the contract by the other co-owners or validation in case the disposing co-owner acquires subsequently the undivided interests of the other co-owners. Such subsequent ratification or acquisition will validate and make the contract fully effective.<br><br><i>Estoque</i> was a decision rendered by this Court <i>en banc</i>, and has not been expressly overturned<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>; hence, it remains a sound case law, which I believe should be the controlling jurisprudence.<br><br>Even if Article 493 is inapplicable in this case, I concur in the conclusion that the validity of the mortgage executed by Susana binds her undivided interest in the subject conjugal property based on the principle of estoppel. Under Article 1431 of the Civil Code, "[t]hrough estoppel an admission or representation is rendered conclusive upon the person making it, and cannot be denied or disproved as against the person relying thereon."<br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Ramirez v.
