It ruled that in the absence of the mandatory written notice of the sale to respondent, the prescriptive period to file a petition for redemption never commenced to run.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, petitioner moved for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> dated March 5, 2015; hence, this petition.<br><br><center><b>The Issue Before the Court</b><br></center><br>The essential issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA erred in ruling that respondent is entitled to redeem the subject land.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br>The petition is meritorious.<br><br>An agricultural lessor has the right to sell his land, with or without the knowledge of the agricultural lessee, subject, however, to the latter's right of redemption over the said land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In this relation, Section 12 of RA 3844, as amended, pertinently provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 12.<i> Lessee's Right of Redemption</i>. -<b> In case the landholding is sold to a third person without the knowledge of the agricultural lessee, the latter shall have the right to redeem the same </b>at a reasonable price and consideration: <i>Provided</i>, That where there are two or more agricultural lessees, each shall be entitled to said right of redemption only to the extent of the area actually cultivated by him. <b>The right of redemption under this Section may be exercised within one hundred eighty days from <u>notice in writing which shall be served by the vendee on all lessees affected and the Department of Agrarian Reform upon the registration of the sale</u>, and shall have priority over any other right of legal redemption. The redemption price shall be the reasonable price of the land at the time of the sale</b>. (Emphases and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Pursuant to the foregoing provision, the right of redemption is validly exercised upon compliance with the following requirements: (<i>a</i>) the redemptioner must be an agricultural lessee or share tenant; (<i>b</i>) the land must have been sold by the owner to a third party without prior written notice of the sale given to the lessee or lessees and the DAR; (<i>c</i>) only the area cultivated by the agricultural lessee may be redeemed; and (<i>d</i>) <u>the right of redemption must be exercised within 180 days from written notice of the sale by the vendee.</u><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Case law further holds that <u>tender or consignation is an indispensable requirement to the proper exercise of the right of redemption</u> by the agricultural lessee.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <b>Thus, an offer to redeem can be properly effected through: (<i>a</i>) a formal tender with consignation, or (<i>b</i>) a complaint filed in court coupled with consignation of the redemption price</b> within the prescribed period. It must be stressed that in making a repurchase, it is not sufficient that a person offering to redeem merely manifests his desire to repurchase. This statement of intention must be accompanied by an actual and simultaneous tender of payment of the full amount of the repurchase price, <i>i.e.</i>, the consideration of the sale,<b> otherwise the offer to redeem will be held ineffectual</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> In <i>Quiño v. CA, </i>the Court explained the rationale for the consignation of the full amount of the redemption price:<br><br><blockquote>It is not difficult to discern why the full amount of the redemption price should be consigned in court. Only by such means can the buyer become certain that the offer to redeem is one made seriously and in good faith. A buyer cannot be expected to entertain an offer of redemption without the attendant evidence that the redemptioner can, and is willing to accomplish the repurchase immediately. A different rule would leave the buyer open to harassment by speculators or crackpots, as well as to unnecessary prolongation of the redemption period, contrary to the policy of the law in fixing a definite term to avoid prolonged and anti-economic uncertainty as to ownership of the thing sold. <u>Consignation of the entire price would remove all controversies as to the redemptioner's ability to pay at the proper time</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Applying the foregoing parameters to the present case, the Court finds that <u>respondent was not able to validly exercise his right of redemption</u> pursuant to Section 12 of RA 3844, as amended.<br><br>In this case, it is undisputed that respondent is the <i>bona fide </i>tenant of the subject land<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> which was sold by the landowner, the Cardona heirs, to a third party, <i>i.e.</i>, petitioner, without any written notice of the sale to respondent and the DAR.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> As such, respondent has the right to redeem the same from petitioner within the prescriptive period of 180 days from written notice of the sale by the latter pursuant to Section 12 of RA 3844, as amended.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Since it has been established that respondent was never notified by petitioner of the sale in her favor, then there is no prescription to speak of in the instant case. As such, respondent has the right to redeem the subject land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, having elected to exercise his right to redeem the subject land by filing a complaint in court, it behooved upon respondent to comply with the requirements for a valid and effective exercise of such right, i.e., the filing of the complaint should have been coupled with the consignation of the redemption price to show his willingness and ability to pay. Considering that respondent failed to consign the redemption price of P20,000.00 when he filed the complaint for redemption before the PARAD on January 15, 2002, there was no valid exercise of the right to redeem the subject land. It bears stressing that while the right of redemption under Section 12 of RA 3844, as amended, is an essential mandate of the agrarian reform legislation to implement the State's policy of owner-cultivatorship and to achieve a dignified, self-reliant existence for small fanners, such laudable and commendable policy is never intended to unduly transgress the corresponding rights of purchasers of land.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Consequently, the dismissal of the complaint for redemption is in order.<br><br><u>This notwithstanding, petitioner, as the new owner, is bound to respect and maintain respondent as tenant of the subject land because of the latter's tenancy right attached to the,land regardless of who its owner may be</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Under the law, the existence of an agricultural leasehold relationship is not terminated by changes in ownership in case of sale,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> as in this case, since the purpose of the law is to strengthen the security of tenure of tenants. Thus, in <i>Planters Development Bank v. Garcia,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> the Court held:<br><br><blockquote>[In] case of transfer [x x x], the tenancy relationship between the landowner and his tenant should be preserved in order to insure the well-being of the tenant or protect him from being unjustly dispossessed by the transferee or purchaser of the land; in other words, <b>the purpose of the law in question is to maintain the tenants in the peaceful possession and cultivation of the land or afford them protection against unjustified dismissal from their holdings</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED.</b> The Decision dated July 31, 2014 and the Resolution dated March 5, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
