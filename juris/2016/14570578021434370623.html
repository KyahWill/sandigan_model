Indeed, few civil actions of any nature would ever reach the trial stage, if a case can be adjudicated by a mere determination from the complaint or answer as to which legal presumptions are applicable. For-example, the presumption that a person is innocent of a wrong is a disputable presumption on the same level as that of the regular performance of official duty. A civil complaint for damages necessarily alleges that the defendant committed a wrongful act or omission that would serve as basis for the award of damages.

A finding that there is apparent authority is not the same as a finding that the corporate act in question is within the corporation's limited powers.<br><br>The rule on apparent authority is based on the principle of estoppel.
