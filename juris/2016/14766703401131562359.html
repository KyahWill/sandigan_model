				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This resolves an administrative complaint charging respondent Atty. Gideon D.V. Mortel (Atty. Mortel) with disobedience or defiance of lawful court orders, amounting to gross misconduct and insubordination or disrespect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The complaint arose from the proceedings before the Court of Appeals in <i>Bank of the Philippine Islands v.

Mortel handles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On July 20, 2010, the Court of Appeals issued a Notice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> for Atty.

Marcelino Ferdinand V. Jose (Atty. Jose), Managing Partner of MFV Jose Law Office, granted this request sometime in August 2010.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Atty. Morte Fs address on record was then listed at Unit 2106, Philippine AXA Life Center, 1286 Sen. Gil Puyat Ave., Makati City,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the same address as MFV Jose Law Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>All communication, court orders, resolutions, notices, or other court processes addressed to MFV Jose Law Office were received by the law firm's staff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The staff would pass these to the desk of Atty. Jose for monitoring and checking. Atty. Jose would then forward these to the handling lawyer in the office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The law firm's messenger, Randy G. Lucero (Lucero), was tasked with informing Atty. Mortel whenever there was a resolution or order pertinent to <i>Bank of Philippine Islands</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><i>Bank of Philippine Islands</i> was not included in MFV Jose Law Office's list or inventory of cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Thus, Atty. Jose "simply attached a piece of paper with notation and instructions on the same, advising [Lucero] ... to forward it to Atty. Mortel."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Initially, Randy De Leon (De Leon), Atty. Mortel's messenger, went to MFV Law Office to inquire if it had received notices for Atty. Mortel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> None came at that time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Thus, De Leon left his number with Lucero, and the two messengers agreed that Lucero would text De Leon should any court notice or order for Atty. Mortel arrive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On August 16, 2010, instead of heeding the Court of Appeals Notice to file the appellant's brief, Atty. Mortel moved to withdraw Angelita De Jesus' appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> in light of an amicable settlement on the disputed property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> After the Motion to Withdraw Appeal was filed, he stopped communicating with MFV Law Office and instructed De Leon to do the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution dated September 20, 2010, the Court of Appeals directed Atty.

Mortel did not comply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution dated November 11, 2010, the Court of Appeals again directed Atty. Mortel to comply with the September 20, 2010 Resolution and warned him of disciplinary action should he fail to secure and submit Angelita De Jesus' written conformity to the Motion within the reglementary period.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Atty. Mortel did not comply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Thus, on'February 23, 2011, the Court of Appeals resolved to "den[y] the motion to withdraw appeal; . . . reiterat[e] the notice dated July 20, 2010, directing [Angelita De Jesus] to file appellant's brief within . . .

Mortel did not comply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution dated October 13, 2011, the Court of Appeals directed Atty.

Mortel did not comply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution dated January 10, 2012, the Court of Appeals ordered Atty.

Mortel ignored this.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution dated May 16, 2012, the Court of Appeals found Atty. Mortel liable for indirect contempt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It ordered him to pay PI0,000.00 as fine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Atty. Mortel did not pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>On August 13, 2012, the Court of Appeals resolved to (1) again order Atty. Mortel to pay, within 10 days from notice, the fine of P10,000.00 imposed upon him under the May 16, 2012 Resolution;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (2) require Atty. Mortel to follow the July 5, 2011 and October 13, 2011 Resolutions that sought information from him as to his client's present address;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and (3) warn him that failure to comply with the Resolutions within the reglementary period will constrain the Court of Appeals "to impose a more severe sanction against him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Atty. Mortel snubbed the directives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>According to the Court of Appeals, the Cashier Division reported that Atty. Mortel still did not pay the fine imposed despite his receipt of the May 16, 2012, August 13, 2012, and October 17/2012 Resolutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution dated April 26, 2013, the Court of Appeals directed Atty. Mortel to show cause why it should not suspend him from legal practice for ignoring its May 16, 2012 Resolution (which fined him for P10,000.00).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> The April 26, 2013 Resolution was sent to his address on record at Unit 2106, Philippine AXA Life Center, 1286 Sen. Gil Puyat Ave., Makati City,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> as shown in the registry return card.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Despite having ignored 11 Court of Appeals Resolutions,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Atty. Mortel did not show cause for him not to be suspended.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> The Court of Appeals found that his "failure or obstinate refusal without justification or valid reason to comply with the [Court of Appeals'] directives constitutes disobedience or defiance of the lawful orders of [the Court of Appeals], amounting to gross misconduct and insubordination or disrespect."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution dated August 14, 2013, the Court of Appeals suspended Atty. Mortel from legal practice for six (6) months and gave him a stern warning against repeating his actions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Atty. Mortel was also directed to comply with the previous Resolutions of the Court of Appeals. The dispositive portion of the Resolution reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> Atty. Gideon D.V.

Mortel from legal practice, together with a statement of facts from which the suspension order was based.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>On October 23, 2013, the Office of the Bar Confidant issued a Report stating that it docketed the Court of Appeals' August 14, 2013 Resolution as a regular administrative case against Atty. Mortel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution dated January 20, 2014, this Court noted and approved the administrative case, furnished Atty. Mortel a copy of the August 14, 2013 Resolution, and required him to comment within 10 days from notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> This Court forwarded it to his address on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>On February 25, 2014, Atty. Jose read this Court's January 20, 2014<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Resolution meant for Atty. Mortel,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> and saw that Atty. Mortel had been suspended by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> He "immediately tried looking for Atty. Mortel's mobile number" to inform him of this development.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> On the following day, he was able to reach Atty. Mortel through a mutual friend.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>Four (4) years passed since the Court of Appeals first sent a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> to Atty. Mortel, through MFV Jose Law Office, in 2010. Atty. Jose asked Lucero, his messenger, why these Resolutions were not forwarded to Atty. Mortel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>Lucero stated that he would usually text De Leon, Atty. Mortel's messenger, whenever there was an order or resolution pertinent to the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> However, after a few messages, De Leon no longer texted back.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> Lucero added that he "had no other way of finding [De Leon]" and knew nothing of De Leon's whereabouts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> He hoped that either Atty. Mortel or De Leon would pick up the mails sent by the Court of Appeals for Atty. Mortel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> Not knowing how to contact Atty. Mortel's messenger, Lucero simply kept the copies in the office racks or on his table.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>On March 5, 2014, Atty. Mortel filed before the Court of Appeals an<br><br>Omnibus Motion and Manifestation with Profuse Apologies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> He informed the Court of Appeals of his present address at No. 2806 Tower 2, Pioneer Highlands, Mandaluyong City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> He also prayed for (1) the reinstatement of the Motion to Withdraw Appeal, (2) the acceptance of his compliance with the September 20, 2010 and November 11, 2010 Resolutions of the Court of Appeals (which sought for his client's conformity to the Motion), (3) the grant of his Motion, and (4) the recall of all previous orders or resolutions of the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>In his Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> dated March 7, 2014, Arty. Mortel argues that he honestly believed that the case was already closed and terminated in light of his Motion to Withdraw Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Atty. Mortel avers that "[h]e did not expect that a requirement of conformity of the client would be needed in as much as the act of counsel binds the client[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> According to him, the filing of a motion to withdraw appeal is a matter of right, which did not need his client's conformity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> Thus, he did not bother to visit MFV Jose Law Office again or send his messenger to check with the law firm if there were resolutions or orders for him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>According to Atty. Mortel, the Court of Appeals Resolutions never reached him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> He interposes the defense of "sheer lack of or absence of knowledge ... as all Resolutions of the Court [of Appeals] were received by the messenger of MFV Jose Law Office but not forwarded to him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Finally, he claims that he had no reason to refuse to comply, had he known of the orders or resolutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>In the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> dated February 9, 2015, this Court noted Atty. Mortel's Comment and required the Sixth Division of the Court of Appeals Manila to file a reply "within 10 days from notice.<br><br>In the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> dated May 30, 2016, this Court dispensed with the filing of the reply.<br><br>For resolution are the following issues:<br><br>First, whether there are grounds for this Court to probe into Atty. Marcelino Ferdinand V. Jose's possible administrative liability; and<br><br>Second, whether respondent Atty. Gideon D.V. Mortel should be imposed a disciplinary sanction.<br><br><center><b>I</b></center><br>This Court has the authority to discipline an errant member of the bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> Rule 139-B, Section 1 of the Rules of Court provides that "[proceedings for the disbarment, suspension, or discipline of attorneys may be taken by the Supreme Court <i>motu proprio</i>[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> However, the lawyer must have the "full opportunity upon reasonable notice to answer the charges against him [or her,] among others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> Thus:<br><br><center>RULE 138<br>ATTORNEYS AND ADMISSION TO BAR</center><blockquote>....<br><br>SEC. 30. <i>Attorney to be heard before removal or suspension.</i> — No attorney shall be removed or suspended from the practice of his profession, until he has had full opportunity upon reasonable notice to answer the charges against him, to produce witnesses in his own behalf, and to be heard by himself or counsel. But if upon reasonable notice he fails to appear and answer the accusation, the court may proceed to determine the matter <i>ex parte.</i></blockquote>Implicit in Atty. Jose and respondent's arrangement is that Atty. Jose would update respondent should there be any communication sent to respondent through his law firm, and that respondent would regularly check with the law firm if any court-delivered mail arrives for him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Yet, Atty. Jose failed to measure up to his part of the deal. He delegated everything to his messenger without adequately supervising him. All communication, court orders, resolutions, notices, or other court processes addressed to MFV Jose Law Office go through Atty. Jose's desk for monitoring and checking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>Having monitored and checked at least 12 envelopes<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> from the Court of Appeals meant for respondent, Atty. Jose could have followed up with Lucero if respondent was <i>actually</i> receiving the Court of Appeals' orders or resolutions. This is a fairly simple task requiring a quick yes or no, accomplishable in a few seconds. As Managing Partner of his firm, Atty. Jose can be expected to have supervisory duties over his firm's associates and support staff, among others.<br><br>Alternatively, Atty. Jose could have contacted respondent himself. That he did not know respondent's number<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> does not suffice. It bears stressing that Atty. Jose and respondent are acquaintances and have common connections.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>In the first place, Atty. Jose showed that he could easily get respondent's new number through a mutual friend. Yet, he only did so four (4) years later.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> In today's age of email, social media, web messaging applications, and a whole gamut of digital technology easing people's connectivity whenever and wherever they are, it is fairly easy to get connected with someone without even leaving one's location.<br><br>Atty. Jose is fully aware of the importance of following court orders and processes. It is reasonable to expect him to extend assistance to the lawyer to whom he lent his office address—and in doing so, to the Court of Appeals—in the speedy and efficient administration of justice in <i>Bank of the Philippine Islands.</i><br><br>Atty. Jose's reading of this Court's January 20, 2014 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> is also highly questionable. While the Resolution was sent to his law firm,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> it was addressed to respondent, a lawyer not under his employ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>Canon 21, Rule 21.04<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> of the Code of Professional Responsibility generally allows disclosure of a client's affairs only to partners or associates of the law firm, unless the client prohibits it. Respondent is not a partner or associate of MFV Jose Law Office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br>Even assuming that this Court's January 20, 2014 Resolution is independent of <i>Bank of Philippine Islands,</i> the present case being administrative in nature, Atty. Jose's action still invites suspicion.<br><blockquote>Article III, Section 3(1) of the 1987 Constitution guarantees that:<br><br><center>ARTICLE III<br>Bill of Rights</center><br>....<br><br>SECTION 3. (1) The privacy of communication and correspondence shall be inviolable except upon lawful order of the court, or when public safety or order requires otherwise as prescribed by law.<br><br>Under Article 32 of the Civil Code:<br><br>ARTICLE 32. Any public officer or employee, or any private individual, who directly or indirectly obstructs, defeats, violates or in any manner impedes or impairs any of the following rights and liberties of another person shall be liable to the latter for damages:<br><br>....<br><br>(11) The privacy of communication and correspondence[.]</blockquote>Atty. Jose took hold of this Court's correspondence meant for respondent and read it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> On February 25, 2014, he <i>look[ed]</i> into the said case [and] <i>noticed</i> that the Resolution . . . was already in the pink form issued by the Supreme Court. [He] saw the word 'suspended' and, <i>upon perusal</i>, saw that [respondent] was now subjected to an administrative case[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br>Atty. Jose may claim that he did so out of concern. However, if he were truly concerned, his proper recourse would have been to inform respondent about receiving mail from this Court, not to read it. Moreover, he would have informed respondent, as early as 2010, that his law firm received several Court of Appeals correspondences, and that these letters kept arriving for respondent until 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup><br><br>Therefore, under Rule 138, Section 30<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup>of the Rules of Court, this<br><br>Court directs Atty. Jose to show cause, within 10 days from receipt of a copy of this Resolution, why he should not be administratively sanctioned for failing to ensure respondent's prompt receipt of the Court of Appeals Resolutions, and for reading this Court's Resolution addressed to respondent.<br><br><center><b>II</b></center><br>Atty. Jose stated under oath that respondent requested to use MFV Jose Law Office's address as his mailing address only in August 2010,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> after respondent had already filed his appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> The exact day in August is unknown.<br><br>Assuming respondent's request was granted as early as August 1, 2010, this does not help him in any way. The Court of Appeals Notice for respondent to file an appellant's brief was issued one (1) month earlier, on July 20, 2010, when respondent still presumably used his old address on record at Herrera Tower, Rufino St., corner Valero St., Makati City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>Thus, respondent's sending De Leon, his messenger, to the new forwarding address at MFV Jose Law Office to get updates anytime between August 1, 2010<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> and August 16, 2010 (when he filed the Motion) would certainly have yielded no result. In this hypothetical scenario, the Court of Appeals would have sent the Notice to his old address on record. That he allegedly did not receive the July 20, 2010 Notice from the Court of Appeals was, therefore, his own lookout.<br><br>Assuming MFV Law Office accommodated respondent's request after August 16, 2010, there could have been no instance where respondent sent De Leon to MFV Law Office, if this Court were to believe his statement that he stopped contacting MFV Law Office <i>after</i> he filed the Motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>In either case, respondent had been remiss in his duty to keep himself informed on the status of the case.<br><br>Respondent presents a different version of the facts. According to him, he requested to use MFV Law Office's address "as his mailing address for the [purpose of] filing of the appeal[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> This hints that he made his request before he even elevated <i>Bank of the Philippine Islands</i> to the Court of Appeals, and precisely for that purpose.<br><br>While the records do not show when respondent filed the appeal, it certainly happened before July 20, 2010, the date when the Court of Appeals issued the Notice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> for respondent to file an appellant's brief.
