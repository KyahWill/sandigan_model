				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">A strike staged without compliance with the requirements of Article 263<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the <i>Labor Code</i> is illegal, and may cause the termination of the employment of the participating union officers and members. However, the liability for the illegal strike is individual, not collective. To warrant the termination of an officer of the labor organization on that basis, the employer must show that the officer knowingly participated in the illegal strike. An ordinary striking employee cannot be terminated based solely on his participation in the illegal strike, for the employer must further show that the employee committed illegal acts during the strike.<br><br><center><b>The Case</b><br></center><br>Under appeal is the decision promulgated on January 31, 2002 by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR.

A collective bargaining agreement (CBA) governed the relations between the Union and its members, on one hand, and HSBC effective April 1, 1990 until March 31, 1993 for the non-representational (economic) aspect, and effective April 1, 1990 until March 31, 1995 for the representational aspect.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[5]</sup></font> The CBA included a salary structure of the employees comprising of grade levels, entry level pay rates and the individual pays depending on the length of service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On January 18, 1993, HSBC announced its implementation of a job evaluation program (JEP) retroactive to January 1, 1993.

The Labor Arbiter's decision was appealed to the NLRC whose disposition to remand the case to the Labor Arbiter for further proceedings was in turn assailed. Ultimately, in G.R. No. 125038 entitled <i>The Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation Employees Union v. National Labor Relations Commission and The Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, Ltd.</i>, the Court affirmed the disposition of the NLRC, and directed the remand of the case to the Labor Arbiter for further proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The Union conducted a strike vote on December 19, 1993 after HSBC accorded regular status to Patrick King, the first person hired under the JEP.

He concluded that because of the illegality of the strike the Union members and officers were deemed to have lost their employment status. Lie disposed thusly:<br><br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><blockquote>1. The 22 December 1993 strike conducted by the union is hereby declared illegal;<br><br>2.

A meticulous review of the testimonies given during trial and a comparison of the same show that 25 respondents were not named by complainant's witnesses.<br><br>Of the 25, 6 of them (Rabuco, Salvacion, Castro, Dacumos, Calangi and Nicolas) have already settled with the complainant during the pendency of the appeal. Of the remaining 19, one respondent is a union officer (Rivera) while the remaining 18 respondents (Molo, Orlina, Ellarma, Flores, Fajardo, Luna, Dizon, Atienza, Gaba, Deriada, Gerong, Herrera, Loquellano, Paule, Motus, Del Rosario, Mundo and Militante) are neither officers nor members who have been pinpointed as having committed illegal act[s]. We, therefore, disagree with the Labor Arbiter's generalization that these 18 respondents have similarly lost their employment status simply because they participated in or acquiesced to the holding of the strike.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Only insofar as the xxx 18 respondents are concerned, We rule that complainant did fail to give them sufficient opportunity to present their side and adequate opportunity to answer the charges against them. More was expected from complainant and its observance of due process may not be dispensed with no matter how brazen and blatant the violation or its rules and regulations may have perceived. The twin requirement of notice and hearing in termination cases are as much indispensable and mandatory as the procedural requirements enumerated in Article 262 of the Labor Code. In this case, We cannot construe complainant's notice to return-to-work as substantial compliance with due process requirement.<br><br>Contrary however to respondents' insistence that complainant failed to observe due process in the case of the 18 respondents does not mean that they are automatically entitled to backwages or reinstatement. Consistent with decided cases, these respondents are entitled only to indemnity for complainant's omission, specifically to the amount of P5,000.00 each, xxx<br><br>As a final word, and only as regard these 18 respondents, We take note of the fact that they have remained silent spectators, if not mere by­standers, in the illegal strike and illegal acts committed by the other individual respondents, and since the grounds for which they have been terminated do not involve moral turpitude, the consequences for their acts must nevertheless be tempered with some sense of compassion. Consistent with prevailing jurisprudence and in the interest of social justice, We find the award of separation pay to each of the 18 respondents equivalent to one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service as equitable and proper.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>WHEREFORE, the decision dated 26 August 1998 is hereby AFFIRMED with the modification that complainant is ordered to pay (a) P5,000.00 and (b) one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service up to December 1993 to each of the following respondents: Isabelo Molo, Elvira Orlina, Samuel Ellarma, Rosario Flores, Rebecca Fajardo, Ma.

Rivera and Mario T. Fermin were on leave during the period of the strike;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> that they could not be dismissed on the ground of insubordination or abandonment in view of participation in a concerted action being a guaranteed right; that their participation in the concerted activities out of their sincere belief that HSBC had committed ULP in implementing the JEP constituted good faith to be appreciated in their favor; that their actions merited only their suspension at most, not the extreme penalty of dismissal; and that the prevailing rule that non-compliance with the procedural requirements under the <i>Labor Code</i> before staging a strike would invalidate the strike should be revisited because the amendment under Batas Pambansa Blg. 227 indicated the legislative intent to ease the restriction on the right to strike.<br><br>HSBC counters that the appeal raises factual issues already settled by the CA, NLRC, and the LA, rendering such issues inappropriate for determination in this appeal; that it was not liable for illegal dismissal because the petitioners had willfully staged their illegal strike without prior compliance with Article 263 of the <i>Labor Code</i>;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> that the procedural requirements of Article 263 of the <i>Labor Code</i> were mandatory and indispensable conformably with Article 264<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> of the <i>Labor Code</i>, which, in relation to Article 263(c), (d) and (f), expressly made such non-compliance a prohibited activity; that for this reason Article 264 penalized the Union officers who had participated in the illegal strike with loss of their employment status;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> that good faith could not be accorded to the petitioners because aside from the non-compliance with the mandatory procedure, they did not present proof to show that the strike had been held for a lawful purpose, or that the JEP had amounted to ULP, or that they had made a sincere effort to settle the disagreement;<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and that as far as the 18 employees were concerned, they were entitled only to nominal damages, not backwages, following the ruling in <i>Agabon v.

National Labor Relations Commission.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Two main issues to be resolved are, therefore, namely: (1) whether the strike commenced on December 22, 1993 was lawfully conducted; and (2 whether the petitioners were illegally dismissed.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b></center><br>We <b>PARTLY GRANT</b> the petition for review on <i>certiorari.</i><br><br><center><b>I<br>Non-compliance with Article 263 of the<br><i>Labor Code</i> renders a labor strike illegal</b></center><br>The right to strike is a constitutional and legal right of all workers because the strike, which seeks to advance their right to improve the terms and conditions of their employment, is recognized as an effective weapon of labor in their struggle for a decent existence. However, the right to strike as a means for the attainment of social justice is never meant to oppress or destroy the employers. Thus, the law prescribes limits on the exercise of the right to strike.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Article 263 of the <i>Labor Code </i>specifies the limitations on the exercise of the right to strike, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>Article 263. <i>Strikes, picketing, and lockouts,</i> x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(c) In cases of bargaining deadlocks, the duly certified or recognized bargaining agent may file a notice of strike or the employers may file a notice of lockout with the [Department] at least 30 days before the intended date thereof. In cases of unfair labor practices, the period of notice shall be 15 days and in the absence of a duly certified or recognized bargaining agent, the notice of strike may be filed by any legitimate labor organization in behalf of its members. However, in case of dismissal from employment of union officers duly elected in accordance with the union constitution and by-laws, which may constitute union busting, where the existence of the union is threatened, the 15-day cooling off period shall not apply and the union may take action immediately.<br><br>(d) The notice must be in accordance with such implementing rules and regulations as the [Secretary] of Labor and Employment may promulgate.<br><br>(e) During the cooling-off period, it shall be the duty of the [Department] to exert all efforts at mediation and conciliation to effect a voluntary settlement. Should the dispute remain unsettled until the lapse of the requisite number of days from the mandatory filing of the notice, the labor union may strike or the employer may declare a lockout.<br><br>(f) A decision to declare a strike must be approved by a majority of the total union membership in the bargaining unit concerned, obtained by secret ballot in meetings or referenda called for that purpose. A decision to declare a lockout must be approved by a majority of the board of directors of the corporation or association or of the partners in a partnership, obtained by secret ballot in a meeting called for that purpose. The decision shall be valid for the duration of the dispute based on substantially the same grounds considered when the strike or lockout vote was taken. The [Department] may, at its own initiative or upon request of any affected party, supervise the conduct of the secret balloting. In every case, the union or the employer shall furnish the [Department] the results of the voting at least seven days before the intended strike or lockout, subject to the cooling-off period herein provided.<br><br>x x x x<br></blockquote><br>The procedural requirements for a valid strike are, therefore, the following, to wit: (1) a notice of strike filed with the DOLE at least 30 days before the intended date thereof, or 15 days in case of ULP; (2) a strike vote approved by the majority of the total union membership in the bargaining unit concerned, obtained by secret ballot in a meeting called for that purpose; and (3) a notice of the results of the voting at least seven days before the intended strike given to the DOLE. These requirements are mandatory, such that non-compliance therewith by the union will render the strike illegal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>According to the CA, the petitioners neither filed the notice of strike with the DOLE, nor observed the cooling-off period, nor submitted the result of the strike vote. Moreover, although the strike vote was conducted, the same was done by open, not secret, balloting,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> in blatant violation of Article 263 and Section 7, Rule XIII of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> It is not amiss to observe that the evident intention of the requirements for the strike-notice and the strike-vote report is to reasonably regulate the right to strike for the attainment of the legitimate policy objectives embodied in the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> As such, the petitioners committed a prohibited activity under Article 264(a) of the Labor Code, and rendered their strike illegal.<br><br>We underscore that the language of the law itself unmistakably bears out the mandatory character of the limitations it has prescribed, to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 264. Prohibited activities. - (a) <b>No labor organization or employer shall declare a strike or lockout</b> without first having bargained collectively in accordance with Title VII of this Book or <b>without first having filed the notice required in the preceding Article or without the necessary strike or lockout vote first having been obtained and reported to the [Department]</b>, (emphasis supplied)<br><br>x x x x</blockquote><br>Accordingly, the petitioners' plea for the revisit of the doctrine to the effect that the compliance with Article 263 was mandatory was entirely unwarranted. It is significant to remind that the doctrine has not been established by judicial declaration but by congressional enactment. <i>Verba legis non est recedendum.</i> The words of a statute, when they are clear, plain and free from ambiguity, must be given their literal meaning and must be applied without interpretation.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Had the legislators' intention been to relax this restriction on the right of labor to engage in concerted activities, they would have stated so plainly and unequivocally.<br><br><center><b>II<br>Commission of unlawful acts during<br>the strike further rendered the same illegal</b></center><br>The petitioners insist that all they did was to conduct an orderly, peaceful, and moving picket. They deny employing any act of violence or obstruction of HSBC's entry and exit points during the period of the strike.<br><br>The contrary was undeniably true. The strike was far from orderly and peaceful. HSBC's claim that from the time when the strike was commenced on December 22, 1993 the petitioners had on several instances obstructed the ingress into and egress from its offices in Makati and in Pasig was not competently disputed, and should thus be accorded credence in the light of the records. We agree with HSBC, for all the affidavits<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and testimonies of its witnesses,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> as well as the photographs<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> and the video recordings<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> reviewed by LA Pati depicted the acts of obstruction, violence and intimidation committed by the petitioners during their picketing. It was undeniable that such acts of the strikers forced HSBC's officers to resort to unusual means of gaining access into its premises at one point.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> In this connection, LA Pati even observed as follows:<br><br><blockquote>[I]t must be pointed out that the Bank has shown by clear and indubitable evidence that most of the respondents have actually violated the prescription provided for in paragraph (b) of Article 264 on free ingress and egress. The incident depicted in the video footage of 05 January 1994, which has been viewed several times during the trial and even privately, demonstrates beyond doubt that <b>the picket was a non-moving, stationary one - nothing less but a barricade. This office is more than convinced that the respondents, at least on that day, have demonstrated an abnormally high degree of hatred and anger at the Bank and its officers (including the Bank's chief executive officer who fell to the ground as a result of the pushing and shoving) leading them to do anything to carry out their resolve not to let anymore inside the Bank.</b> Additionally, as observed by this Labor Arbiter, the tensed and disquieting relation between the parties became all the more apparent during the actual hearings as clearly evident from the demeanor and actuations of the respondents.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>The situation during the strike actually went out of hand because of the petitioners' illegal conduct, compelling HSBC to secure an injunction from the NLRC as well as to file its petition for <i>habeas corpus</i> in the proper court in the interest of its trapped officers and employees; and at one point to lease an helicopter to extract its employees and officers from its premises on the eve of Christmas Day of 1993.<br><br>For sure, the petitioners could not justify their illegal strike by invoking the constitutional right of labor to concerted actions. Although the Constitution recognized and promoted their right to strike, they should still exercise the right <i>within the bounds of law</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Those bounds had been well-defined and well-known. Specifically, Article 264(e) of the Labor Code expressly enjoined the striking workers engaged in picketing from committing any act of violence, coercion or intimidation, or from obstructing the free ingress into or egress from the employer's premises for lawful purposes, or from obstructing public thoroughfares.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> The employment of prohibited means in carrying out concerted actions injurious to the right to property of others could only render their strike illegal. Moreover, their strike was rendered unlawful because their picketing which constituted an obstruction to the free use of the employer's property or the comfortable enjoyment of life or property, when accompanied by intimidation, threats, violence, and coercion as to constitute nuisance, should be regulated.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In fine, the strike, even if justified as to its ends, could become illegal because of the means employed, especially when the means came within the prohibitions under Article 264(e) of the <i>Labor Code</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br><center><b>III<br>Good faith did not avail because of the<br>patent violation of Article 263 of the<i> Labor Code</i></b></center><br><br>The petitioners assert their good faith by maintaining that their strike was conducted out of their sincere belief that HSBC had committed ULP in implementing the JEP. They had also hoped that HSBC would be willing to negotiate matters related to the JEP considering that the economic aspect of the CBA was set to expire on March 31, 1993.<br><br>We rule out good faith on the part of the petitioners.<br><br>The petitioners' disregard of the procedural requirements for conducting a valid strike negated their claim of good faith. For their claim to be upheld, it was not enough for them to believe that their employer was guilty of ULP, for they must also sufficiently show that the strike was undertaken with a modicum of obeisance to the restrictions on their exercise of the right to strike prior to and during its execution as prescribed by the law. They did not establish their compliance with the requirements specifically for the holding of the strike vote and the giving of the strike notice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The petitioners should entirely bear the consequence of their non-compliance with the legal requirements. As we said in <i>Pilipino Telephone Corporation v. Pilipino Telephone Employees Association (PILTEA)</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><blockquote>[W]e do not find any reason to deviate from our rulings in <i>Gold City Integrated Port Service, Inc. and Nissan Motors Philippines, Inc. </i>It bears emphasis that the strike staged by the Union in the instant case was illegal for its procedural infirmities and for defiance of the Secretary's assumption order. The CA, the NLRC and the Labor Arbiter were unanimous in finding that bad faith existed in the conduct of the subject strike. The relevant portion of the CA Decision states:<br><blockquote>xxx <b>We cannot go to the extent of ascribing good faith to the means taken in conducting the strike</b>. The requirement of the law is simple, that is—1. Give a Notice of Strike; 2. Observe the cooling period; 3. Observe the mandatory seven day strike ban; 3. If the act is union busting, then the union may strike doing away with the cooling-off period, subject only to the seven-day strike ban. To be lawful, a strike must simply have a lawful purpose and should be executed through lawful means. <b>Here, the union cannot claim good faith in the conduct of the strike because, as can be gleaned from the findings of the Labor Arbiter, this was an extensively coordinated strike having been conducted all throughout the offices of PILTEL all over the country. Evidently, the strike was planned</b>. Verily, they cannot now come to court hiding behind the shield of "good faith." Be that as it may, petitioners claim good faith only in so far as their grounds for the strike but not on the conduct of the strike. Consequently, they still had to comply with the procedural requirements for a strike, which, in this case, they failed to do so.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote><br><center><b>IV<br>The finding on the illegal strike did not justify the<br>wholesale termination of the strikers from employment</b></center><br>The next issue to resolve is whether or not HSBC lawfully dismissed the petitioners for joining the illegal strike.<br><br>As a general rule, the mere finding of the illegality of the strike does not justify the wholesale termination of the strikers from their employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> To avoid rendering the recognition of the workers' right to strike illusory, the responsibility for the illegal strike is individual instead of collective.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The last paragraph of Article 264(a) of the <i>Labor Code</i> defines the norm for terminating the workers participating in an illegal strike, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>Article 264. Prohibited Activities -xxx <br><br>x x x x<br><br>Any worker whose employment has been terminated as a consequence of any unlawful lockout shall be entitled to reinstatement with full backwages. <b>Any union officer who knowingly participates in an illegal strike and any worker or union officer who knowingly participates in the commission of illegal acts during a strike may be declared to have lost his employment status</b>: <i>Provided</i>, That mere participation of a worker in a lawful strike shall not constitute sufficient ground for termination of his employment, even if a replacement had been hired by the employer during such lawful strike, (emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Conformably with Article 264, we need to distinguish between the officers and the members of the union who participate in an illegal strike. The officers may be <i>deemed terminated</i> from their employment upon a finding of their<i> knowing participation in the illegal strike,</i> but the members of the union shall suffer the same fate only if they are shown to have knowingly participated in the commission of illegal acts during the strike. Article 264 expressly requires that the officer must have <i>knowingly participated in the illegal strike.</i> We have explained this essential element in <i>Club Filipino, Inc. v. Bautista,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> thusly:<br><br><blockquote>Note that the verb "participates" is preceded by the adverb "knowingly." This reflects the intent of the legislature to require "knowledge" as a condition <i>sine qua non</i> before a union officer can be dismissed from employment for participating in an illegal strike. The provision is worded in such a way as to make it very difficult for employers to circumvent the law by arbitrarily dismissing employees in the guise of exercising management prerogative. This is but one aspect of the State's constitutional and statutory mandate to protect the rights of employees to self-organization.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></blockquote><br>The petitioners assert that the CA erroneously affirmed the dismissal of Carmina Rivera and Mario Fermin by virtue of their being officers of the Union despite lack of proof of their having participated in the strike.<br><br>The assertion is partly correct.<br><br>In the case of Fermin, HSBC did not satisfactorily prove his presence during the strike, much less identify him as among the strikers. In contrast, Union president Ma. Dalisay dela Chica testified that Fermin was not around when the Union's Board met after the strike vote to agree on the date of the strike.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In that regard, Corazon Fermin, his widow, confirmed the Union president's testimony by attesting that her husband had been on leave from work prior to and during the strike because of his heart condition.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Although Corazon also attested that her husband had fully supported the strike, his extending moral support for the strikers did not constitute sufficient proof of his participation in the strike in the absence of a showing of any overt participation by him in the illegal strike. The burden of proving the overt participation in the illegal strike by Fermin solely belonged to HSBC, which did not discharge its burden. Accordingly, Fermin, albeit an officer of the Union, should not be deemed to have lost his employment status.<br><br>However, the dismissal of Rivera and of the rest of the Union's officers, namely: Ma. Dalisay dela Chica, Marvilon Militante and David Atanacio, is upheld. Rivera admitted joining the picket line on a few occasions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> Dela Chica, the Union president, had instigated and called for the strike on December 22, 1993.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> In addition, HSBC identified Dela Chica<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> and Militante<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> as having actively participated in the strike. Their responsibility as the officers of the Union who led the illegal strike was greater than the responsibility of the members simply because the former had the duty to guide their members to obey and respect the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> When said officers urged and made their members violate the law, their dismissal became an appropriate penalty for their unlawful act.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> The law granted to HSBC the option to dismiss the officers as a matter of right and prerogative.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Unlike the Union's officers, the ordinary striking members could not be terminated for merely taking part in the illegal strike. Regardless of whether the strike was illegal or not, the dismissal of the members could be upheld only upon proof that they had committed illegal acts during the strike. They must be specifically identified because the liability for the prohibited acts was determined on an individual basis.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> For that purpose, substantial evidence available under the attendant circumstances justifying the penalty of dismissal sufficed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>We declare the illegality of the termination of the employment of the 18 members of the Union for failure of HSBC to prove that they had committed illegal acts during the strike. We also declare that Daisy Fagutao was unlawfully dismissed because HSBC did not adduce substantial evidence establishing her presence and her commission of unlawful acts during the strike.<br><br>We clarify that the 18 employees, including Fagutao and Union officer Fermin, were illegally dismissed because of lack of any valid ground to dismiss them, and for deprivation of procedural due process. Thus, we take exception to that portion of the NLRC ruling that held:<br><br><blockquote>We here note that all of the herein named respondents were terminated by complainant for reasons other than their holding of an participation in the illegal strike. Specifically, the grounds for their termination were enumerated in the notices of termination sent out by complainant as follows: abandonment, insubordination and seriously hampering operations. To Our mind, the complainant in the exercise of its management prerogative, had every reason to discipline these respondents for their disregard of the complainant's return-to-work order and for the damage sustained by reason thereof. Although these 18 respondents did not commit any illegal act during the strike, We can not simply ignore the fact that they nonetheless breached complainant's rules and regulations and which acts serve as valid causes to terminate their employment. These respondents took a risk when they refused to heed complainant's lawful order and knowingly caused damage and prejudice to complainant's operations; they should be prepared to take the consequences and be held accountable for their actions. Whether or not complainant observed due process prior to the termination of these respondents is however a totally different matter.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br></blockquote><br>We hold that said employees' right to exercise their right to concerted activities should not be defeated by the directive of HSBC for them to report back to work. Any worker who joined the strike did so precisely to assert or improve the terms and conditions of his work.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Otherwise, the mere expediency of issuing the return to work memorandum could suffice to stifle the constitutional right of labor to concerted actions. Such practice would vest in the employer the functions of a strike breaker,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> which is prohibited under Article 264(c) of the <i>Labor Code</i>.<br><br>The petitioners' refusal to leave their cause against HSBC constituted neither insubordination nor abandonment. For insubordination to exist, the order must be: (1) reasonable and lawful; (2) sufficiently known to the employee; and (3) in connection to his duties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> None of these elements existed in this case.<br><br>As to abandonment, two requirements need to be established, namely: (1) the failure to report for work or absence must be without valid or justifiable reason; and (2) there must be a clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship. The second element is the more decisive factor and must be manifested by overt acts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> In that regard, the employer carries the burden of proof to show the employee's deliberate and unjustified refusal to resume his employment without any intention of returning.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> However, the petitioners unquestionably had no intention to sever the employer-employee relationship because they would not have gone to the trouble of joining the strike had their purpose been to abandon their employment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br>Moreover, we cannot subscribe to the view that the striking employees should be dismissed for having seriously hampered and damaged HSBC's operations. In this aspect of the case, HSBC did not discharge its burden to prove that the acts of the employees constituted any of the just causes under the <i>Labor Code</i> or were prohibited under the company's code of conduct as to warrant their dismissal.<br><br><center><b>V<br>Non-compliance with due process resulted<br>in illegal dismissal; the employer's liability<br>depended on the availing circumstances</b></center><br>While Article 264 authorizes the termination of the union officers and employees, it does not remove from the employees their right to due process. Regardless of their actions during the strike, the employees remain entitled to an opportunity to explain their conduct and why they should not be penalized. In <i>Suico v. National Labor Relations Commission</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> we have reiterated the need for the employers to comply with the twin-notice requirement despite the cause for the termination arising from the commission of the acts prohibited by Article 264, thus:<br><br><blockquote>Art. 277(b) in relation to Art. 264(a) and (e) recognizes the right to due process of all workers, without distinction as to the cause of their termination. Where no distinction is given, none is construed. Hence, the foregoing standards of due process apply to the termination of employment of Suico, et al. even if the cause therefor was their supposed involvement in strike-related violence prohibited under Art. 264 (a) and (e).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></blockquote><br>Consequently, failure of the employer to accord due process to its employees prior to their termination results in illegal dismissal.<br><br>The petitioners maintain that the CA applied the twin-notice requirement in favor of the 18 employees. HSBC disagrees, claiming instead that the award of backwages in favor of said employees should be modified following <i>Agabon.</i><br><br>We partially agree with both parties.<br><br>Article 277(b)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> of the <i>Labor Code</i> mandates compliance with the twin-notice requirement in terminating an employee, <i>viz</i>.:<br><br><blockquote>Article 277.

"Reasonable opportunity" under the Omnibus Rules means every kind of assistance that management must accord to the employees to enable them to prepare adequately for their defense. This should be construed as a period of at least five (5) calendar days from receipt of the notice to give the employees an opportunity to study the accusation against them, consult a union official or lawyer, gather data and evidence, and decide on the defenses they will raise against the complaint. Moreover, in order to enable the employees to intelligently prepare their explanation and defenses, the notice should contain a detailed narration of the facts and circumstances that will serve as basis for the charge against the employees. A general description of the charge will not suffice. Lastly, the <b>notice should specifically mention which company rules, if any, are violated and/or which among the grounds under Art. 282 is being charged against the employees</b>.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(3) After determining that termination of employment is justified, the employers shall serve the employees <b>a written notice of termination indicating that: (1) all circumstances involving the charge against the employees have been considered; and (2) grounds have been established to justify the severance of their employment</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>HSBC admitted issuing two <i>pro forma</i> notices to the striking employees. The first notice, sent on December 22, 1993, reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>Re: NOTICE OF RETURN TO WORK<br>__________________________________________________<br><br>On ___________________ at ________ o'clock in the morning/afternoon, you "walked-out" by leaving your assigned work station without prior permission/leave during work hours.<br><br>You are hereby directed to <b>report back for work at the start of banking hours on the day immediately following knowledge or receipt of this notice</b>. Should you report for work no disciplinary action shall be imposed on you. This is without prejudice to any action the Bank may take against the Union.<br><br>Should you fail to report back for work within the period abovestated, the Bank shall be forced to terminate your employment and take all appropriate measures to continue serving its clients.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></blockquote><br>As the notice indicates, HSBC did not fully apprise the strikers of the ground under the <i>Labor Code</i> that they had supposedly violated. It also thereby deprived them the ample opportunity to explain and justify their actions. Instead, it manifested therein its firm resolve to impose the extreme penalty of termination should they not comply with the order. Plainly, the tenor of the notice was short of the requirements of a valid first notice.<br><br>The second notice was as follows: <br><br><blockquote>Re: NOTICE OF TERMINATION<br>__________________________________________________________<br><br>On_________ , 1993, you and a majority of the rank-and-file staff "walked out" by leaving your respective work stations without prior leave and failed to return.<br><br>You were directed to report back for work when a copy of the Bank's Memorandum/Notice to Return to Work dated________________ 1993 was:<br><br>1.

Hence, this notice should be struck down for having violated the right of the affected employees to due process.<br><br>The failure by HSBC to strictly observe the twin-notice requirement resulted in the illegal dismissal. However, the extent of its liability should depend on the distinct circumstances of the employees.<br><br>HSBC should be held liable for two types of illegal dismissal — the first type was made without both substantive and procedural due process, while the other was based on a valid cause but lacked compliance with procedural due process. To the first type belonged the dismissal of Fermin, Fagutao and the 18 employees initially identified by the NLRC, while the second type included the rest of the petitioners.<br><br>HSBC maintains that the dismissed 18 employees should not be entitled to backwages in conformity with <i>Agabon</i>.<br><br>We disagree. <i>Agabon</i> involved the second type of dismissal, not the first type to which the 18 employees belonged. The rule for employees unlawfully terminated without substantive and procedural due process is to entitle them to the reliefs provided under Article 279<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> of the Labor Code, that is, reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time the compensation was withheld up to the time of actual reinstatement.
