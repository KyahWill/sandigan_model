It affirmed the indefeasibility of the spouses Ligon's title over the entire 9,478-square-meter property, saying that petitioner Lim failed to adduce evidence to overturn the ruling of both the RTC and the CA. In that ruling, the Court said that the findings of the DENR Regional Executive Director, as affirmed by the OP in the instant case, did not operate as <i>res judicata </i>in the Complaint for quieting of title that would have the effect of cancelling the title of the spouses Ligon.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> The Court held:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br><blockquote>While there is identity of parties and subject matter between the instant case and the matter before the DENR and later the OP, the causes of action are not the same. The present case arose from a case for quieting of title where the plaintiff must show or prove legal or equitable title to or interest in the property which is the subject-matter of the action. Legal title denotes registered ownership, while equitable title means beneficial ownership. Without proof of such legal or equitable title, or interest, there is no cloud to be prevented or removed. The administrative proceedings before the DENR and now the OP, on the other hand, were instituted on behalf of the Director of Lands, in order to investigate any allegation of irregularity in securing a patent and the corresponding title to a public land under Section 91<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> of the Public Land Act, xxx.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>To be sure, even if there was an identity of the issues involved, there still would have been no bar by prior judgment or conclusiveness of judgment since the March 24, 2004 Resolution of the OP has not reached finality - it being the subject of an appeal by respondents Spouses Ligon under CA-G.R. SP No. 85011. Furthermore, in terms of subject matter, the property involved in the administrative proceedings is a 1,000-square meter tract of land over which petitioners' alleged right of possession could ripen into ownership. On the other hand, the instant case involves the issue of the ownership or the validity of the title of respondents over the entire 9,478-square meter tract of land where petitioners claim to have enjoyed open, continuous, exclusive, and notorious possession for more than thirty years over a 1,000-square meter portion thereof.<br></blockquote><br><center><b>THE ISSUES</b></center><br>The issues in this case are as follows:<br><br>1.

Clearly they are aware that observance of the rules of procedure should not be lightly estimated, as the Court considers it a matter of public policy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> Indeed, the rules were conceived and promulgated not only to effectively dispense justice,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> but also to fully protect the rights of the parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>Courts, however, are not shorn of the discretion to suspend the rules or except a particular case from their operation when their rigid application would frustrate rather than promote justice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> The policy is to maintain a healthy balance between the strict enforcement of procedural laws and the guarantee that litigants are given the full opportunity for a just and proper disposition of their cause. In some cases, it is a far better and more prudent cause of action for the court to excuse a technical lapse and afford the parties a review of the case to attain the ends of justice. In those cases, in which technicalities are dispensed with, the courts do not mean to undermine the force and effectivity of the periods set by law. When the courts do so, it is because of the existence of a clear need to prevent the commission of a grave injustice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>Public interest and the interest of substantial justice require that the instant case be resolved on the merits, and not on mere technical grounds, for the following reasons:<br><br><ol><li>DENR Regional Director Principe's findings are indirect conflict with those of the DENR Secretary; hence, there is a need to review the arguments raised and evidence submitted by the parties.<br><br></li><li>Petitioners benefitted from the relaxation of the rules when they were able to file a Motion for Reconsideration before the DENR Regional Office and an appeal before the DENR even after the prescribed period had lapsed; they cannot question the same liberality afforded to respondents by the OP.<br><br></li><li>The present controversy involves both parties' sacrosanct right to property, which is protected by the constitutional provision that "[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup></li></ol><br>Moreover, it bears stressing that rules of procedure are construed liberally in proceedings before administrative bodies. In Department of <i>Agrarian Reform v. Uy</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> the second Motion for Reconsideration filed by the respondent before the OP was allowed, even if it was considered <i>pro forma</i> or not exceptionally meritorious. The Court reasoned:<br><br><blockquote>[T]echnical rules of procedure imposed in judicial proceedings are unavailing in cases before administrative bodies. Administrative bodies are not bound by the technical niceties of law and procedure and the rules obtaining in the courts of law. Rules of procedure are not to be applied in a very rigid and technical manner, as they are used only to help secure and not to override substantial justice.</blockquote><br>All told, the CA was correct in validating the OP's decision to give due course to respondents' appeal of the DENR Secretary's Order on the basis of the second Motion for Reconsideration.<br><br><b><center>II<br></center></b><br>Petitioners raise as the second ground for this Petition the argument that the CA failed to resolve the following issues: (1) whether the OP erred in reversing the Decision of the DENR Secretary; and (2) whether the finding of the DENR Secretary that the Order of Director Principe was a collateral attack on their title was valid.<br><br>It is noteworthy to emphasize at this point that the jurisdiction of this Court in a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court is limited to reviewing only errors of law. Factual questions are not the proper subject of an appeal by <i>certiorari.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[109]</sup><br><br>A question of law is present when there is a doubt or difference in opinion as to what the law is on a certain set of facts, while a question of fact exists when a doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of the alleged facts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110]</sup> Unless the case falls under any of the recognized exceptions, the Court is limited solely to a review of legal questions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br><br>The allegation of petitioners that there was an omission on the part of the CA when it failed to resolve the issues they had put forth obviously involves a factual question, which is outside this Court's authority to act upon.<br><br>At any rate, this Court finds that the CA has actually ruled upon the issues mentioned by petitioners. The CA declared that the OP did not err in reversing the Decision of the DENR Secretary. Quoted hereunder is the relevant portion of the appellate court's Decision:<br><br><blockquote>Considering the foregoing and the fact that the issue in this case is actual possession of the disputed land, We hold and so conclude that the Office of the President just corrected its previous error when it reconsidered and set aside its June 27, 2003 Resolution and issued the assailed March 24, 2004 Resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup></blockquote><br>The CA likewise resolved, albeit indirectly when it affirmed the OP's factual findings, the question of whether the Order of Director Principe was a collateral attack on petitioners' title. It particularly cited the following conclusions of the OP:<br><br><blockquote>Anent the Free Patent application of appellee (herein petitioners), suffice it to state that the same was never pursued from the time of its filing in 1970 and the approved plan under Psu-04-008565 did not confer any title to the land to appellee in the light of the actual occupation of the land by appellants (herein respondents).<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Summing up, it has been established that appellants have been the actual occupants of the disputed land since 1953 or for more than thirty years as to be entitled to a grant from the government. Therefore, the plan under psu-04-008565 of appellee covering the said land, being ineffective, could not render nugatory the actual occupation of appellants and should be cancelled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup></blockquote><br>By agreeing to these findings of fact, the CA impliedly refused to recognize the title to the property held by petitioners. Since it deemed that they had no title to speak of, the issue of collateral attack was consequently answered in the negative. This view is in line with the principle that "a judgment is an adjudication on all the matters which are essential to support it, and that every proposition assumed or decided by the court leading up to the final conclusion and upon which such conclusion is based is as effectually passed upon as the ultimate question which is finally solved."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup><br><br>In their Motion for Reconsideration of the CA Decision, petitioners also highlighted the appellate court's alleged failure to resolve these two particular questions. The fact that the CA denied the motion on the ground that the arguments advanced therein had already been considered and passed upon in its Decision further indicates that the appellate court has fully covered and resolved the issues in this case.<br><br>On a final note, this Court finds that the Decision of the OP merely affirmed the Order of Director Principe. Contrary to petitioners' claim, the OP did not in any way grant unto respondents possession of the entire 9,748 square meters of property registered under petitioners' name. The CA upheld the OP Decision also without any such pronouncement. To be clear, the subject matter of this case involves only the 1,000 square meters of land that respondents have long possessed and occupied, but that has been included as part of petitioner's property.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, this Court <b>DENIES</b> the Petition.
