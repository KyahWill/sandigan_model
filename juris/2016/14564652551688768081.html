The Decision dismissed DFI's Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> in C.A.-G.R. SP Nos. 53806 and 61607 and granted DARBMUPCO's Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> in C.A.-G.R. SP No. 59958.

However, the Department of Agrarian Reform ("DAR") granted DFI a deferment privilege to continue agricultural operations until 1998.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Due to adverse marketing problems and observance of the so-called "lay-follow" or the resting of a parcel of land for a certain period of time after exhaustive utilization, DFI closed some areas of operation in the original plantation and laid off its employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> These employees petitioned the DAR for the cancellation of DFI's deferment privilege alleging that DFI already abandoned its area of operations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The DAR Regional Director recalled DFI's deferment privilege resulting in the original plantation's automatic compulsory acquisition and distribution under the CARL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> DFI filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied.

However, out of the total 800 hectares, the DAR only approved the disposition of 689.88 hectares. Hence, the original plantation was split into two: 689.88 hectares were sold to the government ("awarded plantation") and the remaining 200 hectares, more or less, were retained by DPI ("managed area").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The managed area is subject to the outcome of the appeal on the cancellation of the deferment privilege before the DAR Secretary.<br><br>On January 1, 1996, the awarded plantation was turned over to qualified agrarian reform beneficiaries ("ARBs") under the CARL. These ARBs are the same farmers who were working in the original plantation.

DARBMUPCO averred that it is not the employer of respondent-workers; neither is DFI.

The Resolution stated that the May 4, 1999 Resolution directing the conduct of certification election is already final and executory on June 4, 1999.

It noted that the DFI hired the respondent-contractors, who in turn procured their own men to work in the land owned by DARBMUPCO.

DFI also paid for the respondent-contractors' services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The CA said that the fact that the respondent-workers worked in the land owned by DARBMUPCO is immaterial.

This impelled DFI to hire contractors to supply labor enabling DARBMUPCO to meet its quota. The CA observed that while the various agencies involved in the consolidated petitions sometimes differ as to who the statutory employer of the respondent-workers is, they are uniform in finding that the respondent-contractors are labor-only contractors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>On the second issue, the CA reiterated the ruling of the SOLE<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> that absent an injunction from the CA, the pendency of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> does not stay the holding of the certification election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> The challenged Resolution of the SOLE is already final and executory as evidenced by an Entry of Judgment dated July 14, 1999; hence, the merits of the case can no longer be reviewed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>The CA thus held in its Decision dated March 31, 2006:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, this Court hereby ORDERS:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> the DISMISSAL of the petitions in C.A.-G.R.

Contracting or subcontracting is an arrangement whereby a principal (or employer) agrees to put out or farm out with a contractor or subcontractor the performance or completion of a specific job, work or service within a definite or predetermined period, regardless of whether such job, work or service is to be performed or completed within or outside the premises of the principal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> It involves a trilateral relationship among the principal or employer, the contractor or subcontractor, and the workers engaged by the contractor or subcontractor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>Article 106 of the Labor Code of the Philippines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> (Labor Code) explains the relations which may arise between an employer, a contractor, and the contractor's employees,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>ART. 106. Contractor or subcontracting. - Whenever an employer enters into a contract with another person for the performance of the formers work, the employees of the contractor and of the latter's subcontractor, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Code.<br><br>In the event that the contractor or subcontractor fails to pay the wages of his employees in accordance with this Code, the employer shall be jointly and severally liable with his contractor or subcontractor to such employees to the extent of the work performed under the contract, in the same manner and extent that he is liable to employees directly employed by him.<br><br>The Secretary of Labor and Employment may, by appropriate regulations, restrict or prohibit the contracting out of labor to protect the rights of workers established under this Code. In so prohibiting or restricting, he may make appropriate distinctions between labor-only contracting and job contracting as well as differentiations within these types of contracting and determine who among the parties involved shall be considered the employer for purposes of this Code, to prevent any violation or circumvention of any provision of this Code.<br><br>There is "labor-only" contracting where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer. In such cases, the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him.<br></blockquote>The Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> distinguishes between permissible job contracting (or independent contractorship) and labor-only contracting. Job contracting is permissible under the Code if the following conditions are met:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">The contractor carries on an independent business and undertakes the contract work on his own account under his own responsibility according to his own manner and method, free from the control and direction of his employer or principal in all matters connected with the performance of the work except as to the results thereof; and </div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">The contractor has substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, and other materials which are necessary in the conduct of his business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>In contrast, job contracting shall be deemed as labor-only contracting, an arrangement prohibited by law, if a person who undertakes to supply workers to an employer:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises and other materials; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td><div align="justify">The workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business or operations of the employer in which workers are habitually employed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> </div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>As a general rule, a contractor is presumed to be a labor-only contractor, unless such contractor overcomes the burden of proving that it has the substantial capital, investment, tools and the like.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br><b>Based on the conditions for permissible job contracting, we rule that respondent-contractors are labor-only contractors.</b><br><br>There is no evidence showing that respondent-contractors are independent contractors. The respondent-contractors, DFI, and DARBMUPCO did not offer any proof that respondent-contractors were not engaged in labor-only contracting. In this regard, we cite our ruling in <i>Caro v. Rilloraza</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> thus:<br><blockquote>"In regard to the first assignment of error, the defendant company pretends to show through Venancio Nasol's own testimony that he was an independent contractor who undertook to construct a railway line between Maropadlusan and Mantalisay, but as far as the record shows, <i>Nasol did not testify that the defendant company had no control over him as to the manner or methods he employed in pursuing his work</i>. On the contrary, he stated that he was not bonded, and that he only depended upon the Manila Railroad for money to be paid to his laborers. As stated by counsel for the plaintiffs, the word 'independent contractor' means 'one who exercises independent employment and contracts to do a piece of work according to his own methods and without being subject to control of his employer except as to result of the work.' furthermore, if the employer claims that the workmen is an independent contractor, for whose acts he is not responsible, <i>the burden is on him to show his independence</i>.<br><br><b>Tested by these definitions and by the fact that <i>the defendant has presented practically no evidence to determine whether Venancio Nasol was in reality an independent contractor</i> or not, we are inclined to think that he is nothing but an intermediary between the defendant and certain laborers. It is indeed difficult to find that Nasol is an independent contractor;</b> a person who <i>possesses no capital</i> or money of his own to pay his obligations to them, <i>who files no bond</i> to answer for any fulfillment of his contract with his employer and <i>specially subject to the control and supervision of his employer</i>, falls short of the requisites or conditions necessary for the common and independent contractor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> (Citations omitted; emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>To support its argument that respondent-contractors are the employers of respondent-workers, and not merely labor-only contractors, DFI should have presented proof showing that respondent-contractors carry on an independent business and have sufficient capitalization. The record, however, is bereft of showing of even an attempt on the part of DFI to substantiate its argument.<br><br>DFI cannot cite the May 24, 1999 Resolution of the NLRC as basis that respondent-contractors are independent contractors. Nowhere in the NLRC Resolution does it say that the respondent-contractors are independent contractors. On the contrary, the NLRC declared that "it was not clearly established on record that said [respondent-]contractors are independent, xxx."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>Further, respondent-contractors admit, and even insist that they are engaged in labor-only contracting. As will be seen below, respondent-contractors made the admissions and declarations on two occasions: <i>first</i> was in their Formal Appearance of Counsel and Motion for Exclusion of Individual Party-Respondents filed before the LA; and <i>second</i> was in their Verified Explanation and Memorandum filed before this Court.<br><br>Before the LA, respondent-contractors categorically stated that they are "labor-only" contractors who have been engaged by DFI and DARBMUPCO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> They admitted that they do not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises and other materials, and they recruited workers to perform activities directly related to the principal operations of their employer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>Before this Court, respondents-contractors <i>again</i> admitted that they are labor-only contractors.

This does not change the situation of the parties. As correctly found by the CA, DFI, as the principal, hired the respondent-contractors and the latter, in turn, engaged the services of the respondent-workers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> This was also the unanimous finding of the SOLE,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> the LA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> and the NLRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Factual findings of the NLRC, when they coincide with the LA and affirmed by the CA are accorded with great weight and respect and even finality by this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br><i>Alilin v. Petron Corporation</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> is applicable. In that case, this Court ruled that the presence of the power of control on the part of the principal over the workers of the contractor, under the facts, prove the employer-employee relationship between the former and the latter, thus:<br><blockquote>[A] finding that a contractor is a 'labor-only' contractor is equivalent to declaring that there is an employer-employee relationship between the principal and the employees of the supposed contractor. <b>In this case, the employer-employee relationship between Petron and petitioners becomes all the more apparent due to the presence of the power of control on the part of the former over the latter.</b><br><br>It was held in <i>Orozco v. The Fifth Division of the Hon. Court of Appeals</i> that:<br><blockquote>This Court has constantly adhered to the "four­fold test" to determine whether there exists an employer-employee relationship between the parties. The four elements of an employment relationship are: (a) the selection and engagement of the employee; (b) the payment of wages; (c) the power of dismissal; and (d) the power to control the employee's conduct.<br></blockquote><b>Of these four elements, it is the power to control which is the most crucial and most determinative factor, so important, in fact, that, the other elements may even be disregarded.</b><br><br>Hence, the facts that petitioners were hired by Romeo or his father and that their salaries were paid by them do not detract from the conclusion that there exists an employer-employee relationship between the parties due to Petron's power of control over the petitioners. One manifestation of the power of control is the power to transfer employees from one work assignment to another. Here, Petron could order petitioners to do work outside of their regular "maintenance/utility" job. Also, petitioners were required to report for work everyday at the bulk plant, observe an 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily work schedule, and wear proper uniform and safety helmets as prescribed by the safety and security measures being implemented within the bulk plant. All these imply control. In an industry where safety is of paramount concern, control and supervision over sensitive operations, such as those performed by the petitioners, are inevitable if not at all necessary. Indeed, Petron deals with commodities that are highly volatile and flammable which, if mishandled or not properly attended to, may cause serious injuries and damage to property and the environment. Naturally, supervision by Petron is essential in every aspect of its product handling in order not to compromise the integrity, quality and safety of the products that it distributes to the consuming public.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> (Citations omitted; emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>That DFI is the employer of the respondent-workers is bolstered by the CA's finding that DFI exercises control over the respondent-workers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup> DFI, through its manager and supervisors provides for the work assignments and performance targets of the respondent-workers. The managers and supervisors also have the power to directly hire and terminate the respondent-workers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> Evidently, DFI wields control over the respondent-workers.<br><br>Neither can DFI argue that it is only the purchaser of the bananas produced in the awarded plantation under the BPPA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> and that under the terms of the BPPA, no employer-employee relationship exists between DFI and the respondent-workers,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote><center>UNDERTAKING OF THE FIRST PARTY<br></center><br><center>xxx<br></center><br>3. THE FIRST PARTY [DARBMUPCO] shall be responsible for the proper conduct, safety, benefits and general welfare of its members working in the plantation and specifically render free and harmless the SECOND PARTY [DPI] of any expense, liability or claims arising therefrom. <b>It is clearly recognized, by the FIRST PARTY that its members and other personnel utilized in the performance of its function under this agreement are not employees of the SECOND PARTY.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In labor-only contracting, it is the law which creates an employer-employee relationship between the principal and the workers of the labor-only contractor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br><br>Inasmuch as it is the law that forms the employment ties, the stipulation in the BPPA that respondent-workers are not employees of DFI is not controlling, as the proven facts show otherwise. The law prevails over the stipulations of the parties. Thus, in <i>Tabas v. California Manufacturing Co., Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> we held that:<br><blockquote><b>The existence of an employer-employees relation is a question of law and being such, it cannot be made the subject of agreement.</b> Hence, the fact that the manpower supply agreement between Livi and California had specifically designated the former as the petitioners' employer and had absolved the latter from any liability as an employer, will not erase either party's obligations as an employer, if an employer-employee relation otherwise exists between the workers and either firm. xxx<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Clearly, DFI is the true employer of the respondent-workers; respondent-contractors are only agents of DFI.
