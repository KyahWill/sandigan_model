They argue that increasing contribution rates would be completely unnecessary if the Corporation used its funds more judiciously.<br><br>The Petitioners-in-Intervention (<i>Migrante, et al.</i>) adopt all of the petitioners' arguments. They add that <b>Circular No. 0025, s. 2013</b> violated the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> which prescribed the non-increase of fees charged by any government office on Overseas Filipino Workers (<i>OFWs</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><center><b>THE COUNTER ARGUMENTS</b><br></center><br>The President, through the Office of the Solicitor General (<i>OSG</i>), invokes his immunity from suit as a sitting Head of State and moved that he be dropped as a party-respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>PhilHealth, through the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (<i>OGCC</i>), claims that the increases in premium contributions were supported by three actuarial studies conducted in 2010,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> 2011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and 2012.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> Moreover, it consulted World Bank representatives<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> and the affected stakeholders before implementing the increase.<br><br>The Php2,400.00 minimum annual contribution for <i>all</i> members is equivalent to the amount that the Government annually incurs to maintain coverage for the poorest of the poor.

In any case, COA's disallowance of these items are presently under appeal and <i>sub-judice</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Lastly, PhilHealth prays for the dismissal of the petition arguing: (1) that it was filed out of time;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (2) that it failed to state the material dates as required by Rule 46, Section 3 of the Rules of Court;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> (3) that the petitioners have no legal standing;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> (4) that the petitioners disregarded the hierarchy of courts because the issue was not of transcendental importance;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and (5) that the petition has neither basis nor merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><center><b>OUR RULING</b><br></center><br>We DISMISS the petition for lack of merit.<br><br>At the outset, we stress the settled principle that a sitting head of state enjoys immunity from suit during his actual tenure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The events that gave rise to the present action and the filing of the case occurred during the incumbency of President Aquino. Moreover, the petition contains no allegations as to any specific presidential act or omission that amounted to grave abuse of discretion. Therefore, it is only proper to drop the President as a party-respondent.<br><br>Under the NHIA, <b>all citizens of the Philippines are required to enroll</b> in the Program; membership is <b>mandatory</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> In other words, the NHIP covers all Filipinos in accordance with the principles of universality and <b><u>compulsory coverage</u></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Ultimately, every Filipino is affected by an increase in the premium rates. Thus, the petitioners have sufficient legal standing to file the present suit.<br><br>Nevertheless, the petitioners availed of the wrong remedy in coming to this Court. <i>Certiorari</i> is a remedy of <b>last resort</b> available only when there is no appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>An administrative agency's exercise of <i>quasi-legislative</i> powers may be questioned and prohibited through an ordinary action for injunction before the Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The petitioners failed to explain their premature resort to <i>certiorari</i> and their disregard for the hierarchy of courts, these procedural grounds warrant the outright dismissal of their petition.<br><br>Even if the procedural issues are disregarded, the petitions still failed to show that PhilHealth gravely abused its discretion in issuing the assailed circulars. On the contrary, PhilHealth acted with reasonable prudence and sensitivity to the public's needs. It postponed the rate increase several times to relieve the public of the burden of simultaneous rate and price increases. It accommodated the stakeholders and heard them through consultation. In the end, it even retained a lower salary bracket ceiling (Php35,000.00 instead of Php50,000.00) and a lower rate (2.5% rather than the planned 3%).<br><br>The term "grave abuse of discretion" has a specific and well-defined meaning in established jurisprudence. It is not an amorphous concept that can be shaped or manipulated to suit a litigant's purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Grave abuse of discretion is present when there is such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> or where power is exercised arbitrarily or in a despotic manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal hostility amounting to an evasion of positive duty, or to a virtual refusal to perform a legal duty or act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Other than a sweeping allegation of grave abuse of discretion under its Nature of the Petition section,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> the petition is devoid of substantial basis.<br><br>PhilHealth has the mandate of realizing the State's vision of affordable and accessible health services for all Filipinos, especially the poor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> To realize this vision and effectively administer the Program, PhilHealth is empowered to promulgate its policies, and to formulate a contribution schedule that can realistically support its programs.<br><br>PhilHealth justified the increase in annual premium rates with the enhanced benefits and the expanded coverage of medical conditions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> This reasonable decision to widen the coverage of the program - which led to increased premium rates - is a business judgment that this Court cannot interfere with.<br><br>This Court does not have administrative supervision over administrative agencies, nor is it an entity engaged in making business decisions. We cannot interfere in purely administrative matters nor substitute administrative policies and business decisions with our own. This would amount to judicial overreach. The courts' only concern is the legality, not the wisdom, of an agency's actions. Policy matters should be left to policy makers.<br><br>The petitioners argue that the new schedule does not conform to the NHIA's standard of a reasonable, equitable, and progressive schedule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Therefore, PhilHealth acted <i>ultra vires</i>.

While the merger primarily impacts on the members of the former 7,999-and-below bracket, the Corporation explained that the current minimum annual contribution corresponds to the amount necessary to retain coverage for even the poorest of the poor. The Corporation broke down this amount (Php2,400.00) as: Php1,000.00 for drugs and other medicine, Php300.00 for administrative costs, Php500.00 for consultation, and Php600.00 for in-patient services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> This new amount is neither unreasonable nor unconscionable.<br><br>Moreover, the contribution schedule, <i>as a whole</i>, remains equitable and progressive. The salary base and the premium contributions increase as a member's actual salary increases. A member who earns Php9,000.00 is required to contribute much less than a member who earns Php31,000.00 but they both enjoy the same coverage. This satisfies the standard of a reasonable, equitable, and progressive contribution schedule.<br><br><b>Section 36 of the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act does not apply to premium contributions under the National Health Insurance Program.</b><br><br>The NHIP is a social insurance program. It is the government's means to allow the healthy to help pay for the care of the sick, and for those who can afford medical care to provide subsidy to those who cannot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> The premium collected from members is <i>neither</i> a fee nor an expense but an <b>enforced contribution</b> to the common insurance fund.<br><br>From this perspective, the petitioners-in-intervention cannot invoke the non-increase clause under Section 36 of the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act. There is no valid distinction between migrant workers and the rest of the population that would justify a lower premium rate for the former. It would unduly burden the other PhilHealth contributors in favor of Overseas Filipino Workers.<br><br>Any distinctions between OFWs and all the other sectors are not germane to the NHIA's purpose of ensuring affordable, acceptable, available, and accessible health care services for all citizens of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> Therefore, the application of Section 36 of the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act to obstruct the increase of premiums under the NHIP amounts to an <i>unreasonable</i> classification, in violation of the equal protection clause.<br><br>Furthermore, the premium rate for indigent members was pegged at Php2,400.00 - the lowest in the salary bracket for the Employed Sector. Pursuant to Section 28 of the NHIA, contributions made in behalf of indigent members cannot exceed the minimum contributions for employed members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> A non-increase in the minimum premium contribution of OFWs would create a ridiculous situation where the poorest of the poor are required to contribute more than a member employed abroad. This violates the standard of a progressive and equitable contribution scheme.<br><br><b>This Court cannot encroach on the Commission on Audit's jurisdiction.</b><br><br>The petitioners' allegations of unconscionable bonuses to PhilHealth executives and their unethical expenditure of funds, if true, are reprehensible. However, it is equally objectionable for the petitioners to make such allegations <i>without substantiating them</i>. That they did not even bother to annex any document to support their factual claims, is very irresponsible.<br><br>Further, even if the allegations were true, this Court does not have the power to audit the expenditures of the Government or any of its agencies and instrumentalities. The Constitution saw fit to vest this power on an independent Constitutional body: the Commission on Audit (<i>COA</i>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> The COA alone has the power to disallow unnecessary and extravagant government spending.<br><br>The Separation of Powers doctrine, so fundamental in our system of government, precludes this Court from encroaching on the powers and functions of an independent constitutional body. Our participation in the audit process is limited to determining whether the COA committed grave abuse of discretion in rendering its audit decisions. We will not overstep the bounds of our jurisdiction.<br><br>Moreover, the alleged improprieties pertain to PhilHealth's manner of <i>spending</i> its funds, not to the assailed act of <i>raising</i> the premium rates. While the alleged improprieties may constitute grave abuse of discretion, it does not follow that PhilHealth gravely abused its discretion in issuing the assailed circulars. The argument is a <i>non sequitur</i>.<br><br>Finally, there is no reason to consider the allegation that the premium rates were increased without conducting an actuarial study. Again, the petitioners simply made bare allegations and did not bother to cite their bases or justifications; while PhilHealth produced the three actuarial studies they used.<br><br>In sum, all things being considered, we see no basis to grant the writ of <i>certiorari</i> prayed for.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>DISMISS</b> the petition for lack of merit.
