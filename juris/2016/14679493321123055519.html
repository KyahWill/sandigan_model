Besides, even if so stated, the residence or principal office address of petitioners was admittedly at Quintin Paredes Street, Binondo, Manila, and not in Makati City. Hence, the venue was mislaid, and the Makati-RTC, Br. 137 did not have jurisdiction over the said cases.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In an Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated February 20, 2007, the Makati-RTC, Br. 137 granted the said motion and dismissed <b>Criminal Case Nos. 06-877 and 06-882 </b>on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It found that the Informations filed in these cases failed to state that any one of the offended parties resides in Makati City, or that the subject articles were printed or first published in Makati City.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Hence, the failure to state the aforementioned details was a fatal defect which negated its jurisdiction over the criminal cases.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[20]</sup></font> Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> which was, however, denied in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> dated September 3, 2007.

No. 32148.<br><br><center><b>The Proceedings Before the CA</b><br></center><br>In <b>CA-GR. CR No. 31467</b>, the CA noted that while petitioners filed a Notice of Appeal, the Appellants' Brief was filed only by the private prosecutor, and not by the OSG as required by law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> It likewise observed from the records that the OSG filed a Manifestation and Motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated September 16, 2008 asking that "it be excused from filing any documents or pleadings relative to the aforementioned case[,] considering that it had not received any endorsement coming from the Department of Justice to appeal the same."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Moreover, the CA held that "the Chief City Prosecutor-of Makati City was required to comment, and he categorically stated in his Explanation and Compliance that he did not authorize the filing, nor conform to the filing of an appeal from the quashal of the two (2) Informations in <b>[Criminal Case Nos. 06-877 and 06-882]</b>."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Thus, in the assailed Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> dated February 24, 2012, the CA denied the appeal outright on the ground that the same was not filed by the authorized official, <i>i.e.</i>, the OSG. It remarked that although the private prosecutor may, at certain times, be permitted to participate in criminal proceedings on appeal in the CA, his participation is always subject to prior approval of the OSG; and the former cannot be permitted to adopt a position that is not consistent with that of the OSG.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Petitioners' motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> was denied in the assailed Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> dated September 5, 2012, prompting them to file the petition in G.R. No. 203370.<br><br>The same was reached when the CA, in the assailed Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> dated March 31, 2014 in CA-GR. CR. No. 32148, denied Malayan Insurance's appeal, but this time, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. The ruling was premised on its finding that the case of <i>Bonifacio v. RTC of Makati, Branch 149 (Bonifacio)</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which involved one of the thirteen (13) Libel cases, particularly Criminal Case No. 06-876, participated in by the same parties albeit concerning a different defamatory article, is already controlling.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Hence, since this Court directed the quashal of Information in Criminal Case No. 06-876 and dismissed the same, the CA did not delve on the propriety of the Makati-RTC, Br. 62's finding of probable cause, and instead, adopted, the same course of action in Bonifacio. In its view, all other issues are rendered moot and academic in light of this Court's declaration that the Makati-RTC is without jurisdiction to try and hear cases for Libel filed by Malayan Insurance against respondents. <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Malayan Insurance's motion for reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> was denied in the assailed Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> dated October 17, 2014, prompting it to file the petition in<b> G.R. No. 215106.</b><br><br><center><b>The Issues Before the Court</b><br></center><br>In <b>G.R. No. 203370</b>, petitioners contend that the CA erred in denying the appeal in<b> CA-GR. CR No. 31467</b> due to lack of the OSG's authorization. While in <b>G.R. No. 215106</b>, Malayan Insurance argued that the CA likewise erred in denying its appeal, in <b>CA-GR. CR. No. 32148</b>, but this time, on jurisdictional grounds.<br><br><center><b>The Court's Ruling</b><br></center><br><u><b>I. Resolution of G.R. No. 203370</b></u><br><br>The authority to represent the State in appeals of criminal cases before the Court and the CA is vested solely in the OSG<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[45]</sup></font> which is "the law office of the Government whose specific powers and functions include that of representing the Republic and/or the People [of the Philippines] before any court in any action which affects the welfare of the people as the ends of justice may require."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Section 35 (1), Chapter 12, Title III, Book IV of the 1987 Administrative Code<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> provides that:<br><br><blockquote>Section 35. Powers and Functions. —<b> The Office of the Solicitor General shall represent the Government of the Philippines</b>, its agencies and instrumentalities and its officials and agents in any litigation, proceeding, investigation or matter requiring the services of a lawyer, x x x. It shall have the following specific powers and functions:<br><br>(1) <b>Represent the Government in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals in all criminal proceedings</b>; represent the Government and its officers in the Supreme Court, and Court of Appeals, and all other courts or tribunals in all civil actions and special proceedings in which the Government or any officer thereof in his official capacity is a party. (Emphases supplied)<br></blockquote><br>In <i>People v. Piccio (Piccio)</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> which involved one of the thirteen (13) criminal cases between the same parties, this Court held that "if there is a dismissal of a criminal case by the trial court or if there is an acquittal of the accused, <b><u>it is only the OSG that may bring an appeal on the criminal aspect representing the People</u></b>. The rationale therefor is rooted in the principle that the party affected by the dismissal of the criminal action is the People and not the petitioners who are mere complaining witnesses. For this reason,<u><b> the People are therefore deemed as the real parties in interest in the criminal case and, therefore, only the OSG can represent them in criminal proceedings pending in the CA or in this Court</b></u>. In view of the corollary principle that every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party in interest who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or by the party entitled to the avails of the suit, an appeal of the criminal case not filed by the People as represented by the OSG is perforce dismissible. The private complainant or the offended party may, however, file an appeal without the intervention of the OSG but only insofar as the civil liability of the accused is concerned. He may also file a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> even without the intervention of the OSG, but only to the end of preserving his interest in the civil aspect of the case."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In this case, as in <i>Piccio</i>, records show that petitioners' appeal in <b>CA-G.R. CR No. 31467</b> principally sought the remand of <b>Criminal Case Nos. 06-877 and 06-882</b> to the Makati-RTC, Br. 137 for arraignment and trial, or, in the alternative, amend the Informations, and therefore, was not intended to merely preserve their interest in the civil aspect of the case. Thus, as its appeal was filed in relation to the criminal aspect of the case, it is necessary that the same be filed with the authorization of the OSG, which, by law, is the proper representative of the real party in interest in the criminal proceedings, the People. There being no authorization given, the appeal was rightfully dismissed by the CA. In fact, in its Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> dated July 5, 2013, the People, through the OSG, even sought the dismissal of petitioners' appeal before this Court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> on the ground that "petitioners have no legal personality to elevate on appeal the quashal of the [Informations] in the subject criminal cases."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> As it is, petitioners have no legal standing to interpose an appeal in the criminal proceeding; hence, as they went beyond the bounds of their interest, petitioners cannot successfully contest the propriety of the Makati-RTC, Br. 137's dismissal of the criminal cases. It must, however, be clarified that the CA's denial of petitioners' appeal is without prejudice to their filing of the appropriate action to preserve their interest in the civil aspect of the Libel cases, following the parameters of Rule 111 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br><u><b>II. Resolution of G.R. No. 215106</b></u><br><br>"Venue is jurisdictional in criminal actions such that the place where the crime was committed determines not only the venue of the action but constitutes an essential element of jurisdiction. This principle acquires even greater import in libel cases, given that Article 360 [of the RPC], as amended [by Republic Act No. 4363<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>], specifically provides for the possible venues for the institution of the criminal and civil aspects of such cases,"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> to wit:<br><br><blockquote>Article 360. <i>Persons responsible</i>. - x x x. <br><br>x x x x<br><br>The criminal and civil action for damages in cases of written defamations as provided for in this chapter, shall be filed simultaneously or separately <u><b>with the court of first instance of the province or city where the libelous article is printed and first published or where any of the offended parties actually resides at the time of the commission of the offense</b></u>: x x x.<br><br>x x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>Thus, generally speaking, "the venue of libel cases where the complainant is a private individual is limited to only <u>either of two places</u>, namely: 1) where the complainant actually resides at the time of the commission of the offense; or 2) where the alleged defamatory article was printed and first published.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>In this case, the CA proceeded to deny Malayan Insurance's appeal in view of the Makati-RTC, Br. 62's lack of jurisdiction over Criminal Case No. 06-884. It held that this Court's ruling in Bonifacio is already "controlling here because they involve the same parties and the same issues," <sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> observing that this case is "one (1) of the thirteen (13) cases/[I]nformations filed before the [Makati-RTC] which originated from the complaint initiated by [Gimenez]."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>To contextualize, the Libel case involved in<i> Bonifacio</i> was Criminal Case No. 06-876 which, as the CA observed, involved the same parties herein. Highlighting the Amended Information's allegation that the offending article "<u><b>was first published and accessed by the private complainant in Makati City,</b></u>"<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> respondents submitted that "[t]he prosecution erroneously laid the venue of the case in the place where the offended party accessed the internet-published article."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> This Court sustained the argument, and directed the Makati-RTC to quash the Amended Information in Criminal Case No. 06-876 and dismiss the case, ratiocinating in the following wise:<br><br><blockquote>If the circumstances as to where the libel was printed and first published are used by the offended party as basis for the venue in the criminal action, the Information must allege with particularity where the defamatory article was printed and <u>first published</u>, as evidenced or supported by, for instance, the address of their editorial or business offices in the case of newspapers, magazines or serial publications. This pre­condition becomes necessary in order to forestall any inclination to harass.<br><br>The same measure cannot be reasonably expected when it pertains to defamatory material appearing on a website on the internet as there would be no way of determining the <i>situs</i> of its printing and first publication. To credit Gimenez's premise of equating his first <i>access</i> to the defamatory article on petitioners' website in Makati with printing and first publication would spawn the very ills that the amendment to Article 360 of the RPC sought to discourage and prevent. It hardly requires much imagination to see the chaos that would ensue in situations where the website's author or writer, a blogger or anyone who posts messages therein could be sued for libel anywhere in the Philippines that the private complainant may have allegedly accessed the offending website.<br><br>For the Court to hold that the Amended Information sufficiently vested jurisdiction in the courts of Makati simply because the defamatory article was accessed therein would open the floodgates to the libel suit being filed in all other locations where the <i>pepcoalition</i> website is likewise accessed or capable of being accessed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Underscoring in the original)<br></blockquote><br>Here, Malayan Insurance opposes the CA's application of <i>Bonifacio</i>, asserting that the venue was properly laid as the Informations subject of this case state in one continuous sentence that: "x x x in Makati City, [Metro Manila,] Philippines and a place within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court xxx, the above-named accused x x x did then and there x x x <b>caused to be composed, posted and published</b> in the said website www.pepcoalition.com and [sic] injurious and defamatory article."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> They also aver that <i>Bonifacio</i> laid down an entirely new requirement on internet Libel cases which did not exist prior to its promulgation and, hence, should not be applied retroactively to Malayan Insurance's prejudice.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>While <i>Bonifacio'</i>s applicability was indeed squarely raised in the instant petition, this Court finds that it would be improper not to pass upon this issue considering that - similar to the appeal in CA-G.R. CR No. 31467 - the appeal in CA-G.R. CRNo. 32148, <b>as well as this petition for review</b>, suffers from a fatal defect in that they were filed without the conformity of the OSG. As earlier stated, the right to prosecute criminal cases pertains exclusively to the People, which is, therefore, the proper party to bring the appeal, through the representation of the OSG. <u><b>The People are deemed as the real parties in interest in the criminal case and, therefore, only the OSG can represent them in criminal proceedings pending in the CA or in this Court</b></u>. As the records bear out, this Court, in a Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> dated September 9, 2015, required the OSG to file its Comment so as to be given the ample opportunity to manifest its desire to prosecute the present appeal, in representation of the People. However, in a Manifestation (In lieu of Comment),<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> the People, through the OSG, manifested that it is adopting its Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> dated July 5, 2013 in G.R.
