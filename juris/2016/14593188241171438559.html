Grave abuse of discretion connotes a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment, done in a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, the character of which being so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>In labor disputes, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed to the NLRC when, <i>inter alia, </i>its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>Guided by the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the CA committed reversible error in granting Carbonilla, Jr.'s<i> certiorari </i>petition since the NLRC did not gravely abuse its discretion in ruling that he was validly dismissed from employment as CPMPC was able to prove, through substantial evidence, the existence of just causes warranting the same.<br><br>Basic is the rule that an employer may validly terminate the services of an employee for <u><b>any of the just causes</b></u> enumerated under Article 296 (formerly Article 282) of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> namely:<br><blockquote>(a) Serious misconduct or willful disobedience by the employee of the lawful orders of his employer or representative in connection with his work;<br><br>(b) Gross and habitual neglect by the employee of his duties;<br><br>(c) Fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative;<br><br>(d) Commission of a crime or offense by the employee against the person of his employer or any immediate member of his family or his duly authorized representatives; and<br><br>(e) Other causes analogous to the foregoing.<br></blockquote>As may be gathered from the tenor of CPMPC's Notice of Dismissal, it is apparent that Carbonilla, Jr.'s employment was terminated on the grounds of, among others, serious misconduct and loss of trust and confidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br>On the first ground, case law characterizes misconduct as a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character and implies wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> For misconduct to be considered as a just cause for termination, the following requisites must concur: (<i>a</i>) the misconduct must be serious; (<i>b</i>) it must relate to the performance of the employee's duties showing that the employee has become unfit to continue working for the employer; and (<i>c</i>) it must have been performed with wrongful intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup><br><br>All of the foregoing requisites have been duly established in this case. Records reveal that Carbonilla, Jr.'s serious misconduct consisted of him frequently exhibiting disrespectful and belligerent behavior, not only to his colleagues, but also to his superiors. He even used his stature as a law graduate to insist that he is "above" them, often using misguided legalese to weasel his way out of the charges against him, as well as to strong-arm his colleagues and superiors into succumbing to his arrogance. Carbonilla, Jr.'s obnoxious attitude is highlighted by the following documents on record: (<i>a</i>) his reply to HRD 202 File 2008.02.26.036 dated February 26, 2008 wherein he threatened HRD Manager Marquez with a lawsuit, stating that if the memorandum is "proven malicious, [she] might be answerable to a certain degree of civil liability which the 1987 Constitution has given to individuals";<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> (<i>b</i>) HRD 202 File 2008.06.26.086 dated June 26, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> wherein he berated COO Bentillo in front of her subordinates with the statement: "<i>[I]kaw ra may di mosalig ba, ka kwalipikado adto niya, maski mag contest pa mo, lupigon gani ka</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> or "[y]ou're the only one who doesn't trust her, she is very qualified, you even lose in comparison to her[,]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> and his reply thereto wherein he dismissed the charge as made with malicious intent and aimed to discredit his person;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> (<i>c</i>) HRD 202 File 2008.06.26.088 dated June 26, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> wherein he argued with the CEO Quevedo, insisting that he had the authority to hire a new staff, and his reply thereto where he cited the Philippine Law Dictionary to maintain that his act did not amount to insubordination;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> (<i>d</i>) HRD 202 File 2008.06.26.0<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> dated June 26, 2008 wherein he openly questioned the authority of HRD Manager Marquez in refusing to hire a new staff and his reply thereto where he again cited the Philippine Law Dictionary to insist that he did not commit acts of insubordination;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> and (<i>e</i>) HRD 202 File 2008.07.04.095 dated July 4, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> wherein he openly and improperly confronted the CPMPC CEO during a Board of Directors' inquiry hearing, to which he again maintained that his acts did not constitute misconduct, gross disrespect, and loss of trust and confidence as he was only looking after the welfare of the cooperative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br>Indisputably, Carbonilla, Jr.'s demeanor towards his colleagues and superiors is serious in nature as it is not only reflective of defiance but also breeds of antagonism in the work environment. Surely, within the bounds of law, management has the rightful prerogative to take away dissidents and undesirables from the workplace. It should not be forced to deal with difficult personnel, especially one who occupies a position of trust and confidence, as will be later discussed, else it be compelled to act against the best interest of its business. Carbonilla, Jr.'s conduct is also clearly work-related as all were incidents which sprung from the performance of his duties. Lastly, the misconduct was performed with wrongful intent as no justifiable reason was presented to excuse the same. On the contrary, Carbonilla, Jr. comes off as a smart aleck who would even go to the extent of dangling whatever knowledge he had of the law against his employer in a combative manner. As succinctly put by CPMPC, "[e]very time [Carbonilla, Jr.'s] attention was called for some inappropriate actions, he would always show his Book, Philippine Law Dictionary and would ask the CEO or HRD Manager under what provision of the law he would be liable for the complained action or omission."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Irrefragably, CPMPC is justified in no longer tolerating the grossly discourteous attitude of Carbonilla, Jr. as it constitutes conduct unbecoming of his managerial position and a serious breach of order and discipline in the workplace.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br>With all these factored in, CPMPC's dismissal of Carbonilla, Jr. on the ground of serious misconduct was amply warranted.<br><br>For another, Carbonilla, Jr.'s dismissal was also justified on the ground of loss of trust and confidence. According to jurisprudence, <b>loss of trust and confidence</b> will validate an employee's dismissal when it is shown that: (<i>a</i>) the employee concerned holds a position of trust and confidence; and (<i>b</i>) he performs an act that would justify such loss of trust and confidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> There are two (2) classes of positions of trust: <i>first</i>, managerial employees whose primary duty consists of the management of the establishment in which they are employed or of a department or a subdivision thereof, and to other officers or members of the managerial staff; and <i>second</i>, fiduciary rank-and-file employees, such as cashiers, auditors, property custodians, or those who, in the normal exercise of their functions, regularly handle significant amounts of money or property. These employees, though rank-and-file, are routinely charged with the care and custody of the employer's money or property, and are thus classified as occupying positions of trust and confidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup><br><br>Records reveal that Carbonilla, Jr. occupied a position of trust and confidence as he was employed as Credit and Collection Manager, and later on, as Legal and Collection Manager, tasked with the duties of, among others, handling the credit and collection activities of the cooperative, which included recommending loan approvals, formulating and implementing credit and collection policies, and conducting trainings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> With such responsibilities, it is fairly evident that Carbonilla, Jr. is a managerial employee within the ambit of the first classification of employees afore-discussed. The loss of CPMPC's trust and confidence in Carbonilla, Jr., as imbued in that position, was later justified in light of the latter's commission of the following acts: (<i>a</i>) the forwarding of the mediation settlements for notarization to a lawyer who was not the authorized legal retainer of CPMPC (HRD 202 File 2008.07.09.103 dated July 9, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup>); (<i>b</i>) the pull-out of important records and vital documents from the office premises, which were either lost or returned already tampered and altered (HRD 202 File 2008.07.15.106 dated July 15, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> and HRD 202 File 2008.07.19.111 dated July 19, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup>); and (<i>c</i>) the incurring of unliquidated cash advances related to the notarial transactions of the mediation agreements (HRD 202 File 2008.07.16.107 dated July 16, 2008<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup>). While Carbonilla, Jr. posited that these actuations were resorted with good intentions as he was only finding ways for CPMPC to save up on legal fees, this defense can hardly hold, considering that all of these transactions were not only highly irregular, but also done without the prior knowledge and consent of CPMPC's management. Cast against this light, Carbonilla, Jr.'s performance of the said acts therefore gives CPMPC more than enough reason to lose trust and confidence in him. To this, it must be emphasized that "employers are allowed a wider latitude of discretion in terminating the services of employees who perform functions by which their nature require the employer's full trust and confidence. Mere existence of basis for believing that the employee has breached the trust and confidence of the employer is sufficient and does not require proof beyond reasonable doubt. Thus, when an employee has been guilty of breach of trust or his employer has ample reason to distrust him, a labor tribunal cannot deny the employer the authority to dismiss him,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>Perforce, having established the actual breaches of duty committed by Carbonilla, Jr. and CPMPC's observance of due process, the Court no longer needs to further examine the other charges against Carbonilla, Jr., as it is already clear that the CA erred in ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when the latter declared that CPMPC validly dismissed Carbonilla, Jr. from his job. The totality and gravity of Carbonilla, Jr.'s infractions throughout the course of his employment completely justified CPMPC's decision to finally terminate his employment. The Court's pronouncement in <i>Realda v. New Age Graphics, Inc.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> is instructive on this matter, to wit:<br><blockquote><u><b>The totality of infractions or the number of violations committed during the period of employment shall be considered in determining the penalty to be imposed upon an erring employee. The offenses committed by petitioner should not be taken singly and separately.

While it may be true that petitioner was penalized for his previous infractions, this does not and should not mean that his employment record would be wiped clean of his infractions. After all, the record of an employee is a relevant consideration in determining the penalty that should be meted out since an employee's past misconduct and present behavior must be taken together in determining the proper imposable penalty[.] Despite the sanctions imposed upon petitioner, he continued to commit misconduct and exhibit undesirable behavior on board. <u><b>Indeed, the employer cannot be compelled to retain a misbehaving employee, or one who is guilty of acts inimical to its interests.</b></u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>On a final point, the Court notes that Carbonilla, Jr.'s award of unpaid salaries and 13<sup>th</sup> month pay were validly offset by his accountabilities to CPMPC in the amount of P129,455.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> Pursuant to Article 1278<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup> in relation to Article 1706<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> of the Civil Code and Article 113 (c)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> of the Labor Code, compensation can take place between two persons who are creditors and debtors of each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> Considering that Carbonilla, Jr. had existing debts to CPMPC which were incurred during the existence of the employer-employee relationship, the amount which may be due him in wages was correctly deducted therefrom.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>GRANTED</b>.
