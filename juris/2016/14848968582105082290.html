As a result, BSP was compelled to file an action for annulment of title and reconveyance or annulment of title, the action subject of the present petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> BSP argued that the trial court, in granting MARRECO's Motion to Dismiss, erred in concluding that to rule otherwise would amount to an intrusion into an order of a co-equal court. According to BSP, contrary to the pronouncement of the trial court in its March 22, 2007 Order, there can be no intrusion into an order of a co-equal court since Civil Case No. MAN-3902 did not order the cancellation of TCT No. 46781 while BSP's complaint for annulment of title and reconveyance or annulment of title assails the Register of Deeds' cancellation of TCT No. 46781.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>We find that BSP's appeal does not only involve questions of law. It also involves questions of fact. The allegations in BSP's complaint and appellant's brief as to the antecedent facts that led to the cancellation of TCT No. 46781 create an uncertainty on the propriety of the trial court's pronouncement that to entertain BSP's complaint would amount to an intrusion into an order of a co-equal court and call for a calibration of the evidence on record. Also telling is BSP's allegation that it is a mortgagee-in­ good faith who obtained its title to the property by being the highest bidder during the auction sale in the foreclosure proceedings. As an innocent third party, it is not bound by whatever transpired between Gotesco and MARRECO. These matters constitute a question of fact and not a question of law as MARRECO would like to present it. As the CA correctly held:<br><blockquote>It is indubitable that what impelled BSP to file the instant complaint for annulment of title and reconveyance or quieting of title before RTC Branch 56, docketed as Civil Case No. Man-5524 is not the Decision of January 19, 2004 rendered by RTC, Branch 55 in Civil Case No. Man-3902 but the subsequent cancellation of BSP's title without any court order to that effect. From this premise, the issue on whether or not the assumption of jurisdiction over the instant case is equivalent to annulment of judgment of a co­equal tribunal is considered a question of fact. The surrounding facts which brought about the cancellation of BSP's title need to be examined to determine whether the complaint subject of the present appeal is indeed one that amounts to the annulment of judgment of a co-equal court.<br><br>At first glance, this issue appears to involve a question of law since it does not concern itself with the truth or falsity of certain facts. Still, in order that this Court can make a ruling on the nature of the action instituted before RTC, Branch 56, it has to evaluate the existence and the relevance of the circumstances that led to the cancellation of BSP's title. The determination of these facts is crucial as it will resolve whether the assumption of jurisdiction over the instant case would indeed tantamount to violation of the doctrine on non-interference, whether the cancellation of BSP's title by virtue of the Order of January 19, 2004 rendered by RTC, Branch 55 is proper though the order is silent on the matter, whether such cancellation is tantamount to a collateral attack on BSP's title. In short, in order to address fully the issues raised by BSP in its Brief, this Court necessarily has to make factual findings.<br><br>Notably, plaintiff-appellant brought the present appeal raising mixed questions of fact and law. BSP impugns the decision of the RTC dismissing its complaint on the ground that it violates the principle on non-interference to a co­ equal court The resolution of the propriety of dismissal entails a review of the factual circumstances that led the trial court to decide in such manner. Further, BSP also questions the lower court's appreciation of the true import of the Order dated January 19, 2004 and its disregard of the provisions under the Civil Code on quieting of title. Hence, the filing of the present appeal before US is proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>Given the mixed questions of law and fact raised, BSP properly elevated the RTC's March 22, 2007 Order to the CA on ordinary appeal under Rule 41, Section 2 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and <i>Mandamus</i> is hereby <b>DISMISSED</b>.
