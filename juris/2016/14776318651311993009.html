				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case questions the propriety of the dismissal by the Court of Appeals (CA) of a Rule 43 petition for review of a decision of the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA), for failure to appeal the same to the Secretary of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), and subsequently, to the Office of the President (OP).<br><br><center><b>Facts</b><br></center><br>On September 28, 2007, respondent 168 Shipping Lines, Inc. (respondent) filed with the MARINA Regional Office V (MARINA RO V), Legaspi City an application<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) to operate M/V Star Ferry I, a roll-on-roll-off vessel, in the route Matnog, Sorsogon to Allen, Northern Samar, and vice versa. The schedule of trips as reflected in the application has 90 departures from the port of Matnog, Sorsogon and 86 departures from the port of Allen, Northern Samar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Peñafrancia Shipping Corporation and Santa Clara Shipping Corporation (petitioners), existing operators who own and operate ferry boats serving the ports of Allen, Northern Samar and Matnog, Sorsogon, intervened in the proceeding and opposed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the application on the following grounds: (1) respondent failed to submit a Certificate of Berthing as required under MARINA Memorandum Circular No. 74-B;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (2) the proposed schedule of trips in the original application is physically impossible to perform by the applicant's lone vessel, the M/V Star Ferry I;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and (3) there exists an overtonnage in the route applied for by the respondent, thus warranting the intervention of MARINA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Respondent countered that under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9295<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR): (1) an application for CPC is not adversarial in character and thus, a motion to intervene and opposition are not allowed; and (2) there is no requirement for the CPC applicant to secure a Certificate of Berthing from the Philippine Ports Authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On December 13, 2007, the MARINA RO V required respondent to file an amended CPC application with workable sailing frequencies/schedule of trips.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> However, instead of complying with the directive, respondent merely submitted a pleading denominated as RE: ADOPTION OF AMENDED SCHEDULE OF TRIPS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The MARINA RO V, in its Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> dated February 1, 2008, denied due course to respondent's application. Respondent filed its Motion for Reconsideration but this was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Respondent filed a Notice of Appeal on March 26, 2008 before the Office of the MARINA Administrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On August 8, 2008, MARINA Administrator Vicente T. Suazo, Jr., joined by Deputy Administrator for Operations Primo V. Rivera, all acting by authority of the Board, reversed the Decision of the MARINA RO V and granted respondent's application for issuance of a CPC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Thus, petitioners sought reconsideration of the MARINA Decision, but their motion was denied through a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> signed by the MARINA Officer-in-Charge Maria Elena H. Bautista who was then concurrent Undersecretary for Maritime Transport of the DOTC.<br><br>Petitioners appealed to the CA via Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. However, the CA dismissed the petition for failure of the petitioners to exhaust administrative remedies, hence, for lack of cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The CA dismissed the petition through its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> dated March 24, 2009, holding that:<br><blockquote>Contrary to petitioners' stance that the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) is an independent agency and that it has the final say in the outcome of its adjudication in any contested matter, this Court finds and holds that MARINA is an entity within the Executive Department. It will be noted that Presidential Decree No. 474 (Maritime Industry' Decree of 1974) organized MARINA under the Office of the President. This was modified on July 23, 1979 by Executive Order No. 546 wherein MARINA was made an attached agency of the then Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) for policy and program coordination. This was confirmed by the Administrative Code of 1987 x x x which explicitly provides that MARINA is an agency attached to the Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC).<br><br>Hence, MARINA is not independent of the executive structural organization and the ruling of the MARINA Administrator is subject to the consecutive reviews of the DOTC Secretary and the Office of the President as its administrative superiors in the Executive Department pursuant to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies which requires an administrative decision to first be appealed to the administrative superiors up to the highest level before it may be elevated to a court of justice for review. Thus, if a remedy within the administrative machinery can still be had by giving the administrative body concerned the opportunity to decide on,the matter that comes within its jurisdiction, then such remedy should be priorly exhausted before the court's judicial power is invoked.<br><br><u>Petitioners' failure to resort to the DOTC Secretary and then the Office of the President, in case of an adverse decision, and the filing of the herein petition before this Court is a premature invocation of the Court's intervention which renders the instant petition without cause of action, hence, dismissible.</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (Underscoring supplied; citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration but this was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Hence, this petition.<br><br>Petitioners, relying on the IRR of R.A. No. 9295, argue that: (1) a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court is the immediate and direct remedy from the adverse rulings of the MARINA;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> (2) the proper forum for review of the decision rendered by a quasi-judicial agency is the CA;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (3) the decision and resolution subject of the Rule 43 petition were acts of the MARINA Board, and not merely by the Administrator;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (4) assuming an appeal to the DOTC Secretary and the Office of the President is necessary, this case is an exception because . an appeal would be a superfluity;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (5) the doctrine of qualified political agency applies because the DOTC Secretary, who is the chairman of the MARINA Board, is the alter ego of the President;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and (6) it would be impractical to file an appeal with the OP because an individual from the OP is also a member of the MARINA Board.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In its Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> respondent counters that: (1) the IRR provision on appeal is void and cannot supplant Section 19, Chapter IV, Book VII of the Administrative Code of 1987 which provides that an appeal from a final decision of the agency may be taken to the Department Head unless otherwise provided by law;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (2) the IRR is inapplicable since it did not provide for the mode of appeal of the decisions of the MARINA Board, rather, it provided for appeals from an order, ruling, decision or resolution of the MARINA Administrator;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (3) the DOTC is an attached agency under the control of the executive department and the decisions or rulings rendered by the MARINA Board in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions are subject to the review of the DOTC Secretary and the OP;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (4) the MARINA was never taken out of the framework of the executive department;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> (5) even assuming that the decisions by the MARINA are not reviewable by the DOTC, the Constitution and the Administrative Code of 1987 provide that the President shall have control of all the executive departments, bureaus and offices;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and (6) the case is not an exception to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Respondent moved to dismiss the petition on the ground that petitioners committed a willful act of forum shopping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Petitioners filed a Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> (moratorium petition) dated March 22, 2010 before the MARINA, praying the latter to issue a moratorium in the grant of CPCs for carriage of passengers and cargoes covering the routes Matnog, Sorsogon - Allen, Northern Samar or Matnog; Sorsogon - Dapdap, Allen, Northern Samar or Matnog; Sorsogon — San Isidro, Northern Samar and vice-versa. They contend that the moratorium petition is an attempt by the petitioners to achieve what they sought to achieve in the present case, <i>i.e.</i>, to prevent respondent or other entities from operating in the subject routes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Petitioners, in their Comment (To Respondent's Manifestation/Submission with Leave of Court dated June 1, 2010),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> maintain that there is no forum shopping since the two cases have different causes of action. In the present case, if the judgment is favorable to petitioners, the effect will be retroactive, <i>i.e.</i>, voidance of the CPC already issued by the MARINA to respondent. Meanwhile, if the moratorium petition is granted, the effect of the moratorium will be prospective, <i>i.e.</i>, the freezing of new applications for CPC or additional bottoms in the subject route.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br><br></center><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Whether petitioners committed forum shopping when they filed the moratorium petition; and</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">Whether the decision of the MARINA Board in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function should be appealed first to the DOTC Secretary, and subsequently to the OP, before appeal to the CA.<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>We deny the petition.<br><br><i>I. No forum shopping.</i><br><br>There is, no forum shopping. There is forum shopping "when a party repetitively avails of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The test to determine'the existence of forum shopping is whether the elements of <i>litis pendentia</i> are present, or whether a final judgment in one case amounts to <i>res judicata</i> in the other. Thus, there is forum shopping when the following elements are present, namely: (a) identity of parties, or at least such parties representing the same interests in both actions; (b) identity of rights asserted and reliefs prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and (c) the identity of the two preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amounts to <i>res judicata</i> in the action under consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The moratorium petition prays for a relief different from that sought in the main case, from which the present petition arose. In the moratorium petition, the petitioners did not pray for the cancellation, or revocation of the CPC issued to the respondent. What petitioners prayed for was a "moratorium or stoppage in the grant of Certificates of Public Convenience for carriage of passengers and cargoes involving the routes MATNOG, SORSOGON - ALLEN, NORTHERN SAMAR or MATNOG, SORSOGON - DAPDAP, ALLEN, NORTHERN; SAMAR, or MATNOG, SORSOGON - SAN ISIDRO, NORTHERN SAMAR AND VICE VERSA."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Thus, any decision of the MARINA on the moratorium petition will not affect the CPC already issued in favor of the respondent and appealed before the CA, the subject matter of the present case.<br><br><i>II. The CA properly dismissed the appeal.</i><br><br>Petitioners justify their direct resort to the CA by invoking the IRR of R.A. No. 9295,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which provides for a procedure for appeal of decisions involving CPCs,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> to wit:<br><blockquote><center>RULE XV <br>APPEALS<br></center><br>Sec. 1. <i>Appeal on Decisions Involving the CPC</i> — Any order, ruling, decision or resolution of the CO/MRO Director/OIC relating to the application for issuance of Entity/Company CPC shall become final and executory fifteen (15) days unless a Motion for Reconsideration is filed within the same period with the CO/MRO Director/OIC concerned after the receipt of a copy thereof by the party affected. The decision of the CO/MRO Director/OIC shall be final and executory unless within the same period an appeal to the MARINA Administrator has been perfected.<br><br>The <u>order, ruling decision or resolution of the MARINA Administrator</u> shall be final .and executory within fifteen (15) days unless <u>an administrative appeal is filed with the MARINA Board or petition for judicial review is filed with the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court in accordance with the provisions of the Revised Rules of Court</u>. (Underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>Petitioners claim that this provision of the IRR shows that "the appropriate remedy against the adverse ruling of;the MARINA Board is a petition for review to the Honorable Court of Appeals under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> However, as correctly pointed out by the respondent, paragraph 2, Section 1, Rule XV of the IRR applies only to an appeal of the order, ruling, decision or resolution of the MARINA Administrator. There is no procedure for appeal of the decisions of the MARINA Board. Hence, the IRR cannot be the basis for petitioners' appeal. Moreover, no procedure for appeal before the courts is provided by R.A. No. 9295. Rules and regulations issued to implement a law cannot go beyond its terms and provisions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Rule 43 governs all appeals from awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any quasi-judicial1 agency in the exercise of quasi-judicial functions. Resort to the CA is authorized by Section 9 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> which provides that the CA shall have jurisdiction over the decisions or final orders of quasi-judicial agencies. The MARINA is a quasi-judicial agency, and though it is not among the enumerated agencies in Rule 43, the list is not meant to be exclusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>However, while Rule 43 provides for the appeal procedure from quasi-judicial agencies to the CA, the aggrieved party must still exhaust administrative remedies prior to recourse to the CA. Thus, Executive Order No. 292 otherwise known as the Administrative Code of 1987 provides for the framework of administrative appeal prior to judicial review:<br><blockquote><center>BOOK VII - ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE<br><br>CHAPTER 4 - ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL IN CONTESTED CASES<br></center><br>Sec. 19. <i>Appeal</i>.—Unless otherwise provided by law or executive order, an appeal from a final decision of the agency may be taken to the Department head.<br><br>Sec. 20. <i>Perfection of Administrative Appeals</i>.—<br><br> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">Administrative appeals under this Chapter shall be perfected within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a copy of the decision complained of by the party adversely affected, by filing with the agency which adjudicated the case a notice of appeal, serving copies thereof upon trie prevailing party and the appellate agency, and paying the required fees.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td><div align="justify"> If a motion for reconsideration is denied, the movant shall have the right to perfect his appeal during the remainder of the period for appeal, reckoned from receipt of the resolution of denial.

The doctrine allows, indeed requires, an administrative decision to first be appealed to the administrative superiors up to the highest level before it may be elevated to a court of justice for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The underlying principle of the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies rests on the presumption that the administrative agency, if afforded a complete chance to pass upon the matter, will decide the same correctly. There are both legal and practical reasons for the principle. The administrative process is intended to provide less expensive and more speedy solutions to disputes. Where the enabling statute indicates a procedure for administrative review and provides a system of administrative appeal or reconsideration, the courts—for reasons of law, comity, and convenience—will not entertain a case unless the available administrative remedies have been resorted to and the appropriate authorities have been given an opportunity to act and correct the errors committed in the administrative forum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>While the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is flexible and may be disregarded in certain instances,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> we find, however, that the case does not fall under any of the recognized exceptional circumstances. Petitioners claim that appeal to the DOTC Secretary, who is already the chairman of the MARINA Board, is a needless superfluity, the latter being the alter ego of the President. Moreover, petitioners state that filing an appeal with the Office of the President would be impractical because a member of the MARINA Board also came from the Office of the President. Both arguments fail to convince.<br><br>A quick look into the nature and functions of the MARINA is necessary to understand its nature, powers, and relationship to the executive department, and in turn determine the applicability of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.<br><br>The MARINA was created under Presidential Decree No. 474<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> as an agency under the Office of the President.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Under Executive Order No. 546,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> the MARINA was designated as an attached agency of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Under Executive Order No. 1011,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> the MARINA was granted the quasi-judicial functions formerly exercised by the Board of Transportation pertaining to water transportation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The Administrative Code of 1987 reiterated that the MARINA is an attached agency of the DOTC:<br><blockquote><center>BOOK IV - THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH<br>TITLE XV - TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS<br>CHAPTER 6 - ATTACHED AGENCIES<br></center><br>Sec. 23. Attached Agencies and Corporations.—The following agencies and corporations are attached to the Department: The Philippine National Railways, the Maritime Industry Authority, the Philippine National Lines, the Philippine Aerospace Development Corporation, the Metro Manila Transit Corporation, the Office of Transport Cooperatives, the Philippine Ports Authority, the Philippine Merchant Marine Academy, the Toll Regulatory Board, the Light Rail Transit Authority, the Transport Training Center, the Civil Aeronautics Board, the National Telecommunications Commission and the Manila International Airport Authority.<br></blockquote>R.A. No. 9295, which was enacted on May 3, 2004, provides the jurisdiction, power and duties of the MARINA including the power to:<br><blockquote>Section 10. <i>Jurisdiction; Powers; and Duties of MARINA</i>.—<br><br><center>x x x <br></center>&nbsp;<br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(2)</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> Issue certificates of public convenience or any extensions or amendments thereto, authorizing the operation of all kinds, classes and types of vessels in domestic shipping: Provided, That no such certificate shall be valid for a period of more than twenty-five (25) years;<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br><center>x x x<br></center></blockquote>The status of the MARINA as an attached agency of the DOTC is crucial to the determination of whether the DOTC has the power to review the decisions of the MARINA Board. Under Section 38, Chapter VII, Book IV of the Administrative Code of 1987,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> there are three kinds of administrative relationship: (1) supervision and control; (2) administrative supervision; and (3) attachment.<br><br>Among the three, the relationship of supervision and control between a department and a subordinate agency is the most stringent since the department has the power to review the decisions of the subordinate agency. This power is not available in administrative supervision as Section 38 expressly states that the department shall have no power to review the decisions of regulatory agencies in the exercise of their regulatory or quasi-judicial functions. As to the relationship of attachment, while the law is silent on the presence or absence of such power to review by the department, Section 38(3) would indicate that the Legislature did not intend that the decisions of an attached agency be subject to review by the department prior to appealing before the proper court. Section 38(3) indicates the most lenient kind of administrative relationship since the <i>lateral</i> relationship is limited to policy and program coordination. Thus, in <i>Beja v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> we distinguished an attached agency from one which is under departmental supervision and control or administrative supervision:<br><blockquote>An attached agency has a larger measure of independence from the Department to which it is attached than one which is under departmental supervision and control or administrative supervision. This is borne out by the "lateral relationship" between the Department and the attached agency. The attachment is merely for "policy and program coordination." With respect to administrative matters, the independence of an attached agency from Departmental control and supervision is further reinforced by the fact that even an agency under a Department's administrative supervision is free from Departmental interference with respect to appointments and other personnel actions "in accordance with the decentralization of personnel functions" under the Administrative Code of 1987. <b>Moreover, the Administrative Code explicitly provides that Chapter 8 of Book IV on supervision and control shall not apply to chartered institutions attached to a Department.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> (Emphasis supplied; citations omitted.)<br></blockquote>Section 39, Chapter VIII, Book IV of the Administrative Code of 1987 expressly states that the chapter on supervision and control shall not apply to chartered institutions or government-owned or controlled corporations attached to the department. Section 39 provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 39. <i>Secretary's Authority</i>.—<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(1) </div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify">The Secretary shall have supervision and control over the bureaus, offices, and agencies under him, subject to the following guidelines:</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td style="text-align: center;">x x x</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(2) </div></td><td><div align="justify">This Chapter shall not apply to chartered institutions or government-owned or controlled corporations attached to the department.</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Reading Section 39 together with Section 38, the decision of an attached agency such as the MARINA in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function <i>is not subject to review by the department</i>. Section 39 makes it clear that the supervision and control exercised by the department over agencies under it with respect to matters including the exercise of discretion (performance of quasi-judicial function) do not apply to attached agencies. Thus, in this respect, petitioners are correct in saying that the decisions of the MARINA are <i>not subject to the review of the DOTC Secretary</i>.<br><br>This is not to say, however, that decisions of the MARINA are not proper subjects of appeal to the OP.<br><br>In <i>Phillips Seafood (Philippines) Corporation v. Board of Investments</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> we recognized that under Administrative Order No. 18,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> a decision or order issued by a department or agency need not be appealed to the OP when there is a special law that provides for a different mode of appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> R.A. No. 9295 does not provide for an appeal procedure; thus, the assailed decision and resolution from the MARINA should have been appealed with the OP.<br><br>More importantly, contrary to the petitioners' claim, the doctrine of qualified political agency does not apply in this case.<br><br>Under the doctrine of qualified political agency, heads of the various executive departments are the alter egos of the President, and, thus, the actions taken by such heads in the performance of their official duties are deemed the acts of the President unless the President himself should disapprove such acts. This is a recognition of the fact that in our presidential form of government, all executive organizations, are adjuncts of a single Chief Executive; that the heads of the Executive Departments are assistants and agents of the Chief Executive; and that the multiple executive functions of the President as the Chief Executive are performed through the Executive Departments. The doctrine has been adopted here out of practical necessity, considering that the President cannot be expected to personally perform the multifarious functions of the executive office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>But the doctrine of qualified political agency does not apply to the actions of heads of executive departments in the performance of their duties as <i><i>ex officio</i></i> members of the various agencies or entities under the executive department.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br><i>Ex officio</i>, is defined in <i>Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> as:<br><blockquote>x x x The term <i>ex-officio</i> means "from office; by virtue of office." It refers to an "authority derived from official character merely, not expressly conferred upon the individual character, but rather annexed to the official position." <i>Ex-officio</i> likewise denotes an "act done in an official character, or as a consequence of office, and without any other appointment or authority than that conferred by the office." An <i>ex-officio</i> member of a board is one who is a member by virtue of his title to a certain office, and without further wan-ant or appointment. x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Manalang-Demigillo v. Trade and Investment Development Corporation of the Philippines</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> (TIDCORP), we: held that the doctrine of qualified political agency cannot be extended to the acts of the Board of Directors of the TIDCORP, though some of its members are cabinet members. We clarified that even if the Secretary of Finance, the Secretary of Trade and Industry, the Governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Director-General of the National Economic and Development Authority, and the Chairman of the Philippine Overseas Construction Board are members of the cabinet, they sat on the TIDCORP Board by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 1080, as amended by R.A. No. 8494 and by reason of their office or function, or in their <i><i>ex officio</i> capacity</i>, and not because of their direct appointment to the Board by the President. Thus, they were acting as members of the Board, and not as alter egos of the President. We said:<br><blockquote>But the doctrine of qualified political agency could not be extended to the acts of the Board of Directors of TIDCORP despite some of its members being themselves the appointees of the President to the Cabinet. Under Section 10 of Presidential Decree No. 1080, as further amended by Section 6 of Republic Act No. 8494, the five <i>ex officio</i> members were the Secretary of Finance, the Secretary of Trade and Industry, the Governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Director-General of the National Economic and Development Authority, and the Chairman of the Philippine Overseas Construction Board, while the four other members of the Board were the three from the private sector (at least one of whom should come from the export community), who were elected by the <i>ex officio</i> members of the Board for a term of not more than two consecutive years, and the President of TIDCORP who was concurrently the Vice-Chairman of the Board. Such Cabinet members sat on the Board of Directors of TIDCORP <i>ex officio</i>, or by reason of their office or function, not because of their direct appointment to the Board by the President. Evidently, it was the law, not the President, that sat them in the Board.<br><br>Under the circumstances, when the members of the Board of Directors effected the assailed 2002 reorganization, they were acting as the responsible members of the Board of Directors of TIDCORP constituted pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 1080, as amended by Republic Act No. 8494, not as the <i>alter egos</i> of the President. We cannot stretch the application of a doctrine that already delegates an enormous amount of power. Also, it is settled that the delegation of power is not to be lightly inferred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br></blockquote>In this case, the DOTC Secretary and the Executive Secretary are <i>ex officio</i> members of the MARINA Board by yirtue of Section 7 of Presidential Decree No. 474, as amended, which provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 7. <i>Composition and Organization</i>.—The Board shall be composed of eight members as follows: The Secretary of Trade, the Secretary of Public Works, <b><i>Transportation and Communications</i></b>, the Secretary of National Defense, <b><i>the Executive Secretary</i></b>, the Chairman of the Board of Investments, the Chairman of the Development Bank of the Philippines, the Chairman of the Board of Transportation and the Maritime Administrator. The Chairman of the Board shall be appointed by the President of the Philippines from among its members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> x x x (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Following our ruling in <i>Manalang-Demegillo</i>, the actions of the DOTC Secretary and the Executive Secretary, as <i>ex officio</i> members of the MARINA Board: were made not in their capacity as alter egos of the President. As such, an appeal to the OP is still warranted. If petitioners are still dissatisfied with the decision of the OP, then it would be the proper time to file a petition for review under Rule 43 with the CA.<br><br>To summarize, the DOTC Secretary does not have supervision and control over the MARINA, which is an attached agency to the DOTC. Consequently, it cannot review the decisions of the MARINA Board. However, decisions of the MARINA Board are proper subjects of appeal to the OP, having been made by its members in their <i>ex officio</i> capacity, and not as his alter egos. Failing to avail of such appeal, petitioners' petition for review with the CA was properly dismissed.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
