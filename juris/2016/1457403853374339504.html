				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Challenged and sought to be set aside in this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> dated December 9, 2010 of petitioner Juana Vda. de Rojales, substituted by her heirs Celerina Rojales, Reynaldo Rojales, Pogs Rojales, Olive Rojales and Josefina Rojales is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated August 16, 2010 of the Court of Appeals (<i>CA</i>), as reiterated in its Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated November 15, 2010 in CA-G.R. CV No. 92228, reversing and setting aside the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated May 7, 2008 of the Regional Trial Court (<i>RTC</i>) of Nasugbu, Batangas, Branch 14, which dismissed the petition for the consolidation of ownership and title over Lot 4-A covered by Transfer Certificate of Title (<i>TCT</i>) No. T-55726 in the name of the respondent Marcelino Dime.<br><br>The antecedents are as follows:<br><br>Petitioner Juana Vda. de Rojales owned a parcel of land (Lot 4-A) located at Barrio Remanente, Municipality of Nasugbu, Batangas consisting of 2,064 square meters covered by TCT No. T-55726.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In a petition dated May 30, 2000 filed before the RTC of Nasugbu, Batangas, Branch 14, respondent Marcelino Dime alleged that on May 16, 1999, petitioner conveyed under a <i><i>pacto de retro</i></i> contract Lot 4-A in favor of respondent for and in consideration of the sum of P2,502,932.10.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Petitioner reserved the right to repurchase the property for the same price within a period of nine (9) months from March 24, 1999 to December 24, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Despite repeated verbal and formal demands to exercise her right, petitioner refused to exercise her right to repurchase the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In her answer, petitioner denied the execution of the <i>pacto de retro</i> sale in favor of respondent and alleged that she had not sold the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> She claimed that the document presented by respondent was falsified since the fingerprint appearing therein was not hers and the signature of the Notary Public Modesto S. Alix was not his.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> She also averred that she filed falsification and use of falsified documents charges against respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In her sworn statement attached to her Answer, petitioner alleged that she mortgaged the subject property with the Batangas Savings and Loan Bank for P100,000.00 when her daughter Violeta Rojales Rufo needed the money for application of overseas work; Antonio Barcelon redeemed the property and paid P260,000.00 for the debt plus the unpaid interest with the bank; when Barcelon entered the mayoralty race, he demanded payment of the debt, then mortgaged the title of the subject property with respondent; and the signatures appearing in the documents were falsified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>During the pre-trial, the parties agreed that petitioner is the registered owner of the subject property, and that she once mortgaged the property with the Batangas Savings &amp; Loan Bank in order to secure a loan of P200,000.00 from the bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> They also submitted the following issues for resolution: whether the <i>pacto de retro</i> sale was executed by petitioner; whether the consideration of the sale has been paid to petitioner; and whether the contract of sale con <i>pacto de retro</i> is genuine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Upon the joint motion of the parties, the RTC issued an Order dated November 16, 2000 directing the questioned thumbmark be referred to the fingerprint expert of the National Bureau of Investigation (<i>NBI</i>) to determine whether the thumbmark appearing in the <i>pacto de retro</i> contract and the specimen thumbmark of the petitioner are the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On April 16, 2001, the NBI submitted a copy of Dactyloscopic Report FP Case No. 2000-349 by Fingerprint Examiner Eriberto B. Gomez, Jr. to the court. It was concluded therein that the questioned thumbmark appearing on the original-duplicate copy of the notarized <i>pacto de retro</i> sale and the standard right thumbmark, taken by Police Officer Marcelo Quintin Sosing, were impressed by and belong to the same person, the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Respondent passed away on June 22, 2002 before the trial on the merits of the case ensued. Being his compulsory heirs, respondent's estranged wife Bonifacia Dime and their children Cesario Antonio Dime and Marcelino Dime, Jr., substituted him in the suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On July 11, 2006, the heirs of respondent filed a Manifestation and Motion to Dismiss the Complaint on the ground that it was Rufina Villamin, respondent's common law wife, who was the source of the fund in purchasing Lot 4-A.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> They alleged that the consolidation of ownership and title to respondent would be prejudicial to Villamin and would unjustly enrich them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Consequently, the RTC, through Judge Christino E. Judit, in an Order dated July 12, 2006, dismissed the case with prejudice on the ground that the case was not filed by an indispensable party, Villamin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>However, on August 2, 2006, Atty. Pedro N. Belmi, the counsel of respondent, filed a Motion for Reconsideration praying to set aside the dismissal with prejudice on the ground that Villamin and the daughters of petitioner, Manilyn Rojales Sevilla and Olivia Rojales, tricked and manipulated the respondent's widow and her children to affix their signatures on the motion to dismiss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Atty. Belmi insisted that the RTC erred in giving credence to the motion without his verification that the motion was indeed freely and voluntarily executed by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Feeling that the respondent's counsel already lost his trust and confidence to his impartiality and lack of bias to resolve the case, Judge Judit inhibited himself from the case on January 25, 2007 without waiting for the petitioner to file a motion for inhibition against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> This Court designated Judge Wilfredo De Joya Mayor to replace Judge Judit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In an Order dated October 25, 2007, Judge Mayor set aside the order of dismissal of the case and set the hearing for further reception of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Thereafter, the RTC ruled in favor of the petitioner. The court <i>a quo</i> ratiocinated that it is a clear mistake to rule on the merits of the case knowing that such was not filed by the indispensable party, hence, the judgment will be void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The RTC considered the unverified motion for reconsideration filed by Atty. Belmi as an unsigned pleading.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> It further held that the manifestation and motion to dismiss deserved the presumption of validity since there was no sufficient proof that the compulsory heirs who substituted respondent were made to sign such motion without knowing its content.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The <i>fallo</i> of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the above-captioned case is hereby DISMISSED for utterly lack of merit.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>Aggrieved, respondent assailed the decision before the CA. In a Decision dated August 16, 2010, the CA reversed and set aside the decision of the RTC. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant appeal is GRANTED and the herein assailed Decision of the trial court dated May 7, 2008 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the consolidation of ownership over the property (Lot 4-A) covered by TCT No. T-55726 in the name of the vendee a retro Marcelino Dime.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>The CA rejected the ruling of the court <i>a quo</i> that Villamin was an indispensable party. It ruled that the person who provided the funds for the purchase of the property is not considered as an indispensable party in a case of consolidation of title filed by respondent, the vendee, in whose favor the petitioner sold the subject property under the contract of sale con <i>pacto de retro</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Upon the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration by the CA, petitioner filed the instant petition raising the following issues:<br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN GIVING DUE COURSE TO THIS APPEAL DESPITE THE MANIFESTATION OF THE HEIRS OF MARCELINO DIME TO DISMISS THE CASE.<br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT DISREGARDED THE NECESSITY OF VERIFICATION OF THE RESPONDENTS IN THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION FILED BEFORE THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT.<br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN ALLOWING THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE TITLE DESPITE THE MANIFESTATION AND ADMISSION OF THE RESPONDENTS THAT CONTINUING SO WOULD CONSTITUTE UNJUST ENRICHMENT.<br><br></li><li>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED WHEN IT RULED THAT THE PETITIONERS FAILED TO OVERCOME THE PRESUMPTION OF REGULARITY OF THE SUBJECT PACTO DE RETRO SALE.<br></li></ol></blockquote>This Court finds the instant petition devoid of merit.<br><br>Bisecting the first and third issues, this Court notes that the petitioner basically argues that the CA erred in ordering the consolidation of ownership and title in the name of respondent Dime since his heirs have filed a motion to dismiss which admitted therein that a ruling of the trial court in respondent's favor is tantamount to unjust enrichment considering that Villamin provided the funds for the purchase of the subject property.<br><br>Relying on the principle that the client has the exclusive control of the cause of action on the claim or demand sued upon, petitioner insists that the filing of the manifestation reflected the intention of the heirs of respondent to enter into a settlement with the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Settled is the rule that a client has an undoubted right to settle her litigation without the intervention of the attorney, for the former is generally conceded to have exclusive control over the subject matter of the litigation and may at anytime, if acting in good faith, settle and adjust the cause of action out of court before judgment, even without the attorney's intervention.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>While we agree with the petitioner that the heirs, as the client, has the exclusive control over the subject matter of litigation and may settle the case without the attorney's intervention, we deny the rationale of the filing of the motion to dismiss by the heirs. It was alleged that they would be unjustly enriched should the court order the consolidation of the title of Lot 4-A in the name of respondent since the source of the consideration was Villamin, respondent's common-law wife.<br><br>As relevant to the case at bar, Articles 1311 and 1607 of the Civil Code provide:<br><blockquote>Article 1311. <b>Contracts take effect only between the parties, their assigns and heirs,</b> except in case where the rights and obligations arising from the contract are not transmissible by their nature, or by stipulation or by provision of law. The heir is not liable beyond the value of the property he received from the decedent.<br><br>If a contract should contain some stipulation in favor of a third person, he may demand its fulfillment provided he communicated his acceptance to the obligor before its revocation. <b>A mere incidental benefit or interest of a person is not sufficient. The contracting parties must have clearly and deliberately conferred a favor upon a third person.</b> (emphasis supplied).<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Article 1607. In case of real property, the consolidation of ownership in the vendee by virtue of the failure of the vendor to comply with the provisions of article 1616 shall not be recorded in the Registry of Property without a judicial order, after the vendor has been duly heard.<br></blockquote>We have consistently held that the parties to a contract are the real parties-in-interest in an action upon it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The basic principle of relativity of contracts is that contracts can only bind the parties who entered into it, and cannot favor or prejudice a third person, even if he is aware of such contract and has acted with knowledge thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Hence, one who is not a party to a contract, and for whose benefit it was not expressly made, cannot maintain an action on it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> One cannot do so, even if the contract performed by the contracting parties would incidentally inure to one's benefit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>As evidenced by the contract of <i>Pacto de Retro</i> sale,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> petitioner, the vendor, bound herself to sell the subject property to respondent, the vendee, and reserved the right to repurchase the same property for the same amount within a period of nine (9) months from March 24, 1999 to December 24, 1999.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Therefore, in an action for the consolidation of title and ownership in the name of vendee in accordance with Article 1616<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> of the Civil Code, the indispensable parties are the parties to the <i>Pacto de Retro</i> Sale - the vendor, the vendee, and their assigns and heirs.<br><br>Villamin, as the alleged source of the consideration, is not privy to the contract of sale between the petitioner and the respondent. Therefore, she could not maintain an action for consolidation of ownership and title of the subject property in her name since she was not a party to the said contract.<br><br>Where there is no privity of contract, there is likewise no obligation or liability to speak about.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> This Court, in defining the word "privy" in the case of <i>Republic vs. Grijaldo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> said that the word privy denotes the idea of succession, thus, he who by succession is placed in the position of one of those who contracted the judicial relation and executed the private document and appears to be substituting him in the personal rights and obligation is a privy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>For not being an heir or an assignee of the respondent, Villamin did not substitute respondent in the personal rights and obligation in the <i>pacto de retro</i> sale by succession. Since she is not privy to the contract, she cannot be considered as indispensable party in the action for consolidation of title and ownership in favor of respondent. A cursory reading of the contract reveals that the parties did not clearly and deliberately confer a favor upon Villamin, a third person.<br><br>Petitioner alleges that the consolidation of the title should not be allowed since the heirs admitted that they would be unjustly enriched, Villamin being the source of the fund used for the purchase of the subject property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Unjust enrichment exists when a person unjustly retains a benefit at the loss of another, or when a person retains money or property of another against the fundamental principles of justice, equity and good conscience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> The prevention of unjust enrichment is a recognized public policy of the State, as embodied in Article 22 of the Civil Code which provides that "[e]very person who through an act of performance by another, or any other means, acquires or comes into possession of something at the expense of the latter without just or legal ground, shall return the same to him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>This Court notes that the RTC relied on the bare assertions of the heirs in dismissing the case with prejudice. The records are bereft of evidence to support the allegation that Villamin has indeed provided the consideration. Not being a privy to the <i>pacto de retro</i> sale, Villamin cannot be considered to have been prejudiced with the consolidation of title in respondent's name. Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that she was indeed the source of the consideration, she has a separate cause of action against respondent. The legal obligation of respondent to her is separate and distinct from the contract of sale cow <i>pacto de retro</i>, thus, the award of consolidation of title in her name would be untenable.<br><br>Anent the issue on verification, Section 4, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court provides as follows:<br><blockquote>Sec. 4. Verification. - Except when otherwise specifically required by law or rule, pleadings need not be under oath, verified or accompanied by affidavit.<br><br>A pleading is verified by an affidavit that the affiant has read the pleading and that the allegations therein are true and correct of his personal knowledge or based on authentic records.<br></blockquote>We do not agree with petitioner's assertion that the motion for reconsideration should not have been allowed since the respondent failed to pose a reasonable explanation on the absence of verification.<br><br>Time and again, we have said that non-compliance with verification or a defect therein does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Verification, like in most cases required by the rules of procedure, is a formal requirement, not jurisdictional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It is mainly intended to secure an assurance that matters which are alleged are done in good faith or are true and correct and not of mere speculation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Thus, when circumstances so warrant, "the court may simply order the correction of unverified pleadings or act on it and waive strict compliance with the rules in order that the ends of justice may thereby be served."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The RTC waived the strict compliance for verification when it acted on the motion for reconsideration in the interest of justice and equity and allowed the further reception of evidence. Therefore, it is erroneous to dismiss the case based on the non-compliance of verification. As discussed earlier, Villamin is not privy to the <i>pacto de retro</i> sale between the petitioner and the respondent. Hence, the case should not have been dismissed because Villamin is not an indispensable party in an action for consolidation of ownership and title emanating from the contract of<i> pacto de retro</i> sale.<br><br>Petitioner's allegation that respondent should have executed affidavits in denying what was written in the manifestation and motion to dismiss based on Rule 8, Section 8<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> of the Rules of Court is unfounded. Such rule is applicable in contesting an action or defense based on a written instrument or document copied or attached to the pleading. In the case at bar, it is the motion to dismiss that is being contested and not a written instrument or document which an action or defense is based on.<br><br>Petitioner avers that the CA erred in relying on the NBI Fingerprint Examination. She alleges that the opinion of one claiming to be an expert is not binding upon the court.<br><br>There is nothing on record that would compel this Court to believe that said witness, Fingerprint Examiner Gomez, has improper motive to falsely testify against the petitioner nor was his testimony not very certain. His testimony is worthy of full faith and credit in the absence of evidence of an improper motive. His straightforward and consistent testimonies bear the earmarks of credibility.<br><br>Gomez testified during direct and cross examination, the process of examination of the fingerprints and his
