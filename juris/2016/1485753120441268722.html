MR. JAIME DICHAVES is a second cousin whom I know quite well. I know for a fact that he is closely associated with former president JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA having helped immensely in the election campaign of the latter in 1992 and 1998.<br><br>4. In June 1999, MR. JAIME DICHAVES was voted in as member of the Board of Directors of BELLE CORPORATION, hence, we became Board Members at the same time.<br><br>5. On the occasion of one of the board meetings of the corporation in September 1999 held at its principal office located at the 26<sup>th</sup> Floor East Tower, Philippine Stock Exchange Centre, Exchange Road, Ortigas Center, Pasig City, <i>MR. DICHAVES came up to me in private and discussed the matter of the 750 million shares of stock of BELLE Corporation. </i> Twenty- five percent (25%) of the subscriptions to these shares of stock has already been paid, leaving an unpaid balance of 75%. The average price was P2.344 per share for a gross value of P1,758,000,000.00 [P1.758. billion]. Out of these figures the unpaid balance stood at P1,318,500,000.00.<br><br><center>...</center><br>8. At this point, it appeared that the only remaining possible investor is the government through the government financial institutions (GFIs). <i>MR. JAIME DICHAVES [later] confirmed to me that he had brought the matter up with the President Estrada who in turn assured him that the latter would "take care of the matter".</i><br><br>9. True enough, in one of our weekends at the Tagaytay Highlands, MR. DICHAVES and I discussed the planned investments of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and the Social Security System (SSS) in Belle Corporation. I asked DICHAVES for any news or development on his talks with JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA who was the President of the country at that time. After these inquiries, I was given the firm assurance that "Ding" (referring to GSIS President and General Manager FEDERICO C. PASCUAL) and "Chuckie" (referring to SSS President and Chairman CARLOS ARELLANO) were already given the instructions by the President to purchase Belle shares.<br><br>10. Thereafter, I would make follow-up calls to DICHAVES regarding the plan of the Social Security System (SSS) and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), particularly during the early part of October 1999. During one of our telephone conversations <i>it was explicitly stated by JAIME DICHAVES that GSIS and SSS would push thru with the transactions only if I agree to give him the profit commission to be derived from the sale of Belle shares to GSIS and </i> SSS <i>as instructed to him by President JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA. </i>Fearing that the transactions would not proceed if I did not agree to the proposition of DICHAVES, I was constrained to agree to the arrangement.<br><br>11. On October 21, 1999, out of the 750,000,000 BEL [Belle Corporation] shares of stock we intended to sell, about 447,650,000 million were sold by way of cross-transaction on the market. As aforesaid, these shares of stock were then being held by SSI Management Corporation.<br><br><div align="center">...<br></div><br>12. On November 3, 1999, at or around 10:30 o'clock in the evening, <i>I went to the residence of MR. JAIME DICHAVES </i>at No. 19 Madrigal Avenue, Corinthian Gardens, Quezon City, <i>to hand him a company check in the amount of ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PESOS (P189,700,000.00)</i> issued by Eastern Securities Development Corporation.<br><br>13. This amount, under I-Bank Check No. 6000159271, after deducting costs of purchase, capital gains tax, broker fees, sales tax and other fees, represented the profit commission generated from the sale of about 447,650,000 BEL [Belle Corporation] shares which were previously covered by the unpaid subscription of SSI Management Corporation for 650,000,000 shares, of which 25% (TWENTY FIVE PERCENT) was already paid for.<br><br>14. As agreed upon, <i>I personally handed the check </i>representing the amount of the profit commission derived out of the sale of the shares of BELLE to GSIS and SSS <i>to MR. JAIME DICHAVES </i>in the living room of his residence. This was done pursuant to our earlier agreement that all profit commissions to be derived out of the sale shall be handed to MR. DICHAVES for subsequent remittance in accordance with the instructions given him by President JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA. Thereafter, he said "Thank you".

When asked what his answer was to the answer of Dichaves that that was the condition, Ocier answered that he was constrained to agree because Dichaves told him that "that was the only way for the transaction to push through."
