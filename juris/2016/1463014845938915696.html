CV No. 84649. The Court of Appeals reversed and set aside the 5 January 2005 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati City, Branch 150, in Civil Case No. 00-946.<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></center><br>Civil Case No. 00-946 stems from a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> for annulment of real estate mortgage, foreclosure of mortgage, and auction sale; accounting and damages, with prayer for temporary restraining order and/or injunction filed by Felino M. Timbol, Jr. and his wife Emmanuela R. Laguardia (Spouses Timbol) against the Philippine National Bank (PNB), Atty. Ricardo M. Espina, in his capacity as notary public of Makati, and the Register of Deeds of Makati.<br><br>The facts of the case are as follows:<br><blockquote>Sometime in December 1996, Karrich Holdings Ltd. ["KHL"], based in Hong Kong and owned by Felino M. Timbol, Jr. ["Timbol"] applied with Philippine National Bank ["PNB"]'s wholly-owned Hong Kong-based subsidiary, PNB International Finance Limited ["PNB-IFL"] for credit facilities. Karrich Auto Exchange ["KAE"], then named Superkinis Auto Sales, a sole proprietorship based in the Philippines and also owned by Timbol, acted as co-borrower. The credit facilities were granted in the total amount of USD 850,000.00, or PhP 22,796,200.00.<br><br>As security, Timbol executed real estate mortgages on his behalf and on behalf of Emmanuela Laguardia ["Laguardia"], over nine (9) different parcels of real estate registered in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Felino M. Timbol, Jr. Timbol was supposedly made to sign the real estate mortgage forms and Promissory Note forms in blank, among other documents, and thereafter returned the same to PNB. Timbol was allegedly never furnished with copies of the finished forms, a statement PNB would later categorically deny.<br><br>The first Real Estate Mortgage was in consideration of credit accommodations in the amount of Thirteen Million Fifty Three Thousand Six Hundred Pesos (Php 13,053,600.00, Philippine currency) and further read pertinently as follows:<br><blockquote>WITNESSETH: That for and in consideration of credit accommodations obtained from the Mortgagee and to secure the payment of the same x x x the Mortgagors hereby transfer and convey by way of mortgage unto the Mortgagee its successors or assigns, the following:<br><br>Seven (7) real estate properties covered by TCT Nos. 196111, 196112, 196113, 196114, 196115, 196116 and 196117 with their technical descriptions detailed in the attached Annex A.<br><br><center>x x x<br></center></blockquote>The consideration for the second Real Estate Mortgage amounted to Seven Million Five Hundred Ninety-Eight Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty Pesos and 0/100 (PhP 7,598,850.00, Philippine currency). The mortgage was constituted over a 293-sq.m. parcel of land covered by TCT No. 177564. The third Real Estate Mortgage secured an obligation amounting to Two Million One Hundred Forty-Three Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty Pesos and 0/100 (Php 2,143,750.00, Philippine currency) and covered an 87.5 sq.m. parcel of land under TCT No. 207636.<br><br>The real estate mortgages were annotated on the aforementioned transfer certificates of title. On later perusal of the transfer certificates of title, however, Timbol supposedly discovered that the amounts annotated as mortgaged added up to One Hundred One Million One Hundred Seventeen Thousand Eight Hundred Pesos and 0/100 (PhP 101,117,800.00). Over time, Timbol signed several Promissory Notes, attesting to availments under the credit line amounting to Eight Hundred Forty-Nine Thousand Five Hundred Ninety-Five US Dollars and 7/100 (USD 849,595.07). On April 1, 1998, the credit facilities were reduced to Eight Hundred Forty-Eight Thousand Three Hundred US Dollars and 0/100 (USD 848,300.00), pursuant to the letter sent by PNB-IFL to KAE/ KHL.<br><br>When Timbol, KAE, and KHL defaulted on the payment 6f their loan obligation, PNB, on behalf of PNB-IFL, sent a demand letter dated September 2, 1999, advising them that their total outstanding obligation stood at Thirty-Eight Million, Eighty-Eight Thousand One Hundred Seventy-Three Pesos and 59/100 (PhP 38,088,173.59), inclusive of penalties and interests. In a response apparently dated October 19, 1999, Timbol, signing in representation of KHL, manifested that he was "well aware" of the "P33 Million" outstanding obligation and that he was awaiting the outcome of a pending application for another loan. Timbol thus requested for additional time to settle the obligation with PNB-IFL and for the conversion of the same to Philippine currency.<br><br>On November 15, 1999, PNB caused the foreclosure of the mortgaged properties, claiming that Timbol/KAE/KHL had violated the terms of the real estate mortgage by defaulting on the payment of the loan obligation despite demands. As of the date of the foreclosure, the outstanding obligation already amounted to One Million Twenty-One Thousand Seven Hundred Forty-Three US Dollars and 40/100 (USD 1,021,743.40) or Forty-Two Million Three Hundred Twenty Thousand Six Hundred Eleven Pesos and 62/100 (PhP 42,320,611.62). Atty. Ricardo M. Espina ["Espina"] notarized the Notice of Extra-Judicial Sale.<br><br>PNB was allegedly the highest bidder at the public auction sale with a bid price of Thirty-Five Million Six Hundred Sixty-Nine Thousand Pesos and 0/100 (PhP 35,669,000.00). Espina issued the corresponding Certificate of Sale dated December 10, 1999.<br><br>On August 4, 2000, Timbol and Laguardia filed suit against PNB, Espina, and the Register of Deeds of Makati City for annulment of the real estate mortgage, of the foreclosure and auction sale, for accounting and damages, and for a temporary restraining order and/or injunction. They accused PNB of deliberately "bloating" the amount of the obligation. They furthermore assailed the foreclosure proceedings as highly irregular, invalid, and illegal, because the petition for the extra-judicial foreclosure had not been filed in accordance with Supreme Court Administrative Order No. 3; the Notice of Notary Public's Sale did not specify the newspaper in which the Notice of Sale would be published, and was neither raffled for this purpose nor properly posted; and the Notary did not conduct an actual public bidding. They moreover faulted Defendant Espina for refusing to furnish Timbol with copies of documents relative to the supposed auction sale. Meanwhile, the Makati City Register of Deeds gave plaintiff Timbol a Certification that no December 11, 1996 Deed of Mortgage in favor of PNB-IFL covering the transfer certificates of title in question was located in the records. Nor had any certificate of sale been registered on the titles. Plaintiffs thus prayed that the mortgage and Promissory Notes, and the extra-judicial foreclosure, the foreclosure sale, and any subsequent Certificate of Sale, be declared null and void; that the mortgage liens annotated on the transfer certificates of title be cancelled; that PNB be directed to render an accounting of plaintiffs' true and actual obligation; and that damages and attorney's fees be awarded. Plaintiffs also prayed for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to restrain PNB from consolidating its title to and ownership over the real properties, and to restrain the Makati City Registry of Deeds from canceling plaintiffs' titles and issuing new ones in lieu thereof.<br><br>During the hearings on his prayer for a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction, Timbol affirmed the Affidavit he executed for that purpose.<br><br>By Order dated September 8, 2000, the RTC granted the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction prayed for. The RTC denied PNB's Motion for Reconsideration and Supplemental Motion for Reconsideration, while granting the plaintiffs' Motion to Reduce Bond. PNB elevated the RTC's Order all the way to the Supreme Court which would ultimately nullify and set aside the same in its February 11, 2005 Decision in G.R. No. 157535.<br><br>Meanwhile, in his Answer, Espina defended the validity of the foreclosure sale proceedings and explained that it was PNB's Atty; Geromo who rejected Plaintiff Timbol's request for copies of the mortgage documents and promissory notes. Espina pointed out that the1 alleged Special Power of Attorney supposedly authorizing plaintiff Timbol to represent Laguardia had already been revoked by a July 20, 1998 Order of the Regional Trial Court of Parañaque City, where a petition for legal separation was already pending. Espina further accused Plaintiff Timbol of coming to court with unclean hands, having also breached his obligations to PNB-IFL. Espina made crossclaims for indemnification as well as counterclaims for moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees, and litigation expenses.<br><br>For its part, PNB insisted that the Real Estate Mortgage contracts had been "already in printed form" at the time Timbol signed the same, and that it was not PNB-IFL's practice that these be signed in blank. PNB also argued that the total amount of Timbol/KAE/KHL's obligation already included interest at agreed-upon rates and that the foreclosure proceedings had been proper and valid. Thus PNB asserted that any damage that might result to plaintiffs were merely <i>damnum absque injuria</i>. PNB added that the proceedings were governed by Act No. 3135, not Administrative Order No. 3, as stipulated in the mortgage contracts themselves. PNB moreover explained that the mortgage over seven (7) properties covered by TCT Nos. 196111 thru 196117, all of the Register of Deeds of Makati, altogether secured an obligation of only Thirteen Million Fifty-Three Thousand Six Hundred Pesos and 0/100 (PhP 13,053,600.00), with each of the other mortgages over two (2) properties securing obligations of only Two Million One Hundred Forty-Three Thousand Seven Hundred Fifty Pesos and 0/100 (PhP 2,143,750.00) and Seven Million Five Hundred Ninety-Eight Thousand Eight Hundred Fifty Pesos and 0/100 (PhP 7,598,850.00), rendering plaintiffs' computation; erroneous. PNB advanced counterclaims for actual, moral, and exemplary, damages as well as litigation expenses and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Ruling of the RTC</u></b><br></div><br>On 5 January 2005, the RTC issued its assailed decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foreclosure of mortgage made by the defendant bank on November 15, 1999 is hereby declared null and void over the properties covered by TCTs Nos. 196111, 196112, 196113, 196114, 196115, 196116, 196117, 207636 and 177564 of the Registry of Deeds of Makati City.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC found that "[t]he mortgage loan annotated at the back of the titles did not reflect the actual amount of the loan obtained by the plaintiffs." This, the RTC held, "vitiated the subsequent foreclosure of the mortgage initiated by the defendant bank."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The RTC also held that there was an "obviously deliberate act of the defendant bank in refusing to furnish the plaintiff copies of the loan documents" which, the RTC stated strengthens "the claim of the [Spouses Timbol] that they were virtually led by the defendant bank to sign blank loan documents by merely affixing their signatures thereto."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Further, the RTC interpreted PNB's actions as an attempt "to hide the correct amount of the obligation," confirming the Spouses Timbol's claim that PNB bloated the amount of their obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The RTC further held that PNB failed "to show proof that when it filed the petition for foreclosure with defendant notary public, [it] was duly empowered by a board resolution, as evidenced by a secretary's certificate x x x to foreclose the mortgage constituted over the subject properties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> There was no evidence, the RTC said, "that this subsidiary, obviously a partnership entity, was duly authorized by a resolution that empowered it to assign all its rights and interest in the mortgage in favor of defendant bank."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Lastly, the RTC found no basis to grant the claim for damages and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u></b><br></center><br>Without filing a motion for reconsideration of the RTC decision, PNB elevated the case to the Court of Appeals.

However, Defendant-Appellant's plea for moral and exemplary damages, together with attorney's fees and costs^ is DENIED. A new judgment is hereby entered DISMISSING the complaint.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals held that factual issues raised by PNB have been "definitively laid to rest" by this Court's decision in <i>PNB v.

Such claim despite respondent Timbol's admission in his October 27, 1999 letter to petitioner's counsel that he and his company's outstanding obligation was P33,000,000.00 is grossly misleading and is a gross [m]isrepresentation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court of Appeals noted that the Court's pronouncements in <i>PNB v. Timbol</i> settle the question on PNB's "attempt to hide something" and the alleged bloating of the amounts in the mortgage documents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> On the other hand, the Court of Appeals held that "PNB sufficiently demonstrated plaintiffs-appellees' satisfaction with the loan transaction, proving that Timbol never questioned his obligation and even repeatedly made partial payments on his principal obligations and the interests accruing thereon."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals also found "that the Real Estate Mortgage contracts themselves amply provide for x x x PNB's authority to foreclose the mortgage as PNB-IFL's agent and attorney-in-fact."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Moreover, the Court of Appeals said that Spouses Timbol never "disputed the authority of xxx PNB in instituting foreclosure proceedings.

They emphasize that the earlier case dealt only with the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, and not the validity of the mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Petitioners also insist that the RTC's findings on PNB's alleged refusal to furnish the Spouses Timbol with copies of the mortgage documents and the lack of evidence to show PNB-IFL's authority to assign its rights and interests to PNB should have been upheld by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Respondent's Arguments</u></b><br></center><br>PNB, in its Comment, counters that the petition for review must be dismissed for "failing to show special and important reasons warranting the exercise of this Honorable Court's discretionary reviewing power."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> PNB points out that petitioners are raising factual issues that have already been "exhaustively discussed and resolved" by this Court in <i>PNB v.

PNB argues that "[t]here is absolutely nothing in the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure that requires a party-litigant to first file a motion for reconsideration of an adverse decision before it can file a Notice of Appeal." PNB claims that the provisions in the Rules of Civil Procedure on motions for reconsideration are "merely directory, and not mandatory."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>As to the alleged absence of a proper authority from PNB-IFL to give PNB the right to foreclose on the real estate mortgage, PNB agrees with the Court of Appeals' ruling and underscores the terms of the mortgage contract as the basis for such authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Specifically, PNB points to Paragraph 21, which states:<br><blockquote>21.

As such, a party aggrieved by the trial court's decision may either move for reconsideration or appeal to the Court of Appeals.<br><br>On the other hand, Rule 41, Section 3 provides as follows:<br><blockquote>SEC. 3. <i>Period of ordinary appeal, appeal in habeas corpus cases</i>.—The appeal shall be taken within fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order appealed from. Where a record on appeal is required, the appellant shall file a notice of appeal and a record on appeal within thirty (30) days from notice of the judgment or final order.

The Court therein thoroughly and thoughtfully examined the validity of the extrajudicial foreclosure in order to determine whether the writ of preliminary injunction was proper. To allow a reexamination of this conclusion will disturb what has already been settled and only create confusion if the Court now makes a contrary finding.<br><br>Thus, "[q]uestions necessarily involved in the decision on a former appeal will be regarded as the law of the case on a subsequent appeal, although the questions are not expressly treated in the opinion of the court, as the presumption is that all the facts in the case bearing on the point decided have received due consideration whether all or none of them are mentioned in the opinion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals was correct to abide by the Court's ruling in <i>PNB v. Timbol</i>, for "once the appellate court has issued a pronouncement on a point that was presented to it with full opportunity to be heard having been accorded to the parties, the pronouncement should be regarded as the law of the case and should not be reopened on remand of the case to determine other issues of the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>Other Issues</u></b><br></center><br>Further, the Court of Appeals itself found ample reason to reverse and set aside the RTC's decision. These findings, the Court now finds, are supported by the evidence on record.<br><br>The Court cannot sustain the claim that the Spouses Timbol were kept in the dark by PNB on the real terms of the contract the Spouses Timbol signed.<br><br>It is difficult to imagine that an experienced businessman like Timbol will sign documents, especially a mortgage contract that potentially involves multi-million peso liabilities, without knowing its terms and conditions. Moreover, the records are replete with evidence that the Spouses Timbol had already partially complied with their obligation under the mortgage contract.<br><br>Replying to PNB's demand letter dated 2 September 1999, Felino Timbol himself acknowledged that he and his wife were "well aware of our total outstanding obligation" to PNB, which he pegged at P33 million. The same letter bears no indication that the Spouses Timbol were impugning the terms of their agreement. On the contrary, they acknowledged their obligation and merely pleaded for more time to comply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> They further amplified their assent in another undated letter where they informed PNB that they "can deliver a partial payment of at least 10% of [their] total obligation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Likewise, in a letter dated 2 October 2000, Felino Timbol acknowledged the amount of his obligation "based on the Statement of Account prepared by PNB-IFL," and even laid down his proposal on how the Spouses Timbol would settle the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup><br><br>As to the claim that there is no proper authority from PNB-IFL assigning its rights and interest in the mortgage contract to PNB, the Court finds that the same is easily controverted by the Real Estate Mortgage itself.<br><br>Paragraph 21 of the Real Estate Mortgage states:<br><blockquote>21. APPOINTMENT OF AGENT; ASSIGNMENT. The Mortgagee <b>hereby appoints the Philippine National Bank (Head Office, Pasay City) as its attorney-in-fact with full power and authority to exercise all its rights and obligations under this Agreement, such as but not limited to foreclosure of the Mortgaged Properties</b>, taking possession and selling of the mortgaged/foreclosed properties, and execution of covering documents. The Mortgagee may also assign its rights and interest: under this Agreement even without need of prior notice to, or consent of, the Mortgagors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The terms of the contract are clear and should end any further discussion on this issue.<br><br>In addition, petitioners never raised the authority of PNB to foreclose the mortgage on behalf of PNB-IFL in their Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> before the trial court or in the proceedings before the Court of Appeals.<br><br>It is now too late for petitioners to raise these issues before the Court. It is noteworthy that all these could have been ventilated in the proceedings before the Court of Appeals had petitioners not neglected to file their Appellees' Brief.<br><br>Thus, the foregoing discussion puts to rest the issues raised by petitioners. Consequently, the real estate mortgage, the subsequent foreclosure and auction sale are held to be valid. No irregularity attended the execution of the mortgage contract, the foreclosure, and the auction sale, the same being within the terms agreed upon by petitioners' predecessor-in-interest and PNB.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <b>DENIED</b>.
