In addition, the factors enumerated under Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, <i>i.e.</i>, (<i>a</i>) the acquisition cost of the land, (<i>b</i>) the current value of like properties, (<i>c</i>) the nature and actual use of the property, and the income therefrom, (<i>d</i>) the owner's sworn valuation, (<i>e</i>) the tax declarations, (<i>f</i>) the assessment made by government assessors, (<i>g</i>) the social and economic benefits contributed by the farmers and the farmworkers, and by the government to the property, and (<i>h</i>) the nonpayment of taxes or loans secured from any government financing institution on the said land, if any, must be equally considered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>However, it bears pointing out that while Congress passed <b>RA 9700</b> on August 7, 2009, further amending certain provisions of RA 6657, as amended, among them, Section 17, and declaring "[t]hat all previously acquired lands wherein valuation is subject to challenge by landowners shall be completed and finally resolved pursuant to Section 17 of [RA 6657], as amended,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> DAR AO 2, series of 2009, which is the implementing rules of RA 9700, had clarified that the said law shall not apply to claims/cases where the <b>claim folders were received by the LBP prior to July 1, 2009</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> In such a situation, just compensation <b>shall be determined in accordance with Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, <i>prior to its further amendment by RA 9700</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>Preliminarily, the Court notes that notwithstanding the CA's reference to the formula<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> provided under DAR AO 5, series of 1998, it still applied the formula under DAR AO 1, series of 2010 considering that it merely affirmed the RTC's computation which utilized values<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> corresponding to those prescribed therein, <i>i.e.</i>, the latest available gross production and selling prices for 12 months immediately preceding July 1, 2009,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> in arriving at the capitalized net income (<b>CNI</b>).<br><br>It is significant to stress, however, that DAR AO 1, series of 2010 which was issued in line with Section 31 of RA 9700<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> empowering the DAR to provide the necessary rules and regulations for its implementation, became effective only <u><i>subsequent to July 1, 2009</i></u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Consequently, it cannot be applied in the determination of just compensation for the subject land where the claim folders were undisputedly received by the LBP <u><i>prior to July 1, 2009</i></u>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> and, as such, <u>should be valued in accordance with Section 17 of RA 6657 prior to its further amendment by RA 9700</u> pursuant to the cut-off date set under DAR AO 2, series of 2009<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> (cut-off rule). Notably, DAR AO 1, series of 2010 did not expressly or impliedly repeal the cut-off rule set under DAR AO 2, series of 2009, having made no reference to any cut-off date with respect to land valuation for previously acquired lands under PD 27 and EO 228 wherein valuation is subject to challenge by landowners. Consequently, the application of DAR AO 1, series of 2010 should be, thus, limited to those where the claim folders were received <u><i>on or subsequent to July 1, 2009</i></u>.<br><br>In this case, the Court has gone over the records and found that the RTC and the CA neither considered the cut-off rule nor explained its reasons for deviating therefrom. Since the claim folders were received by the LBP prior to July 1, 2009, the RTC should have computed just compensation using pertinent DAR regulations applying Section 17 of RA 6657 prior to its amendment by RA 9700 instead of adopting the new DAR issuance, absent any cogent justifications otherwise. Therefore, as it stands, the RTC and the CA were duty-bound to utilize the basic formula prescribed and laid down in pertinent DAR regulations existing prior to the passage of RA 9700, to determine just compensation.<br><br>Nonetheless, the RTC, acting as a SAC, is reminded that it is not strictly bound by the different formula created by the DAR if the situations before it do not warrant their application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> To insist on a rigid application of the formula goes beyond the intent and spirit of the law, bearing in mind that the valuation of property or the determination of just compensation is essentially a judicial function which is vested with the courts, and not with administrative agencies. Therefore, the RTC must still be able to reasonably exercise its judicial discretion in the evaluation of the factors for just compensation, which cannot be restricted by a formula dictated by the DAR<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> when faced with situations that do not warrant its strict application. However, the RTC must explain and justify in clear terms the reason for any deviation from the prescribed factors and formula.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, while the parties did not raise as issue the <i>improper</i> application of DAR AO 1, series of 2010, the Court finds a need to <u><b><i>remand</i></b></u> the case to the RTC for the determination of just compensation to <b>ensure compliance with the law, and to give everyone - the landowner, the farmers, and the State - their due</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> To this end, the RTC is hereby directed to observe the following guidelines in the remand of the case:<br><br><b><u>1.</u> <i>Just compensation must be valued at the time of taking,</i></b> or the time when the owner was deprived of the use and benefit of his property,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> in this case, when emancipation patents were issued in the names of the farmer-beneficiaries on May 27, 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> Hence, the evidence to be presented by the parties before the trial court for the valuation of the subject land must be based on the <u>values prevalent on such time of taking for like agricultural lands</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup><br><br><b><u>2.</u> <i>Just compensation must be arrived at pursuant to the guidelines set forth in Section 17 of RA 6657, as amended, prior to its amendment by RA 9700.</i></b> However, the RTC is reminded that while it should take into account the different formula created by the DAR in arriving at the just compensation for the subject land, it is not strictly bound thereto if the situations before it do not warrant their application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> In any event, should the RTC find the said guidelines to be inapplicable, it must clearly explain the reasons for deviating therefrom, and for using other factors or formula in arriving at the reasonable just compensation for the acquired property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup><br><br><b><u>3.</u> <i>Interest may be awarded as may be warranted by the circumstances of the case and based on prevailing jurisprudence.</i></b> In previous cases, the Court has allowed the grant of legal interest in expropriation cases where there is delay in the payment since the just compensation due to the landowners was deemed to be an effective forbearance on the part of the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> Legal interest on the unpaid balance shall be pegged at the rate of 12% p.a. from the time of taking on May 27, 2002 until June 30, 2013 only.
