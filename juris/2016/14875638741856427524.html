No. 1125), which grants the CTA the exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review, among others, the decisions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue "in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) or other law or part of law administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue."<br><br>PAGCOR counters, however, that it is the Secretary of Justice who should adjudicate the dispute by virtue of Chapter 14 of the <i>Revised Administrative Code of 1987</i>, which provides:<br><blockquote><center>CHAPTER 14. CONTROVERSIES AMONG GOVERNMENT OFFICES AND CORPORATIONS.<br></center><br>SEC. 66. <i>How settled</i>. - All disputes/claims and controversies, solely between or among the departments, bureaus, offices, agencies and instrumentalities of the National Government, including government­-owned and controlled corporations, such as those arising from the interpretation and application of statues, contracts or agreements shall be administratively settled or adjudicated in the manner provided for in this Chapter. This Chapter shall, however, not apply to disputes involving the Congress, the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Commission and local governments.<br><br>SEC. 67. <i>Disputes Involving Questions of Law</i>. - All cases involving only questions of law shall be submitted to and settled or adjudicated by the Secretary of Justice as Attorney-General of the National Government and as ex-officio legal adviser of all government-­owned or controlled corporations. His ruling or decision thereon shall be conclusive and binding on all the parties concerned.<br><br>SEC. 68. <i>Disputes Involving Questions of Fact and Law</i>. - Cases involving mixed questions of law and of fact or only factual issues shall be submitted to and settled or adjudicated by:<br><br>(1) The Solicitor General, if the dispute, claim or controversy involves only departments, bureaus, offices and other agencies of the National Government as well as government-owned or controlled corporations or entities of whom he is the principal law officer or general counsel; and<br><br>(2) The Secretary of Justice, in all other cases not falling under paragraph (1).<br></blockquote>Although acknowledging the validity of the petitioner's contention, the Secretary of Justice still resolved the disputed assessments on the basis that the prevailing doctrine at the time of the filing of the petitions in the Department of Justice (DOJ) on January 5, 2004 was that enunciated in <i>Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> whereby the Court ruled that:<br><blockquote>x x x (T)here is an "irreconcilable repugnancy x x x between Section 7(2) of R.A. NO. 1125 and P.D. No. 242," and hence, that the latter enactment (P.D. No. 242), being the latest expression of the legislative will, should prevail over the earlier.<br></blockquote>Later on, the Court reversed itself in <i>Philippine National Oil Company v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and held as follows:<br><blockquote>Following the rule on statutory construction involving a general and a special law previously discussed, then P.D. No. 242 should not affect R.A. No. 1125. R.A. No. 1125, specifically Section 7 thereof on the jurisdiction of the CTA, constitutes an exception to P.D. No. 242. Disputes, claims and controversies, tailing under Section 7 of R.A. No. 1125, even though solely among government offices, agencies, and instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations, remain in the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the CTA. Such a construction resolves the alleged inconsistency or conflict between the two statutes, x x x.<br></blockquote>Despite the shift in the construction of P.D. No. 242 in relation to R.A. No. 1125, the Secretary of Justice still resolved PAGCOR's petitions on the merits, stating that:<br><blockquote>While this ruling (DBP) has been superseded by the ruling in <i>Philippine National Oil Company vs. CA</i>, in view of the prospective application of the PNOC ruling, we (the DOJ) are of the view that this Office can continue to assume jurisdiction over this case which was filed and has been pending with this Office since January 5, 2004 and rule on the merits of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>We disagree with the action of the Secretary of Justice.<br><br>PAGCOR filed its appeals in the DOJ on January 5, 2004 and August 4, 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> <i>Philippine National Oil Company v. Court of Appeals</i> was promulgated on April 26, 2006. The Secretary of Justice resolved the petitions on December 22, 2006. Under the circumstances, the Secretary of Justice had ample opportunity to abide by the prevailing rule and should have referred the case to the CTA because judicial decisions applying or interpreting the law formed part of the legal system of the country,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and are for that reason to be held in obedience by all, including the Secretary of Justice and his Department. Upon becoming aware of the new proper construction of P.D. No. 242 in relation to R.A. No. 1125 pronounced in <i>Philippine National Oil Company v. Court of Appeals</i>, therefore, the Secretary of Justice should have desisted from dealing with the petitions, and referred them to the CTA, instead of insisting on exercising jurisdiction thereon. Therein lay the grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the Secretary of Justice, for he thereby acted arbitrarily and capriciously in ignoring the pronouncement in <i>Philippine National Oil Company v. Court of Appeals</i>. Indeed, the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> required him to adhere to the ruling of the Court, which by tradition and conformably with our system of judicial administration speaks the last word on what the law is, and stands as the final arbiter of any justiciable controversy. In other words, there is only one Supreme Court from whose decisions all other courts and everyone else should take their bearings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, the Secretary of Justice should not be taken to task for initially entertaining the petitions considering that the prevailing interpretation of the law on jurisdiction at the time of their filing was that he had jurisdiction. Neither should PAGCOR to blame in bringing its appeal to the DOJ on January 5, 2004 and August 4, 2004 because the prevailing rule then was the interpretation in <i>Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>. The emergence of the later ruling was beyond PAGCOR's control. Accordingly, the lapse of the period within which to appeal the disputed assessments to the CTA could not be taken against PAGCOR. While a judicial interpretation becomes a part of the law as of the date that the law was originally passed, the reversal of the interpretation cannot be given retroactive effect to the prejudice of parties who may have relied on the first interpretation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The Court now undertakes to settle the controversy because of the urgent need to promptly decide it. We cannot lose sight of the fact that PAGCOR is among the most prolific income-generating institutions that contribute immensely to the country's developing economy. Any controversy involving PAGCOR should be resolved expeditiously considering the underlying public interest in the matter at hand. To dismiss the petitions in order to have PAGCOR bring a similar petition in the CTA would not serve the interest of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> On previous occasions, the Court has overruled the defense of jurisdiction in the interest of public welfare and for the advancement of public policy whenever, as in this case, an extraordinary situation existed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><center><b>2.<br><br>PAGCOR is exempt from payment of VAT</b><br></center><br>The CIR insists that under VAT Ruling No. 04-96 (dated May 14, 1996), VAT Ruling No. 030-99 (dated March 18, 1999), and VAT Ruling No. 067-01 (dated October 8, 2001), R.A. No. 7716<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> has expressly repealed, amended, or withdrawn the 5% franchise tax provision in PAGCOR's Charter; hence, PAGCOR was liable for the 10% VAT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The relevant provisions of R.A. No. 7716 on which the insistence has been anchored are the following:<br><blockquote>SEC. 3. Section 102 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 102. Value-added tax on sale of services and use or lease of properties. - (a) Rate and base of tax. - There shall be levied, assessed and collected, a value-added tax equivalent to 10% of gross receipts derived from the sale or exchange of services, including the use or lease of properties.<br><br>"The phrase 'sale or exchange of services' means the performance of all kinds of service in the Philippines for others for a fee, remuneration or consideration, including x x x service of franchise grantees of telephone and telegraph, radio and television broadcasting and all other franchise grantees except those under Section 117 of this Code; x x x"<br></blockquote>SEC. 12. Section 117 of the National Internal revenue Code, as amended, is hereby further amended further to read as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 117. Tax on Franchises. Any provision of general or special law to the contrary notwithstanding, there shall be levied, assessed and collected in respect to all franchises on electric, gas and water utilities a tax of two percent (2%) on the gross receipts derived from the business covered by the law granting the franchise. x x x"<br></blockquote>SEC. 20. Repealing Clauses. - The provisions of any special law relative to the rate of franchise taxes are hereby expressly repealed. x x x<br></blockquote>The CIR argues that PAGCOR's gambling operations are embraced under the phrase <i>sale or exchange of services, including the use or lease of properties</i>; that such operations are not among those expressly exempted from the 10% VAT under Section 3 of R.A. No. 7716; and that the legislative purpose to withdraw PAGCOR's 5% franchise tax was manifested by the language used in Section 20 of R.A. No. 7716.<br><br>The CIR's arguments lack merit.<br><br>Firstly, a basic rule in statutory construction is that a special law cannot be repealed or modified by a subsequently enacted general law in the absence of any express provision in the latter law to that effect. A special law must be interpreted to constitute an exception to the general law in the absence of special circumstances warranting a contrary conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> R.A. No. 7716, a general law, did not provide for the express repeal of PAGCOR's Charter, which is a special law; hence, the general repealing clause under Section 20 of R.A. No. 7716 must pertain only to franchises of electric, gas, and water utilities, while the term <i>other franchises</i> in Section 102 of the NIRC should refer only to transport, communications and utilities, exclusive of PAGCOR's casino operations.<br><br>Secondly, R.A. No. 7716 indicates that Congress has not intended to repeal PAGCOR's privilege to enjoy the 5% franchise tax in lieu of all other taxes. A contrary construction would be unwarranted and myopic nitpicking. In this regard, we should follow the following apt reminder uttered in <i>Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><blockquote>A law must not be read in truncated parts: its provisions must be read in relation to the whole law. It is the cardinal rule in statutory construction that a statute's clauses and phrases must not be taken as detached and isolated expressions but the whole and every part thereof must be considered in fixing the meaning of any of its parts in order to produce a harmonious whole. Every part of the statute must be interpreted with reference to the context <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, that every part of the statute must be considered together with other parts of the statute and kept subservient to the general intent of the whole enactment.<br><br>In construing a statute courts have to take the thought conveyed by the statute as a whole; construe the constituent parts together ascertain the legislative intent from the whole act; consider each and every provision thereof in the light of the general purpose of the statute; and endeavor to make every part effective, harmonious and sensible.<br></blockquote>Although Section 3 of R.A. No. 7716 imposes 10% VAT on the sale or exchange of services, including the use or lease of properties, the provision also considers transactions that are subject to 0% VAT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> On the other hand, Section 4 of R.A. No. 7716 enumerates the transactions exempt from VAT, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>SEC. 4. Section 103 of the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 103. Exempt transactions. - <b>The following shall be exempt from the value-added tax</b>:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>"(q) <b>Transactions which are exempt under special laws</b>, except those granted under Presidential Decree Nos. 66, 529, 972, 1491, and 1590, and nonelectric cooperatives under republic Act No. 6938, or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory;<br><br>x x x x" (bold emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote></blockquote>Anent the effect of R.A. No. 7716 on franchises, the Court has observed in <i>Tolentino v. The Secretary of Finance</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> that:<br><blockquote>Among the provisions of the NIRC amended is § 103, which originally read:<br><blockquote>§103. <i>Exempt transactions</i>. - The following shall be exempt from the value-added tax:<br><br>.....<br><br>(q) Transactions which are exempt under special laws or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory.<br></blockquote>Among the transactions exempted from the VAT were those of PAL because it was exempted under its franchise (P.D. No. 1590) from the payment of all "other taxes ... now or in the near future," in consideration of the payment by it either of the corporate income tax or a franchise tax of 2%.<br><br>As a result of its amendment by Republic Act No. 7716, §103 of the NIRC now provides:<br><blockquote>§103. <i>Exempt transactions</i>. - The following shall be exempt from the value-added tax:<br><br>.....<br><br>(q) Transactions which are exempt under special laws, except those granted under Presidential Decree Nos. 66, 529, 972, 1491, 1590 .....<br></blockquote>The effect of the amendment is to remove the exemption granted to PAL, as far as the VAT is concerned. <br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x Republic Act No. 7716 expressly amends PAL's franchise (P.D. No. 1590) by specifically excepting from the grant of exemptions from the VAT PAL's exemption under P.D. No. 1590. This is within the power of Congress to do under Art. XII, § 11 of the Constitution, which provides that the grant of a franchise for the operation of a public utility is subject to amendment, alteration or repeal by Congress when the common good so requires.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br></blockquote>Unlike the case of PAL, however, R.A. No. 7716 does not specifically exclude PAGCOR's exemption under P.D. No. 1869 from the grant of exemptions from VAT; hence, the petitioner's contention that R.A. No. 7716 expressly amended PAGCOR's franchise has no leg to stand on.<br><br>Moreover, PAGCOR's exemption from VAT, whether under R.A. No. 7716 or its amendments, has been settled in <i>Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) v. The Bureau of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> whereby the Court, citing <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Acesite (Philippines) Hotel Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> has declared:<br><blockquote><b>Petitioner is exempt from the payment of VAT, because PAGCORs charter, P.D. No. 1869, is a special law that grants petitioner exemption from taxes.</b><br><br>Moreover, the exemption of PAGCOR from VAT is supported by Section 6 of R.A. No. 9337, which retained Section 108 (B) (3) of R.A. No. 8424, thus:<br><blockquote>[R.A. No. 9337], SEC. 6. Section 108 of the same Code (R.A. No. 8424), as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows:<br><br>SEC. 108. <i>Value-Added Tax on Sale of Services and Use or Lease of Properties</i>.<br><br>(A) <i>Rate and Base of Tax</i>. There shall be levied, assessed and collected, a value-added tax equivalent to ten percent (10%) of gross receipts derived from the sale or exchange of services, including the use or lease of properties: x x x<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>(B) <i>Transactions Subject to Zero Percent (0%) Rate</i></b>. The following services performed in the Philippines by VAT-registered persons shall be subject to zero percent (0%) rate;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(3) <b>Services rendered to persons of entities whose exemption under special laws</b> or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory effectively <b>subjects the supply of such services to zero percent (0%) rate</b>;<br><br>x x x x<br><br>As pointed out by petitioner, although R.A. No. 9337 introduced amendments to Section 108 of R.A. No. 8424 by imposing VAT on other services not previously covered, it did not amend the portion of Section 108 (B) (3) that subjects to zero percent rate services performed by VAT-registered persons to persons or entities whose exemption under special laws or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory effectively subjects the supply of such services to 0% rate.<br></blockquote>Petitioner's exemption from VAT under Section 108 (B) (3) of R.A. No. 8424 has been thoroughly and extensively discussed in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Acesite (Philippines) Hotel Corporation</i>. x x x The Court ruled that PAGCOR and Acesite were both exempt from paying VAT, thus:<br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br><b>PAGCOR is exempt from payment of indirect taxes</b><br><br>It is undisputed that P.D. 1869, the charter creating PAGCOR, grants the latter an exemption from the payment of taxes. Section 13 of P.D. 1869 pertinently provides:<br><br>Sec. 13. <i>Exemptions</i>.<br><br>x x x x<br><blockquote>(2) <i>Income and other taxes</i>. - (a) Franchise Holder: No tax of any kind or form, income or otherwise, as well as fees, charges or levies of whatever nature, whether National or Local, shall be assessed and collected under this Franchise from the Corporation; nor shall any form of tax or charge attach in any way to the earnings of the Corporation, except a Franchise Tax of five (5%) percent of the gross revenue or earnings derived by the Corporation from its operation under this Franchise. Such tax shall be due and payable quarterly to the National Government and shall be in lieu of all kinds of taxes, levies, fees or assessments of any kind, nature or description, levied, established or collected by any municipal, provincial, or national government authority.<br><br>(b) <i>Others</i>: The exemptions herein granted for earnings derived from the operations conducted under the franchise specifically from the payment of any tax, income or otherwise, as well as any form of charges, fees or levies, shall inure to the benefit of and extend to corporation(s), association(s), agency(ies), or individual(s) with whom the Corporation or operator has any contractual relationship in connection with the operations of the casino(s) authorized to be conducted under this Franchise and to those receiving compensation or other remuneration from the Corporation or operator as a result of essential facilities furnished and/or technical services rendered to the Corporation or operator.<br></blockquote>Petitioner contends that the above tax exemption refers only to PAGCOR's direct tax liability and not to indirect taxes, like the VAT.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br><b>A close scrutiny of the above provisos clearly gives PAGCOR a blanket exemption to taxes with no distinction on whether the taxes are direct or indirect.</b> We are one with the CA ruling that PAGCOR is also exempt from indirect taxes, like VAT, as follows:<br><blockquote>Under the above provision [Section 13 (2) (b) of P.D. 1869], the term "Corporation" or operator refers to PAGCOR. Although the law does not specifically mention PAGCOR's exemption from indirect taxes, <b>PAGCOR is undoubtedly exempt from such taxes because the law exempts from taxes persons or entities contracting with PAGCOR in casino operations</b>. Although, differently worded, the provision clearly exempts PAGCOR from indirect taxes. <b>In fact, it goes one step further by granting tax exempt status to persons dealing with PAGCOR in casino operations.</b> The unmistakable conclusion is that PAGCOR is not liable for the P30,152,892.02 VAT and neither is Acesite as the latter is effectively subject to zero percent rate under Sec. 108 B (3), R.A. 8424. (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Indeed, by extending the exemption to entities or individuals dealing with PAGCOR, the legislature clearly granted exemption also from indirect taxes. It must be noted that the indirect tax of VAT, as in the instant case, can be shifted or passed to the buyer, transferee, or lessee of the goods, properties, or services subject to VAT. <b>Thus, by extending the tax exemption to entities or individuals dealing with PAGCOR in casino operations, it is exempting PAGCOR from being liable to indirect taxes.</b><br><br><b>The manner of charging VAT does not make PAGCOR liable to said tax.</b><br><br>It is true that VAT can either be incorporated in the value of the goods, properties, or services sold or leased, in which case it is computed as 1/11 of such value, or charged as an additional 10% to the value. Verily, the seller or lessor has the option to follow either way in charging its clients and customer. In the instant case, Acesite followed the latter method, that is, charging an additional 10% of the gross sales and rentals. Be that as it may, the use of either method, and in particular, the first method, does not denigrate the fact that PAGCOR is exempt from an indirect tax, like VAT.<br><br><b>VAT exemption extends to Acesite</b><br><br>Thus, while it was proper for PAGCOR not to pay the 10% VAT charged by Acesite, the latter is not liable for the payment of it as it is exempt in this particular transaction by operation of law to pay the indirect tax. Such exemption falls within the former Section 102 (b) (3) of the 1977 Tax Code, as amended (<b>now Sec. 108 [b] [3] of R.A. 8424</b>), which provides:<br><blockquote>Section 102. <i>Value-added tax on sale of services</i>. - (a) Rate and base of tax - There shall be levied, assessed and collected, a value-added tax equivalent to 10% of gross receipts derived by any person engaged in the sale of services x x x; Provided, that the following services performed in the Philippines by VAT registered persons shall be subject to 0%.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(3) <b>Services rendered to persons or entities whose exemption under special laws</b> or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory effectively subjects the supply of such services to zero (0%) rate (emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote>The rationale for the exemption from indirect taxes provided for in P.D. 1869 and the extension of such exemption to entities or individuals dealing with PAGCOR in casino operations are best elucidated from the 1987 case of <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. John Gotamco &amp; Sons, Inc.</i>, where the absolute tax exemption of the World Health Organization (WHO) upon an international agreement was upheld. We held in said case that the exemption of contractee WHO should be implemented to mean that the entity or person exempt is the contractor itself who constructed the buiId.ng owned by contractee WHO, and such does not violate the rule that tax exemptions are personal because the manifest intention of the agreement is to exempt the contractor so that no contractor's tax may be shifted to the contractee WHO. <b>Thus, the proviso in P.D. 1869, extending the exemption to entities or individuals dealing with PAGCOR in casino operations, is clearly to proscribe any indirect tax, like VAT, that may be shifted to PAGCOR.</b><br></blockquote>Although the basis of the exemption of PAGCOR and Acesite from VAT in the case of <i>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Acesite (Philippines) Hotel Corporation</i> was Section 102 (b) of the 1977 Tax Code, as amended, which section was retained as Section 108 (B) (3) in R.A. No. 8424, it is still applicable to this case, since the provision relied upon has been retained in R.A. No. 9337.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>Clearly, the assessments for deficiency VAT issued against PAGCOR should be cancelled for lack of legal basis.<br><br>The Court also deems it warranted to cancel the assessments for deficiency withholding VAT pertaining to the payments made by PAGCOR to its catering service contractor.<br><br>In two separate letters dated December 12, 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and December 15, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> the BIR conceded that the unmonetized meal allowances of PAGCOR's employees were not subject to fringe benefits tax (FBT). However, the BIR held PAGCOR liable for expanded withholding VAT for the payments made to its catering service contractor who provided the meals for its employees. Accordingly, the BIR assessed PAGCOR with deficiency withholding VAT for taxable year 1999 in the amount of P4,077,667.40, inclusive of interest and compromise penalty; and for taxable year 2000 in the amount of P12,212,199.85, exclusive of interest and penalties.<br><br>The payments made by PAGCOR to its catering service contractor are subject to zero-rated (0%) VAT in accordance with Section 13(2) of P.O.

To avoid the imposition of the FBT on the benefit received by the employee, and, consequently, to avoid the withholding of the payment thereof by the employer, PAGCOR must sufficiently establish that the fringe benefit is required by the nature of, or is necessary to the trade, business or profession of the employer, or when the fringe benefit is for the convenience or advantage of the employer.<br><br>PAGCOR asserted that the car plan was granted "not only because it was necessary to the nature of the trade of PAGCOR but it was also granted for its convenience."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The records are lacking in proof as to whether such benefit granted to PAGCOR's officers were, in fact, necessary for PAGCOR's business or for its convenience and advantage.

According to PAGCOR, the membership dues and fees are:<br><blockquote>57. x x x expenses borne by [respondent] to cover various memberships in social, athletic clubs and similar organizations. x x x<br><br>58. Respondent's nature of business is casino operations and it derives business from its customers who play at the casinos. In furtherance of its business, PAGCOR usually attends its VIP customers, amenities such as playing rights to golf clubs. The membership of PAGCOR to these golf clubs and other organizations are intended to benefit respondent's customers and not its employees. Aside from this, the membership is under the name of PAGCOR, and as such, cannot be considered as fringe benefits because it is the customers and not the employees of PAGCOR who benefit from such memberships.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br></blockquote>Considering that the payments of membership dues and fees are not borne by PAGCOR for its employees, they cannot be considered as fringe benefits which are subject to FBT under Section 33 of the NIRC.
