This is because the parcels of land in the three (3) expropriation cases were located in other barangays of Calbayog City and there is no showing that the decisions therein have attained finality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> Finally, petitioner submits that the City Assessor's valuation of the subject property appearing in Tax Declaration No. 96-03023-00104 should prevail over that determined by the Commissioner—the Branch Clerk of Court—who does not have the expertise or competence to conduct property appraisals as required under Rule 67, Section 5.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>Respondents aver that the trial court was justified in allowing them to present evidence ex parte because (1) petitioner and its counsel failed to appear at the pre-trial on May 24, 2000; and (2) petitioner's Urgent Manifestation and Motion to postpone the pre-trial setting on May 24, 2000 was filed late.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> They add that due process was satisfied in the court a quo as petitioner was afforded the fair and reasonable opportunity to defend its side and to move for the reconsideration of the trial court ruling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>As to the appointment of the Branch Clerk of Court as Commissioner, respondents aver that this was proper and sanctioned by the Rules; that the Commissioner's preliminary determination of just compensation was merely recommendatory and did not make the ex parte proceedings invalid; and that the final determination of the amount of just compensation still rests on the trial judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup><br><br>Lastly, respondents contend that Section 3-A of Republic Act No. 6395 cannot defeat the trial court's determination of the just compensation of their property; that the determination of just compensation is a judicial function; and that it has been ruled in previous cases that the acquisition of right-of-way easement is a taking under the power of eminent domain and the owner is entitled to the money equivalent of the property expropriated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>The issues for resolution are:<br><br>First, whether petitioner was deprived of due process when respondents were allowed to present evidence ex parte;<br><br>Second, whether the appraisal of the property was valid and the court-appointed Commissioner exceeded his authority when he conducted an appraisal of the property and recommended a valuation for just compensation;<br><br>Third, whether petitioner should be made to pay simple easement fee or full compensation for the land traversed by its transmission lines; and<br><br>Lastly, whether the trial court erred in its determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid to respondents.<br><br>The Petition lacks merit.<br><br><center><b>I</b><br></center><br>The Regional Trial Court did not err in allowing respondents to present their evidence ex parte. The action of the trial court is expressly allowed under Rule 18, Section 5 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. Section 5 provides that if it is the defendant who fails to appear, then the plaintiff may be allowed "to present his evidence ex parte and the court to render judgment on the basis thereof." Petitioner's stance that it was deprived of due process because it was not given the <i>reasonable opportunity</i> to attend the second pre-trial setting is likewise untenable.<br><br>Petitioner and its counsel were absent during the first pre-trial setting on May 8, 2000. Respondents' counsel attended, although he was late. Had petitioner and its counsel appeared on the first setting, they would have been reasonably notified then and there of the second pre-trial resetting on May 24, 2000 and would have had the opportunity to ask for a later date. Nonetheless, petitioner's counsel should have tried to inquire from the court the next schedule of the pre-trial.<br><br>Attendance by the party and its counsel during a pre-trial conference is mandatory as expressly stated under Rule 18, Section 4 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Petitioner alleges that it filed a motion for postponement of the first pre-trial setting. This notwithstanding, it was still its duty to appear at the pre-trial first set on May 8, 2000. A motion for postponement should never be presumed to be granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Petitioner does not refute respondents' argument that its <i>Urgent Manifestation and Motion</i>, although dated May 24, 2000, was filed only one (1) day after the scheduled pre-trial sought to be postponed, on May 25, 2000. The trial court was, therefore, justified in denying petitioner's motion for postponement for having been filed out of time. A motion for postponement should be filed on or before the lapse of the day sought to be postponed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> In any case, "the matter of postponement of a hearing is addressed to the sound discretion of the court [and] unless there is a grave abuse of discretion in the exercise thereof the same should not be disturbed on review."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's counsel received the Regional Trial Court Order resetting the pre-trial to May 24, 2000 on May 22, 2000. Assuming its counsel was unable to appear at the second pre-trial setting, petitioner could and should have sent a representative on May 24, 2000 to ask for postponement of the second pre-trial setting. During the second pre-trial setting, it was not only petitioner's counsel who failed to appear, but petitioner as well.<br><br>Under the circumstances, petitioner cannot claim that it was denied due process. "Parties are presumed to have known the governing rules and the consequences for the violation of such rules."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Moreover, the essence of due process is an opportunity to be heard. Petitioner was given that opportunity. Yet, it failed to appear at the two (2) pre-trial settings. A pre-trial cannot be taken for granted for it serves a vital objective: the simplification and expedition of the trial, if not its dispensation. Non-appearance of a party may only be excused for a valid cause. We see none in this case.<br><br>In <i>Air Philippines Corporation v. International Business Aviation Services Philippines, Inc.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> the petitioner and its counsel did not appear during the scheduled pre-trials and did not file a pre-trial brief even after filing a motion to extend the date for filing. Hence, the respondent was allowed to adduce its evidence ex parte. The petitioner moved for reconsideration, but the motion was denied. After the ex parte presentation of the respondent's evidence, the trial court rendered a judgment in favor of the respondent. The petitioner moved for new trial arguing that it was deprived of its day in court due to the gross negligence of its counsel, but the trial court denied the motion. Affirming the trial court, this Count ruled that the petitioner and its counsel's lapses showed a plain disregard of the duty imposed by law. Ruling that there was no denial of due process, this Court held:<br><blockquote>"The essence of due process is to be found in the reasonable opportunity to be heard and submit any evidence one may have in support of one's defense." Where the opportunity to be heard, either through verbal arguments or pleadings, is accorded, and the party can "present its side" or defend its "interest in due course," "there is no denial of procedural due process." Petitioner has been given its chance, and after being declared in default, judgment has not been automatically "rendered in favor of the non-defaulting party." Rather, judgment was made only after carefully weighing the evidence presented. Substantive and adjective laws do complement each other "in the just and speedy resolution of the dispute between the parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Similarly, petitioner in this case was not deprived of its day in court. Petitioner was able to file a Motion for Reconsideration, participate in further proceedings, and was allowed to submit its objections to respondents' evidence and to the Commissioner's recommendation before the trial court rendered judgment. It must, therefore, bear the consequences of its lapses.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>On the second issue, we likewise find petitioner's arguments untenable.<br><br>The procedure of designating the clerk of court as commissioner to receive and report evidence to the court is likewise sanctioned by Rule 32, Sections 2 and 3 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. Section 3 of the same Rule, speaking of the authority that may be granted to a Commissioner, provides:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 32 <br>Trial by Commissioner<br></center><br>. . . .<br><br>SEC. 3. <i>Order of reference; powers of the commissioner</i>. — When a reference is made, the clerk shall forthwith furnish the commissioner with a copy of the order of reference. The order may specify or limit the powers of the commissioner, and may direct him to report only upon particular issues, or to do or perform particular acts, or to receive and report evidence only, and may fix the date for beginning and closing the hearings and for the filing of his report. Subject to the specifications and limitations stated in the order, the commissioner has and shall exercise the power to regulate the proceedings in every hearing before him and to do all acts and take all measures necessary or proper for the efficient performance of his duties under the order. He may issue subpoenas and subpoenas <i>duces tecum</i>, swear witnesses, and unless otherwise provided in the order of reference, he may rule upon the admissibility of evidence. The trial or hearing before him shall proceed in all respects as it would if held before the court.<br></blockquote>Furthermore, after the hearing before the Commissioner, the Commissioner must file a written report, which may contain his or her factual findings and conclusions of law:<br><blockquote><center>RULE 32 <br>Trial by Commissioner<br></center><br>. . . .<br><br>SEC. 9. <i>Report of commissioner</i>. - Upon the completion of the trial or hearing or proceeding before the commissioner, he shall file with the court his report in writing upon the matters submitted to him by the order of reference. When his powers are not specified or limited, he shall set forth his findings of fact and conclusions of law in his report. He shall attach thereto all exhibits, affidavits, depositions, papers and the transcript, if any, of the testimonial evidence presented before him.<br></blockquote>With respect to the proceedings in the court a quo, the Court of Appeals observed that:<br><blockquote>The report of the commissioner shows clearly that he received and evaluated [respondents'] evidence which were adduced <i>ex parte</i>. His preliminary determination of the just compensation of the property [in] issue would not necessarily render invalid the <i>ex parte</i> proceedings conducted by him. The valuations suggested by the commissioner as just compensation for [respondents'] land that was utilized by [petitioner] were merely recommendatory. The final determination of just compensation was left to the court <i>a quo</i> as it rests within the exclusive domain of the latter. Simply stated, the court <i>a quo</i> was still at liberty to reject or adopt the recommendations of the commissioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> (Emphasis in the original)<br></blockquote>Hence, absent any express limitation in the order of reference, Branch Clerk of Court Arty. Ferdinand S. Arpon, as the court-appointed Commissioner, may make factual findings and recommendations on the valuation of the property. Indeed, the Commissioner's recommendation could have been necessarily rejected had it been an <i>ultra vires</i> act.<br><br>Besides, the proceedings before the Regional Trial Court were not for expropriation—for which petitioner itself claims that there is no need—but were for recovery of just compensation and damages initiated by respondents. Hence, Rule 67, Section 5 on the ascertainment of the just compensation to be paid was no longer applicable. A trial before commissioners, for instance, was dispensable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br><br>In <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> the National Irrigation Administration took possession of the property without the benefit of expropriation proceedings. The property owner subsequently filed a case for recovery of possession or its value and damages. This Court held that Rule 67 presupposes a prior filing of a complaint by the expropriator for eminent domain with the appropriate court. If no such complaint is filed, the expropriator is considered to have violated procedural requirements and, hence, waived the usual procedure prescribed in Rule 67. This includes the appointment of commissioners to ascertain just compensation, thus:<br><blockquote>NIA contends that it was deprived of due process when the trial court determined the compensation due to respondent without the assistance of commissioners. NIA refers to the procedure found in Section 5, Rule 67 of the 1964 Rules of Court applicable at the time[.]<br><br>. . . .<br><br>Rule 67, however, presupposes that NIA exercised its right of eminent domain by filing a complaint for that purpose before the appropriate court. Judicial determination of the propriety of the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the just compensation for the subject property then follows. The proceedings give the property owner the chance to object to the taking of his property and to present evidence on its value and on the consequential damage to other parts of his property.<br><br>Respondent was not given these opportunities, as NIA did not observe the procedure in Rule 67. Worse, NIA refused to pay respondent just compensation. The seizure of ones property without payment, even though intended for public use, is a taking without due process of law and a denial of the equal protection of the laws. NIA, not respondent, transgressed the requirements of due process.<br><br>When a government agency itself violates procedural requirements, it waives the usual procedure prescribed in Rule 67. This Court ruled in the recent case of <b><i>National Power Corporation (NPC) v.

NPC's taking of Pobre's property without filing the appropriate expropriation proceedings and paying him just compensation is a transgression of procedural due process.<br></blockquote>Like in <b><i>NPC</i></b>, the present case is not an action for expropriation. NIA never filed expropriation proceedings although it had ample opportunity to do so. Respondents' complaint is an ordinary civil action for the recovery of possession of the Property or its value, and damages. Under these circumstances, a trial before commissioners is not necessary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> (Emphasis in the original, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>We hold that the non-appointment of three (3) Commissioners in the court a quo does not render infirm the entire proceedings.

"Taking," in the exercise of the power of eminent domain, occurs not only when the government actually deprives or dispossesses the property owner of his property or of its ordinary use, but also when there is a practical destruction or material impairment of the value of his property. Using this standard, there was undoubtedly a taking of the remaining area of Andaya's property. True, no burden was imposed thereon and Andaya still retained title and possession of the property. But, as correctly observed by the Board and affirmed by the courts <i>a quo, the nature and the effect of the Jloodwalls would deprive Andaya of the normal use of the remaining areas.

This is because the National Power Corporation's subterranean intervention prevented the respondents from introducing any developments on the surface and from disposing of the land or any portion of it. Hence, there was a taking of the land as to entitle the owners to just compensation:<br><blockquote>We agree with both the RTC and the CA that there was a full taking on the part of NPC, notwithstanding that the owners were not completely and actually dispossessed. It is settled that the taking of private property for public use, to be compensable, need not be an actual physical taking or appropriation. Indeed, the expropriator's action may be short of acquisition of title, physical possession, or occupancy but may still amount to a taking. Compensable taking includes destruction, restriction, diminution, or interruption of the rights of ownership or of the common and necessary use and enjoyment of the property in a lawful manner, lessening or destroying its value.

In striking down the petitioner's argument and ruling that the property owners were entitled to the full market value of the land in question, the Court ruled that:<br><blockquote>The trial court's observation shared by the appellate court show that "x x x While it is true that plaintiff [is] only after a right-of-way easement, it nevertheless perpetually deprives defendants of their proprietary rights as manifested by the imposition by the plaintiff upon defendants that below said transmission lines no plant higher than three (3) meters is allowed. Furthermore, because of the high-tension current conveyed through said transmission lines, danger to life and limbs that may be caused beneath said wires cannot altogether be discounted, and to cap it all, plaintiff only pays the fee to defendants once, while the latter shall continually- pay the taxes due on said affected portion of their property."<br><br>The foregoing facts considered, the acquisition of the right-of-way easement falls within the purview of the power of eminent domain. Such conclusion finds support in similar cases of easement of right-of-way where the Supreme Court sustained the award of just compensation for private property condemned for public use[.]<br><br>. . . .<br><br>In the case at bar, the easement of right-of-way is definitely a taking under the power of eminent domain.

As the Court held in <i>NPC v. Chiong</i>, it is not improper to assume that NPC will erect structures for its transmission lines within the property.

Roviro</i>, 61 Phil. 137, 139 (1935) [Per J. Imperial, En Banc], the trial court denied the motion for postponement of a hearing on the ground that it was presented out of time and the reason alleged therein was insufficient. This Court affirmed the trial court, thus: "The postponement of the hearing of a case, which had been previously set and of which the parties and their attorneys had already been notified, is not an absolute right of the litigants nor of their attorneys. The granting of a motion for postponement depends entirely upon the discretion of the courts, in the exercise of which all the attending circumstances and the rights of all the parties appearing therein should be taken into account. If the postponement would manifestly prejudice some of the parties, or, if the motion for postponement had been presented too late to prevent them from notifying their witnesses not to appear, thus causing them considerable trouble and expense, as probably would have happened in the present case, it is the duty of the courts to deny it."<br><br>In <i>Macabingkil v.
