Avoiding these expenses would be tantamount to preventing the performance of their functions. Considering the value of these expenses as already included in the concerned personnel's salary would mean that they would then have to exhaust their personal funds, just so they could perform their official functions.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>It is in recognition of these peculiarities that, through Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758, certain specified allowances are permitted to be given, on top of or in addition to standardized salaries. Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6758 provides:<br><br><blockquote>Section 12. Consolidation of Allowances and Compensation. - All allowances, except for representation and transportation allowances; clothing and laundry allowances; subsistence allowance of marine officers and crew on board government vessels and hospital personnel; hazard pay; allowances of foreign service personnel stationed abroad; and such other additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be determined by the [Department of Budget and Management], shall be deemed included in the standardized salary rates herein prescribed. Such other additional compensation, whether in cash or in kind, being received by incumbents only as of July 1, 1989 not integrated into the standardized salary rates shall continue to be authorized.<br><br>Existing additional compensation of any national government official or employee paid from local funds of a local government unit shall be absorbed into the basic salary of said official or employee and shall be paid by the National Government.</blockquote><br><br><i>Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Employees Union </i> expounds on the nature of the exceptional allowances permitted by Section 12, as well as on the significance of the phrase "and such other additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be determined by the [Department of Budget and Management]":<br><br><blockquote>The Court has had the occasion to interpret Sec. 12 of R.A. No. 6758. In <i>National Tobacco Administration v. Commission on Audit, </i>we held that under the first sentence of Section 12, the benefits excluded from the standardized salary rates are the "allowances" or those which are usually granted to officials and employees of the government to defray or reimburse the expenses incurred in the performance of their official functions. These are the RATA, clothing and laundry allowance, subsistence allowance of marine officers and crew on board government vessels and hospital personnel, hazard pay, and others, as enumerated in the first sentence of Section 12. We further ruled that the phrase "and such other additional compensation not otherwise specified herein as may be determined by the DBM" is a catch-all proviso for benefits in the nature of allowances similar to those enumerated. In <i>Philippine Ports Authority v.

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>For its part, Section 2 of Rule X of the Omnibus Rules, implementing Book 5 of the Administrative Code, provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 2. The System is designed to encourage creativity, innovativeness, efficiency, integrity and productivity in the public service by recognizing and rewarding officials and employees, individually or in groups, for their suggestions, inventions, superior accomplishments, and other <i>personal efforts </i>which contribute to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement in government operations, or for other <i>extraordinary acts or services </i>in the public interest. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Respondents are, therefore, correct. There is no room for the Employee Suggestions and Incentive Award System for the indiscriminate grant of an incentive package to all employees, or the en masse payment of the Financial Performance Award, as petitioner did.<br><br>The entire point of the Employee Suggestions and Incentive Award System is the recognition of exemplary <i>personal </i>effort. Contributions beyond the ordinary are its essence. Even as Section 2 of Rule X of the Omnibus Rules implementing Book 5 of the Administrative Code refers to "rewarding officials and employees . . . <i>in groups," </i>the pivotal consideration remains to be innovations or accomplishments of an exceptional nature, that is, those that may be set apart from what the remainder of work force has attained. To use the Employee Suggestions and Incentive Award System to grant incentive packages to all employees (excepting only those with disciplinary liabilities) is to run afoul of its very nature.<br><br><center><b>IV</b></center><br><br>Presidential Decree No. 1445, otherwise known as the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, spells out the rule on general liability for unlawful expenditures:<br><br><blockquote>Section 103. General liability for unlawful expenditures. Expenditures of government funds or uses of government property in violation of law or regulations <i>shall be a personal liability of the official or employee found to be directly responsible therefor.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br><br>Section 19 of Commission on Audit Circular No: 94-001, the Manual of Certificate of Settlement and Balances, spells out the bases for determining the extent of personal liability:<br><br><blockquote>19.1. The liability of public officers and other persons for audit disallowances shall be determined on the basis of: (a) the nature of the disallowance; (b) the duties, responsibilities or obligations of the officers/persons concerned; (c) the extent of their participation or involvement in the disallowed transaction; and (d) the amount of losses or damages suffered by the government thereby. The following are illustrative examples:<br><br>....<br><br><blockquote>19.1.3. Public officers who approve or authorize transactions involving the expenditure of government funds and uses of government properties shall be liable for all losses arising out of their negligence or failure to exercise the diligence of a good father of a family.</blockquote></blockquote><br><br>A public officer's good faith does not dispense with personal liability for unauthorized disbursements. In <i>Vicencio v. Villar:</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Section 103 of P.D. 1445 declares that expenditures of government funds or uses of government property in violation of law or regulations shall be a personal liability of the official or employee found to be directly responsible therefor. The public official's personal liability arises only if the expenditure of government funds was made in violation of law. In this case, petitioner's act of entering into a contract on behalf of the local government unit without the requisite authority therefor was in violation of the Local Government Code. While petitioner may have relied on the opinion of the City Legal Officer, such reliance only serves to buttress his good faith. It does not, however, exculpate him from his personal liability under P.D. 1445.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Nevertheless, in cases involving the disallowance of salaries, emoluments, benefits, and allowances due to government employees, jurisprudence<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[74]</sup></font> has settled that recipients or payees in good faith need not refund these disallowed amounts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> For as long as there is no showing of ill intent and the disbursement was made in good faith, public officers and employees who receive subsequently disallowed benefits or allowances may keep the amounts disbursed to them.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br><br>On the part of the approving officers, they shall only be required to refund if they are found to have acted in bad faith or were grossly negligent amounting to bad faith.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup><br><br><i>Philippine Economic Zone Authority v. Commission on Audit</i><font color="#FF0000"><sup>[78]</sup></font><i> </i> has expounded on good faith in the context of a controversy on the refund of disallowed benefits or allowances:<br><br><blockquote>In common usage, the term "good faith" is ordinarily used to describe that state of mind denoting "honesty of intention, and freedom from knowledge of circumstances which ought to put the holder upon inquiry; an honest intention to abstain from taking any unconscientious advantage of another, even through technicalities of law, together with absence of all information, notice, or benefit or belief of facts which render transaction unconscientious."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Thus, in <i>De Jesus v. Commission on Audit</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Nevertheless, our pronouncement in <i>Blaquera v. Alcala </i>supports petitioners' position on the. refund of the benefits they received. In Blaquera, the officials and employees of several government departments and agencies were paid incentive benefits which the COA disallowed on the ground that Administrative Order No. 29 dated 19 January 1993 prohibited payment of these benefits. While the Court sustained the COA on the disallowance, it nevertheless declared that:<br><br><blockquote>Considering, however, that all the parties here acted in good faith, we cannot countenance the refund of subject incentive benefits for the year 1992, which amounts the petitioners have already received. Indeed, no indicia of bad faith can be detected under the attendant facts and circumstances. The . officials and chiefs of offices concerned disbursed such incentive benefits in the honest belief that the amounts given were due to the recipients and the latter accepted the same, with gratitude, confident that they richly deserve such benefits.</blockquote><br><br>This ruling in Blaquera applies to the instant case. Petitioners here received the additional allowances and bonuses in good faith under the honest belief that LWUA Board Resolution No. 313 authorized such payment. At the time petitioners received the additional allowances and bonuses, the Court had not yet decided <i>Baybay Water District. </i>Petitioners had no knowledge that such payment was without legal basis. Thus, being in good faith, petitioners need not refund the allowances and bonuses they received but disallowed by the COA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Petitioner's Financial Performance Award was written into its Employees Suggestions and Incentive Award System.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> This System was formally approved by the Civil Service Commission in a letter dated October 2, 1993.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> As underscored by petitioner, this letter of approval never indicated any instruction to modify or remove the grant of Financial Performance Award.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> Moreover, in a letter dated June 6, 2006,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> it appeared that Civil Service Commission Director Velda C.
