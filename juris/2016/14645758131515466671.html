				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court (<i>Rules</i>) seeks to declare the illegality and unconstitutionality of the <i>Members' Contribution for Capital Expenditures (MCC)</i>, later renamed as <i>Reinvestment Fund for Sustainable Capital Expenditures (RFSC)</i>, which is being imposed by on-grid Electric Cooperatives (ECs), pursuant to the following Rules and Resolution of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC):<br><br><blockquote>1.

This translates to an average of 22% of the 98 ECs' distribution charges (inclusive of distribution, supply and metering charges). The Members' Contribution for Capital Expenditure Rate Cap was determined by applying the 22% to the respective group's 2008 median operating costs per kWh which was the basis for the ECs' operating revenue requirements.<br><br>The result of the afore-mentioned calculation is presented in Table 7 hereunder:<br><br>TABLE 7.

IT LIKEWISE VIOLATES SECTION 37 OF P.D. 269.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote><br>In a nutshell, the issue for petitioners is not about the nomenclature of MCC/RFSC or how such funds are utilized but in the ERC's treatment of MCC/RFSC as a subsidy/funds for capital expenditures (CAPEX) or contribution in aid of construction (CIAC) instead of patronage capital, which is an equity or investment that must be accounted for and could be withdrawn by the member-consumers upon termination of their contract with respondent ECs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The petition is dismissed. <br><br><i><b>Legal standing of petitioners</b></i><br><br>Petitioners claim that as Board members/officers of the National Alliance for Consumer Empowerment of Electric Cooperatives (NACEELCO) they have the required legal standing to assail the validity of MCC/RFSC imposed by the ECs under the RSEC-WR and Resolution No. 14 issued by the ERC. They also stand to be benefited or injured by the judgment in this suit because they are member-consumers of the ECs who were required to and did pay the MCC/RFSC, as shown by the electric bills appended to the petition. Further, over and above their personal capacity as member-consumers, petitioners, like party-list representatives Briones of AGAP, Payuyo of APEC, and Ping-ay of NATCO, represent their constituents who are paying EC member-consumers in good standing.<br><br>Even assuming that no direct injury is or will continue to be suffered, petitioners contend that the liberal policy consistently adopted by the Court on <i>locus standi</i> must apply. They view that the issues raised in this petition are of paramount public importance as it does not merely involve the constitutionality of MCC/RFSC but also the plight of the member-consumers of ECs nationwide. For them, the transcendental importance of this case cannot simply be ignored as it also involves the economic well-being of more than half of the Philippine population. Two contesting parties are said to be laying claim on the ownership of the ECs, to wit: (1) the persons running the ECs being directly controlled by the NEA, which has not contributed any funds to fund debt-servicing except loan accommodations with high interest rates, and (2) the member-consumers of ECs who have continuously contributed their hard-earned money to fund the operations, cost, and debt-servicing of the ECs.<br><br>Only petitioners Ping-ay and Ramirez satisfy the requirement of <i>locus standi.</i><br><br>Petitioners have no legal standing to file this petition in their capacity as NACEELCO Board members. It was not shown that respondent ECs are members of NACEELCO. Further, while petitioners claim that they represent nine million member-consumers of the ECs, they have not attached to the petition any documentary proof as regards their purported authority to file the case on their behalf.<br><br>Also, petitioners Payuyo and Rosales have no legal standing to file the case as member-consumers of the Palawan Electric Cooperative, Inc. (PALECO) and Agusan Del Norte Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ANECO), respectively.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Even if ANECO is within the coverage of RSEC-WR, it is not impleaded as respondent in the petition. As for PALECO, it is neither a part of any group enumerated in RSEC-WR nor is it impleaded as respondent herein.<br><br>While the Court held that legislators have the standing to maintain inviolate the prerogatives, powers and privileges vested by the Constitution in their office and are allowed to sue to question the validity of any official action which they claim infringes their prerogatives as legislators,<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[9]</sup></font> there was no specific allegation of usurpation of legislative function in this case. Moreover, We do not view that the procedural rules on standing should be waived on the ground that the issues raised in this petition are of transcendental importance. To consider a matter as one of transcendental importance, all of the following must concur: (1) the public character of the funds or other assets involved in the case; (2) the presence of a clear case of disregard of a constitutional or statutory prohibition by the public respondent agency or instrumentality of the government; and (3) the lack of any other party with a more direct and specific interest in the questions being raised.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[10]</sup></font> As will be shown in the discussion below, elements (2) and (3) are obviously lacking in this case.<br><br>The above notwithstanding, petitioners Ping-ay and Ramirez have the legal standing to sue. Ping-ay is a member-consumer of respondent Ilocos Sur Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ISECO).<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> On the other hand, Ramirez is undisputedly the spouse of Mary Ramirez,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> who is the registered member-consumer of respondent Eastern Samar Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ESAMELCO). Mary, who is not one of the petitioners, only needs to be impleaded as a <i>pro-forma</i> party to the suit based on Section 4, Rule 4 of the <i>Rules</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The determination of whether Mary is a party who is indispensable or necessary or neither indispensable nor necessary would no longer matter since, as We said, Ping-ay possesses the required <i>locus standi</i> for the Court to already take cognizance of the case.<br><br><blockquote>It is a general rule that every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party-in-interest, who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit.<br><br>Jurisprudence defines interest as "material interest, an interest in issue and to be affected by the decree, as distinguished from mere interest in the question involved, or a mere incidental interest. By real interest is meant a present substantial interest, as distinguished from a mere expectancy or a future, contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest." "To qualify a person to be a real party-in-interest in whose name an action must be prosecuted, he must appear to be the present real owner of the right sought to be enforced."<br><br>"Legal standing" or<i> locus standi</i> calls for more than just a generalized grievance. The concept has been defined as a personal and substantial interest in the case such that the party has sustained or will sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental act that is being challenged. The gist of the question of standing is whether a party alleges such personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adversencss which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.<br><br>A party challenging the constitutionality of a law, act, or statute must show "not only that the law is invalid, but also that he has sustained or is in immediate, or imminent danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers thereby in some indefinite way." It must shown that he has been, or is about to be, denied some right or privilege to which he is lawfully entitled, or that he is about to be subjected to some burdens or penalties by reason of the statute complained of.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>Tested by the foregoing standards, petitioners Ping-ay and Ramirez clearly have legal standing to file the petition. They are real parties-in-interest to assail the constitutionality and legality of RSEC-WR and Resolution No. 14. Their cause of action to declare invalid the subject Rule and Resolution is related to their right to seek a refund of the payments made and to stop future imposition of the MCC/RFSC.<br><br><i><b>Rule 65 as a Remedy</b></i><br><br>Despite the legal standing of petitioners Ping-ay and Ramirez, their choice of remedy to question the validity of RSEC-WR and Resolution No. 14 is inexcusably inapposite.<br><br>Section 1, Rule 65 of the <i>Rules </i>mandates:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Petition for certiorari</i>. - When any tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of its or his jurisdiction, and there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court, alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered annulling or modifying the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and granting such incidental reliefs as law and justice may require.<br><br>x x x</blockquote><br>The Court agrees with respondents that RSEC-WR and Resolution No. 14 were issued by the ERC in its quasi-legislative power.<br><br><blockquote>A respondent is said to be exercising <i>judicial function </i>where he has the power to determine what the law is and what the legal rights of the parties are, and then undertakes to determine these questions and adjudicate upon the rights of the parties.<br><br><i>Quasi-judicial function</i>, on the other hand, is "a term which applies to the actions, discretion, etc., of public administrative officers or bodies ... required to investigate facts or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, and draw conclusions from them as a basis for their official action and to exercise discretion of a judicial nature."<br><br>Before a tribunal, board, or officer may exercise judicial or quasi-judicial acts, it is necessary that there be a law that gives rise to some specific rights of persons or property under which adverse claims to such rights are made, and the controversy ensuing therefrom is brought before a tribunal, board, or officer clothed with power and authority to determine the law and adjudicate the respective rights of the contending parties.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></blockquote><br>As defined above, the ERC exercised neither judicial nor quasi-judicial function. In issuing and implementing the RSEC-WR and Resolution No. 14, it was not called upon to adjudicate the rights of contending parties to exercise, in any manner, discretion of a judicial or quasi-judicial nature. Instead, RSEC-WR and Resolution No. 14 were done in the exercise of the ERC's quasi-legislative and administrative functions. It was in the nature of subordinate legislation, promulgated in the exercise of its delegated power. Quasi-legislative power is exercised by administrative agencies through the promulgation of rules and regulations within the confines of the granting statute and the doctrine of non-delegation of powers flowing from the separation of the branches of the government.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Particularly, the ERC applied its rule-making power as expressly granted by Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9136 ("Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001" or EPIRA), to wit:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 43. <i>Functions of the ERC.</i> - The ERC shall xxx be responsible for the following key functions in the restructured industry:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>f. <u><b>In the public interest, establish and enforce a methodology for setting transmission and distribution wheeling rates and retail rates for the captive market of a distribution utility</b></u>, taking into account all relevant considerations, including the efficiency or inefficiency of the regulated entities. The rates must be such as to allow the recovery of just and reasonable costs and a reasonable return on rate base (RORB) to enable the entity to operate viably. The ERC may adopt alternative forms of internationally-accepted rate-setting methodology as it may deem appropriate. The rate-setting methodology so adopted and applied must ensure a reasonable price of electricity. The rates prescribed shall be non-discriminatory. To achieve this objective and to ensure the complete removal of cross subsidies, the cap on the recoverable rate of system losses prescribed in Section 10 of Republic Act No. 7832, is hereby amended and shall be replaced by caps which shall be determined by the ERC" based on load density, sales mix, cost of service, delivery voltage and other technical considerations it may promulgate. The ERC shall determine such form of rate-setting methodology, which shall promote efficiency. In case the rate setting methodology used is RORB, it shall be subject to the following guidelines:<br><br><blockquote>(i) For purposes of determining the rate base, the TRANSCO or any distribution utility may be allowed to revalue its eligible assets not more than once every three (3) years by an independent appraisal company: Provided, however, That ERC may give an exemption in case of unusual devaluation: Provided, further, That the ERC shall exert efforts to minimize price shocks in order to protect the consumers;<br><br>(ii) Interest expenses are not allowable deductions from permissible return on rate base;<br><br>(iii) In determining eligible cost of services that will be passed on to the end-users, the ERC shall establish minimum efficiency performance standards for the TRANSCO and distribution utilities including systems losses, interruption frequency rates, and collection efficiency;<br><br>(iv.) Further, in determining rate base, the TRANSCO or any distribution utility shall not be allowed to include management inefficiencies like cost of project delays not excused by force majeure, penalties and related interest during construction applicable to these unexcused delays; and<br><br>(v.) <u><b>Any significant</b></u> operating costs or <u><b>project investments of the</b></u> TRANSCO and distribution utilities which <u><b>shall become part of the rate base</b></u> shall be subject to verification by the ERC to ensure that the contracting and procurement of the equipment, assets and services have been subjected to transparent and accepted industry procurement and purchasing practices to protect the public interest. (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>Granting <i>arguendo</i>, that the MCC/RFSC imposition is in the exercise of the ERC's quasi-judicial function, still, the petition should have been filed before the Court of Appeals, which may entertain a petition for <i>certiorari</i> whether or not the same is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. Indeed, petitioners violated the principle of hierarchy of courts. As We said in one case:<br><br><blockquote>xxx The petitioners appear to have forgotten that the Supreme Court is a court of last resort, not a court of first instance. The hierarchy of courts should serve as a general determinant of the appropriate forum for Rule 65 petitions. The concurrence of jurisdiction among the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals and the Regional Trial Courts to issue writs of <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, <i>mandamus, quo warranto, habeas corpus</i> and injunction does not give the petitioners the unrestricted freedom of choice of forum. By directly filing Rule 65 petitions before us, the petitioners have unduly taxed the Court's time and attention which are better devoted to matters within our exclusive jurisdiction. Worse, the petitioners only contributed to the overcrowding of the Court's docket. We also wish to emphasize that the trial court is better equipped to resolve cases of this nature since this Court is not a trier of facts and does not normally undertake an examination of the contending parties' evidence.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote><br>Since the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court have original concurrent jurisdiction over petitions for <i>certiorari</i>, the rule on hierarchy of courts determines the venue of recourses to these courts. In original petitions for <i>certiorari</i>, this Court will not directly entertain special civil action unless the redress desired cannot be obtained elsewhere based on exceptional and compelling circumstances to justify immediate resort to this Court,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> which We found none in the present case that likewise involves factual questions. Time and again, it has been held that this Court is not a trier of fact.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Glaringly, petitioners did not comply with the rule that "<i>there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. </i>" Since petitioners assail the validity of the ERC issuances and seeks to declare them as unconstitutional, a petition for declaratory relief under Rule 63 of the<i> Rules</i> is the appropriate remedy. Under the Rules, any person whose rights are affected by any other governmental regulation may, before breach or violation thereof, bring an action in the appropriate Regional Trial Court to determine any question of construction or validity arising, and for a declaration of his rights or duties, thereunder.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Noticeably, administrative remedies should have been exhausted by filing the case in the ERC, which, has technical expertise, at the very least, to dwell on the issue. Considering that petitioners are challenging the MCC/RFSC, which is a rate component under the RSEC-WR, the original and exclusive jurisdiction is vested with the ERC, pursuant to Section 43 of R.A. No. 9136, which states:<br><br><blockquote>SEC. 43.<i> Functions of the ERC</i>. - The ERC shall xxx be responsible for the following key functions in the restructured industry:<br><br><blockquote>x x x x<br><br>u. <u><b>The ERC shall have the original and exclusive jurisdiction over all cases contesting rates</b></u>, fees, fines and penalties <u><b>imposed by the ERC in the exercise of the abovementioned powers, functions and responsibilities</b></u> and over all cases involving disputes between and among participants or players in the energy sector. (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>All actions taken by the ERC, pursuant to R.A. No. 9136, are subject to judicial review. As an independent quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions, its judgment, final order or resolution is appealable to the Court of Appeals <i>via</i> Rule 43 of the <i>Rules,</i> and, if still unfavorable, to this Court <i>via</i> Rule 65.<br><br>The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is a cornerstone of our judicial system.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> As opined in a case:<br><br><blockquote>The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies allows administrative agencies to carry out their functions and discharge their responsibilities within the specialized areas of their respective competence. The doctrine entails lesser expenses and provides for the speedier resolution of controversies. Therefore, direct recourse to the trial court, when administrative remedies are available, is a ground for dismissal of the action.<br></blockquote><blockquote>The doctrine, however, is not without exceptions. Among the exceptions are: (1) where there is <i>estoppel</i> on the part of the party invoking the doctrine; (2) where the challenged administrative act is patently illegal, amounting to lack of jurisdiction; (3) where there is unreasonable delay or official inaction that will irretrievably prejudice the complainant; (4) where the amount involved is relatively so small as to make the rule impractical and oppressive; (5) where the question involved is purely legal and will ultimately have to be decided by the courts of justice; (6) where judicial intervention is urgent; (7) where the application of the doctrine may cause great and irreparable damage; (8) where the controverted acts violate due process; (9) where the issue of non-exhaustion of administrative remedies had been rendered moot; (10) where there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy; (11) where strong public interest is involved; and (12) in<i> quo warranto </i>proceedings.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote><br>Assuming, for argument's sake, that this case falls under any of the recognized exceptions, just the same, the petition must be dismissed for being filed out of time. Under the <i>Rules,</i> a petition for <i>certiorari</i> should be filed not later than sixty (60) days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution sought to be assailed. In this case, Resolution No. 20, which adopted the RSEC-WR, and Resolution No. 14 were issued by the ERC on September 23, 2009 and July 6, 2011, respectively. The petition was filed only on May 31, 2012, which is manifestly way beyond the reglementary period.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>It is significant to note that, in drafting RSEC-WR, the ERC conducted a series of expository hearings and public consultations for all ECs in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, and that it was only after taking into account the various manifestations, comments, and oppositions during the public consultations that a new methodology for setting the ECs' wheeling rates was developed. The <i>Whereas </i>clauses of Resolution No. 20 narrated this long and tedious process:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREAS</b>, the current rates of ECs are no longer responsive since the costs of providing electric service to the consumers increased significantly from the time their rates were determined by the Commission based on 2000 test year;<br><br><b>WHEREAS</b>, the ECs are cognizant of the inherent regulatory lag in the current cash flow rate-setting methodology adopted through a quasi-judicial process which is further exacerbated by the fact that if all the one hundred twenty (120) ECs file their respective rate applications with each application to the resolved in one (1) month, it will take the Commission one hundred twenty (120) months or ten (10) years, to resolved all the applications;<br><br><b>WHEREAS</b>, the Commission has conducted studies to establish a new rate-setting methodology for ECs that will address their present problems and resolve the regulatory lag in the resolution of rate applications, particularly, the "Benchmarking Methodology";<br><br><b>WHEREAS</b>, the results of said "Benchmarking Methodology" studies were subjected to several expository and public consultations which were held on various dates and venues.

The records of this case, voluminous as it is, is bereft of evidence that they did.<br><br>Finally, it bears to stress that a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 is the proper remedy when the respondent has committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<br><br><blockquote>The term "grave abuse of discretion" has a specific meaning. An act of a court or tribunal can only be considered as with grave abuse of discretion when such act is done in a "capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction." The abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an "evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility." Furthermore, the use of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is restricted only to "truly extraordinary cases wherein the act of the lower court or quasi-judicial body is wholly void.<br>x x x<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></blockquote><br>The stringent criterion imposed by the above-quoted precludes Us from giving due course to this petition. The ERC rests on solid legal grounds as it is indubitably empowered to establish and enforce a methodology for setting the distribution wheeling rates of respondent ECs. The delegation of legislative powers by the Congress to the ERC is explicit in Section 43 (f) and (u) of R.A. No. 9136, which is elaborated in Section 5 (a), Rule 15 and Section 4 (n), Rule 3, respectively, of the IRR; hence, the presumption of regularity of MCC/RFSC must be upheld.<br><br>As a new regulatory framework for the on-grid<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> ECs, RSEC-WR is designed to achieve the following:<br><br><blockquote>1. Develop a tariff setting methodology that would be more responsive to the needs of the ECs given the objectives of the EP1RA;<br><br>2. Encourage reforms in the structure and operations of the ECs for greater efficiency and lower costs;<br><br>3.
