				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On June 9, 2010, Congress, in joint session assembled and sitting as the National Board of Canvassers (NBOC), proclaimed protestee Jejomar C. Binay as the Vice President duly elected in the May 10, 2010 National and Local Elections after garnering 14,645,574 votes. Protestant Manuel A. Roxas came in second with 13,918,490 votes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> or a margin of 727,084 votes in favor of the protestee.<br><br>On July 9, 2010, the protestant initiated this protest,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> whereby he prayed as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, protestant respectfully prays that the Honorable Tribunal:<br><ol><li>Immediately upon the filing of the instant Protest, ISSUE a Precautionary Protection Order;<br><blockquote><ol type="a"><li>DIRECTING all City/Municipal Treasurers, Regional Election Directors, Provincial Election Supervisors, Election Officers, responsible personnel and custodians nationwide to take immediate steps and measures to safeguard the integrity of all ballot boxes and their contents, lists of voters with voting records, books of voters, audit logs, statistics report and any and all other documents or paraphernalia used in the 10 May 2010 elections, as well as data storage devices containing electronic data evidencing the conduct and the results of elections in all contested clustered precincts nationwide;

Pardo (Ret) as the hearing commissioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> However, because the parties were unable to agree on the common issues, as well as on the procedure to expedite the proceedings at said preliminary conference, Justice Pardo advised them to file their respective desired motions with the Tribunal, including those for the deferment of the retrieval of ballot boxes, and for the disposition of threshold issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On September 24, 2012, the Tribunal held another preliminary conference<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> in order to thresh out the various motions and requests filed by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, the Tribunal received the letter<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> from Executive Director Jose M. Tolentino, Jr. of the Project Management Office (PMO) of the COMELEC requesting authority to conduct the mandatory Hardware Acceptance Test (HAT) of the PCOS Machines and other IT equipment for use during the May 13, 2013 Synchronized Automated National, Local and ARMM Regional Elections. After hearing the concerned parties, the Tribunal granted the request subject to certain conditions stated in the resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Consequently, the COMELEC issued Resolution No. 13-0135,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> whereby it scheduled the retrieval of the ballot boxes for use in the May 13, 2013 National and Local Elections to commence on February 19, 2013 until March 15, 2013.<br><br>Anent the submission of inventory reports by the retrieval committees, the Chief Justice issued an order dated March 26, 2013<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> modifying the Guidelines on the Retrieval of Ballot Boxes for the August 8, 2011 ARMM Elections. The Tribunal ratified the order dated March 26, 2013 on April 2, 2013.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Noting that the parties had filed their certificates of candidacy for the Presidency in the May 9, 2016 National and Local Elections, the Tribunal directed them to move in the premises<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> by expressing their interest in pursuing the case. Neither of the parties has complied with the directive as of date.<br><br>In view of the holding of the May 9, 2016 National and Local Elections, and in response to the letter request<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> of COMELEC Executive Director Tolentino for the lifting of the PPO, the Tribunal lifted the PPO on February 23, 2016.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>After the holding of the National and Local Elections on May 9, 2016, the Philippines elected a new set of national and local officials. On May 30, 2016, the NBOC officially proclaimed Rodrigo R. Duterte as the newly elected President of the Philippines, and Ma. Leonor G. Robredo as the newly elected Vice President of the Philippines. Both of them took their respective oaths of office and assumed office at noon of June 30, 2016.<br><br>The term of the office of Vice President being contested by the parties had expired at noon of June 30, 2016. Vice President Robredo has assumed the office thereby contested. Clearly, the protest and the counter-protest that are the subject matter of this case have become moot and academic. As such, the Tribunal is constrained to dismiss the protest and the counter-protest. It is settled rule that the Tribunal should not anymore proceed in this case because any decision that may be rendered hereon will have no practical or useful purpose, and cannot be enforced.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Proceeding in this case until its resolution will then be an exercise in futility considering that there is no longer any practical reason why the Tribunal should still determine who had won as Vice President in the 2010 National and Local Elections if the term of such office had already expired.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Tribunal <b>DISMISSES</b> the protest filed by protestant Manuel A. Roxas, and the counter-protest filed by protestee Jejomar C. Binay on the ground of mootness.<br><br>No pronouncement on costs of suit.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Sereno, C.
