Revilla's PDAF through: (1) the commencement <i>via</i> "business propositions" with the legislator regarding his allocated PDAF; (2) the creation and operation of JLN-controlled NGOs to serve as "conduits" for "ghost" PDAF-funded projects; (3) the use of spurious receipts and liquidation documents to make it appear that the projects were implemented by her NGOs; (4) the falsification and machinations used in securing funds from the various implementing agencies (IAs) and in liquidating disbursements; and (5) the remittance of Sen. Revilla's PDAF for misappropriation;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>(<i>d</i>) <b>Lim</b> and <b>De Asis</b>, as staff employees of Napoles, for assisting in the fraudulent processing and releasing of the PDAF funds to the JLN­-controlled NGOs<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> through, among others, their designation as Presidents/Incorporators<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of JLN-controlled NGOs, namely, <i>Kaupdanan Para sa Mangunguma Foundation, Inc.</i> (KPMFI)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and <i>Ginintuang Alay sa Magsasaka Foundation, Inc.</i> (GAMFI),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> respectively, and for eventually remitting the PDAF funds to Napoles's control;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and<br><br>(<i>e</i>) <b>Relampagos, Nuñez, Paule</b>, and <b>Bare</b> (Relampagos, <i>et al.</i>), as employees of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), for participating in the misuse or diversion of Sen.

Revilla's PDAF.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>As alleged, the PDAF scheme commences with Napoles meeting with a legislator - in this case, Sen. Revilla - with the former giving an offer to "acquire" his PDAF allocation in exchange for a "commission" or "kickback" amounting to a certain percentage of the PDAF.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Upon their agreement on the conditions of the PDAF acquisition, including the project for which the PDAF will be utilized, the corresponding IA tasked to implement the same, and the legislator's "commission" or "kickback" ranging from 40-60% of either the project cost or the amount stated in the SARO,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> the legislator would then write a letter addressed to the Senate President for the immediate release of his PDAF, who in turn, will endorse such request to the DBM for the release of the SARO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> By this time, the initial advance portion of the "commission" would be remitted by Napoles to the legislator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Upon release of the SARO, Napoles would then direct her staff - including whistleblowers Benhur Luy (Luy), Marina Sula (Sula), and Merlina Suñas (Suñas) to prepare PDAF documents containing, <i>inter alia</i>, the preferred JLN-controlled NGO that will be used as a "conduit" for the implementation of the project, the project proposals of the identified NGO, and the endorsement letters to be signed by the legislator and/or his staff, all for the approval of the legislator;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> and would remit the remaining portion or balance of the "commission" of the legislator, which is usually delivered by her staff, Lim and De Asis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Once the documents are approved, the same would be transmitted to the IA which would handle the preparation of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to be executed by the legislator's office, the IA, and the chosen NGO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Thereafter, the DBM would release the NCA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> to the IA concerned, the head/official of which, in turn, would expedite the transaction and release of the corresponding check representing the PDAF disbursement, in exchange for a ten percent (10%) share in the project cost.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Among those tasked by Napoles to pick up the checks and deposit them to the bank accounts of the NGO concerned were Luy, Suñas, and De Asis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Once the funds are in the account of the JLN-controlled NGO, Napoles would then call the bank to facilitate the withdrawal thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Upon withdrawal of the said funds by Napoles's staff, the latter would bring the proceeds to the office of JLN Corporation for accounting.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Napoles would then decide how much will be left in the office and how much will be brought to her residence in Taguig City. De Asis, Lim, Luy, and Suñas were the ones instructed to deliver the money to Napoles's residence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Finally, to liquidate the disbursements, Napoles and her staff would manufacture fictitious lists of beneficiaries, liquidation reports, inspection reports, project activity reports, and similar documents that would make it appear that the PDAF-funded projects were implemented when, in fact, they were not since they were actually inexistent or, in other words, "ghost" projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Under this <i><i>modus operandi</i></i>, Sen. Revilla, with the help of petitioners, among others, allegedly funneled his PDAF amounting to around P517,000,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> to the JLN-controlled NGOs and, in return, received "commissions" or "kickbacks" amounting to at least P224,512,500.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In the Orders dated November 19, 2013<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and November 29, 2013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> the Ombudsman directed petitioners, along with several others, to submit their respective counter-affidavits, to which petitioners complied with, except for Napoles and Lim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In his defense, Revilla filed his Counter-Affidavit dated January 16, 2014, contending that: (<i>a</i>) his and Cambe's signatures in the PDAF documents were forgeries; (<i>b</i>) the utilization of his PDAF had "always been regular and above-board"; (<i>c</i>) his involvement in the release of his PDAF is limited; and (<i>d</i>) there is "no credible proof" to show that he committed said illegal acts and that conspiracy exists between him and all the other persons involved in the PDAF scam.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Cambe, on the other hand, filed his Counter-Affidavit dated January 20, 2014 and Supplemental Counter-Affidavit dated March 12, 2014, maintaining that: (<i>a</i>) his signatures in the PDAF documents were all forgeries; and (<i>b</i>) he did not receive any money from Sen. Revilla's PDAF nor connive with any of the alleged co-conspirators to acquire ill-gotten wealth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>For his part, De Asis filed his Counter-Affidavit dated January 16, 2014, admitting that: (<i>a</i>) he was an employee of the JLN Corporation; (<i>b</i>) he did pick up checks for JLN-controlled NGOs; and (<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) he was an incorporator in one of the JLN-controlled NGOs; but denying that he personally benefited from the supposed misuse of Sen. Revilla's PDAF.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, Relampagos, <i>et al.</i>, in their separate Counter-Affidavits dated December 13, 2013, contended that: (<i>a</i>) there is no probable cause and factual or legal basis to indict them for the offenses charged; and (<i>b</i>) the criminal complaints did not specifically mention their names as among those who allegedly participated in the misuse of Sen. Revilla's PDAF.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>Pending resolution of the Ombudsman cases, Sen. Revilla and Cambe separately moved for the suspension of the preliminary investigation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> on the criminal complaints, which were, however, denied by the Ombudsman in a Joint Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> dated January 28, 2014, holding that no prejudicial question exists to warrant the suspension of the preliminary investigation proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Cambe filed another motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> to suspend proceedings of the preliminary investigation, claiming that the filing of the criminal complaints was premature since the Commission on Audit (COA) had yet to issue an Order of Execution in relation to the Notices of Disallowance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> (NDs) against Sen. Revilla's Office, docketed as Special Audits Office (SAO) ND Nos. NLDC-2014-013-PDAF(07-09) to 020-PDAF(07-09). The said motion was, again, denied by the Ombudsman in a Joint Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> dated March 14, 2014 (March 14, 2014 Joint Order). Thus, Cambe elevated the matter to this Court <i>via</i> a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, docketed as <b>G.R. Nos. 212014-15</b>.<br><br>Meantime, Sen. Revilla filed a Motion to be Furnished Copies of Motions, Pleadings, and Other Submissions (Motion to be Furnished),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> praying that he be furnished with copies of all the counter-affidavits filed by the parties in this case, which was denied by the Ombudsman in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> dated March 11, 2014. His motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> thereof was likewise denied by the Ombudsman in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> dated March 27, 2014.<br><br>Sen. Revilla likewise filed a Motion for Voluntary Inhibition (Of the Special Panel of Investigators),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> which was also denied by the Ombudsman in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> dated March 7, 2014. His motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> thereof was further denied in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> dated May 9, 2014.<br><br>In a Joint Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> dated March 28, 2014 (March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution), the Ombudsman found probable cause to indict, among others, petitioners Sen. Revilla, Cambe, Napoles, De Asis, and Lim of one (1) count of Plunder,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> and all the petitioners (along with several others), except Lim, of sixteen (16) counts of violation of Section3 (e) of RA 3019.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup><br><br>The Ombudsman found that the diversion and/or misuse of Sen. Revilla's PDAF was coursed through a complex scheme involving various participants from Sen. Revilla's Office, the DBM, the IAs, and the JLN­-controlled NGOs. The Ombudsman then went on to conclude that through the said scheme, they were able to siphon out government funds in the aggregate amount of P517,000,000.00, with at least P224,512,500.00 received by Sen. Revilla.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>Thus, the Ombudsman held that probable cause exists against Sen. Revilla, Cambe, Napoles, De Asis, and Lim for Plunder, considering that: (<i>a</i>) Sen. Revilla was a public officer at the time material to the charges; (<i>b</i>) with the help of his co-accused, who are public officers and private individuals, Sen. Revilla amassed, accumulated, or acquired ill-gotten wealth through their intricate <i><i>modus operandi</i></i> as described above; and (<i>c</i>) such ill-gotten wealth amounted to at least P224,512,500.00,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> way more than the threshold amount of P50,000,000.00 required in the crime of Plunder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>In the same manner, the Ombudsman established probable cause to indict all the petitioners (along with several others), except Lim, for violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 in light of the following: (<i>a</i>) Sen. Revilla, Cambe, and Relampagos, <i>et al.</i> are all public officers, while private individuals Napoles and De Asis all conspired with these public officers; (<i>b</i>) said public officers exhibited manifest partiality to Napoles and her cohorts by favoring her controlled NGOs without the benefit of public bidding and without having been authorized by an appropriation law or ordinance, as legally mandated; (<i>c</i>) said public officers likewise exhibited their bad faith by unduly benefiting from the "ghost" PDAF-funded projects through the receipt of "commissions," "kickbacks," and the like; and (<i>d</i>) their collective acts caused undue injury to the government in the aggregate amount of P517,000,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Aggrieved, all the petitioners separately moved for the reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> of the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution. Specifically, Sen. Revilla, in his motion for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> pointed out that the Ombudsman's use of the counter-affidavits, which documents he prayed to be furnished with in his denied Motion to be Furnished, was a grave violation of his constitutionally guaranteed right to due process.<br><br>Pending resolution of the aforesaid motions for reconsideration, the Ombudsman issued a Joint Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> dated May 7, 2014 granting Sen. Revilla's Motion to be Furnished, but only with respect to the counter-­affidavits of his six (6) co-respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> He was also directed to file his comment thereon. Dissatisfied, Sen. Revilla then filed an Omnibus Motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> dated May 13,2014 praying for the: (<i>a</i>) partial reconsideration of the May 7, 2014 Joint Order; (<i>b</i>) recall of the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution; and (<i>c</i>) re-conduct of the preliminary investigation and reconstitution of another special panel of investigators.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> The said Omnibus Motion having been denied by the Ombudsman in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> dated May 15, 2014, Sen. Revilla elevated the matter to this Court <i>via</i> a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, docketed as <b>G.R. Nos. 212427-28</b>.<br><br>On June 4, 2014, the Ombudsman issued a Joint Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> (June 4, 2014 Joint Order) denying petitioners' motions for reconsideration for lack of merit and, thereby, affirming the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution with minor modifications to correct clerical errors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> These Ombudsman's issuances led to the filing of <i>certiorari</i> petitions before this Court, docketed as <b>G.R.

In particular, Cambe seeks to annul and set aside the Ombudsman's March 14, 2014 Joint Order which denied his motion to suspend proceedings, arguing that the COA's issuance of an Order of Execution is a condition precedent to the filing of the criminal complaints against him. This relates to the twelve (12) NDs received by the Office of Sen. Revilla on January 14, 2014 and February 4, 2014 pertaining to expenditures charged against his PDAF during the period 2007 to 2009, docketed as SAO ND Nos.

Revilla in relation to the COA's audit is clearly separate and distinct from the criminal aspect covering the charges of Plunder and/or of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 against them. Hence, the incidents related to it should have no effect on the filing of the latter. In <i>Villaseñor v. Sandiganbayan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> this Court explained that:<br><blockquote>[T]here are three kinds of remedies that are available against a public officer for impropriety in the performance of his powers and the discharge of his duties: (1) civil, (2) criminal, and (3) administrative <b><u>[and that] [t]hese remedies may be invoked separately, alternately, simultaneously or successively</u></b>. Sometimes, the same offense may be the subject of all three kinds of remedies.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It is clear, then, that criminal and administrative cases are distinct from each other. The settled rule is that criminal and civil cases are altogether different from administrative matters, such that the first two will not inevitably govern or affect the third and vice versa. <b><u>Verily, administrative cases may proceed independently of criminal proceedings.</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup><br></blockquote>In <i>Reyna v.

As worded, the provision only accounts for the possibility of the filing of criminal charges upon referral of the audit findings to the Ombudsman:<br><blockquote>Section 6. <i>Referral to the Ombudsman</i>. - The Auditor shall report to his Director all instances of failure or refusal to comply with the decisions or orders of the Commission contemplated in the preceding sections. The COA Director shall see to it that the report is supported by the sworn statement of the Auditor concerned, identifying among others, the persons liable and describing the participation of each. He shall then refer the matter to the Legal Services Sector who shall refer the matter to the Office of the Ombudsman or other appropriate office for the possible filing of appropriate administrative or criminal action.<br></blockquote>Nowhere does the provision state any delimitation or precondition to the filing of such criminal charges. As correctly pointed out by the Ombudsman, "an audit disallowance may not necessarily result in the imposition of disciplinary sanctions or criminal prosecution of the responsible persons. Conversely, therefore, an administrative or criminal case may prosper even without an audit disallowance. Verily, Rule XIII, Section 6 is consistent with the ruling in [<i>Reyna</i>] that a proceeding involving an audit disallowance is distinct and separate from a preliminary investigation or a disciplinary complaint."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>In fine, the Ombudsman did not gravely abuse its discretion in promulgating its March 14, 2014 Joint Order which denied Cambe's motion to suspend proceedings.

Probable Cause Against Sen. Revilla.</u></b><br></center><br>First, in <b>G.R. Nos. 212694-95</b>, Sen. Revilla seeks to annul the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution and the June 4, 2014 Joint Order of the Ombudsman finding probable cause against him for the crimes charged, Among others, Sen. Revilla faults the Ombudsman for allegedly disregarding his defense of forgery, and further contends that in the absence of other competent testimony, the Ombudsman cannot consider the whistleblowers' testimonies who purportedly were his co-conspirators in the PDAF scam, pursuant to the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule.<br><br>The petition holds no water.<br><br>The finding of probable cause against Sen. Revilla is amply supported by the evidence on record. At the forefront are the <b>PDAF documents</b>, consisting of the written endorsements signed by Sen. Revilla<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[123]</sup> himself requesting the IAs to release his PDAF funds to the identified JLN­-controlled NGOs, as well as other documents that made possible the processing of his PDAF, <i>e.g.</i>, the MOAs executed by the legislator's office, the IA, and the chosen NGO. All these documents - even those not actually signed by Sen. Revilla - directly implicate him for the crimes charged, as they were nonetheless, all issued under the authority of his Office as Senator of the Republic of the Philippines. In <i>Belgica v. Ochoa</i> (<i>Belgica</i>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[124]</sup> this Court observed that "the defining feature of all forms of Congressional Pork Barrel would be the authority of legislators to participate in the post­-enactment phases of project implementation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[125]</sup> "At its core, legislators ­ may it be through project lists, prior consultations or program menus - have been consistently accorded post-enactment authority to identify the projects they desire to be funded through various Congressional Pork Barrel allocations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[126]</sup> It is through this mechanism that individual legislators, such as Sen. Revilla, were able to practically dictate the entire expenditure of the PDAF allocated to their offices throughout the years.<br><br>In particular, the Ombudsman details that "the NGO endorsed by the legislator would be among those organized and controlled by Napoles. In fact, these NGOs were specifically set by Napoles for the x x x purpose [of having the PDAF funds released]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[127]</sup> Napoles's staff would then "prepare the PDAF documents for the approval of the legislator and reflecting the preferred NGO to implement the undertaking."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[128]</sup> These documents "are transmitted to the IA which, in turn, handles the preparation of the MOA relating to the project, to be executed by the legislator's office, the IA[,] and the NGO concerned." "The projects are authorized as eligible under the DBM's menu for pork barrel allocations. <b><u>[However,] [i]t bears noting that the NGO is directly endorsed by the legislator [and that] [n]o public bidding or negotiated procurement [took] place.</u></b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[129]</sup> As such, there was a defiance of Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB) Resolution No. 012-2007 which states that:<br><blockquote>4.1 When an appropriation law or ordinance specifically earmarks an amount for projects to be specifically contracted out to NGOs, <b><i><u>the procuring entity may select an NGO through competitive bidding or negotiated procurement under Section 53[(j)] of the [IRR-A]</u></i></b>.

Revilla's claim that his signatures in the documentary evidence presented were forged, it must be emphasized that "<b><u>the findings of the x x x prosecutor [on the issue of forgery] should be ventilated in a full-blown trial</u></b>[.] [This] is highlighted by the reality that the authenticity of a questioned signature cannot be determined solely upon its general characteristics, or its similarities or dissimilarities with the genuine signature. <b><u>The duty to determine the authenticity of a signature rests on the judge who must conduct an independent examination of the signature itself in order to arrive at a reasonable conclusion as to its authenticity.</u></b> [As such], Section 22 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Court explicitly authorizes the court, by itself, to make a comparison of the disputed handwriting with writings admitted or treated as genuine by the party against whom the evidence is offered, or proved to be genuine."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[130]</sup> Accordingly, Sen. Revilla's evidence of forgery, including the findings of his purported handwriting experts, Rogelio G. Azores (Azores)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup> and Forensic Document Examiner Atty. Desiderio A. Pagui, (Pagui)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> cannot be readily credited at this stage of the proceedings.<br><br>Besides, the Ombudsman aptly observed that Azores and Pagui admittedly used mere photocopies of the PDAF documents in their handwriting analyses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup> In <i>Heirs of Gregorio v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> this Court ruled that "[w]ithout the original document containing the alleged forged signature, one cannot make a definitive comparison which would establish forgery," and that "[a] comparison based on a mere [photo] copy or reproduction of the document under controversy cannot produce reliable results."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> Furthermore, it may not be amiss to state that the credibility of Azores and Pagui as handwriting experts has yet to be tested. They still have to authenticate their findings and be subjected to cross-examination. Without a doubt, the prosecution should also be given a chance to properly contest Azores and Pagui's findings with evidence of its own. It could all too well present its own handwriting experts during trial to rebut such findings.<br><br>It is significant to emphasize that the Ombudsman had thoroughly passed upon the veracity of Sen. Revilla's signatures on the PDAF documents. As explicitly stated in the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution: "[a]t all events, the Special Panel members, <b>after a <i>prima facie</i> comparison with their naked eyes of the questioned signatures appearing in the PDAF documents and the original signatures of [Sen.] Revilla and Cambe in their respective counter-affidavits</b>, opine that <b><u>both sets of signatures, which bear the same style and flourish, were written by one and the same hands</u></b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> Verily, the Ombudsman's own factual finding on the absence of forgery, at least for the purpose of determining probable cause, should be regarded with utmost respect. "<b>[F]indings of fact by the Office of the Ombudsman are conclusive when supported by substantial evidence</b>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup> as in this case.<br><br>The Ombudsman's finding on the absence of forgery furthr gains credence in light of the <b><u>July 20, 2011 Letter</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup> <b><u>signed by Sen. Revilla submitted to the COA (Confirmation Letter)</u></b>. The letter evinces on its face that Sen.

Revilla's Office because it was issued Bar code/Reference No. 0-2011-13079.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup><br><br>At this juncture, it deserves mentioning that while Luy indeed admitted that there were times that the whistleblowers would forge the signatures of the legislators in the PDAF documents, he, however, <b><u>explicitly qualified</u></b> that such forgeries were made "<b><i>[w]ith the approval of Ms. Napoles kasi sila po ang nag-uusap</i></b>":<br><blockquote>Sen.

It is not difficult to discern that this authorization allows for a more expedient processing of PDAF funds since the documents required for their release need not pass through the legislator's respective offices. It is also apparent that this grant of authority gives the legislators room for plausible deniability: the forging of signatures may serve as a security measure for legislators to disclaim their participation in the event of discovery. Therefore, Luy's testimony completely makes sense as to why the legislators would agree to authorize Napoles and her staff to forge their signatures. As such, even if it is assumed that the signatures were forged, it does not mean that the legislators did not authorize such forgery.<br><br>The <b>testimonies of the whistleblowers</b> which the prosecution submitted before the Ombudsman - are, in fact, the most integral evidence against Sen. Revilla, since they provide a detailed account on the inner workings of the PDAF scam to which Sen. Revilla was directly involved. It should be pointed out that, of all the Senators, only the Offices of Sen. Revilla, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile (Sen. Enrile), and Sen. Jinggoy, Estrada (Sen. Estrada) were explicitly implicated<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> to have dealt with Napols in the plunder of their PDAF. Also, it is apparent that whistleblowers Suñas, Sula, and Luy had personal knowledge of the conspiracy since they were employees of JLN Corporation - the epicenter of the entire PDAF operation and in their respective capacities, were individually tasked by N&amp;poles to prepare the pertinent documents, liquidate the financial transactions, follow up the release of the NCAs with the DBM, and/or facilitate the withdrawal of PDAF funds deposited in the NGOs' accounts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup><br><br>Among others, it is interesting to note that, as per Luy's testimony, Sen. Revilla was given his own codename, same as the other involved legislators with whom Napoles transacted with:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">58.</div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"> T: <em>Maaari mo bang linawin itong sinasabi mong</em> "codename"?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify">S: <em>Ang pangalan pong taong</em> [<em>tumanggap</em>] <em>ng pera ang nilalagay ko sa voucher pero minsan po ay codename ang nilalagay ko.</em></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">59.</div></td><td><div align="justify"> T: <em>Sino ang nagbigay ng</em> "codename"?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify">S: <em>Si</em> Madame JANET LIM NAPOLES <em>po ang nagbigay ng codename kasi daw po ay sa gobyerno kami nagta</em>-transact.</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">60. </div></td><td><div align="justify">T: <em>Maaari mo bang sabihin kung anu-ano ang mga</em> "codenames" <em>ng mga ka</em>-transact <em>ni</em> JANET LIM NAPOLES <em>na pulitiko o kanilang </em>[Chief of Staff]?</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify">S:<em> Opo.</em> "TANDA" <em>kay</em> Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, "SEXY/ANAK/KUYA" <em>kay</em> Senator Jinggoy Estrada, <strong><u>"POGI" <em>kay</em> Senator Bong Revilla</u></strong>, "GUERERA" <em>kay</em> Congressman Rizalina Seachon-Lanete, "BONJING" <em>kay</em> Congressman RODOLFO PLAZA, "BULAKLAK" <em>kay</em> Congressman SAMUEL DANGWA, "SUHA" <em>kay</em> Congressman ARTHUR PINGOY, <em>at</em> "KURYENTE" <em>kay</em> Congressman EDGAR VALDEZ. <em>Mayroon pa po ibang</em> codename <em>nasa</em> records <em>ko</em>. <em>Sa ngayon po ay sila lang po ang aking naalala.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup><br></div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>As observed by this Court in the <i>Reyes</i> case, "the names of the legislators to whom the PDAF shares were disbursed x x x were identified by the use of 'codenames.' These 'codenames,' which were obviously devised to hide the identities of the legislators involved in the scheme, were known by a select few in the JLN Corporation,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> such as the whistleblowers. The level of detail of the whistleblowers' narration of facts would surely impress upon a reasonable and prudent mind that their statements were not merely contrived. In addition, the fact that they had no apparent motive as to why Sen. Revilla, among all others, would be drawn by the whistleblowers, into such a high-profile case of plundet should likewise be taken into account. Further, in <i>Reyes</i>, this Court observed that:<br><blockquote>[W]histleblower testimonies - especially in corruption cases, such as this - should not be condemned, but rather, be welcomed as these whistleblowers risk incriminating themselves in order to expose the perpetrators and bring them to justice. In <i>Re: Letter of Presiding Justice Conrado M. Vasquez, Jr. on CA-G.R. SP No. 103692</i> (<i>Antonio Rosete, et al. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, et al.</i>) [590 Phil. 8, 49-50 (2008)], the Court gave recognition and appreciation to whistleblowers in corruption cases, considering that corruption is often done in secrecy and it is almost inevitable to resort to their testimonies in order to pin down the crooked public officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[146]</sup><br></blockquote>Sen. Revilla opposes the admission of the whistleblowers' testimonies based on the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule. However, in <i>Reyes</i>, citing <i>Estrada v. Ombudsman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup> this Court had unanimously ruled that the testimonies of the same whistleblowers against Jo Christine and John Christopher Napoles, children of Janet Napoles who were also charged with the embezzlement of the PDAF, are admissible in evidence, considering that technical rules of evidence are not binding on the fiscal during preliminary investigation. This Court was unequivocal in declaring that the objection on <i>res inter alios acta</i> should falter:<br><blockquote>Neither can the Napoles siblings discount the testimonies of the whistleblowers based on their invocation of the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule under Section 28, Rule 130 of the Rules on Evidence, which states that the rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another, unless the admission is by a conspirator under the parameters of Section 30 of the same Rule. To be sure, <b><u>the foregoing rule constitutes a technical rule on evidence which should not be rigidly applied in the course of preliminary investigation proceedings</u></b>. In <i>Estrada</i>, the Court sanctioned the Ombudsman's appreciation of hearsay evidence, which would otherwise be inadmissible under technical rules on evidence, during the preliminary investigation "as long as there is substantial basis for crediting the hearsay." This is because "such investigation is merely preliminary, and does not finally adjudicate rights and obligations of parties." Applying the same logic, and with the similar observation that there lies substantial basis for crediting the testimonies of the whistleblowers herein, <u><b>the objection interposed by the Napoles siblings under the evidentiary <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule should falter</b></u>. Ultimately, as case law edifies, "[t]he technical rules on evidence are not binding on the fiscal who has jurisdiction and control over the conduct of a preliminary investigation," as in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> (Emphases and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Absent any countervailing reason, the rule on <i>stare decisis</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> mandates a similar application of the foregoing ruling to this case.<br><br>In any event, even if it is assumed that the rule on <i>res inter alios acta</i> were to apply during preliminary investigation, the treatment of the whistleblowers' statements as hearsay is bound by the exception on <b><u>independently relevant statements</u></b>. "Under the doctrine of independently relevant statements, regardless of their truth or falsity, the fact that such statements have been made is relevant. The hearsay rule does not apply, and the statements are admissible as evidence. Evidence as to the making of such statement is not secondary but primary, for the statement itself may constitute a fact in issue or be circumstantially relevant as to the existence of such a fact."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[150]</sup> Undoubtedly, the testimonies of the whistleblowers are independently relevant to prove the involvement of Sen. Revilla and his co­accused in the present controversy, considering their respective participations in the entire PDAF scam. Therefore, the statements made by whistleblowers Suñas, Sula, and Luy, who were employees of JLN Corporation and privy to the financial transactions of Napoles concerning, among others, Sen. Revilla's PDAF, should be given consideration as they are directly, if not circumstantially, relevant to the issue at hand.<br><br>To add, the prosecution also presented <b>Luy's ledger entries</b> which corroborate his testimony that Sen.

Luy's records disclose that the kickbacks amountpd to "at least P224,512,500.00: P10,000,000.00 for 2006; P61,000,000.00 for 2007; P80,000,000.00 for 2008; P40,000,000.00 for 2009; and P33,512,500.00 for 2010."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[151]</sup><br><br>Relatedly, it should be clarified that <b><u>the fact that Luy did not personally know Sen. Revilla or that none of the whistleblowers personally saw anyone handing/delivering money to Sen. Revilla does not mean that they did not personally know of his involvement</u></b>. Because of their functions in JLN Corporation as above-stated, it is evident that they had personal knowledge of the fact that Napoles named Sen. Revilla as one of the select-legislators she transacted with. More significantly, they personally processed the PDAF funds and documents connected with Sen. Revilla's Office, which lasted for a considerable amount of time, <i>i.e.</i>, four (4) years [2006-2010 as charged]. As such, their testimonies should not be completely disregarded as hearsay.<br><br>In any case, this Court has resolved that "<b><u>probable cause can be established with hearsay evidence, as long as there is substantial basis for crediting the hearsay</u></b>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[152]</sup> The substantial basis for crediting the whistleblowers' testimonies, even if so regarded as hearsay, rests on their key functions in JLN Corporation as above-mentioned, as well as the collective evidence gathered by the prosecution tending to support the same conclusion that Sen. Revilla and his alleged co-conspirators acted in concert to pillage his PDAF funds.<br><br>The prosecution further submitted the <b>affidavits of Sen. Revilla's co­respondents</b> which constitute direct evidence that provide an account of Sen. Revilla's involvement, this time from the perspective of certain IA officials.<br><br>Among others, National Livelihood Development Corporation Director IV Emmanuel Alexis G. Sevidal, echoed the Ombudsman's finding that "[Sen.] Revilla, through Cambe, [was] responsible for '<i>identifying the projects, determining the project costs and choosing the NGOs</i>' which was manifested in the letters of [Sen.] Revilla[.]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[153]</sup><br><br>For his part, Technology Resource Center (TRC) Deputy, Director General Dennis L. Cunanan (Cunanan) narrated that he met Janet Napoles sometime in 2006 or 2007. According to him, Napoles introduced herself as "the representative of certain legislators who supposedly picked TRC as a conduit for PDAF-funded projects"; at the same occasion, Napoles told him that "<b><i><u>her principals were then Senate President [Enrile], [Sen. Revilla], [and] [Sen. Estrada.]</u></i></b>" Cunanan further averred that he "often ended up taking and/or making telephone verifications and follow-ups and receiving legislators or their staff members," all in connection with PDAF projects. In addition, Cunanan even conveyed that Luy would occasionally go to his office to pressure him to expedite the release of the PDAF funds by calling the offices of the legislators concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[154]</sup><br><br>Cunanan's statements were furthr corroborated by TRC Department Manager III Francisco B. Figura (Figura), wno averred that legislators would "highly recommend" NGOs/foundations as conduit implementors and that if TRC disagreed with their recommendations, said legislators wquld feel insulted and take away their PDAF from TRC, resulting in the latter losing the chance to earn service fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[155]</sup> According to Figura, this set up rendered TRC officials powerless to disregard the wishes of Sen. Revilla especially on the matter of public bidding for the PDAF projects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[156]</sup><br><br>At this juncture, this Court would like to dispel the notion. that due process rights were violated when Sen. Revilla was denied copies of the counter-affidavits of his co-respondents in the preliminary investigation proceedings before the Ombudsman as he argues in <b>G.R. Nos. 212427-28</b>. This matter was already resolved in the similar case of <i>Estrada</i>, where this Court said:<br><blockquote>Both the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman require the investigating officer to furnish the respondent with copies of the affidavits of the complainant and affidavits of his supporting witnesses. Neither of these Rules require the investigating officer to furnish the respondent with copies of the affidavits of his [co-respondents]. <b>The right of the respondent is only "to examine the evidence <i>submitted by the complainant</i>,"</b> as expressly stated in Section 3 (b), Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure. This Court has unequivocally ruled in <i>Paderanga</i> that "Section 3, Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure expressly provides that the respondent shall only have the right to submit a counter-affidavit, to examine all other evidence submitted by the complainant and, where the fiscal sets a hearing to propound clarificatory questions to the parties. or their witnesses, to be afforded an opportunity to be present but without the right to examine or cross-examine." Moreover, Section 4 (<b>a, b and c</b>), of Rule II of the Ombudsman's Rule of Procedure, <b>read together</b>, only require the investigating officer to furnish the respondent with copies of the affidavits of the complainant and his supporting witnesses. <b><u>There is no law or rule requiring the investigating officer to furnish the respondent with copies of the affidavits of his co-respondents.</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[157]</sup><br></blockquote>In any event, the Ombudsman in this case went beyond its legal duty and eventually granted Sen. Revilla's requests to be furnished with said counter-affidavits, and even afforded him the opportunity to comment thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[158]</sup> Thus, there is more reason to decline his flawed claims of denial of due process. Case law statethat the touchstone of due process is the opportunity to be heard,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[159]</sup> which was undeniably afforded to Sen. Revilla in this case.<br><br><b>The findings of the COA in its SAO Report No. 2012-2013 (COA report)</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[160]</sup> also buttress the finding of probable cause against Sen.Revilla. This report presents'in detail the various irregularities in the disbursement of the PDAF allocations of several legislators in the years 2007 to 2009, such as: (<i>a</i>) the IAs not actually implementing the purported projects, and instead, directly releasing the funds to the NGOs after deducting a "management fee," <b><u>which were done at the behest of the sponsoring legislator, including Sen. Revilla</u></b>; (<i>b</i>) the involved NGOs did not have any track record in the implementation of government projects, provided fictitious addresses, submitted false documents, and were selected without any public bidding and complying with COA Circular No. 2607-001 and GPPB Resolution No. 12-2007; and (<i>c</i>) the suppliers who purportedly provided supplies to the NGOs denied ever dealing with the latter. Resultantly, the COA Report concluded that the PDAF-funded projects of Sen. Revilla were "ghost" or inexistent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[161]</sup><br><br>The findings in the COA report were further corroborated by the field verifications conducted by the <b>Field Investigation Office - Office of the Ombudsman (FIO)</b> to determine whether or not Sen. Revilla's PDAF was indeed utilized for its intended livelihood projects. In the course of investigation, it was revealed that the mayors and municipal agriculturists, who had reportedly received livelihood assistance kits/packages, purportedly procured through Sen. Revilla's PDAF, actually denied receiving the same and worse, were not even aware of any PDAF-funded projects intended for their benefit. Moreover, the signatures on the certificates of acceptance and delivery reports were forged, and in fact, the supposed beneficiaries listed therein were neither residents of the place where they were named as such; had jumbled surnames; deceased; or even downright fictitious. The foregoing led the FIO to similarly conclude that the purported livelihood projects were "ghost" projects, and that its proceeds amounting to P517,000,000.00 were never used for the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[162]</sup><br><br>Taking together all of the above-stated pieces of evidence, the COA and FIO reports tend to <i>prima facie</i> establish that irregularities had indeed attended the disbursement of Sen. Revilla's PDAF and that he had a hand in such anomalous releases, being the head of Office which unquestionably exercised operational control thereof. As the Ombudsman correctly observed, "[t]he PDAF was allocated to him by virtue of his position as a Senator, and therefore he exercise[d] control in the selection of his priority projects and programs. He indorsed [Napoles's] NGOs in consideration for the remittance of kickbacks and commissions from Napoles. Compounded by the fact that the PDAF-funded projects turned out to be 'ghost projects', and that the rest of the PDAF allocation went into the pockets of Napoles and her cohorts, [there is probable cause to show that] Revilla thus unjustly enriched himself at the expense and to the damage and prejudice of the Filipino people and the Republic of the Philippines."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[163]</sup> Hence, he should stand trial for violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019. For the same reasons, it is apparent that ill-gotten wealth in the amount of at least P50,000,000.00 (<i>i.e.</i>, P224,512,500.00) were amassed, accumulated or acquired through a combination or series of overt acts stated in Section 1 of the Plunder Law. Therefore, Sen. Revilla should likewise stand trial for Plunder.<br><br>Besides, case law holds<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[164]</sup> that once the trial court finds probable cause, which results in the issuance of a warrant of arrest (as the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> in this case, with respect to Sen. Revilla and his co­petitioners<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[165]</sup>), any question on the prosecution's conduct of preliminary investigation becomes moot.<br><br>In fine, Sen. Revilla's petitions in <b>G.R. Nos. 212427-28</b> and <b>G.R. Nos. 212694-95</b> are dismissed for lack of merit.<br><br><center><b><u>IV. Probable Cause Against Cambe.</u></b><br></center><br>The same conclusion obtains with respect to the petition of Cambe in <b>G.R. Nos. 212794-95</b> assailing the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause against him, as well as its failure to furnish him copies of his co­respondents' counter-affidavits.<br><br>The above-discussed pieces of evidence are all equally significant to establish probable cause against Cambe. There is no dispute that Ca:mbe was Sen. Revilla's trusted aide, being his Chief of Staff. By such authority, he also exercised operational control over the affairs of Sen. Revilla's office, including the allocation of his PDAF. In fact, Cambe's signatures explicitly appear on several PDAF documents, such as the MOAs allowing the IAs to transfer Sen. Revilla's PDAF funds allocated for certain projects to various JLN-controlled NGOs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[166]</sup><br><br>Moreover, Cambe was personally identified by the whistleblowers to have received PDAF money for himself and for Sen. Revilla. As recounted by Luy, Cambe was the one who would go to Napoles's office and receive cash from the latter in the aggregate amount of P224,512,500.00 representing Sen. Revilla's "commissions" or "kickbacks" coming from the PDAF scam. The cash would come either from Luy's vault or from Napoles herself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[167]</sup> In simple terms, Cambe allegedly acted as a liaison between Sen. Revilla and Napoles.<br><br>For the same reasons above-discussed, there should be no valid objection against the appreciation of the PDAF documents and whistleblowers' testimonies as evidence to establish probable cause against Cam be at this stage of the proceedings. He also has no right to be furnished copies of the counter-affidavits ,of his co-respondents. Thus, this Court holds that Cambe should likewise stand trial for the crimes charged, and his petition in <b>G.R. Nos. 212014-15</b> be dismissed.<br><br><center><b><u>V. Probable Cause Against Napoles.</u></b><br></center><br>In <b>G.R. Nos. 213536-37</b>, Janet Napoles similarly seeks to nullify the Ombudsman's March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution and June 4, 2014 Joint Order finding probable cause against her for Plunder and for violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019. Essentially, she argues that the complaints did not establish the specific acts of the crimes she supposedly committed. She likewise contends that since she is not a public officer, she cannot be subjected to prosecution by the Ombudsman before the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>Napoles's arguments are untenable.<br><br>Records clearly show that Napoles, in all reasonable likelihood, played an integral role in the illegal utilization, diversion, and disbursement of Sen. Revilla's PDAF. In fact, she was tagged as the mastermind of the entire PDAF scam. As outlined by the Ombudsman, Napoles would approach legislators, such as Sen. Revilla, and "offer to 'acquire' his x x x PDAF allocation in exchange for a 'commission' or kickback amounting to a certain percentage of the PDAF."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[168]</sup> Once Napoles was informed of the availability of Sen Revilla's PDAF, she and/or her staff would prepare listings of the available projects specifically indicating the IAs which would carry out the same. After the listings are released by Sen. Revilla's Office, Napoles would then give a down payment from her own pockets for delivery to Sen. Revilla, or in case of his unavailability, to Cambe who would receive the same on Sen. Revilla's behalf. Once the SARO and/or the NCA regarding said project is released, Napoles would then deliver the promised "kickbacks" to Sen. Revilla. Thereafter, Sen. Revilla and/or Cambe would endorse Napoles's NGOs to undertake the PDAF-funded projects, all of which turned out to be "ghost" or "inexistent;" thus, allowing Napoles and her cohorts to pocket the PDAF allocation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[169]</sup><br><br>Based on the evidence in support thereof such as the PDAF documents, whistleblowers' testimonies, the accounts of the IA officials, and the COA report, as well as the field verifications of the FIO, Ombudsman, this Court is convinced that there lies probable cause against Janet Napoles for the charge of Plunder as it has been <i>prima facie</i> established that she, in conspiracy with Sen. Revilla, Cambe, and other personalities, was significantly involved in the afore-described <i>modus operandi</i> to obtain Sen. Revilla's PDAF amounting to at least P50,000,000.00 in "kickbacks." In the same manner, there is probable cause against Napoles for violations of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, as it is ostensible that their conspiracy to illegally divert PDAF Funds to "ghost" projects caused undue prejudice to the government.<br><br>That a private individual, such as Napoles, could not be charged for Plunder and violations of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019 because the offenders in those crimes are public officers is a complete misconception. It has been long-settled that while the primary offender in the aforesaid crimes are public officers, private individuals may also be held liable for the same <b><u>if they are found to have conspired with said officers in committing the same</u></b>. This proceeds from the fundamental principle that in cases of conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[170]</sup> In this case, since it appears that Napoles has acted in concert with public officers in the systematic pillaging of Sen. Revilla's PDAF, the Ombudsman correctly indicted her as a co-conspirator for the aforementioned crimes.<br><br>Thus, Napoles's petition in <b>G.R. Nos. 213536-37</b> is dismissed.<br><br><center><b><u>VI. Probable Cause Against De Asis.</u></b><br></center><br>In <b>G.R. Nos. 213477-78</b>, De Asis accuses the Ombudsman of gravely abusing its discretion in finding probable cause against him for Plunder and violations of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, contending, <i>inter alia</i>, that the performance of his functions as driver and messenger of Napoles hardly constitutes overt acts of the aforesaid crimes or a willful participation thereof. In this regard, he asserts that as a mere high school graduate and former security guard, it is highly unimaginable for him to conspire with his employer and other high-ranking government officials to commit the aforesaid crimes.<br><br>The petition has no merit.<br><br>Records show that De Asis was designated as the President/Incorporator<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[171]</sup> of KPMFI which was one of the many NGOs controlled by Napoles that was used in the embezzlement of Sen. Revilla's PDAF allocations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[172]</sup> Moreover, whistleblowers Luy and Suñas explicitly n,amed De Asis as one of those who prepared money to be given to the lawmaker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[173]</sup> Said whistleblowers even declared that De Asis, among others, rec ived the checks issued by the IAs to the NGOs and deposited the same in the bank; and that, after the money is withdrawn from the bank, he was also one of those tasked to bring the money to Janet Napoles's house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[174]</sup> Indeed, the foregoing prove to be well-grounded bases to believe that, in all probability, De Asis conspired with the other co-accused to commit the crimes charged.<br><br>To refute the foregoing allegations, De Asis presented defenses which heavily centered on his perceived want of criminal intent, as well as the alleged absence of the elements of the crimes charged. However, such defenses are evidentiary in nature, and thus, are better ventilated during trial and not during preliminary investigation. To stress, a preliminary investigation is not the occasion for the full and exhaustive display of the prosecution's evidence; and the presence or absence of the elements of the crime is evidentiary in nature and is a matter of defense that may be passed upon only after a full-blown trial on the merits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[175]</sup><br><br>In sum, the Ombudsman did not gravely abuse its discretion in finding probable cause to indict De Asis for the crimes charged. Consequently, his petition in <b>G.R. Nos. 213477-78</b> is dismissed.<br><br><center><b><u>VII. Probable Cause Against Lim.</u></b><br></center><br>In <b>G.R. Nos. 213532-33</b>, Lim argues that the Ombudsman. gravely abused its discretion in finding probable cause against him for Plunder. According to him, the criminal complaints do not allege a specific action he committed that would demonstrate his involvement for the crime charged.<br><br>Lim's contention is without merit.<br><br>As correctly pointed out by the Ombudsman, whistleblowers Luy and Suñas narrated that over the course of the perpetuation of the PDAF scam, they, along with the other staff of Napoles - which includes Lim - would prepare, and thereafter deliver, the kickbacks intended for Sen. Revilla.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> The preparation and delivery of kickbacks to the legislator and/or his trusted staff are indeed overt acts that relate to his involvement in the PDAF scheme. To note, even if it is assumed that Lim only prepared the money and did not deliver the same as he claims,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup> the act of preparation is still connected to the common objective of the conspiracy. Accordingly, this establishes the existence of probable cause against him for thb crime charged. Hence, his petition in <b>G.R. Nos. 213532-33</b> is likewise dismissed.<br><br><center><b><u>VIII. Probable Cause Against Relampagos, <i>et al</i>.</u></b><br></center><br>Meanwhile, in <b>G.R. Nos. 218744-59</b>, DBM employees Relampagos, Nuñez, Paule, and Bare assail the Sandiganbayan Resolutions dated November 13, 2014<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> and May 13, 2015<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[179]</sup> which judicially found probable cause against them for eight (8) counts of violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019, thereby affirming the Ombudsman's earlier finding of probable cause against them (at least for the said eight [8] counts that were affirmed). In particular, they argue that: (<i>a</i>) they cannot be faulted for issuing the SAROs without prior IA endorsement as it was authorized under the General Appropriations Acts (GAAs) for the years 2007 to 2009; and (<i>b</i>) there was no "undue haste" in the issuance of the said SAROs as the DBM itself prescribes shorter periods in the processing of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[180]</sup><br><br>Relampagos, <i>et al.</i>'s arguments fail to persuade.<br><br>As pointed out by the Ombudsman and the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, some of the SAROs and NCAs issued in the perpetuation of the PDAF scam were issued by the Office of Relampagos as DBM Undersecretary, where Nuñez, Paule, and Bare are all working - a finding that they themselves did not dispute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[181]</sup> More significantly: (<i>a</i>) <b><u>whistleblower Luy positively identified Relampagos, <i>et al</i>. as Napoles's "contact persons" in the DBM</u></b>; and (<i>b</i>) the COA Report found irregularities in their issuances of the aforesaid SAROs and NCAs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[182]</sup> Ostensibly, these circumstances show Relampagos <i>et al</i>.'s manifest partiality and bad faith in favor of Napoles and her cohorts that evidently caused undue prejudice to the Government. Thus, they must stand trial for violation of Section 3 (e) of RA 3019.<br><br>As to their contentions that there was no "undue haste" in the issuance of the said SAROs as the GAAs for the years 2007 to 2009 authorized such issuances even without prior IA endorsement and that the DBM itself prescribes a shorter processing time for the same, suffice it to say that these are matters of defense that are better ventilated in a full-blown trial. The timing of the SARO releases by these DBM officials, as well as any deviations from legal procedure are but part of a multitude of factors to be threshed out during trial in order to determine their exact culpability. Verily, the confines of a preliminary investigation do not yet allow a full exposition of the parties' claims. Relampagos, <i>et al</i>.'s petition in <b>G.R. Nos. 218744-59</b> is therefore dismissed.<br><br><center><b>Conclusion</b><br></center><br>Case law states that "the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause does not touch on the issue of guilt or innocence of the accused. It is not the function of the Office of the Ombudsman to rule on such issue. All that the Office of the Ombudsman did was to weigh the evidence presented together with the counter-allegations of the accused and determine if there was enough reason to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused are probably guilty thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[183]</sup> In the review of the Ombudsman's determination of probable cause, we are guided by this Court's pronouncement in <i>Vergara v. Ombudsman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> where it was ruled that:<br><blockquote>[C]ourts do not interfere in the Ombudsman's exercise of discretion in determining probable cause unless there are compelling reasons. The Ombudsman's finding of probable cause, or lack of it, is entitled to great respect absent a showing of grave abuse of discretion. Besides, to justify the issuance of the writ of <i>certiorari</i> on the ground of abuse of discretion, the abuse must be grave, as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and it must be so patent as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined, or to act at all, in contemplation of law, as to be equivalent to having acted without jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup><br></blockquote>Meanwhile, with respect to the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>'s judicial determination of probable cause, this Court, in <i>Delos-Santos Dio v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[186]</sup> enlightens that:<br><blockquote>[A] judge's discretion to dismiss a case immediately after the filing of the information in court is appropriate only when the failure to establish probable cause can be clearly inferred from the evidence presented and not when its existence is simply doubtful. After all, it call)lot be expected that upon the filing of the information in court the prosecutor would have already presented all the evidence necessary to secure a conviction of the accused, the objective of a previously-conducted preliminary investigation being merely to determine whether there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and that the respondent is probably guilty thereof and should be held for trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[187]</sup><br></blockquote>In this case, the Ombudsman (and the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> as to Relampagos, <i>et al</i>.) did not err in finding probable cause against all the petitioners. Their findings are fully supported by the evidence on record and no semblance of misapprehension taints the same. Moreover, this Court cannot tag key documentary evidence as forgeries and bar testimonies as hearsay at this stage of the proceedings; otherwise, it would defy established principles and norms followed during preliminary investigation. Jurisprudence teaches us that "[i]n dealing with probable cause[,] athe very name implies, we deal with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act. The standard of proof is accordingly correlative to what must be proved."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[188]</sup> Overall, based on the foregoing disquisitions, the standard of probable cause was adequately hurdled by the prosecution in this case. As such, no grave abuse of discretion was committed by the Ombudsman and the <i>Sandiganbayan</i> in the proceedings <i>a quo</i>. All the petitioners should therefore stand trial for the crimes they were charged.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions are <b>DISMISSED</b> for lack of erit.

The focal point of <i>stare decisis</i> is the doctrine created. The principle, entrenched under Article 8 of the Civil Code, evokes the general rule that, for the sake of certainty, a conclusion reached in one case should be doctrinally applied to those that follow if the facts are substantially the same, even though the parties may be different. It proceeds from the frrst principle of justice that, absent any powerful countervailing considerations, like cases ought to be decided alike. Thus, where the same questions relating to the same event have been put forward by the parties similarly situated as in a previous case litigated and decided by competent court, the rule of <i>stare decisis</i> is a bar to any attempt to re-litigate the same issue.

Ramon "Bong" Revilla, Jr. (Revilla), Richard A. Cambe (Cambe), Mario L. Relampagos (Relampagos), Rosario S. Nuñez (Nuñez), Lalaine N. Paule (Paule) and Marilou D. Bare (Bare).<br><br><center><b>FACTUAL ANTECEDENTS</b><br></center><br>As culled from the Joint Resolution dated March 28, 2014 issued by the Ombudsman in OMB-C-C13-0316 and OMB-C-C-13-0395, the issuance that has invariably spawned the consolidated special civil actions at bar, the relevant factual antecedents are as follows:<br><br>On March 22, 2013, National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents rescued Benhur Luy (Luy) who would claim having been illegally detained in connection with the discharge of his responsibilities as the "lead employee" of the Janet Lim Napoles Corporation (JLN). JLN was supposedly involved in overseeing the anomalous implementation of several projects funded from the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF).<br><br>The NBI's investigation that followed focused on the adverted irregularities surrounding the PDAF of certain lawmakers, acting in connivance with individuals in and out of govermnent and non­govermnental organizations (NGOs). Interviewed during the probe,were Luy and other JLN employees, Marina Sula (Sula) and Merlina Suñas (Suñas).<br><br>After its investigation, the NBI filed with the Office of the Ombudsman (OOMB) a complaint, docketed as OMB-C-C-13-0316 (the NBI complaint), charging, <i>inter alia</i>, the herein petitioners, namely: 1) Sen. Ramon "Bong" Revilla, Jr. (Revilla); 2) Richard A. Cambe, a member of his Senate staff; 3) Janet Lim Napoles (Napoles); 4) Ronald John B. Lim (Lim); 5) John Raymund S. De Asis (De Asis); and 6) Mario L. Relampagos (Relampagos), Rosario S. Nuñez (Nuñez), Lalaine N. Paule (Paule) and Marilou D. Bare (Bare) with Plunder. Thereat, the NBI alleged that Revilla, through Cambe, received a total of P224,512,500.00 from Napoles for supposedly allowing the latter to divert Revilla's PDAF from 2006 to 2010 to her controlled non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with the help of the other respondents therein.<br><br>Based on similar allegations, the Field Investigation Office (FIO) of the OOMB thereafter filed another complaint for violation of Sec. 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act against, among other individuals, Revilla, Napoles, Cambe, and De Asis (FIO Complaint).<br><br>Docketed as OMB-C-C-13-0395, the FIO Complaint cites COA (Commission on Audit) SAO (Special Audits Office) Report No. 2012-03, on PDAF allocations and disbursements covering 2007-2009. Mentioned in the FIO Complaint are supposed letters from COA to Revilla and vice versa, bearing on the authenticity of his signature or Cambe's appearing on the documents appended to the letter, <i>i.e.</i>, letters to the head of Implementing Agencies (IAs), memoranda of agreement (MOA), and project proposals, inspection/acceptance/disbursement papers relating to his PDAF. ("PDAF Documents").<br><br>In separate or joint counter-affidavits submitted in compHance with the OOMB orders, the above-named respondents, proferred the following defenses or inculpatory statements, the gist of which are as summarized below. Other related incidents are as indicated.<br><br>1. Relampagos, Nuñez, Paule, and Bare, who were identified by Luy as Napoles' "<i>contacts</i>" in the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) who helped expedite the release of the Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) relating to the PDAF, alleged they are not mentioned in the NBI Complaint as participants in the PDAF misuse.<br><br>2. De Asis admits that, as employee of JLN Group from 2006-2010, serving as driver/bodyguard/messenger for Napoles he used, per her instructions, to pick up checks for Napoles-affiliated government organizations. But he denies having any knowledge in setting-up or managing firms that supposedly received PDAF.<br><br>3. As in his later pleadings and submissions, Revilla alleged that his or Cambe's signatures in the PDAF Documents thus submitted by the NBI and the FIO are all forgeries as shown in the independent and separate reports of two handwriting experts, Atty. Desiderio Pagni and Mr. Rogelio Azores. Sen. Revilla drew attention to the fact that not one of complainants' witnesses testified about his receipt of money as kickback or commission from Napoles. He stressed that the complainants have neither identified the "overt act" of the crimes he committed nor the so-called ill-gotten wealth he has allegedly accumulated. Revilla rued the lack of admissible proof to support the contentions that he conspired with Napoles and her employees.<br><br>Revilla would stress too that his limited involvement in the PDAF release started and ended with his letter to the Senate President and a Senate committee identifying the projects for his PDAF.<br><br>4. Cambe denies, as he would later deny, any involvement in the PDAF scam or in the conspiracy involving the PDAF. He tagged as forgeries his purported signature appearing in certain PDAF documents. He would echo Revilla's line on the absence in the complaints of averments of the "overt or criminal acts" constitutive of Plunder case filed against him.<br><br>Napoles, Lim, and five others opted not to file their counter-affidavits.<br><br>In related moves, Revilla and Cambe sought the suspension of the preliminary investigation on the NBI and FIO complaints, pleading that a civil case previously filed to nullify the PDAF Documents presents a prejudicial question to the criminal proceedings. In the <b>Joint Order dated <i>January 28, 2014</i></b>, as later reiterated, however, the Ombudsman denied the motions holding that the desired suspension is unwarranted, falsification not being an essential element of either crime involved, besides which there are other pieces of evidence in support of the complaints thus filed.<br><br>Raising an entirely distinct issue, Cambe filed a second motion to suspend proceedings on the ground that the filing of the criminall cases is premature. He argued that non-compliance with the COA Order of Execution (COE) is a pre-condition or a condition precedent to the filing of the charges against him. However, the Ombudsman denied this second motion in its <b>Joint Order dated March 14, 2014</b>, now being challenged in G.R. Nos. 212014-15.<br><br>On February 11, 2014, Revilla interposed a <i>Motion to be Furnished Copies of Motions, Pleadings, and other Submissions filed</i> in relation to the criminal complaints against him including the Counter-Affidavits of the other respondents ("Motion to be Furnished"). By Order of March 11, 2014, the Ombudsman denied the motion. Another Order of March 27, 2014 would deny Revilla's motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Revilla's subsequent <i>Motion for Voluntary Inhibition (Of the Special Panel of Investigators)</i> met the same adverse fate. So did his motion for motion for reconsideration of the denial order.<br><br><center><b><u>The Ombudsman's March 28,2014 Joint Resolution</u></b><br></center><br>By Joint Resolution of <b>March 28, 2014</b>, the Ombudsman found probable cause to charge Revilla and the other petitioners, with plunder and violation of Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019, pertinently disposing in this wise -<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, this Office, through the undersigned: <br><br>(a) FINDS PROBABLE CAUSE to indict:<br><br>[PLUNDER - 1 Count]<br><br>i.

Wrote the Ombudsman on the matter of conspiracy:<br><blockquote>Based on the x x x evidence presented, the widespread misuse of the subject PDAF allotted to a legislator was coursed through a complex scheme basically involving "ghost" or inexistent projects allegedly funded by said PDAF.

A week later, however, Sen. Revilla filed, but the OOMB via its <b>May 15, 2014</b> Order denied, an <i>Omnibus Motion</i> wherein he prayed for: (1) the reconsideration of the May 7, 2014 Joint Order; (2) the recall of the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution; (3) the reconduct of the preliminary investigation; and (4) the reconstitution of another special panel of investigators.<br><br>The May 15, 2014 order is now assailed in G.R. No. 212427-28.<br><br>In its <b>June 4, 2014 Joint Order</b>, the OOMB denied the petitioners' motions for reconsideration. On June 6 and 9, 2014, the Ombudsman filed before the Sandiganbayan the Informations against Revilla for one (1) count of Plunder and sixteen (16) counts of vio!ation of Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019, which were docketed as Criminal Case Nos. SB 14 CRM 0240 (for Plunder) and SB 14 CRM 0267 to 0282 (for Violation of Sec. 3[e] of RA 3019).<br><br>On June 13, 2014, Revilla interposed a <i>Motion for Judicial Determination of Probable Cause and Deferment and/or Suspension of Proceedings</i>. The Sandiganbayan, however, denied the motion and then issued warrants of arrest against Revilla, <i>et al</i>.<br><br>In its August 28, 2014 Resolution, the Sandiganbayan dismissed Crim. Case Nos. SB-14-CRM-0267, 0270, 0271, 0274, 0277, 0278, 0281, and 0282 as against the four respondents from the DBM. In the same resolution, however, the anti-graft court ordered the prosecution to present additional evidence to establish the existence of probable cause against them in Crim. Case Nos. SB-14-CRM-0268, 0269, 0272,0273, 0275,0276, 0279; and 0280 (where Relampagos signed the SAROs involved). The prosecution moved for partial reconsideration of the August 28, 2014 Resolution insofar as the dismissal aspect of the issuance is concerned; but the Sandiganbayfin denied the motion in its <b>Resolution of November 13, 2014</b>. The Sandiganbayan, however, affirmed the probable cause finding against the four DBM employees in Crim. Case Nos. SB-14-CRM-0268, 0269, 0272, 0273, 0275, 0276, 0279 and 0280 on the ground that the defenses they raised were evidentiary in character. In particular, the graft court held that the issue of whether the IAs' endorsement was indispensable before a SARO can be issued is a matter of evidence to be threshed out during trial. So too, the court added, is the issue of whether there was actual undue haste in the issuance of the SAROs involved.<br><br>Relampagos, <i>et al</i>. moved for the reconsideration of the November 13, 2014 Resolution citing DBM Circular Letter No. 2015-1, s. of 2015, which supposedly clarified that the IAs' endorsements are no longer required before the issuance of the corresponding SARO.

Nos. 212014-15</u></b><br><i>Atty. Richard A. Cambe, petitioner</i><br><br>This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition to annul and, set aside the March 14, 2014 Joint Order of the Office of the Ombudsman on the Motion to Suspend Proceedings and to command the Ombudsman from further proceedings in the criminal complaints against Cambe.<br><br>To Cambe, the Ombudsman gravely abused her discretion by refusing to dismiss the criminal complaints or at least suspend the proceedings despite non-compliance with a precondition or condition precedent to the filing thereof. According to Cambe, the COE, which should have been preceded by a Notice of Finality of Decision, is a precondition or condition precedent to the filing of the NBl and FIO complaints. However, since the Notices of Disallowance (ND) have not become final and executqry at the time of filing of the complaints, the Ombudsman should have dismissed the criminal complaints, or at least, suspended the proceedings for non­compliance of said precondition or condition precedent.<br><br><b><u>G.R. Nos. 212427-28</u></b><br><i>Sen. Ramon "Bong" Revilla, Jr., petitioner</i><br><br>Senator Revilla assails in this recourse the OOMB's refusal, via its May 15, 2014 Order, (a) to provide him with the requested counter-affidavits and other submissions subject of his motion to furnish, (b) to re-conduct the preliminary investigation, recall and set aside the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution and (c) to constitute a different panel of investigators.<br><br>Pushing his point, Revilla alleges that the Ombudsman violated his right to due process when, in her March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution, she used nineteen (19) counter-affidavits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of his co-respondents that he had not been previously furnished with, thereby depriving him the opportunity to respond to the allegations therein. Revilla further argues that the Ombudsman's May 7, 2014 Order, belatedly furnishing him six out of the 19 counter-affidavits, with a right to submit a reply, does not cure the underlying fatal infirmity of the proceedings. As the preliminary investigation is a nullity, Revilla adds, the Ombudsman should have recalled its March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution and conducted another preliminary investigation. The senator takes the Ombudsman's refusal to take the twin courses, like her refusal to replace the biased members of the investigating panel as indicia of grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Disputing the senator's posture on denial of due process, the OOMB, the FIO and the NBI, in their Comment, alleged that he wain fact eventually furnished copies of the counter-affidavits of his co-respondents. Also, the Ombudsman denied the charge of bias hurled against the Special Panel of Investigators. The public respondents further aver that the fact that the Informations against Revilla have been filed with the Sandiganbayan has rendered this particular issue moot and academic.<br><br><b><u>G.R. Nos. 212694-95</u></b><br><i>Sen. Ramon "Bong" Revilla, Jr., petitioner</i><br><br>Sought to be nullified in this certiorari and prohibition actions are the adverted March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution and June 4, 2014 Joint Resolution of the OOMB. Revilla seeks to nullify the two issuances and yventually annul the Informations for plunder and corrupt practices thus filed with the Sandiganbayan, on the argument that the OOMB, in cond cting the preliminary investigation on the NBI and FIO complaints, trampled upon the due process guarantee, particularly his right to be confronted with the accusations and allegations charging him with crime.<br><br>Furthermore, Revilla faults the Ombudsman for her finding despite the complete absence of credible inculpating evidence. He contends that there is absolutely no evidence to support allegations of his having PDAF dealings with Napoles. To him, the complainants have yet to establish the commission of the required overt acts and that all the allegations against him are hearsay, inadmissible evidence.<br><br>Revilla asserts that the only thing linking him to the supposed scam are the PDAF documents bearing his forged signatures, the forgery admitted by no less than the complainants' witnesses and affirmed by two independent handwriting experts. In this regard, Revilla maintains that in the absence of contrary competent testimony, the findings of the handwriting experts stand. Invoking the doctrine of <i>res inter alios acta</i>, he also argues that absent independent evidence to prove conspiracy, the Ombudsman cannot consider the testimonies of the whistleblowers, who are self­-confessed co-conspirators, against Revilla.<br><br>In traversal of petitioner Revilla's allegation about being denied due process, respondents OOMB, NBI, FIO and the Office of the Special Prosecutors (OSP) adverted to the fact that the former was furnished with copies of the six incriminating counter-affidavits and given time to comment thereon. As a corollary point, respondents would argue that there were independent, credible and competent pieces of evidence that establish the finding of probable cause against petitioner. They emphasize that out of the 32 PDAF Documents shown to be signed by Revilla, he only contested 16 and the Ombudsman relied on 12 SAROs purportedly signed by Revilla to indict him for plunder and violation of Sec. 3(E), RA 3019.<br><br>In his Reply to Comment, Revilla countered that the OOMB should have provided him with all the documents he requested as a persop charged of the crime is entitled to be furnished with all evidence, be inculpating or exculpating, obtaining in the case. Else the person so charged is deemed denied his constitutional right to due process.<br><br>As to the public respondents' assertion that he refuted only a portion of the total number of PDAF Documents as forgeries, Revilla cited a civil complaint he filed wherein he sought the nullification of all the PDAF Documents. Revilla also clarified that there is no question on the regularity of the SAROs as these were forwarded by the Senate to the DBM for the release of the funds. Rather, he emphasized that what he is contesting are the letters to the IAs supposedly containing his endorsements of Napoles' NGOs and the MOAs with them. He reiterates his denial of ever signing any of these endorsement letters and MOAs without which, there is nothing to link him with Napoles.<br><br>On February 2, 2015, the Ombudsman herself, through the OSG, filed her Consolidated Comment on the petitions. Among other things, she particularly took stock of Revilla's acts indicating his manifest partiality and evident bad faith as shown by his repeated and direct endorsement of his PDAF-funded projects to Napoles' NGOs without the requisite public bidding and compliance with GPPB Resolution No. 012-200, IRR of R.A. 9184,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> amended, and National Budget Circular (NBC) No. 476.<br><br><b><u>G.R. Nos. 212794-95</u></b><br><i>Atty. Richard A. Cambe</i><br><br>In this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition, petitioner Cambe also seeks to annul the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution and the June 4, 2014 Joint Order, claiming the Ombudsman issued them in violation of his right to due process. For one, Cambe states, the Ombudsman totally ignored his counter-affidavits and countervailing evidence and even attributed to him statements and defenses which he did not make. Worse still, Cambe adds, the statements in the aforesaid Joint Resolution betray the Ombudsman's failure to even peruse what he submitted. For another, she used the counter­affidavits of other respondents against Cambe without so much as providing him copies thereof. To compound matters, the Ombudsman even used various memoranda which the whistleblowers admitted to have been falsified. For a third, Cambe, following Revilla's lead, parlayed the <i>res inter alios acta</i> line. He also laments the Ombudsman's disregard of handwriting experts' finding on the authenticity of his signatures on the PDAF Documents. He further raises the issue of his right, as part of due process, to be furnished with the counter-affidavits of his co-respondents like Revilla.<br><br>Finally, Cambe asserts that none of the elements for the successful prosecution of plunder or violation of Sec. 3 (e) of R.A. 3019 is present. As it were, Cambe claims, vis-a-vis the latter crime, he has nothing to do with the PDAF projects let alone acting with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence. Most importantly, he did not, under the premises, cause undue injury to any party, or give any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his functions.<br><br>Public respondents, in their Consolidated Comment and training their sights on allegations of supposed denial of due process, argue in the main that Cambe failed to present ny competent evidence to support his thesis. On the contrary, Cambe was furnished copies of the counter-affidavits that directly linked him to the crimes charged against him. They further argue that the issue on Cambe's pretense of being denied, under the premises, of due process has been rendered moot by the Ombudsman's issuance of the May 7, 2014 Joint Order wherein Cambe was furnished copies of the requested documents and was given a chance to comment thereon.<br><br><b><u>G.R. Nos. 213477-78</u></b><br><i>John Raymund De Asis, petitioner</i><br><br>In this petition to annul the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution, De Asis contends at bottom as follows: (1) the basic complaints were devoid of any allegation or proof that would justify the charge of Plunder against him. At best, these allegations merely depicted him as exercising his duties as Napoles' driver, messenger, and janitor which can hardly be construed as overt criminal acts of Plunder or a willful participation on his part to commit the same. (2) He has no knowledge of the existence, let alone of being president, of <i>Kaupdanan Para sa Mangunguma Foundation, Inc.</i> (KPMFI). De Asis describes as unimaginable for a mere high school graduate and a former security guard, like him, to conspire with his employer and high­ranking government officials to perpetrate the crime. He emphasized that the Joint Resolution expressly stated that his employer, Napoles, had "full control and possession of the funds." And, (3) KPMFI was not used as conduit in the PDAF scam.<br><br>Commenting on De Asis' declaration of good faith, the Ombudsman stated that the former's acts of receiving checks for Napole' NGOs, depositing them in their bank accounts, delivering Napoles' share in the scam, and assisting in the delivery of the lawmakers' kickbacks are not part of his duties as driver, messenger, or janitor. Rather, for the Ombudsman, these are indispensable parts of the commission of Plunder and violation of Sec. 3(E), RA 3019 in conspiracy with his employer and other persons.<br><br>The Ombudsman also shoots down, as specious, De Asis' Claims of not knowing about the incorporation of KPMFI, with the fact that he does not effectively deny the authenticity of his signature on the incorporation papers. At any event, the Ombudsman concludes, De Asis' acts under the premises contextually show his participation in the conspiracy.<br><br><b><u>G.R. Nos. 213532-33</u></b><br><i>Ronald John Lim, petitioner</i><br><br>Lim prays in this <i>certiorari</i> action at bar for the annulment of the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution, predicating his plea on the premise that the Ombudsman issued the same when both the NBl and FIO complaints do not even allege his specific action that constitutes a violation of Plunder. Lim asserts that the complaints failed to establish the elements of the crimes charged against him and that the OOMB's Joint Resolution itself shows that he was not one of those who received the checks issued to the NGOs. To stress, he points out that only the NBl complaint named him as respondent. But even then, the NBl Complaint only impleaded him for being the supposed president of <i>Ginintuang Alay sa Magsasaka Foundation, Inc.</i> (GAMFI), when GAMFI was not even identified as an NGO that transacted with Revilla. He rued the sweeping assumption taken that all Napoles' employees are involved in the subject scam.<br><br>To this key contention, the Ombudsman counters that Luy and Suñas explicitly identified Lim as having helped Napoles deliver commissions and kickbacks money to the lawmakers, an actuality clearly indicating his involvement in the execution of the conspiracy to commit Plunder.<br><br><b><u>G.R. Nos. 218744-59</u></b><br><i>Mario Relampagos, Rosario Nuñez,<br>Lalaine Paule, and Marilou Bare, petitioners</i><br><br>In G.R. Nos. 218744-59, Relampagos, Nuñez, Paule and Bare assail the November 13, 2014 and May 13, 2015 Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan, which sustained the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause to indict them in Criminal Case Nos. SB-14-CRM-0268, 0269, 0272, 0273, 0275, 0276, 0279 and 0280. Petitioners contend that the Sandiganbayan gravely abused its discretion in refusing to declare the lack of probable cause in the mentioned cases considering that the General Appropriations Acts (GAAs) for 2007, 2008 and 2009 already decreed the direct release of all PDAF allocations to the IAs without the need of the prior requirement for the IAs' indorsement. For the petitioners, they cannot be faulted for issuing the SAROs under that circumstance.<br><br>They also stress that the Sandiganbayan should have dismissed the prosecution's allegation that they released the SAROs with "undue haste" since the SAROs involved were released four (4) to nine (9) days, way beyond the 11 hours and 15 minutes processing period required under the DBM charter.<br><br><b><u>G.R. Nos. 213536-37</u></b><br><i>Janet Lim Napoles, petitioner</i><br><br>In this petition for <i>certiorari</i>, Napoles hooks her plea for the nullification of the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution and the June 4, 2014 Joint Order on this claim: the Ombudsman arrived at its flawed finding on the existence of probable cause to charge her with Plunder notwithstanding the absence of the critical element of "amassing ill-gotten wealth for an accused public officer." She argues that the complaints did not establish the specific acts of the crime she supposedly committed nor the place and time of commission, and that the testimonies of Luy, Sula and Suñas are conflicting, unreliable, and barred by relevant rules of evidence. Napoles also makes much of the fact that she is not a public officer, thus not subject in context to prosecution by the Ombudsman before the Sandiganbayan.<br><br>In her Comment, the Ombudsman urges the outright dismissal of the Napoles petition for being baseless. To a precise point, the Ombudsman alleged having acted within the scope of her jurisdictional authority in detennining the existence of probable cause for the plunder and graft charges against Napoles, who, through her indispensable cooperation and conspiratorial acts, such as concocting non-existent projects and creating the bogus-NGOs, paved the way for Revilla to illegally divert his PDAF allocation and amass ill-gotten wealth. And in controvertion of Napoles' posture, the Ombudsman contends that the complaints and Information filed against the former are sufficient in form and substance since all theintegral parts were explicitly indicated.<br><br><center><b><u>Issue</u></b><br></center><br>The crucial question underlying these consolidated petitions boils down to whether the Ombudsman acted with grave abuse of discretion in finding probable cause to indict the petitioners for Plunder and violation of Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019.<br><br><center><b><u>Discussion</u></b><br></center><br>As the <i>ponencia</i> points out, the courts do not usually interfere with the Ombudsman in the determination as to the existence of probable cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In other words, the Ombudsman possesses ample latitude to detennine the propriety of filing a criminal charge against a person.

People</i>, we took exception to the Ombudsman's determination of probable cause and accordingly dismissed the case against the accused before the Sandiganbayan. Therein, we observed:<br><br>While it is the function of the Ombudsman to determine whether or not the petitioner should be subjected to the expense, rigors and embarrassment of trial, he cannot do so arbitrarily. This seemingly exclusive and unilateral authority of the Ombudsman must be tempered by the Court when powers of prosecution are in danger of being used for persecution. Dismissing the case against the accused for palpable want of probable cause not only spares her the expense, rigors and embarrassment of trial, but also prevents needless waste of the courts' time and saves the precious resources of the government.<br><br>In <i>Venus v. Hon. Desierto</i>, where the case against the accused was also dismissed for want of probable cause, we clarified that:<br><br>Agencies tasked with the preliminary investigation and prosecution of crimes must always be wary of undertones of political harassment. They should never forget that the purpose of a preliminary investigation is to secure the innocent against hasty, malicious and oppressive prosecution, and to protect one from an open and public accusation of crime, from the trouble, expense and anxiety of a public trial, and also to protect the State from useless and expensive trials. It is, therefore, imperative upon such agencies to relieve any person from the trauma of going through a trial once it is ascertained that the evidence is insufficient to sustain a <i>prima facie</i> case or that no probable cause exists to form a sufficient belief as to the guilt of the accused.<br></blockquote>On this account, especially in cases where the imposable statutory penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death as in this case, I submit that the Ombudsman must take into consideration only such competent and relevant evidence in determining the probability of the existence of the elements of the crimes charged, for such determination may spell months, if not years, of incarceration and anxiety for the accused, and vast amounts of expenses by the State.<br><br>Where the Ombudsman finds probable cause despite the palpable absence of any competent and relevant evidence of the elements of the crimes charged, I deem it the duty of this Court to reverse her findings on account of such grave abuse of discretion, as had been previously discussed:<br><blockquote>As a general rule, the Office of the Ombudsman is endowed with a wide latitude of investigatory and prosecutory prerogatives in the exerc,ise of its power to pass upon criminal complaints. However, such authoritx is not absolute; it cannot be exercised arbitrarily or capriciously. Verily, the Constitution has tasked this Court to determine whether or not there as been grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government, including the Office of the Ombudsman. Specifically, <b><u>this Court is mandated to review and reverse the ombudsmans evaluation of the existence, of probable cause, if it has been made with grave abuse of discretion</u></b>.<br><br>x x x x<br><br><b>Grave abuse of discretion refers not merely to palpable errors of jurisdiction; or to violations of the Constitution, the law nd jurisprudence. <u>It refers also to cases in which, for various reasons, there has been a gross misapprehension of facts.</u></b> The present Petition is one such exception, involving serious allegations of multimillion-dollar bribes and unlawful commissions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote><b><u>Prosecutors and the Ombudsman should verify the averments in the complaint and winnow all the documents and testimonies</u></b> not only to build the case but also to spare the state the expenses of a frivolous trial and prevent the unnecessary prosecution of the innocent. In <i>Salapuddin v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> the Court reminds, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Hence, <b><u>even at this stage, the investigating prosecutors are duty-bound to sift through all the documents, objects, and testimonies to determine what may serve as a relevant and competent evidentiary foundation of a possible case against the accused persons. They cannot defer and entirely leave this verification of all the various matters to the courts</u></b>. Otherwise, the conduct of a preliminary investigation would be rendered worthless; the State would still be forced to prosecute frivolous suits and innocent men would still be unnecessarily dragged to defend themselves in courts against groundless charges. Indeed, while prosecutors are not required to determine the rights and liabilities of the parties, <b><u>a preliminary investigation still constitutes a realistic judicial appraisal of the merits of the case</u></b> so that the investigating prosecutor is not excused from the duty to weigh the evidence submitted and ensure that what will be filed in court is only such criminal charge that the evidence and inferences can properly warrant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br></blockquote>Guided by these postulates, the Ombudsman's basis for finding probable cause against each of herein petitioners vis-a-vis the elements of the crimes charged must be considered. For plunder, the following elements must concur:<br><blockquote>1. The offender is a public officer acting by himself or in connivance with members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons.<br><br>2. The offender amasses, accumulates or acquires ill-gotten wealth.<br><br>3. The aggregate amount or total value of the ill-gotten wealth so amassed, accumulated or acquired is at least fifty million pesos (P50,000,000).<br><br>4. Such ill-gotten wealth - defined as any asset, property, business enterprise or material possession of any of the aforesaid persons (the persons within the purview of Section 2, RA 7080) - has been acquired directly or indirectly through dummies, nominees, agents, subordinates and/or business associates by any combination or series of the following means or similar schemes:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(i) through misappropriation, conversion, misuse or malversation of public funds or raids on the public treasury;<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(ii) by receiving, directly or indirectly, any commission, gift, share, percentage, kickbacks or any other form of pecuniary benefit from any person and/or entity in connection with any government contract or project or by reason of the office or position of the public officer concerned;<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(iii) by the illegal or fraudulent conveyance or disposition of assets belonging to the national government or any of its subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities or government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries;<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(iv) by obtaining, receiving or accepting directly or indirectly any shares of stock, equity or any other form of interest or participation including the promise of future employment in any business enterprise or undertaking;<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(v) by establishing agricultural, industrial or commercial monopolies or other combination and/or implementation of decrees and orders intended to benefit particular persons or special interests; or<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(vi) by taking undue advantage of official position, authority, relationship, connection or influence to unjustly enrich himself or themselves at the expense and to the damage and prejudice of the Filipino people and the Republic.<br></div></blockquote>Meanwhile, the elements of the crime of violation of Section 3 (e), RA 3019 are as follows: (a) the offender must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions; (b) he must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence; and (c) his action caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br><b><i>Revilla</i></b><br><br>The majority sustained the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause to indict Revilla for Plunder and violation of Sec. 3(e) of RA 3019, for supposedly amassing ill-gotten wealth by allegedly misappropriating, or supposedly receiving commission for allowing the misappropriation of, the PDAF in conspiracy with and/or by giving unwarranted benefit to Napoles and her cohorts.

Richard A Cambe is indeed an authorized signatory for and in behalf of Senator Revilla. Said verification turned out "positive" because not only was I able to talk to Atty. Cambe, Senator Revilla himself even took the call at that instance and confirmed to me that he authorized Atty. Richard A Cambe to coordinate and facilitate the implementation of his PDAF-funded projects. He likewise confirmed to me the fact that he picked and endorsed the NGOs which will implement his PDAF-funded Projects, and he even admonished me that now that I have been able to talked to him, the PDAF ­ funded project of said NGO should not proceed expeditiously from then on. I did not expect the said admonition by Sen. Revilla, however, I merely replied to him that I am just doing my job.<br></blockquote>Cunanan's testimony jibe with Luy, Sula and Suñas' assertion that Senator Revilla's office participated in the complex scheme to improperly divert PDAF disbursements from designated beneficiaries to NGOs affiliated with or controlled by Napoles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Luy, Sula and Suñas' version of events is supported by: (a) the business ledgers prepared by Luy, showing the amounts received by Senator Revilla as his "commission" from the so-called PDAF scam; (b) the 2007-2009 COA Report documenting the results of the special audit undertaken on PDAF disbursements which found that there were serious irregularities relating to the implementation of PDAF-funded projects, including those sponsored by Senator Revilla; and (c) the results of the independent field verification conducted by the FIO in 2013, which were consistent with the COA's findings and showed that the projects supposedly funded by Senator Revilla's PDAF and implemented by NGOs affiliated with or controlled by Napoles were "ghost" or inexistent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>x x x x<br><br>Based on Luy's testimony, supported by his business ledg rs prepared during his tenure at Napoles' organization, Senator Revilla received kickbacks from the scheme in the aggregate sum of PHP242,512,500.00, mostly coursed through his authorized staff, Cambe.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></blockquote>Notably, the pieces of evidence relied upon by the Ombudsman do not provide sufficient basis for even a <i>prima facie</i> finding of probable cause to believe <b>that Revilla negotiated and agreed with Napoles</b> on: (i) tpe list of projects to be chosen by the lawmaker; (ii) the corresponding IA that would implement the project; (iii) the project cost; (iv) the Napoles-controlled NGO that would implement the project; and (v) the amount of commission or kickback which the lawmaker would receive in exchange for ehdorsing the NGO. Indeed, <b>the Ombudsman's affirmation of these allegations stands on mere inferences and presumptions</b>.<br><br>What is certain is that the Ombudsman surrnised Revilla's involvement with the PDAF scam from the following: (1) his purported signatures appearing in several documents endorsing the NGOs affiliated with Napoles; (2) the testimonies of the so-called "whistleblowers" and (3) the Counter-Affidavits of some of Revilla's co-respondents. As will be discussed, these are neither relevant nor competent, and do not constitute sufficient bases to sustain the finding of probable cause to subject Revilla to continuous prosecution.<br><br><b><u>The PDAF Documents</u></b><br><br>By the PDAF documents, Revilla supposedly coerced the IAs to choose the Napoles NGOs to implement the projects identified by Revilla. The Ombudsman should have been more than wary in accepting such allegations since Revilla, as a member of Congress, was without authority to compel officials or agencies of the executive branch to act at his bidding. The IAs, in fine, simply do not come under the jurisdiction of the Senate, let alone senators. In fact, free from the legislature's control, <b>the IAs are mandated by law to conduct a public bidding in selecting the NGOs that would implement the projects chosen by the legislator</b>.<br><br>The duty of the IAs to conduct a public bidding and oversee the implementation of PDAF projects is at once apparent in the National Budget Circulars (NBC) that the DBM issued.

The choice of the NGO made by the IA, without complying with RA 9184 and similar laws, falls on the IA alone. This is apparent from the very words of the NBI Complaint, which states:<br><blockquote>The COA Special Audit Office Report No. 2012-03 revealed that the livelihood projects were not undertaken by the Implementing Agencies themselves, but by the NGOs endorsed by the Lawmaker. Among the Implementing Agencies mentioned are NABCOR, NLDC, and TRC.<br><br>The arrangement is a blatant disregard of the provisions of the IRR-A of RA 9184 and issuances of GPPB. As per GPPB Resolution No. 12-2007, funds may be transferred to NGOs for implementation when there is an appropriation law or ordinance earmarking an amount to be specifically contracted out to NGOs. <b><u>The Implementing Agencies to where funds were released should have implemented the projects as they are the Implementing Agencies defined in the GAA.</u></b> It is noted that, as per 2007-2009 GAA, NABCOR is not one of those mentioned Implementing Agencies of the Priority program /Projects of the Lawmakers.<br><br><b>The NGOs were not selected in accordance with the Guidelines on Participation of NGOs in Public Procurement prescribed under GPPB Resolution</b>, that is, the selection of NGOs shall either be through competitive bidding, prescribed under Section 21.2.4 of the IRR-A of RA No. 9184.

Among others, the NGOs involved are NAPOLES' NGOs, SDPFFI, MAMFI, POPDFI, APMFI, AEPFFI, CARED, PSDFI.</blockquote>As Revilla maintained all along, his involvement/participation in the release of his PDAF was limited only to the identification and selection of projects or programs listed in the GAA and communicating such selection to the Chair of the Senate Committee on Finance and the Senate President. Any endorsement made by him does not and cannot sway these IAs to act per his will and contrary to legal requirements. It is, therefore, perplexing that Revilla's involvement in the PDAF scam is hinged on apparently worthless "endorsements" of Napoles-controlled NGOs.<br><br>Further, the Ombudsman ought to have exercised caution especially <b>since <u>the "whistleblowers" no less admitted to forging the lawmakers' endorsements of Napoles' NGOs to the IAs</u> along with all other PDAF Documents</b>.

Pagui similarly found the signatures above Revilla's na ne on the PDAF Documents as not belonging to the latter. Atty.

A prime example is the "endorsement" letter addressed to Gondelina Amata of the NLDC dated October 23, 2009, supposedly signed by Revilla. Compared to the standard signatures submitted by Revilla, the signature contained therein lacks the cursive flourishes of his true signatures and instead contains sharp and blunt strokes. Similarly noticeable is the variance of the letterheads used in these various endorsement letters, with some containing supposed bar codes of Revilla's office, others simply a number.<br><br><b>Respondent Ombudsman, however, makes much of the letter dated July 20, 2011 Letter addressed to COA Assistant Commissioner Cuenco, Jr., wherein Revilla supposedly confirmed the authenticity of his and Cambe's signatures on the PDAF documents.

In other words, the foregoing <b>specified questioned signatures are NOT authentic, which mean, <u>said questioned signatures were NOT affixed by Ramon "Bong" Revilla, Jr.</u></b>, whose standard signatures admitted as genuine are those enumerated in item numbers B1 to B30, inclusive, above.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br></blockquote>At the very least, the Azores and Pagui findings should have Impelled the Ombudsman to consider the veracity of the signatures on the PDAF documents given that these experts' findings uniformly detail discrepancies between the signatures in the PDAF documents and Revilla's dmitted genuine specimens of writing. <b>That the Ombudsman failed to even require NBI handwriting experts to study the questioned signatures renders the immediate dismissal of the two handwriting expert's certifications highly suspect.</b> Where the genuineness of the documents is crucial to the respondents' defense, it is more prudent, as stressed in <i>People v. Agresor</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> to allow the opinion of handwriting experts:<br><blockquote><b>The task of determining the genuineness of the handwriting would have been made easier had an expert witness been employed to aid the court in carrying out this responsibility.</b> The records show that counsel for the accused did ask the court for time to file a motion so that the handwriting may be submitted to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to ascertain its authenticity. Such motion was, however, denied by the court, ruling that "The Court itself can determine whether or not that handwriting is the handwriting of the private complainant."<br><br>x x x x<br><br>It is true that the opinion of handwriting experts are not necessarily binding upon the courts, the expert's function being to place before the court data upon which the court can form its own opinion. Ultimately, the value of the expert testimony would still have to be weighed by the judge, upon whom the duty of determining the genuineness of the handwriting devolves. <b>Nevertheless, the handwriting expert may afford assistance in pointing out distinguishing marks, characteristics and discrepancies in and between genuine and false specimens of writing which would ordinarily escape notice or detection from an unpracticed observer. There is no doubt that superior skills along these lines will often serve to direct the attention of the courts to facts, assent to which is yielded not because of persuasion or argument on the part of the expert, but by their own intrinsic merit ahd reasonableness.</b><br><br>As there was a dispute regarding the genuineness of the handwriting, it would have been more prudent if the trial court allowed the presentation of a handwriting expert by the defense. The denial of the request for time to file a motion to have the handwriting examined in effect rendered the right of the accused to have compulsory process to secure the production ofevidence in his behalf nugatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>Being uncontroverted and, in fact, confirmed by the complainants' witnesses, I submit that this forgery of Revilla's signatures and the falsification of the PDAF Documents should have dissuaded the Ombudsman from filing the Infonnations against Revilla.<br><br>Certainly, <b><u>the finding of probable cause to indict a person for plunder cannot be based on <i>admittedly</i> falsified documents</u></b>. While probable cause falls below proof beyond reasonable doubt in the liierarchy of quanta of evidence, it must nonetheless be supported by sufficient, credible and competent evidence, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, <b>there should be facts and circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a prudent and cautious man to believe that the accused is guilty of the crime with which he is charged</b>. Thus, this Court elucidated in <i>Allado v. Diokno</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><blockquote>But then, it appears in the instant case that the prosecutors have similarly misappropriated, if not abused, their discretion. <b>If they really believed that petitioners were probably guilty, they should have armed themselves with facts and circumstances in support of that belief; for mere belief is not enough. <u>They should have presented sufficient and credible evidence to demonstrate the existence of probable cause.</u></b> For the prosecuting officer "is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and ery definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with eamest ess and vigor - indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one."<br><br>In the case at bench, <b>the undue haste in the filing of the information and the inordinate interest of the government cannot be ignored. From the gathering of evidence until the termination of the preliminary investigation, it appears that the state prosecutors were overly eager to file the case</b> and secure a warrant for the arrest of the accused without bail and their consequent detention. x x x<br><br>Indeed, the task of ridding society of criminals and misfits and sending them to jail in the hope that they will in the future reform and be productive members of the community rests both on the judiciousness of judges and the prudence of prosecutors. And, whether it is preliminary investigation by the prosecutor, which ascertains if the respondent should be held for trial, or a preliminary inquiry by the trial judge which determines if an arrest warrant should issue, <b><u>the bottomline is that there is a standard in the determination of the existence of probable cause, i.e., there should be facts and circumstances sufficiently stronin themselves to warrant a prudent and cautious man to believe that the accused is guilty of the crime with which he is charged</u></b>. Judges and prosecutors are not off on a frolic of their own, but rather engaged in a delicate legal duty defined by law and jurisprudence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote><b><u>Testimonies of the Co-Respondents</u></b><br><br>Absent any credible proof of Revilla's actual link or partic pation in the alleged scheme to divert his PDAF to Napoles' NGOs, the Ombudsman should likewise not have accepted hook, line, and sinker any testimony of a participant in the supposed conspiracy.<br><br>It is basic <b>that an extrajudicial confession binds only the confessant or declarant and is inadmissible against his or her co­accused</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> This basic postulate, an extension of the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule, is embodied in Section 28, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, which states:<br><blockquote>SECTION 28. Admission by third party. - The rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another, except as hereinafter provided.<br></blockquote>Under the rule, the testimony made by the confessant is he,arsay and inadmissible as against his co-accused even during the preliminary investigation stage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> We explained why so in <i>Tamargo v. Awingan</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><blockquote><b><u>Considering the paucity and inadmissibility of the evidence presented against the respondents, it would be unfair to hold them for trial.</u></b> Once it is ascertained that no probable cause exists to form a sufficient belief as to the guilt of the accused, they should be relieved from the pain of going through a full blown court case. <b><u>When, at the outset, the evidence offered during the preliminary investigation is nothing more than an uncorroborated extrajudicial confession of an alleged conspirator, the criminal complaint should not prosper so that the system would be spared from the unnecessary expense of such useless and expensive litigation.</u></b> The rule is all the more significant here since respondent Licerio Antiporda remains in detention for the murder charges pursuant to the warrant of arrest issued by Judge Daguna.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br></blockquote>The exception to the above rule, the succeeding Section 30 of Rule 130, requires foremost, the existence of an independent and conclusive proof of the conspiracy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and that the person concerned has <b>performed an overt act</b> in pursuance or furtherance of the complicity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>As discussed above, besides the admittedly falsified and forged PDAF documents, <b>there is no concrete proof showing that Revilla pulled off any "overt act" in furtherance of the supposed conspiracy with Napoles</b>. Other than saying that without Revilla, the scheme would have supposedly failed, the Ombudsman has been unable to point to concrete set of facts to support her conclusion as to the complicity of Revilla to the conspiracy in question. Thus, <b>the conclusion reached by the Ombudsman falls short of the threshold requirement that conspiracy itself must be proved as positively as the commission of the felony itself</b>. The quantum of evidence required is as should be, as conspiracy is a "facile device by which an accused may be ensnared and kept within the penal fold."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>For this reason, I submit that the testimonies of Revilla's co­respondents cannot be taken against him. Yet, the Ombudsman repeatedly and freely cited the <b><i>previously withheld</i></b> counter-affidavits of Revilla's co­respondents in finding probable cause to indict him for Plunder and violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.<br><br>The reliance on these previously suppressed testimonies of Revilla's co-respondents to conjure up probable cause against him is not only violative of the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule, worse, it desecrates the basic rule of due process.<br><br>To recall, the counter-affidavits of Revilla's co-respondents, in which the foregoing statements were contained, were not furnished to Revilla before the Ombudsman rendered the March 28, 2014 Resolution despite Revilla's Motion to be Furnished. In denying the Motion, the Ombudsman held that it had no basis to grant the motion and cited <i>Artillero v. Casimiro</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> But <i>Artillero</i> is not even applicable to the case. <i>First</i>, in <i>Artillero</i>, it was the <i>complainant</i> who claimed denial of due process when he was not furnished with a copy of the counter-affidavit of the accused. Here, it is the petitioner, as <i>accused</i>, requesting for the counter-affidavits of his co-respondents. <i>Second</i>, the complainant in <i>Artillero</i> requested a copy of the counter-affidavit of the accused not because he wanted to answer the counter-charges against him, such as what petitioner intended to do, but because he wanted to file a reply lest his complaint is dismissed for insufficiency of evidence.<br><br>After denying Revilla's Motion to be Furnished and his Motion for Reconsideration, the Ombudsman would suddenly turn around, find Revilla's request in order, and allow him to be furnished copies of the counter-affidavits of some his co-respondents.<br><br>In a bid to justify her initial refusal to provide Revilla with subject affidavits, the Ombudsman stated that Revilla was anyway eventually furnished the desired documents before the rendition of the assailed June 4, 2014 Joint Order (albeit after the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution) and yet chose not to submit his comment within the time given him. Upon this premise, Revilla cannot, as the Ombudsman posited citing <i>Ruivivar v. Office of the Ombudsman</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> be heard about being denied due process having, as it were, "been given ample opportunity to be heard but x x x did not take full advantage of the proffered chance."<br><br>I believe that that the Ombudsman has misread <i>Ruivivar</i>, which, at bottom, is not consistent with the essence of due process: <b>to be heard before a decision is rendered</b>. In <i>Ruivivar</i>, petitioner Ruivivar's motion for reconsideration that paved the way for his being furnished with copis of the affidavits of private respondent's witnesses came <u>after</u> the Ombudsman rendered a decision. In the present case, however, Revilla's request to be furnished with his co-respondents' counter-affidavits preceded the Ombudsman's issuance of her probable cause-finding resolution. Clearly, <b>the accommodation accorded Revilla was belated</b>, <span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, after the qenial of his motion for reconsideration and way after the issuance of the resolution finding probable cause against him. There lies the crucial difference.<br><br>It appears that the Ombudsman issued the May 7, 2014 Joint Order only as an afterthought, as an attempt to address the defects of the preliminary investigation the OOMB conducted on petitioner. However, such Order is of little moment as any comment that Revilla would file would no longer have any bearing precisely because the Ombudsman already issued the Joint Resolution on March 28, 2014 finding probable cause against them.<br><br>Worse, the Court cannot see its way clear on why the Ombudsman limited the grant to few counter-affidavits when it could have allowed Revilla access to all counter-affidavits and other filings of his co­respondents. The Ombudsman conveniently justified the selective1liberality on the notion that only these counter-affidavits contain allegations that tend to incriminate Revilla to the scam. Yet, as pointed out by Revilla, <b>due process does not only cover the right to know and respond to the inculpatory evidence, but also the concomitant right to secure exculpatory evidence. The mere fact of suppression of evidence, regardless of its nature, is enough to violate the due process rigpts of the respondent</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Indeed, <i>Morfe v. Mutuc</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> teaches that <b>the due process requirement is met if official action is free from arbitrariness. But, the Omblidsman's denial and limitation of Revilla's Motion to be Furnished, were arbitrary and unreasonable for there was nothing improper or irregular in Revilla's request</b>. And it cannot be overemphasized in this regard that the requesting petitioners offered to have the requested documents photocopied at his expense. Verily, these limitations <b>coupled with her ue of the counter-affidavits requested against Revilla, without giving him a <u>prior opportunity to know each and every allegation against him</u>, whether from the complainants and their witnesses or his co-respondents</b>, are random, unreasonable, and taint the Ombudsman's actions with grave abuse of discretion for violating the sacred rule of due process. As such, <b><u>the statements contained in the Counter-Affidavits of Revilla's co­respondents cannot be used to find probable cause to indict him</u></b>.<br><br>In <i>Duterte v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> where the petitioners therein1 were not sufficiently apprised of the charges against them during preliminary investigation, this Court ordered the dismissal of the criminal case filed against them, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>We have judiciously studied the case records and we find that the preliminary investigation of the charges against petitioners has been conducted not in the manner laid down in Administrative Order No. 07.<br><br>In the 12 November 1991 Order of Graft Investigator Manriquez, petitioners were merely directed to submit a point-by-point comrltent under oath on the allegations in Civil Case No. 20,550-91 and on SAR No. 91-05. <b>The said order was not accompanied by a single affidavit of any person charging petitioners of any offense as required by law.</b> They were just required to comment upon the allegations in Civil Case No. 20,550-91 of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City which had earlier been dismissed and on the COA Special Audit Report. <b>Petitioners had no inkling that they were being subjected to a preliminary investigation as in fact there was no indication in the order that a preliminary investigation was being conducted.</b> If Graft Investigator Manriquez had intended merely to adopt the allegations of the plaintiffs in the civil case or the Special Audit Report (whose recommendation for the cancellation of the contract in question had been complied with) as his bases for criminal prosecution, then the procedure was plainly anomalous and highly irregular. <b>As a consequence, <u>petitioners' constitutional right to due process was violated</u>.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is GRANTED and Criminal Case No. 23193 is hereby DISMISSED.

Consequently, his right to due process was denied and I believe that this Court is duty-bound to reverse the Ombudsman's action that was tainted with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the counter-affidavits of Revilla's co­respondents are admissible, the testimonies contained therein are inadequate to engender the probability that Revilla was a knowing participant in the alleged scheme to divert the PDAF. Buenaventura simply testified in general terms that that she confirmed the authenticity of the authorization given by Revilla<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> without specifying how she made such confir ation or providing the details of the documents and transactions involved.

Figura's declaration of having no power to "simply disregard the wishes of [Revilla]" is a clearly baseless assumption.<br><br>Meanwhile, a closer look of Cunanan's testimony, which was a critical part of the Ombudsman's Resolutions, bares the infirmity of his claim. While he could have easily asked for a written confirmation of the authorization given by Revilla to Cambe, Cunanan himself admitted that he, instead, supposedly sought verification over the telephone. Yet, an audio recording of the alleged telephone conversation was not presented or even mentioned. Not even a transcript of the alleged telephone conversation was attached to Cunanan's Counter-Affidavit.<br><br>Section 1, Rule 11 of the Rules on Electronic Evidence provides that an audio evidence, such as a telephone conversation, is admissible only if it is presented, explained, or authenticated, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. <i>Audio, video and similar evidence</i>. - Audio, photographic and video evidence of events, acts or transactions shall be admissible provided is shall be shown, presented or displayed to the court and shall be identified, explained or authenticated by the person who made the recording or by some other person competent to testify on the accuracy thereof.<br></blockquote>Given that no audio evidence of the telephone conversation was presented, much less "identified, explained or authenticated," the occurrence of the alleged telephone conversation is rendered highly suspect, if not improbable, and any testimony thereon is inadmissible and of no probative<br><br>But granting, <i>arguendo</i>, that Cunanan did call Revilla's office, it still begs the question of how he could have recognized or confirmed the identity of the person he was speaking with over the phone and not face-to-face. There is no indication, and Cunanan never even hinted, that he was closely familiar with Revilla's voice that he can easily recognize it over the phone in a single conversation.<br><br>This Court had previously declared that the person with whom the witness was conversing on the telephone <b><u>must first be reliably identified before the telephone conversation can be admitted in evidence and given probative value</u></b>. In <i>Sandoval v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> the Court held, thus:<br><blockquote>It must also be stressed that, <b>as a matter of reliability and trustworthiness, a telephone conversation must first be authenticated before it can even be received in evidence.

Worst, the record does not even divulge the alleged employee at the HRET Office of the Secretary from whom the purported caller asked about the releyant matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br></blockquote>A similar conclusion was reached by this Court in <i>People v. Wagas</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> where it ruled, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Finally, Ligaray's declaration that it was Wagas who had transacted with him over the telephone was not reliable because <b>he did not exp ain how he determined that the person with whom he had the telephone conversation was really Wagas whom he had not yet met or known before then. <u>We deem it essential for purposes of reliability and trustworthiness that a telephone conversation</u></b> like that one Ligaray supposedly had with the buyer of rice to <b><u>be first authenticated before it could be received in evidence</u></b>. Among others, the person with whom the witness conversed by telephone should be first satisfactorily identified by voice recognition or any other means. <b>Without the authentication, incriminating another person just by adverting to the telephone conversation with him would be all too easy.</b> In this respect, an identification based on familiarity with the voice of the caller, or because of clearly recognizable peculiarities of the caller would have sufficed. The identity of the caller could also be established by the caller's self­identification, coupled with additional evidence, like the context and timing of the telephone call, the contents of the statement challenged, internal patterns, and other distinctive characteristics, and disclosure of knowledge of facts known peculiarly to the caller.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Verily, it is only fair that the caller be <b><u>reliably identified first before a telephone communication is accorded probative weight</u></b>.

This holds especially true for testimonies that not only try to relieve the affiant from responsibility but also seek to pass the blame to others. The Ombudsman, however, utterly failed to do so and simply accepted the co-respondents' declarations as the gospel truth, unmindful that a neglect to closely sift through the affidavits of the parties can still force the unhecessary prosecution of frivolous cases. By itself, this neglect constitutes a grave abuse of discretion, which should be reversed by this Court.<br><br><b><u>Whistleblowers' Testimonies</u></b><br><br>Anent the elements of the crimes charged, the gravamen of the crime of Plunder is the accumulation by the accused of ill-gotten wealth amounting to at least Fifty Million Pesos (P50,000,000.00). In a bid to satisfy this element against Revilla, the Ombudsman heavily relied on the testilnonies of the whistleblowers, Luy, Sula, and Suñas. Yet, <b>none of the witnesses stated that they deposited money representing the alleged commissios to any of Revilla's accounts. Not one of them testified that they personally handed money or saw anyone handing/delivering money to Revilla as commission/kickback</b>.<br><br>The closest thing passed as proof by the complainants is the private and personal records of Luy. But, even <b>Luy himself admitted his lack of personal knowledge of Revilla's involvement in the PDAF scam, much less of the former senator receiving money from it</b>. In his September 12, 2013 <i>Karagdagang Sinumpaang Salaysay</i>, Luy stated:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"><em>T: </em></div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"><em>Mayroon bang pagkakataon na ikaw mismo ay nakapagbigay ng pera ng "rebates" ng transaction sa Senador o Congressman o sa kung sinomang representative ng pulitiko?</em></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"><em>S: </em></div></td><td><div align="justify"><em>Opo.

The hearsay nature of Luy's testimony regarding Revilla's receipt of money from his PDAF is again highlighted in Luy's Sworn Statement of November 8, 2013, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"><em>Q: </em></div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"><em>How can you tell that Janet Lim Napoles already gave, the commissions or kickbacks to Sen.

Yet, <b><u>there is nothing to prove that Revilla received the said money from Cambe or that Cambe's alleged receipt of the said money was under his authority or instruction</u></b>.<br><br>For this and for the fact that there is absolutely nothing competent and relevant that can sway a reasonable man to believe that Revilla had participated in the PDAF scheme, I vote for the reversal of the Ombudsman's finding of probable cause to indict Revilla for plunder and violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 on account of grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>It must not be forgotten that the crimes involved in these clases are Plunder and violation of Section 3 (e), RA 3019-two grave charges that can strip a man of his good name and liberty, as in this case. The Ombudsman should not have found probable cause to indict Revilla given that there is nothing but falsified documents, hearsay testimonies and declarations barred by the <i>res inter alios acta</i> that support the complaints. Worse, the Ombudsman violated the due process protection of the Constitution in citing affidavits and testimonies not previously furnished Revilla. Without doubt, the Assailed Resolutions, insofar as it found probable cause against Revilla, were tainted with grave abuse of discretion.<br><br><b><i>Cambe</i></b><br><br>As to Cambe, the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolution of the respondent OOMB briefly outlines his alleged participation in the conspiracy, thus:<br><blockquote><b>Senator Revilla x x x authorized in writing his Chief-of-Staff Cambe to act for, deal with, and sign documents necessary</b> for the immediate and timely implementation of his PDAF-funded projects. From 2006 to 2012, Senator Revilla, <b>through Cambe, issued several indorsement letters</b> to NABCOR, TRC, and NLDC, expressly naqting the following NGOs to carry out his PDAF projects: AEPFFI, APMFI, MAMFI, PSDFI, and SDPFFI.<br><br>Once a PDAF allocation becomes available to Senator Revilla; his office or staffwould advise Napoles or her employees or cohorts about it. Napoles or witness Luy would then prepare a listing of the projects available indicating the IAs. This listing would be sent to <b>Cambe who would sign and indorse the same to the DBM under his authority as Chief-of-Staff of Senator Revilla</b>. After the listing is released to, the DBM, the Office of Senator Revilla then formally requests the DBM to release his PDAF; Napoles, in the meantime, would advance to Revilla, through Cambe, a down payment representing a portion of his commission or kickback. After the SARO and/or NCA is released, Napoles would give the full payment for the delivery to Senator Revilla through Cambe.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Significantly, after the DBM issues the SARO, Senator Revilla, through Cambe, would then write another letter addressed to the IAs which would identify and indorse Napoles' NGOs as his preferred NGO to undertake the PDAF-funded project. x x x (emphasis added, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>In fine, the Ombudsman, in its Joint Resolution, attempted to establish Cambe's liability by presenting an elaborate, complicated schem¢ wherein he purportedly conspired with Revilla, <i>et al.</i> and the whistleb owers to allegedly enable Revilla to illegally acquire and amass portions of the PDAF through kickbacks.<br><br>Cambe's participation in the alleged conspiracy scheme to amass wealth, therefore, hinges on his participation as staff member of Sen. Revilla, and his purported signatures on the PDAF documents. On this point, Cambe argued that all his signatures in the PDAF documents were forged, and, thus, his participation in the conspiracy scheme has not been adequately established.<br><br>To underscore his point, he presented the examination report dated December 5, 2013 of Atty. Pagui, the forensic document examiner who examined the purported signatures of Cambe appearing on the PDAF documents, and compared them with various standard signaturespresented by Cambe. In his report, Atty. Pagui concluded:<br><blockquote>(1) Between questioned signature marked <br>"Q" and standard signatures:<br><br>Questioned signature reveals inner loop lying horizontally which shows uncertainty or writing direction coupled with unnecessary pen tops and pen lifts at wrong places, signs of uncertainty of direction of writing strokes, likewise presence of slow and tremulous strokes indicative of unfamiliarity of habitual writing movements that resulted to simulation from certain model genuine signature.

Pagui, nor did it squarely address the allegation of forgery. It immediately dismissed the argument by saying:<br><blockquote>Forgery is not presumed; it must be proved by clear, positive, and convincing evidence and the burden of proof lies on the party alleging forgery.<br></blockquote>Further, as gathered from the March 28, 2014 Joint Resolption, the fact of Cambe, acting on his own as a public officer, amassing or acquiring ill-gotten wealth amounting to at least Fifty Million Pesos (P50,000,000.00) through any of the means provided under the plunder law or acting in violation of RA 3019 has not been demonstrated.<br><br>The Ombudsman simply relied heavily on the statements of Luy, Sula, and Suñas, who confessed to having conspired with Napoles in executing this scheme. From their statements, the Ombudsman pieced together the participation of Revilla, Cambe, and the other petitioners. Thus, Cambe asserts that the whistleblowers' statements cannot be used against him under the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule.<br><br>Respondents, through the OSG, claim that the case against Cambe fall under the exception to such rule.<br><br>I am unable to agree. The exception to the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule, as earlier indicated, in Section 30 of Rule 130 provides:<br><blockquote>Section. 30. Admission by conspirator. - The act or declaration Qf a conspirator relating to the conspiracy and during its existence, may: be given in evidence against the co-conspirator after the conspiracy is shown by evidence other than such act or declaration.<br></blockquote><i>People v. Cachuela</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> succinctly dwells on the application the rule and its exception, thus:<br><blockquote>At any rate, Nabilgas' extrajudicial confession is inadmissiblin evidence against the appellants in view of the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule. This rule provides that the rights of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another. Consequently, an extrajudicial confession is binding only on the confessant and is not admissible against his or her co-accused because it is considered as hearsay against them.<br><br>An exception to the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule is an admission made by a conspirator under Section 30, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court. This provision states that the act or declaration of a conspirator relating to the conspiracy, and during its existence, may he given in evidence against the co-conspirator after the conspiracy is shown by evidence other than such act or declaration. Thus, in order that the admission of a conspirator may be received against his or her co-conspirators, it is necessary that: (a) the conspiracy be first proved by evidence other than the admission itself; (b) the admission relates to the common object; and (c) it has been niade while the declarant was engaged in carrying out the conspiracy.<br><br>This exception, however, does not apply in the present case since there was no other piece of evidence presented, aside from the extrajudicial confession, to prove that Nabilgas conspired with the appellants in committing the crime charged. Conspiracy cannot be presumed and must be shown as distinctly and conclusively as the crime itself Nabilgas, in fact, was acquitted by the trial court due to insufficiency of evidence to prove his participation in the crime.<br></blockquote>The requisites to bring a given set of facts under the exceptjon to the <i>res inter alios acta</i> rule were not met in the present case. Consider:<br><br><i>First</i>, the alleged conspiracy has yet to be established by competent evidence. Except for the whistleblowers' admissions/statements, no other evidence was adduced to show that Cambe agreed to commit plunder or any crime. In fact, these statements heavily relied upon do not even establish Cambe's participation in the scheme or imply any wrongdoing on his part. The PDAF documents made much of by respondents are tainted with falsehood, as the whistleblowers themselves admitted, and can hardly be viewed to be independent and credible evidence to establish said conspiracy.<br><br>The fact that some of the PDAF Documents Cambe purportedly signed were notarized is of no moment in light of the admissions, made by the "whistle-blowers" that they themselves did the "notarization." In his <i>Karagdagang Sinumpaang Salaysay</i> dated September 12, 2013,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> Luy admitted that Napoles' employees kept the dry seals and notarial registers of several notary publics and used them to "notarize" the PDAF Documents:<br><blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify"><em>107. </em></div></td><td width="95%"><div align="justify"><em>T: Nabanggit mo na ang ginagawaga ninyong report of disbursement ay notarized, saan ninyo ito dinadala para ipanotarize?</em></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"><em>S: Doon din lang sa opisina ng JLN Corporation po.</em></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"><em>108.</em></div></td><td><div align="justify"><em> T: Kilala mo ba kung sino ang nagno-notarize ng report of disbursement na ginagawa ninyo?</em></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"><em>S: <u><strong>Bale ipinipirma na naming iyon mga attorney.

This includes the forging and falsification of official documents to make it appear their issuance was authorized by legislators and their staff. Any alleged participation of Cambe as related to by the whistleblowers is hearsay considering that their supposed knowledge as to Cambe's role has Napoles, as source.<br><br>Moreover, Cambe's alleged receipt of P224,512,500.00 for Revilla and 5% for himself from the years 2006 to 2010, which purportedly represent their commissions, "rebates," or "kickbacks" for endorsing Napoles' NGOs was never corroborated by any independent evidence aside from the whistleblowers' testimonies. The business ledgers Luy submitted cannot be considered as such independent evidence since they are still based on Luy's statement. The allegation made by Cunanan of the TRC in his counter-affidavit pertaining to his phone conversation with Cambe and Revilla, has not been corroborated and does not establish any wrongdoing on the part of Cambe or Revilla.<br><br><i>Finally</i>, public respondents never refuted the fact that these statements were made after the purported conspiracy had ceased. Luy, Sula, and Suñas only executed their respective admissions/statements sometime in September 2013, long after they have completed the alleged scheme.<br><br>What may be taken as independent evidence gathered during the FIO and the NBI's investigations consisted of endorsement letters, MOAs, and other documentation. They are of little evidentiary value, however, as they have been shown to have been falsified and forged by Luy, Sula, and Suñas upon Napoles' instructions. The COA report which found PDAF projects to be inexistent or have never been implemented is also insufficient as to Cambe, as his alleged participation is predicated on the forged indorsement letters, MOAs, and other documents. Even the MOAs allegedly executed by the NGOs, the implementing agencies, and Cambe as representative of Revilla, were admitted to have been "<i>notarized</i>" by Napoles' cohorts, not by legitimate notaries. Owing to this aberration, the MOAs do not enjoy the presumption of regularity and cannot be considered to be credible evidence to establish probable cause against Cambe.<br><br>Aside from the whistleblowers' own admission of forgery, handwriting experts Azores and Pagui had evaluated the authenticity of the PDAF documents and had determined that the signatures on the PDAF documents were not made by one and the same person. The testimonies of these experts cannot simply be swept aside by mere resort to legal arguments, but must be addressed and refuted by superior contrary evidence. Until then, the shifted burden to establish the authenticity of the documents rests with public respondents. The evaluation by the Special Panel of Investigators as to such authenticity would not, in context, suffice to overturn the expert testimonies of Azores and Pagui since the Special Panel is not experts in the field of handwriting analysis.<br><br>The Ombudsman's selective appreciation of certain critical testimonial evidence is a badge of grave abuse of discretion. She, for instance, accepted as gospel truth the accusatory statements of Luy, Sula, and Suñas insofar as the alleged participation of Revilla and Catibe in the scam is concerned, but in the same breath disregarded their admission of forgery and fabrication of the PDAF documents. In fine, the Ombudsman viewed as true those portions of the whistleblowers' statements which would support the prosecution's version despite contrary evidence presented by petitioners.<br><br>Considering the apparent whimsical and capnctous approach thus taken by the Ombudsman, I submit that this Court should have exercised its power of judicial review. <b>Tolerating the practice of establishing probable cause based on forged or questionable documents would expose the criminal justice system to malicious prosecution.</b> It will create a dangerous precedent. It will encourage unscrupulous individuals to file trumped up charges based on fictitious, spurious, or manipulated documents. Malicious lawsuits designed to harass the innocent will proliferat, in clear violation of their rights enshrined by no less than the Constitution. This, I cannot allow.<br><br>To repeat, a preliminary investigation serves to protect the innocent from hasty, and oppressive prosecution and the state from having to conduct useless, but expensive trials.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Wrote the Court in <i>Cabahug v. People</i>:<br><blockquote>We cannot overemphasize the admonition to agencies tasked with the preliminary investigation and prosecution of crimes that the very purpose of a preliminary investigation is to shield the innocent rom precipitate, spiteful and burdensome prosecution. They are duty-bound to avoid, unless absolutely necessary, open and public accusation of crime not only to spare the innocent the trouble, expense and torment of a public trial, but also to prevent unnecessary expense on the part of the State for useless and expensive trials. Thus, <b>when at the outset the evidence cannot sustain a <i>prima facie</i> case or that the existence of prob ble cause to form a sufficient belief as to the guilt of the accused cannot be ascertained, the prosecution must desist from inflicting on any person the trauma of going through a trial</b>. (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted.)<br></blockquote><b><i>Napoles</i></b><br><br>Like Revilla and Cambe, Napoles also attributes grave abuse of discretion on the Ombudsman for finding probable cause for plunder against her, it being her submission that the elements of the crime have not been alleged and established. The FIO and NBI complaints, as well as the Joint Resolution have, to her, failed to establish that the alleged conspiracy was for the common design or purpose of enriching a public officer or that the proceeds of the PDAF landed in the pockets of any public officer. She points out that the Joint Resolution repeatedly held that the alleged <i>modusi operandi</i> was geared towards helping her, a private individual, obtain personal gain. She argues that since it was supposedly her, Napoles, who was enriched in the alleged conspiracy, then the plunder case is improper.<br><br>Assuming, Napoles continues, that she advanced money to Revilla prior to the release of the SARO, then his monetary gain cannot be considered as coming from the public coffers. Aside from this, Napoles denies being affiliated with the NGOs involved in the implementation of the PDAF projects and that nowhere in the documentary evidence adduced was it shown that she received any check from the implementing agencies.<br><br>Napoles obviously misinterpreted the charges against her and the trajectory of the Joint Resolution. This resolution, far from driving home the idea, as Napoles posits, that the conspiracy in question intended to enrich her, a private individual, clearly stated that the conspiratorial acts were "plainly geared towards a common goal which was to amass, acquire and accumulate ill-gotten wealth amounting to at least PhP224,512,500.00."<br><br>While I submit that the Court can accord merit to Napoles' assertion respecting the undue reliance of the Ombudsman on inadmissible vidence, such as the statements and ledgers submitted by Luy, I concur with the majority that the Ombudsman's finding as to the existence of probable cause to charge Napoles is substantiated. Her argument that no evidence was presented to show her affiliation to the NGOs and the implementation of the PDAF-financed projects holds no water. <b><u>Save for her bare denials, Napoles did not submit any contrary evidence which would support her claim.</u></b><br><br>On the contrary, the Ombudsman, through the efforts of the FIO and the NBI, was able to secure <b><u>the statements of Napoles' former employees, to independently establish how she set-up NGOs</u></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> <b><u>and colluded with people in and out of the government to acquire the proceeds of the PDAF of various legislators</u></b>. Notably, an employee, Mary Arlene Baltazar, categorically testified having been instructed by Napoles to rorge the signatures of directors in her NGO, as well as the signatures of listed beneficiaries in the PDAF-funded projects, and to shred documents related to the PDAF scheme. Counter-affidavits of the public officers from the implementing agencies involved also admitted having coordinated with Napoles in processing the projects.<br><br>Napoles' claim that the NBI and FIO Complaints, purportedly lacking as they do certain data, e.g., dates and places, are insufficient in form and in substance to support a criminal charge for plunder is specious. As correctly pointed out by the OOMB, all the integral parts of a valid complaint, as required by Section 6, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court, quoted below are explicitly indicated:<br><blockquote>Section 6. Sufficiency of complaint or information. - A complaint or information is sufficient if it states the name of the accused; the designation of the offense given by the statute; the acts or omissions complained of as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party; the approximate date of the commission of the offense; and the place where the offense was committed.<br><br>When an offense is committed by more than one person, all of them shall be included in the complaint or information. (6a)<br></blockquote>A cursory reading of the NBI and FIO complaints would show substantial compliance with the above provision. All the accused were specifically named, the designation of the offenses charged clearly indicated, and the acts allegedly constituting the offenses and where they were committed enumerated. Considering the offenses charged, it was correctly indicated that the State is the offended party. As for the date of when the offenses were committed, it is sufficient if, as here, the approxim te period of commission, <i>i.e.</i>, span of four years starting from and ending on, is provided, the exact date of the commission of the crime not being an element in either Plunder or violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019.<br><br><b><i>De Asis</i></b><br><br>The crux of De Asis' petition resembles that of Napoles.<br><br>The assailed joint resolution and order, De Asis asserts, did not find KPMFI-of which he is supposed to be president-as among te NGOs used as a conduit in the PDAF Scam. A finding of probable caue against him, in spite of KPMFI's alleged non-involvement, is, therefore, without factual and legal basis since the SARO itself controverted his alleged involvement.<br><br>Contrary to De Asis' posture, the NBI Complaint mentioned KPMFI as one of those NGOs that served as conduits in the implementation of Revilla's 2006-2012 PDAF. While the assailed joint resolution and order did not indeed mention KPMFI as one of the conduit NGOs, the COA Report alleged that verification is still ongoing as to it since its SARO was only released in March 2012.<br><br>Even assuming, as De Asis urges, that he had no participation in the incorporation of KPMFI, there remains the fact that his acts cont ibuted to the furtherance of the illegal scheme. His admitted participatipn aided Napoles and her cahoots to illegally acquire ill-gotten wealth at the expense of the public. His acts alone in receiving and depositing checks in NGO bank accounts, albeit generally harmless, enabled Napoles to withdraw the money and funnel the funds from the PDAF.<br><br>It bears stressing that De Asis, in his counter-affidavit, admitted picking up checks for Napoles' NGOs as he was "instructed" to do so. Yet, De Asis avers that the performance of his duties as Napoles' driver and messenger does not establish criminal intent. He maintains that the mere act of performing his routine duties can hardly be construed as overt criminal acts of plunder or a willful participation on his part to commit the same. Moreover, he had no knowledge of the purpose for which he performed his duties and, as far as he was concerned, he merely did his job in good faith.<br><br>I am not persuaded.<br><br>The term <i>good faith</i> is commonly descriptive of that state of mind denoting honesty of intention, and freedom from knowledge of circumstances which ought to put the holder upon inquiry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> Good faith is actually a matter of intention. Albeit internal, a person's intention is judged by relying not on his own protestations of good faith, which is self-serving, but on evidence of his conduct and outward acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>Applying the foregoing tenets, the Ombudsman aptly point$d out the inconsistency of De Asis' acts with the principle of good faith. Routinely withdrawing and delivering huge sums of cash for Napoles and producing fictitious list of beneficiaries and liquidation reports would make a reasonable person doubt the legitimacy of his employer's business. De Asis, as Napoles' employee, possesses knowledge of facts and circumstances, which can put one wary of his employer's nature of business. Possessing this knowledge while continuously participating in the illegal scheme, even if instructed by his employer, is tantamount to acquiescence in the illegal act, thus belying his <i>bona fide</i> claim.<br><br><b><i>Lim</i></b><br><br>In like manner, I concur with the majority that probable cause exists against petitioner Lim.<br><br>While he was not included as respondent in the FIO complaint, Lim's name, along with four others, was mentioned as one of those who would deliver the money from the office of JLN in Pasig City to Napoles' house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> The Ombudsman had, thus, a valid reason to assume Lim's likely involvement in criminal activities and to proceed against him.<br><br>Lim contends that Ombudsman, in charging him with Plunder, proceeded on the theory she erroneously deduced from the ensuing accounts of Luy and Suñas, that he prepares and delivers the kickbacks and commissions to the concerned lawmakers, thus:<br><blockquote>4.1 Kakausapin ni Gng. Napoles ang lawmaker na makakapagbigay ng pondo, at pagkakasunduan nila ang komisyon o kickback na dapat matanggap ng kausap niya. Alam namin ito dahil sinasama niya kami noon sa mga ilang meetings niya sa mga lawmakers, at ito rin ang kinagawidn na sa mga sumunod niyang mga transaksyon. At nakokompirma naming ito tuwing nag-uutos si Gng. Napoles sa amin na maghanda o magpadala ng pera para sa mga nakausap niya. Ang kasama naming na laging naghahanda ng pera ay sina Ronald John Lim at x x x De Asis.<br></blockquote>According to Lim, there is no allegation that he delivered kickbacks and commissions to the lawmakers. Luy and Suñas merely stated that he (Lim) would usually prepare the money, a scenario different ifrom the concept of being involved in the delivery of money.<br><br>This contention is bereft of merit.<br><br>While preparation or segregation and the actual delivery arseparate acts, they are interconnected with a common objective. It is immaterial, thus, whether Lim only prepared or segregated the money, actually delivered it or both. The fact is, there is probable cause to believe that he performed a role in the consummation of the crime of Plunder.<br><br>Further, evidence shows that there is probable cause to believe that Lim cooperated in order to divert the PDAF to their own poqkets. By rendering assistance in the delivery of money, Lim is deemed to have conspired in the illegal transaction. Under these circumstances, Lim is as much liable as the principal because of his overt and indispensable cooperation in perpetuating the scam.<br><br>At this juncture, it is necessary to state that Revilla is not the only named public officer involved in this issue. There are others against whom the Ombudsman found probable cause. Thus, Lim, being a private individual, may be charged with Plunder, there being probable cause to believe that he acted in concert with some public officers.<br><br><b><i>Relampagos, Nuñez, Paule, Bare</i></b><br><br>Petitioners Relampagos, Nuñez, Paule and Bare assail the November 13, 2015 and May 13, 2015 Resolutions of the Sandiganbayan that sustained the finding of probable cause against them in Criminal Case Nos. SB-14-CRM-0268, 0269, 0272, 0273, 0275, 0276, 0279, and 0280. In particular, they maintain that, contrary to the graft court's affirmatory findings, undue haste did not characterize the issuance of the concerned SAROs,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> which their office is not in charge of processing in the first place. Petitioners also argue that Luy himself admitted that he is not aware of any "kickbacks" given to DBM officers and employees. Thus, for the petitioners, the Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion in remaining adamant in its refusal to dismiss the foregoing criminal cases against them.<br><br>I submit that the issues raised by the parties are ripe for adjudication and easily verifiable by the submissions of the parties. To wait for trial will only unnecessarily prolong the disposition of the case. On this note, Sec. 6, Rule 112 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a judge "may immediately dismiss the case if the evidence on record clearly1 fails to establish probable cause."<br><br>As borne by the records, the Ombudsman initially found probable cause to charge petitioners Relampagos, <i>et al.</i> for sixteen (16) counts of violation of Sec. 3 (e), RA 3019 on account of Luy's testimony that petitioners are Napoles' contact in the DBM. Yet, even Luy himself twice admitted during the September 12, 2013 Senate Blue Ribbon Committee that petitioners did not receive any part of the PDAF, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz</span>:<br><blockquote><i>The Chairman: So, ang hatian - sa legislator, sa line agency na nagimplement.

Some excerpts of that testimony:<br><blockquote><i>Q: I have a PDAF processed flow chart. It's a processed flow for 2007 to 2009.

However, the GAAs for FYs 2007, 2008, and 2009 already dispensed with this requirement, when they provided a menu of programs/projects as well as the list of IAs authorized to implement them. DBM Circular Letter No. 2015-1, s. 2015, in fact did away with the endorsement of the IA as a <i>sine qua non</i> requirement before a SARO issues. It provides:<br><blockquote>1. This Circular is being issued to clarify the application of NBC No. 476 dated September 20, 2001 to PDAF releases for FY 2005 and ears thereafter in view of the related disallowances and cases filed agAinst DBM officials and employees.<br><br>2. In this regard, this Department hereby clarifies that beginning FY 2005 and in the succeeding fiscal years, all PDAF allocation were directly released to implementing agencies pursuant to the express provisioris of Special Provision of the FY 2005 [GAA] which already included a list of programs, projects and [IAs] (PDAF menu) upon which the requests for release of funds were evaluated as to consistency with the prognims, projects and [IAs] listed in the PDAF menu, to wit:<br><br><u>FY 2005 GAA and FY 2006 reenacted budget [FY 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010]</u><br><br>1. Use and Release of the Fund: The amount appropriated herein shall be used to fund priority programs and projects under the ten point agenda of the national government and <b><u>shall be released directly to the [IAs] as indicated hereunder</u></b>, to wit:<br><br>x x x x<br><br><u>FY 2010 GAA</u><br><br>1. Use and Release of the Fund: The amount appropriated herein hall be used to fund priority programs and projects of the national government and <b><u>shall be released directly to the [IAs] as indicated hereunder</u></b>, to wit:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>3. Consequently, the requirement for the submission of project profile and endorsement by the [IAs] previously required under NBC No. 476, is already effectively superseded by the enactment of the FY 2005 GAA. The submission of project profile and endorsement by the [IAs] were no longer necessary considering that the details required in the project profiles land endorsements under NBC No. 476 were already provided for in the PDAF menu under the GAA for FYs 2005 and succeeding fiscal years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup><br></blockquote>As a related point, it bears to stress that the SAROs were issued and released only four (4) to nine (9) days following the DBM's rec ipt of the requests for their issuance. The DBM Citizens' Charter, however, provides that the total processing time of such request should be for less than 10 hours. Clearly then, if petitioners were to be censured, it shoud be for tardiness, not for acting with "undue haste."<br><br><center><b>Final Note</b><br></center><br>Without belaboring the obvious, the presumption of innocence, and all rights associated with it, remains even at the preliminary investigatlon stage.
