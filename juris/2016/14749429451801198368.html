The written protest was filed on the same day at the office of, the City Treasurer of Cebu City albeit that protest-letter is dated October 6, 2009. (Records, pp. 95 to 99)<br><br>The jCity Treasurer of Cebu did not act on [NGCP's] written protest. Petitioner NGCP, with main office in [Quezon City], sent its appeal, by way of registered mail on March 11, 2010, to the LBAA of Cebu City. On April 22, 2010, petitioner NGCP received copies of its verified Petition from the Post Office of Diliman, [Quezon City] with notation "RTS, insufficient address, 4-14-10." On April 26, 2010, NGCP filed its Motion to Admit Petition with the LBAA of Cebu City. In July 2010[,] the LBAA directed the City Treasurer and City Assessor of Cebu City to file their Comment on [NGCP's] Motion. The City Assessor[,] on his own, did not interpose any objection. The City Attorney, however, opposed the, same in his Comment/Opposition on [the] ground that the NGCP's Petition was filed out of time and prayed the Local Board to dismiss the same accordingly. On October 12, 2010, the Local Board of Assessment Appeals of Cebu City issued the assailed Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br><center><b><u>The LBAA's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The LBAA ruled in favor of the City Assessor and dismissed NGCP's petition for being filed out of time. The Order reads:<br><blockquote>On June 17, 2010, the Board issued twin orders: one addressed to [the] City Assessor's Office and the other to the City Treasurer's Office. The gist of the Order is to seek the opposition/comments of both offices as to <i>"whether dr not this case may be given due course."</i><br><br>On July 16, 2010, respondent City Assessor filed his Comment [and] cited that the tax declarations referred to in the subject petition are properties [declared in the name of NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION/TRANSCO.<br><br>On July 27, 2010, the Office of the City Attorney, Cebu City, filed its Comment/Opposition to the Petitioner's Motion to Admit Petition, for respondent Cebu City Assessor Eustaquio B. Cesa. For grounds cited therein, it prayed that an Order be issued DISMISSING the instant Petition for being filed out of time.<br><br>After;careful examination of the pleadings filed, this Board found merit to the opposition of the respondent [City Assessor]. Hence, the Board hereby DISMISSES the instant petition, as having been filed out of time.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby <i>DISMISSED for lack of merit.</i><br><br>SO ORDERED<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>NGCP filed a notice of appeal with memorandum on appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated 9 December 2010 with the CBAA. NGCP argued that (1) its petition before the LBAA was timely filed; (2) it had the legal personality to file the petition before the LBAA; and (3) NGCP is exempt from payment of the real property taxes subject matter of the second and final notices of demand dated 16 and 21 September 2009 in the total amount of P2,792,862.41.<br><br><center><b><u>The CBAA's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The CBAA dismissed NGCP's appeal. The CBAA found NGCP liable for real property taxes on the subject properties for the year 2009.<br><br>The CBAA stated that the petition of NGCP mailed on 11 March 2010 in the Quezon City Post Office for the LBAA of Cebu City was timely filed. The CBAA cited the following provision of Section 229(b) of the Local Government Code: "The proceedings of the Board shall be conducted solely for the purpose of ascertaining the facts without necessarily adhering to technical rules applicable in judicial proceedings." The LBAA's Order dismissing NGCP's appeal was based on a technicality and did not resolve the merits of the case. The CBAA took notice that a postal courier would probably know the locations of the offices of the City Assessor and City Treasurer but not of the LBAA. The CBAA further stated that many people, even lawyers, do not know that LBAA offices exist.<br><br>The CBAA also stated that NGCP has the legal personality to institute an appeal. The CBAA cited Section 226<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> of the Local Government Code and pronounced that NGCP has a legal interest in the properties of NPC/TRANSCO because NGCP is TRANSCO's concessionaire for electric transmission.<br><br>The CBAA declared that Section 9<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of Republic Act No. 9511 (RA 9511), NGQP's franchise, does not exempt it from payment of real property taxes oh the subject properties. Section 234(a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of the Local Government Code instead states that a taxable entity like NGCP, as the beneficial user of the subject properties, is liable for the real property tax. Moreover, it is the City Treasurer's duty to collect the real property tax based on the assessment of the City Assessor. The City Assessor, not the City Treasurer, has the power to decide whether a property is exempt from real property tax.<br><br>The CBAA further declared that NGCP should claim from NPC/TRANSCO the refund of the taxes due for the years 2001 to 2008. The CBAA found that the subject properties are declared in the name of NPC/TRANSCO] and the notices of demand were addressed to NPC/TRANSCO. NPC/TRANSCO made a formal turn-over of the power transmission operation to NGCP on 15 January 2009; hence, NGCP received the notices on 24[September 2009. NGCP paid the assessed amount to City Treasurer Oliva under protest, which amount included taxes due for the years 2001 to 2008.<br><br>Finally, the! CBAA ruled that the subject properties do not qualify as a special class of real property under Sections 216<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and 218(d)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> of the Local Government Code. Although the subject properties are owned by NPC/TRANSCO,' the subject properties are used by NGCP, a taxable private entity engaged in the generation and transmission of electric power.<br><br>NGCP filed a motion for partial reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> on 17 June 2011 with the CBAA. NGCP prayed that (1) the CBAA declare the real properties covered by the ; Second and Final Notices of Demand dated 16 and 21 September 2009 as exempt from payment of real property tax in accordance with RA 9511; (2) the CBAA direct the reclassification of the subject properties as exempt from the payment of real property tax; (3) the CBAA direct the' cancellation of the real property tax billing on the subject properties; and (4) the CBAA direct the refund to NGCP of the payment of taxes that NGCP paid under protest. In the alternative, NGCP asked that the CBAA classify the subject properties as a special class under Section 216 of the Local Government Code, and assess the real property taxes at 10% of the fair market value as provided under Section 218(d) of the same Code. NGCP also asked for a refund of payment made in excess of the real property tax that j it paid under protest, following the reclassification of the subject properties and the corresponding reassessment of the real property tax.<br><br>The CBAA denied for lack of merit NGCP's motion for partial reconsideration in an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> promulgated on 16 November 2011.<br><br>NGCP filed a verified petition for review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> dated 1 December 2011 with the CTA. NGCP reiterated in its petition before the CTA the prayer in its motion for partial reconsideration before the CBAA.<br><br><center><b><u>The CTA-EB's Ruling</u></b></center><br>The CTA-EB partly granted NGCP's petition in its Decision promulgated on 13 November 2013. Like the CBAA, the CTA-EB found NGCP liable for real property taxes on the subject properties only for the year 2009.<br><br>The CTA-EB stated that even though Section 9<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> of RA 9511 contains an "in lieu of all taxes" clause in its first paragraph, the succeeding paragraph states l GCP's liability to pay taxes on its "real estate, buildings, and personal property, as other corporations are now or hereby may be required by law to pay." Moreover, the Local Government Code withdrew the exemption from real property tax of NGCP's predecessors (NPC and TRANSCO). The assessed properties do not fall under the classifications under Sections 216 and 218(d) of the Local Government Code because although NGCP is engaged in the generation and transmission of electric power, it is not a government-owned or controlled corporation.<br><br>The CTA-EB, however, noted that NGCP paid real property tax on the subject properties for 2001 to 2008, when NPC and TRANSCO were the owners of record! of the subject properties. The CTA-EB held that NGCP was liable only for the real property tax incurred for the year 2009. The CTA-EB reduced;NGCP's liability from £2,792,862.41 to £338,472.67, and ordered the City Treasurer of Cebu City to refund NGCP the amount of P2,454,389.74.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the Decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review is hereby PARTLY GRANTED. | Accordingly, the Decision dated May 30, 2011, and Order dated November 16, 2011 issued by the Central Board of Assessment Appeals are riereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.<br><br>Respdndent [City Treasurer of Cebu City] is hereby ORDERED TO REFUND in favor of petitioner [NGCP] the amount of P2,454,3 89.74.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>CTA Presiding Justice Roman G. Del Rosario (PJ Del Rosario) wrote a concurring and dissenting opinion, to which Associate Justice Ma. Belen M. Ringpis-Liban concurred. PJ Del Rosario stated that Sections 216 and 218(d) of the Lopal Government Code cannot be made to apply to the real properties under NGCP's control because even though NGCP is engaged in the transmission of electricity, it is not a government-owned or controlled corporation. He also concurred with the opinion that NGCP should not be made liable for real property taxes for the years 2001 to 2008.<br><br>PJ Del Rosario dissented from the CTA-EB <i>ponencia's</i> interpretation of Section 9 of Rt 9511. When the real property is used in connection with the grantee's franchise, the grantee shall not be made liable for real property tax because the franchise tax is in lieu of all taxes due on said real property. He opined that the case be remanded to the CBAA for a proper determination of whether the real properties are used in connection with NGCP's franchise. If the real properties are used in connection with the franchise, then they should be exempt from real property tax. If the real properties are not used in connection with the franchise, then they should be subject to real property tax.<br><br>The NGCP<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> and the City Treasurer of Cebu City<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> filed their respective motions for partial reconsideration.<br><br>The CTA-EB denied the motions for partial reconsideration of both parties. It found no reason to reverse or modify its decision. The CTA-EB also reminded the City Treasurer of Cebu City that taxes are not debts, and that NGCP canriot be made liable for real property taxes incurred by NPC/TRANSCO:<br><br><center><b><u>The Issues</u></b></center><br>In G.R. No. 213157, NGCP assigned the following errors:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> The Honorable Court of Tax Appeals <i>En Banc</i> ruled contrary to prevailing laws and jurisprudence when it held that petitioner NGCP is not exempt from! the payment of real property taxes on the subject properties.<br><br></li><li> The Honorable Court of Tax Appeals <i>En Banc</i> ruled contrary to prevailing laws and jurisprudence when it held that the subject properties do not qualify as "special class" of real property under Section 216 of the Local Government Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>In G.R.

We reproduce Section 9 of RA 9511, the tax provisions of NGCP's franchise, below:<br><blockquote>Section 9. <i>Tax Provisions</i>. - In consideration of the franchise and rights hereby granted, the Grantee [NGCP], its successors or assigns, shall pay a franchise tax equivalent to three percent (3%) of all gross receipts derived by trie Grantee [NGCP] from its operation under this franchise. Said tax shall be in lieu of income tax and any and all taxes, duties, fees and charges of any kind, nature or description levied, established or collected by any authority whatsoever, local or national, on its franchise, rights, privileges, receipts, revenues and profits, and on properties used in connection with its franchise, from which taxes, duties and charges, the Grantee is hereby expressly exempted: <i>Provided,</i> That the Grantee, its successors or[ assigns, shall be liable to pay the same taxes on their real estate, buildings and personal property, exclusive of this franchise, as other corporations are now or hereby may be required by law to pay: <i>Provided, further,</i> That payment by Grantee of the concession fees due to PSALM under the concession agreement shall not be subject to income tax and valueradded tax (VAT).</blockquote>Back in 2003, this <i>ponente</i> discussed the "in lieu of all taxes" clause in a separate opinion in <i>PLDT v. City of Davao</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The Court struck down PLDT's argument that the "in lieu of all taxes" clause in Smart's franchise exempts PLDT from the payment of the local franchise tax imposed by the City of Davao. At first glance, it may seem that the "in lieu of all taxes" clause in Smart's franchise is similarly worded to that of NGCP. Smart's tax provisions in Section 9 of Republic Act No. 7294 read as follows:<br><blockquote><i>Tax provisions</i>. - The grantee, its successors or assigns shall be liable to pay, the same taxes on their real estate, buildings and personal property, exclusive of this franchise, as other persons or corporations which are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay. In addition thereto, the grantee, its successors or assigns shall pay a franchise tax equivalent to three percent (3%) of all gross receipts of the business transacted under this franchise by the grantee, its successors or assigns and the said percentage shall be in lieu of all taxes on this franchise or earnings thereof: <i>Provided,</i> that the grantee, its successors or assigns shall continue to be liable for income taxes payable under Title II of the National Internal Revenue Code pursuant to Section 2 of Executive Order No. 72 unless the latter enactment is amended or repealed, in which case the amendment or repeal shall be applicable thereto.<br><br>The grantee shall file the return with and pay the tax due thereon to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his duly authorized representative in accordance with the National Internal Revenue Code and the return shall be subject to audit by the Bureau of Internal Revenue.</blockquote>Under Republic Act No. 7294, Smart was liable to pay the following taxes: (1) the same taxes on real estate, buildings, and personal property exclusive of the franchise, as other persons Dr corporations are required by law to pay; (2) a franchise tax, which shall be in lieu of taxes on franchise or earnings; and (3) income taxes under the National Internal Revenue Code.<br><br>Part of the discussion in the separate opinion went as follows:<br><blockquote>Tax bxemptions must be clear and unequivocal. A taxpayer claiming a tax exemption must point to a specific provision of law conferring oh the taxpayer, in clear and plain terms, exemption from a common burden. Any doubt whether a tax exemption exists is resolved against the taxpayer. Tax exemptions cannot arise by mere implication, much less by an implied re-enactment of a repealed tax exemption clause, xxx.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>Smart's franchise states that the 3 percent "<i><b>franchise tax</b></i>" shall be "in lieu of all taxes." Clearly, it is the <b><i>franchise tax</i></b> that shall be in lieu of all taxes referred to in Section 9, and not the VAT or any other tax. Following the rule on strict interpretation of tax exemptions, the "in lieu of all taxes" clause cannot apply when what is paid is a tax other than the franchise tax. Since the franchise tax on telecommunications companies has been abolished, the "in lieu of all taxes" clause has now become <i>functus officio</i>, rendered inoperative for lack of a franchise tax. Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 5-96 issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue stating that the VAT shall be "in lieu of all taxes" since it merely replaced the franchise tax is void for lack of a legal basis.<br><br>xxx [T]he "in lieu of all taxes" clause in Smart's franchise refers only to taxes', other than income tax, imposed under the National Internal Revenue Code. The "in lieu of all taxes" clause does not apply to local taxes. The proviso in the first paragraph of Section 9 of Smart's franchise states that the grantee shall "continue to be liable for income taxes payable under Title II of the National Internal Revenue Code." Also, the second paragraph ofi Section 9 speaks of tax returns filed and taxes paid to the "Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his duly authorized representative in accordancje with the National Internal Revenue Code." Moreover, the same paragraph declares that the tax returns "shall be subject to audit by the Bureau of Internal Revenue." Nothing is mentioned in Section 9 about local taxes. The clear intent is for the "in lieu of all taxes" clause to apply only to taxes under the National Internal Revenue Code and not to local taxes. Even with respect to national internal revenue taxes, the "in lieu of all taxes" clause does not apply to income tax.<br><br><u>If Congress intended the "in lieu of all taxes" clause in Smart's franchise to' also apply to local taxes.</u> Congress would have expressly mentioned the exemption from municipal and provincial taxes. Congress could have used the language in Section 9 (b) of Clavecilla's old franchise, as follows:<br><blockquote>x x x ;in lieu of any and all taxes of any kind, nature or description levied, established or collected by any authority whatsoever, <i><b>municipal, provincial</b></i> or national, from which the grantee is hereby expressly exempted, x x x.</blockquote>However, <u>Cofagress did not expressly exempt Smart from local taxes. Congress used the "in lieu of all taxes" clause only in reference to national internal revenue taxes. The only interpretation, under the rule on strict construction of tax exemptions, is that the "in lieu of all taxes" clause in Smart's franchise refers only to national and not to local taxes.</u><br><br>PLDT cites <i>Philippine Railway Co. v. Nolting</i> [34 Phil. 401 (1916)] to support its claim that the "in lieu of all taxes" clause includes exemption from local taxes. However, in <i>Philippine Railway</i> the franchise of the railway company expressly exempted it from <b>municipal and provincial taxes,</b> as follows:<br><blockquote>Such annual payments, when promptly and fully made 'by the grantee, shall be in lieu of all taxes of every name 'and nature - <i>municipal, provincial</i> or central - upon its capital stock, franchises, right of way, earnings, and all other property owned or operated by the grantee, under this concession or franchise.</blockquote><u>If anything, <i>Philippine Railway</i> shows the need to avoid ambiguity by specifying thjs taxing authority - municipal, provincial or national - from whose jurisdiction the taxing power is withheld to create the tax exemption.</u> This is not the case in Smart's franchise, where the "in lieu of all taxes" clause refers only to national internal revenue taxes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote>We take note of the pronouncements made in the separate opinion, and apply them to the present set of facts.<br><br><i>First.</i> Tax [exemptions must be clear and unequivocal, and must be directly stated in a specific legal provision.<br><br>In the present case, Section 9 of RA 9511 provided for NGCP's tax liabilities and exemptions.<br><br><i>Second.</i> The "in lieu of all taxes" clause is strictly limited to the kind of taxes, taxing authority, and object of taxes specified in the law.<br><br>Section 9 of RA 9511 states that NGCP's payment of franchise tax is in lieu of payment of "income tax and any and all taxes, duties, fees and charges of any kind, nature or description levied, established or collected by any authority whatsoever, <b>local or national,</b> on its franchise, rights, privileges, receipts, revenues and profits, and on properties used in connection with 'its franchise." Thus, in contrast to Smart's franchise as quoted above, Section 9 of RA 9511 clearly stated that the NGCP's "in lieu of all taxes" clause includes taxes imposed by the local government on properties used in connection withJSTGCP's franchise.<br><br>We now proceed to the determination of NGCP's tax liabilities.<br><br><i><u>Determination of NGCP's Tax Liabilities</u></i><br><br>All parties are in agreement that NGCP paid real property taxes on the subject properties for the years 2001 to 2009. From 2001 to 2008, the subject properties were under the control and supervision of NPC/TRANSCOj It was only in 2009 that NGCP took control of the subject properties.<br><br>The CTA-EB summarized the

Article 1236 provides in part:<br><blockquote>Whoever pays for another may demand from the debtor what he has paid, except that if he paid without the knowledge or against the will of the debtor, he can recover only insofar as the payment has been beneficial to the debtor.</blockquote>However, the City Treasurer of Cebu City may collect real property taxes only in the proper amount.
