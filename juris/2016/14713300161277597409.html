To date, however, <b>the FHGCCI Board of Directors </b><b> intentionally and deliberately failed and/or refused to heed Shareholder and Club Member Rainier L. Madrid and numerous undisclosed members of FHGCCPs above valid and just demand, to the damage and prejudice of [petitioner] FHGCCI and its Members.</b><br><br>x x x x<br><br>2.2 As shown, for more than ten (10) years now from the stipulated full completion of the 2<sup>nd</sup> 18-Holes Arnold Palmer Golf Course, and the country club facilities in September 2000, <b>the FHGCCI Board of Directors, being </b><b> guilty of apparent conflict of interest prescinding from their interlocking directorships, have deliberately and purposely failed, shirked and/or refused to demand and sue [respondents] developer FEPI/FEGDI to fully complete the Project, </b> especially the 36-Hole Golf Course, and adjunct Country Club and commercial complex amenities, to the grave damage and prejudice of [petitioner] FHGCCI and its Members. It is pure and simple, SYNDICATED ESTAFA.<br><br>2.3. Consequently, [respondents FEPI and FEGDI], jointly and severally, should be compelled, ordered and directed to fully perform, finish, complete and turn-over the whole 36-Hole Golf Course and Country Club Amenities soonest.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>3.2. Additionally, [respondents] FEPI and FEGDI must be ordered to render an accounting of ALL work done, EXISTING work-in-progress, if any, and differential backlog in connection with their performance and delivery of the Project, including the contracted 36-Hole Golf Course and Country Club Amenities.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Based on the foregoing allegations, it is clear that Madrid filed a derivative suit on behalf of petitioner FHGCCI to compel respondents FEPI and FEGDI to complete the golf course and country club project and to render an accounting of all works done, existing work-in-progress and, if any, differential backlog. The fact that petitioner FHGCCI denominated the Complaint as a derivative suit for specific performance is sufficient reason for the RTC to dismiss it for lack of jurisdiction, as the RTC where the Complaint was raffled is not a special commercial court. Upon the enactment of RA No. 8799, jurisdiction over intra- corporate disputes, including derivatives suits, is now vested in the RTCs designated as special commercial courts by this Court pursuant to A.M. No. 00- 11-03-SC promulgated on November 21, 2000.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>Petitioner FHGCCI's contention that the instant case does not involve an intra-corporate controversy as it was filed against respondents FEPI and FEGDI as developers, and not as shareholders of the corporation holds no water. Apparent in the Complaint are allegations of the interlocking directorships of the Board of Directors of petitioner FHGCCI and respondents FEPI and FEGDI, the conflict of interest of the Board of Directors of petitioner FHGCCI, and their bad faith in carrying out their duties. Likewise alleged is that respondent FEPI and, later, respondent FEGDI are shareholders of petitioner FHGCCI which under the project agreement, respondent FEPI was tasked to perform the development and construction work and other obligations and undertakings of the project as full payment of its subscription to the authorized capital stock of petitioner FHGCCI, which it later assigned to respondent FEGDI. Considering these allegations, we find that, contrary to the claim of petitioner FHGCCI, there are unavoidably intra- corporate controversies intertwined in the specific performance case.<br><br>Moreover, a derivative suit is a remedy designed by equity as a principal defense of the minority shareholders against the abuses of the majority.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Under the Corporation Code, the corporation's power to sue is lodged with its board of directors or trustees.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> However, when its officials refuse to sue, or are the ones to be sued, or hold control of the corporation, an individual stockholder may be permitted to institute a derivative suit to enforce a corporate cause of action on behalf of a corporation in order to protect or vindicate its rights.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In such actions, the corporation is the real party in interest, while the stockholder suing on behalf of the corporation is only a nominal party.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Considering its purpose, a derivative suit, therefore, would necessarily touch upon the internal affairs of a corporation.<br><br>It is for this reason that a derivative suit is among the cases covered by the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies, A.M. No. 01-2-04- SC, March 13, 2001. Section l(a), Rule 1 of the said Interim Rules states that: <br><br><blockquote><center><b> RULE 1</b><br><i> General Provisions</i></center><br>SECTION 1. <i>(a) Cases Covered— </i>These Rules shall govern the procedure to be observed in civil cases involving the following:<br><br>(1) Devices or schemes employed by, or any act of, the board of directors, business associates, officers or partners, amounting to fraud or misrepresentation which may be detrimental to the interest of the public and/or of the stockholders, partners, or members of any corporation, partnership, or association;<br><br>(2) Controversies arising out of intra-corporate, partnership, or association relations, between and among stockholders, members, or associates; and between, any or all of them and the corporation, partnership, or association of which they are stockholders, members, or associates, respectively; <br><br>(3) Controversies in the election or appointment of directors, trustees, officers, or managers of corporations, partnerships, or associations;<br><br><b>(4) Derivative suits; </b> and<b></b><br><br>(5) Inspection of corporate books. </blockquote><br>In view of the foregoing, we agree with the RTC that the instant derivative suit for specific performance against respondents FEPI and FEGDI falls under the jurisdiction of special commercial courts.<br><br>In <i>Gonzales </i>v. <i>GJH Land, Inc.,</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> we laid down the guidelines to be observed if a commercial case filed before the proper RTC is wrongly raffled to its regular branch. In that case, we said that if the RTC has no internal branch designated as a Special Commercial Court, the proper recourse is to refer the case to the nearest RTC with a designated Special Commercial Court branch within the judicial region. Upon referral, the RTC to which the case was referred to should redocket the case as a commercial case. And if the said RTC has only one branch designated as a Special Commercial Court, it should assign the case to the sole special branch.<br><br><b><i> The Complaint filed by petitioner </i><i> FHGCCI failed to comply with the </i><i> requisites for a valid derivative suit.</i></b><br><br>In this case, however, to refer the case to a special commercial court would be a waste of time since it is apparent on the face of the Complaint, as pointed out by respondents FEPI and FEGDI in their Answer, that petitioner FHGCCI failed to comply with the requisites for a valid derivative suit.<br><br>Rule 8, Section 1 of the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra- Corporate Controversies provides:<br><br><blockquote>SECTION 1.

Although the Complaint alleged that demand letters were sent to the Board of Directors of petitioner FHGCCI and that these were unheeded, these allegations will not suffice.<br><br>Thus, for failing to meet the requirements set forth in Section 1, Rule 8 of the Interim Rules of Procedure Governing Intra-Corporate Controversies, the Complaint, denominated as a derivative suit for specific performance, must be dismissed.<br><br><b> WHEREFORE, </b> the Petition is hereby <b>DENIED. </b>The assailed Orders dated May 14,2012 and February 1, 2013 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 74, Antipolo City, in Civil Case No. 10-9042 are hereby <b>AFFIRMED.</b><br><br><b> SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Carpio, (Chairperson,)</i> and <i>Leonen, JJ.</i>, concur. <br><i>Brion, J.,</i> on leave.<br><i>Mendoza, J.</i>, on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><i> Hi-Yield Realty, Inc. v.
