				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before us for review is the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 05286 dated 8 January 2013 which affirmed with modification the Judgment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 12, in Criminal Case No. 1014-M-2005 finding appellants Jonel Vargas y Ramos (Jonel) and Jerienald Villamero y Esman (Jerienald) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder.<br><br>The Information filed on 7 April 2005 charged appellants with murder committed as follow:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 4th day of September 2004, in San Jose del Monte City, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with unknown caliber guns, and with intent to kill one Jojo F. Magbanua, with evident premeditation, treachery and abuse of superior strength, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot with the said firearms, they were then provided, the said Jojo F. Magbanua, hitting him on his head, thereby inflicting upon him mortal wound which directly caused his death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellants entered a "not guilty" plea. Trial proceeded.<br><br>The prosecution's lone eyewitness, Adolfo Lagac (Adolfo), narrated that on 4 September 2004, at around 7:00 p.m., he was inside a grocery store in <i>Barangay</i> Muzon, San Jose del Monte City, Bulacan when he heard a gunshot which preceded the arrival of Jojo Magbanua (Jojo), who was bloodied and running. Immediately thereafter, two (2) armed men, whom Adolfo identified as appellants Jonel and Jerienald, entered the grocery store. They approached Jojo who, then, was already sprawled on the ground. Adolfo saw Jonel shoot Jojo while Jerienald merely stood beside Jonel. After the shooting, appellants hurriedly left the store.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The victim's father, Elias Magbanua (Elias) testified on the expenses he incurred as a result of the death of his son, Jojo. Elias however failed to present the receipts in court.<br><br>In his defense, Jonel claimed that he was watching television inside his house in Pabahay 2000 in San Jose del Monte City on 4 September 2004 between 4:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m, the time of the supposed shooting incident. Jonel denied he knew and killed Jojo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Jonel also denied knowing the eyewitness, Adolfo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Jerienald admitted that he and Jonel grew up together in Quezon City. He narrated that he was at home doing his chemistry project on 4 September 2004 when he heard from a neighbor that someone was killed in the area near the church. Worried for his cousins who were attending a service in said church, Jerienald went to the scene of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> He did not find his cousins. He was arrested a year later or on 10 September 2005 by three aides upon identification by Jonel's brother.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Jerienald's mother corroborated his statement that he was at home studying on the date of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On 30 June 2011, the RTC rendered judgment finding appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Murder. The dispositive portion reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court finds the accused JONEL VARGAS y RAMOS and JERIENALD VILLAMERO y ESMAN, <b>guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder</b>, and hereby sentences them to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and to pay the heirs of the victim Jojo Magbanua, the sum of P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P50,000.00 as moral damages, P30,000.00 as exemplary damages, and costs.<br><br>In so far as the other accused ARMANDO CADANO @Mando; JOJO ENORME @ Jojo; and RUTHER GARCIA @ Benjie/Loloy are concerned, let an ALIAS WARRANT be issued against them. In the meantime, the records of this case [are] hereby sent to the archives to be revived upon the arrest of the other accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>The RTC relied on the lone eyewitness' positive identification of appellants as the perpetrators of the crime over appellants' defense of denial and alibi.<br><br>Appellant seasonably filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> before the Court of Appeals. On 8 January 2012, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the RTC with modification on the amount of damages awarded, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the appeal is <b>DENIED</b>. The Decision dated 30 June 2011 of the Regional Trial Court, Third Judicial Region, Branch 12, City of Malo1os, Bulacan in Criminal Case No. 1014-M-2005, finding accused-appellants Jonel Vargas y Ramos and Jerienald Villamero y Esman guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, sentencing accused-appellants to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, and ordering them to pay to the heirs of the victim Jojo Francisco Magbanua the sum of Php75,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php50,000.00 as moral damages, and Php30,000.00 as exemplary damages is <b>AFFIRMED</b> with <b>MODIFICATION</b> in that accused-appellants are further ordered to pay to the heirs of the victim Php25,000.00 as temperate damages, with interest of six percent (6%) <i>per annum</i> on all damages, from the date of finality of this Decision until fully paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br></blockquote>Appellants filed a Notice of Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> On 25 September 2013, we issued a Resolution requiring the parties to file their supplemental briefs, if they so desire.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Both parties manifested that they will adopt the same arguments in their separate briefs filed before the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Appellants highlight the inconsistencies in the statements given by the lone prosecution witness in his sworn statement and in his testimony in open court relative to the identification of the perpetrators. Appellants assert that due to said inconsistencies, their guilt has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Appellants also question the trial court's finding of treachery to qualify the crime to murder. Appellants aver that the eyewitness did not witness the whole incident, thus treachery cannot be presumed.<br><br>We agree with appellants.<br><br>In every criminal case, the task of the prosecution is always two-fold, that is, (1) to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of the crime charged; and (2) to establish with the same quantum of proof the identity of the person or persons responsible therefor, because, even if the commission of the crime is a given, there can be no conviction without the identity of the malefactor being likewise clearly ascertained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>In his sworn statement, Adolfo named six (6) individuals who apparently chased the victim into the grocery store, namely: Jonel Vargas, <i>alyas</i> Taroy, <i>alyas</i> Mando, <i>alyas</i> Jojo, <i>alyas</i> Jamin and <i>alyas</i> Benjie, and he could not identify who shot the victim. He reasoned that he could not remember because he was too scared for his life.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Two years later and testifying before the court, Adolfo categorically identified appellants as the only two assailants who chased Adolfo into the grocery store and further pointed to Jonel as the one who shot him.<br><br>Generally, whenever there is inconsistency between the affidavit and the testimony of a witness in court, the testimony commands greater weight considering that affidavits taken <i>ex parte</i> are inferior to testimony in court, the former being almost invariably incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate, sometimes from partial suggestions and sometimes from want of suggestions and inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall the connected circumstances necessary for his accurate recollection of the subject.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>The circumstances obtaining in this case militate against the application of the aforecited principle. The inconsistency between the two statements relate to the identification of the assailants. Adolfo named six (6) assailants in his sworn statement which was taken twelve (12) days after the shooting incident, thus:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td style="text-align: right;" width="5%">6.

Adolfo gave out names which match the names of actual people living in <i>Barangay</i> Muzon. Furthermore, when pressed by the police officer on who shot the victim, Adolfo replied that he could not remember, thus:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td style="text-align: right;" width="5%">8.

Nothing in such detail referred to the identity of the culprit. The lone witness clearly said he could not remember who shot the victim. Two years thereafter, he came with the testimony that only two not six chased the deceased. And he saw the person who shot the victim.<br><br>In <i>People v. Rodrigo</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the Court had the occasion to instruct that great care should be taken in considering the identification of the accused especially, when this identification is made by a sole witness and the judgment in the case totally depends on the reliability of the identification.<br><br>In his Sworn Statement, Adolfo mentioned six (6)&nbsp; individuals involved in the crime but that he could not remember who shot the victim. In his testimony however, the number of participants were reduced to two, who conveniently were the only two individuals arn!sted in connection with the crime. Adolfo also remembered seeing Jonel shoot the victim.<br><br>We held in <i>People v. Flores</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> that when serious and inexplicable discrepancies are present between a previously executed sworn statement of a witness and her testimonial declarations with respect to one's participation in a serious imputation such as murder, there is raised a grave doubt on the veracity of the witness' account. There is no other evidence in this case aside from the testimony of the lone eyewitness which directly implicates appellants to the crime. The inconsistent statements could not be dismissed as inconsequential because the inconsistency goes into the very identification of the assailants, which is a crucial aspect in sustaining a conviction.<br><br>In <i>People v. Tumambing</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> we declared that:<br><blockquote>A successful prosecution of a criminal action largely depends on proof of two things: the identification of the author of the crime and his actual commission of the same. An ample ,proof that a crime has been committed has no use if the prosecution is unable to convincingly prove the offender's identity. The constitutional presumption of innocence that an accused enjoys is not demolished by an identification that is full of uncertainties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>The deficiency in the proof submitted by the prosecution cannot be ignored. A slight doubt created in the identity of the perpetrators of the crime should be resolved in favor of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>As succinctly put by the Court in <i>People v. Fernandez</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><blockquote>It is better to liberate a guilty man than to unjustly keep in prison one whose guilt has not been proved by the required quantum of evidence. Hence, despite the Court's support of ardent crusaders waging all-out war against felons on the loose, when the People's evidence fails to prove indubitably the accused's authorship of the crime of which they stand accused, it is the Court's duty - and the accused's right - to proclaim their innocence. Acquittal, therefore, is in order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>Although the acquittal of appellants renders any further question on the elements of the crime moot, we deem it worthwhile to discuss why treachery should not be appreciated in this case had appellants been proven to have killed the victim.<br><br>Appellants were correct in asserting that Adolfo did not witness the onset of the commotion. For treachery to be considered, it must be present and seen by the witness right at the inception of the attack. Where no particulars are known as to how the killing began, the perpetration of an attack with treachery cannot be presumed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Adolfo merely saw the victim being chased by two armed men. He could not describe how the aggression began and who started it.<br><br>For failure of the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that appellants were the perpetrators of the crime, we are constrained to rule on the latters' acquittal.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision dated 8 January 2013 of the Court of Appeals affirming the conviction of appellants Jonel Vargas y Ramos and Jerienald Villamero y Esman by the Regional Trial Court of Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 12, for murder is <b>REVERSED AND SET ASIDE</b>.
