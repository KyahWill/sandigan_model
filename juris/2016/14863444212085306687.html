Respondent ECC ruled that petitioner's illness was a ''result of complications expected from a progressive disease, atherosclerosis, enhanced by major risk factors such as history of cigarette smoking and findings of dyslipidemia."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner moved for reconsideration but respondent ECC denied the same as the filing of a motion for reconsideration is not allowed under Rule 5,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Section 11 of the Rules of Procedure for Filing and Disposition of Employees' Compensation Claims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p><p><em> <b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b> </em> </p><p> Unfazed, petitioner elevated the matter to the CA via a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court. </p><p> On October 31, 2012, the CA rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> affirming the denial of petitioner's claim for EC TTD benefits under PD No. 626, as amended. The CA quoted the findings of respondent ECC and ruled that in view of its expertise, its findings are binding on the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> The CA also said that petitioner's arguments are mere rehashes of the arguments he raised before respondent ECC and that failed to show that respondents ECC and SSS overlooked factual matters that would warrant the reversal of their findings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> </p><p align="center"> <b>Issue</b> </p><p> Hence, petitioner filed the instant Petition and Supplemental Petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court contending that the CA erred in denying his claim for EC TTD. </p><p><em><strong> Petitioner's Arguments </strong></em> </p><p> Petitioner avers that his illnesses, stroke and essential hypertension, are both compensable diseases under ECC Resolution No. 432.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> He claims that his illness, essential hypertension, is compensable without need of any proof of a causal relationship between his work and his illness because it is an occupational disease listed in Annex "A" of ECC Resolution No. 432.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> His stroke is likewise compensable since he was able to prove by substantial evidence that it is work­ related.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> He insists that contrary to the findings of respondents SSS and ECC, he is not a mere clerk assigned in the front desk.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The truth is that he is the Sports Area In-Charge tasked to deal with the needs and complaints of the club members and their guests who wish to use the club's facilities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> He asserts that his work involves mental pressure and physical activity since he has to cater to the needs and complaints of different personalities of club members and their guest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In addition, he is the President of the VVCCI Employees Union and, on behalf of the union, has filed several cases against VVCCI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Due to his position in the union, he was subjected to all forms of harassment in the workplace, prompting him to file cases against VVCCI before the National Labor Relations Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> His work and his position in the labor union caused him to experience tremendous stress that affected his health, develop hypertension, and suffer a stroke.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner also belies the findings of respondents SSS and ECC that he is a chronic smoker and drinker.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> He admits that he was a smoker but insists that stopped smoking in 1995.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> He also admits drinking alcoholic beverages but only occasionally.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In any case, petitioner argues that the fact that he was a smoker and a drinker should not bar him from claiming compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p><em><strong> Respondents' Arguments </strong></em> </p><p> Respondents SSS and ECC, in essence, contend that petitioner is not entitled to compensation as he failed to prove by substantial evidence that his illness is work-related.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> They also contend that petitioner raised factual matters, which are not proper in a petition for review on certiorari,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and that petitioner's arguments are mere reiterations of his previous arguments.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> </p><p align="center"><strong> Our Ruling </strong> </p><p> The Petition has merit. </p><p> As a rule, questions of facts may not be the subject of an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court as the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> However, there are exceptions to this rule such as when the factual findings of the CA are not supported by the evidence on record and/or are based on misapprehension of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Such is the situation in this case. </p><p><em><strong> Petitioner was not a mere clerk at the<br> time he suffered a stroke. </strong></em> </p><p> The denial of petitioner's claim is based on the factual finding of respondents SSS and ECC that he is a mere clerk of VVCCI, responsible for the issuance of vouchers and receipts to its member.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Based on this, respondents SSS and ECC ruled that in the absence of any substantial evidence showing the causal relationship between his stroke and the clerical nature of his work, petitioner is not entitled to his claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> This factual finding, however, is not supported by the evidence on record. </p><p> In 1978, VVCCI employed petitioner as a waiter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It then transferred him to the Sports Department as Sports Dispatcher, and later, promoted him as Sports Area In-Charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> His Identification Card<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> and SSS Employees' Notification Form B-300<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> both prove his claim that his position at the club is not a mere clerk but is a Sports Area-In-Charge. In fact, his Job Description<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> proves that his work is not limited to issuing vouchers and receipts to club members, but includes the following duties and responsibilities: </p><blockquote> <p> Basic Function: </p> <p> Follow all house rules regarding order, use of sports facilities and strictly enforce proper sports attire. Monitor area assigned (i.e, cleanliness, availability of courts tor member use, equipment, events). Coordinates with Shift Leader. </p> <p> Specific duties and responsibilities: </p> <p> 1. Recognizes and implements all house rules regarding order and use of sports facilities. Sees to it that proper attire is strictly followed. </p> <p> 2. Takes note of any changes in the status of accounts of the Club members, which are circulated by the Administration and Accounting Offices and makes the necessary adjustments as the situation dictates. </p> <p> 3. Keeps record of court playing time by members, dependents, and sponsored guests. Makes sure that all charges are properly receipted and signed by the member concerned. </p> <p> 4. Sees to it that non-members are properly sponsored and charged. </p> <p> 5. Ensures that proper guest rate is applied, charged, paid for, and turned-over to the Cashier at the end of the shift. </p> <p> 6. Refers any complaint received from members concerning the facilities/staff to the Sports Supervisor. </p> <p> 7. Makes the necessary arrangements during tournaments.</p> <p> 8. Coordinates with F&amp;B captain waiter concerning any F&amp;B services as arranged by the client. </p> <p>9. Cleans and maintains all facilities/equipment in the assigned area. </p> <p>10. Reports any repair need in the sports facilities. </p> <p>11. Turns on lights when members/sponsored guests are in the court area and switches off lights after use. </p> <p>12. Ensures that clean drinking water and glasses are available at all times for use of members/guests.</p> <p> 13. Perform other works as assigned by the Sports Supervisor. </p> </blockquote> <p> Based on the foregoing, it is clear that contrary to the findings of the respondents SSS and ECC, petitioner's job is not a mere clerk issuing vouchers or receipts. His duties and responsibilities as Sports Area In-Charge are obviously laborious and stressful since he is tasked to cater to the needs of all club members and their guests, and to coordinate with the other departments of the club regarding their needs. He also receives the complaints and requests of club members and their guests, and ensures that these complaints and requests are properly addressed. To do all these, he has to move around the club and deal with the club members and their guests. Obviously, he has to endure both physical and mental stress in order to perform his duties. </p><p> Aside from his position as Sports Area In-Charge, petitioner is also the President of the VVCCI Employees Union since 1984, except for the period 2000- 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> As the president of the union, he was subjected to harassment and unfair labor tactics of the management of the club. In fact, when petitioner suffered a stroke, there were four pending cases filed by him, on behalf of the union and in his own personal capacity, to wit: </p><blockquote> <p> a. Jesus B. Villamor v. Valle Verde Country Club, Inc. - NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-0504064-05; </p> <p>b. Jesus B. Villamor v. Valle Verde Country Club, Inc.- NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-05-04402-06; </p> <p>c. VVCCIEU and Jesus Villamor v. Valle Verde Country Club, Inc. - NLRC­ NCR Case No. 10-05594-2001; and </p> <p>d. VVCCIEU v. Valle Verde Country Club, Inc. - CA-G.R. SP No. 53189.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Taking into account the foregoing facts, the Court finds that the CA seriously erred in affirming the factual findings of the respondents SSS and ECC that petitioner is a mere clerk and that the nature of his work did not affect his health; these factual findings are not supported by the evidence on record and are based on misapprehension of facts. </p><p> Having discussed the true nature of petitioner's work, the Court shall now proceed to determine whether petitioner is entitled to his claim for EC TTD benefits under PD No. 626, as amended. </p><p><em><strong> Petitioner is entitled to his claim for EC <br> TTD benefits under PD No. 626, as<br> amended. </strong></em> </p><p> The Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation provides that for an illness or disease to be compensable, "[it] must be a result of occupational disease listed under Annex 'A' of these Rules with the conditions set therein satisfied, otherwise, proof must be shown that the risk of contracting the disease is increased by the working conditions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In the case of stroke and hypertension, both are compensable since they are listed as occupational diseases under Nos. 19<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> and 29,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> respectively, of Annex "A" of the said rules. </p><p> In fact, in <em>Government Service Insurance System v. Baul</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> whether the claimant who was diagnosed with essential hypertension later suffered a stroke, the Court affirmed the claimant's entitlement to compensation as both essential hypertension and stroke are considered occupational diseases. The Court ruled that: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>Cerebro-vascular accident and essential hypertension are considered as occupational diseases under Nos. 19 and 29, respectively, of Annex 'A' of the Implementing Rules of P.D. No.626, as amended. Thus, it is not necessary that there be proof of causal relation between the work and the illness which resulted in the respondent's disability. </strong>The open-ended Table of Occupational Diseases requires no proof of causation. In general, a covered claimant suffering from an occupational disease is automatically paid benefits. </p> <p> However, although cerebro-vascular accident and essential hypertension are listed occupational diseases, their compensability requires compliance with all the conditions set forth in the Rules. In short, both are qualified occupational diseases. For cerebro-vascular accident, the claimant must prove the following: (1) there must be a history, which should be proved, of trauma at work (to the head specifically) due to unusual and extraordinary physical or mental strain or event, or undue exposure to noxious gases in industry; (2) there must be a direct connection between the trauma or exertion in the course of the employment and the cerebro-vascular attack; and (3) the trauma or exertion then and there caused a brain hemorrhage. On the other hand, essential hypertension is compensable only if it causes impairment of function of body organs like kidneys, heart, eyes and brain, resulting in permanent disability, provided that, the following documents substantiate it: (a) chest X-ray report; (b) ECG report; (c) blood chemistry report; (d) funduscopy report; and (e) c-T scan. </p> <p> <strong>The degree of proof required to validate the concurrence of the above-mentioned conditions under P.D. No. 626 is merely substantial evidence</strong>, that is, such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <strong>What the law requires is a reasonable work-connection and not direct causal relation.</strong> It is enough that the hypothesis on which the workmen's claim is based is probable. As correctly pointed out by the CA, <strong>probability, not the ultimate degree of certainty, is the test of proof in compensation proceedings.</strong> For, in interpreting and carrying out the provisions of the Labor Code and its Implementing Rules and Regulations, the primordial and paramount consideration is the employee's welfare. To safeguard the worker's rights, any doubt as to the proper interpretation and application must be resolved in [his] favor. (Emphasis supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Taking the cue from the<em> Baul</em> case, the Court finds that petitioner is entitled to compensation for his illness. Just like in <em>Baul</em>, petitioner was diagnosed with hypertension and stroke, as evidenced by his medical reports: Cranial CT Scan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Chest X-Ray Result,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Laboratory or Blood Chemistry Result,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> and Electrocardiogram Result.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> He was also able to show that his work and position in the union caused him physical and mental strain as he had to deal with the demands of various types of people. Thus, there is a probability that his work and position in the union increased his risk of suffering a stroke, which affected his brain, caused cerebral infarctions, paralysis of the left side of his body, difficulty in speaking, and loss of muscular coordination. </p><p> Direct evidence showing that his work and position in the union caused his illness is not necessary. As we have consistently ruled, the test of proof in compensation proceedings is probability, and not the ultimate degree of certainty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> In fact, in claims for compensation, the strict rules of evidence need not be observed as the primordial and paramount consideration should be the employee's welfare.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> </p><p> As to the findings of respondents SSS and ECC that petitioner is a chronic smoker and drinker, the Court finds that it should not bar petitioner's claim for compensation, whether or not such findings are true. In <em>Government Service Insurance System v. De Castro</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> the Court said that: </p><blockquote> <p> We find it strange that both the ECC and the GSIS singled out the presence of smoking and drinking as the factors that rendered De Castro's ailments, otherwise listed as occupational, to be non-compensable. To be sure, the causes of CAD and hypertension that the ECC listed and explained in its decision cannot be denied; smoking and drinking are undeniably among these causes. However, they are <strong>not the sole causes</strong> of CAD and hypertension and, at least, not under the circumstances of the present case. For this reason, we fear for the implication of the ECC ruling if it will prevail and be read as definitive on the effects of smoking and drinking on compensability issues, even on diseases that are listed as occupational in character. The ruling raises the possible reading that smoking and drinking, by themselves, are factors that can bar compensability. </p> <p> We ask the question of whether these factors can be sole determinants of compensability as the ECC has apparently failed to consider other factors such as age and gender from among those that the ECC itself listed as major and minor causes of atherosclerosis and, ultimately, of CAD. While age and gender are characteristics inherent in the person (and thereby may be considered non-work related factors), they also do affect a worker's job performance and may in this sense, together with stresses of the job, significantly contribute to illnesses such as CAD and hypertension. To cite an example, some workplace activities are appropriate only for the young (such as the lifting of heavy objects although these may simply be office files), and when repeatedly undertaken by older workers, may lead to ailments and disability. Thus, age coupled with an age-affected work activity may lead to compensability. From this perspective, none of the ECC's listed factors should be disregarded to the exclusion of others in determining compensability. </p> <p> In any determination of compensability, the nature and characteristics of the job are as important as raw medical findings and a claimant's personal and social history. This is a basic legal reality in workers' compensation law. We are therefore surprised that the ECC and the GSIS simply brushed aside the disability certification that the military issued with respect to De Castro's disability, based mainly on their primacy as the agencies with expertise on workers' compensation and disability issues. </p> <p> While ECC and GSIS are admittedly the government entities with jurisdiction over the administration of workers' disability compensation and can thus claim primacy in these areas, they cannot however claim infallibility, particularly when they use wrong or limited considerations in determining compensability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> (Emphasis in the original) </p> </blockquote> <p> All told, the Court finds that under prevailing jurisprudence, the nature of petitioner's work and his medical results are substantial evidence to support his claim for EC TTD benefits under PD No. 626, as amended. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Petition is hereby <strong>GRANTED</strong>.

The strain of work that brings about an acute stroke must be of sufficient severity and must be followed within 24 hours by the clinical signs of an acute onset of neurological deficit to constitute causal relationship. <br> c. If a person who was apparently asymptomatic before being subjected to strain at work showed signs and symptoms of an acute onset of neurologic deficit during the performance of his work, and such symptoms and signs persisted, it is reasonable to claim a causal relationship. <br> d. There was a history, which should be proven, of unusual and extraordinary mental strain or event, or trauma to or hyperextension of the neck. There must be a direct connection between the insult in the course of the employment and the worker's collapse. <br> e. If the neck trauma or exertion then and there caused either a brain infarction or brain hemorrhage as documented by neuro-imaging studies, the injury may be considered as arising from work.<br> f.
