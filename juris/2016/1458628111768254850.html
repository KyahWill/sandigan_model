Dismissing the counterclaims.<br><br>On the cross-claim, defendants Nolan llapitan, Ilona Hapitan and the spouses Jessie P. Terosa and Ruth O.

As regards the sale of the house and lot to the Spouses Terosa, the RTC noted that the property was sold through an attorney-in-fact, Ilona. The SPA provided that the proceeds of the sale of Esmeralda's share in the property shall be applied specifically in payment of her obligations. This limited authority was acknowledged by Nolan in his SPA to Ilona.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The RTC found that the house and lot was sold at an unreasonably low amount of P450,000.00. The lot's market value was P290,150.00 and the bill of materials for the construction of the house was P511,341.94. Thus, the minimum consideration for the property should have been at least P800,000.00. The RTC also found that the SPA was revoked after Esmeralda knew that the consideration was unconscionably low and that Nolan and his relatives became antagonistic to her. Further, Ilona turned over the payment to Nolan, but Ilona or Nolan did not pay Esmeralda's obligations.<br><br>On the liability of the Spouses Terosa, the RTC ruled that there is sufficient evidence on record to prove that they connived and cooperated with their co-defendants Nolan and Ilona to defraud Esmeralda, and also Jimmy and Warlily. The RTC noted that the Spouses Terosa chose to remain silent because whatever the outcome of the case, they will not stand to lose anything. In addition, before the sale was consummated, they were informed of the revocation of the SPA in favor of Ilona.<br><br>The parties filed separate Notices of Appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>In its Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> dated October 14, 2003, the CA agreed with the RTC ruling.

They alleged that on October 28, 2003, Warlily was approached by Nolan who offered money to settle the case amicably. Considering that she was not assisted by her counsel, who had died earlier that year, and that she was in difficult financial constraints then, she accepted the deal of P 125,000.00 for her and her husband to sign a quitclaim or waiver. Further, at that moment, she was not aware of the fact that the CA had already rendered a decision dated October 14, 2003 as she only knew of the decision on October 30, 2003. She said that she felt somehow deprived of her rights when Nolan willfully failed to disclose the fact that the case was already decided by the CA and taking undue advantage of her counsel's absence, hurriedly closed the deal with her. She further averred that perhaps Nolan was bothered by his conscience when he gave her P300,000.00 on November 19, 2003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>In response, Nolan and Ilona filed an Answer to the Manifestation and Motion<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> dated January 6, 2004. They argued that Warlily's claim of being deceived rests on dubious grounds as she did not categorically state when she officially received a copy of the CA Decision. Also, whatever defects there were in the Waiver were cured or rendered moot and academic by her signing of the Amicable Settlement.<br><br>Jimmy and Warlily further refuted Nolan and Ilona's claims in their Opposition to the Motion for Reconsideration/Modification and Comment to the Answer to the Manifestation and Motion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Jimmy and Warlily said that the execution of the Waiver was actually done on October 28, 2003, not on October 22. In noting the dates of receipts of the CA Decision by the counsel for Nolan and Ilona (October 24, 2003) and by Jimmy and Warlily (October 30, 2003), it clearly appears that Warlily was deceived when she executed her Waiver. The execution of the Amicable Settlement later on November 19, 2003 did not change Warlily's situation as she was never apprised of the import of the CA Decision. She was also of the impression that she had no counsel at that time as she believed that Atty. Edgar Praile, who assisted Jimmy and Warlily in the Amicable Settlement, was only a witness that she received P300,000.00 in addition to the P125,000.00 that she already received.<br><br>In their Reply to Opposition and Answer to Comment<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> dated January 20, 2004, Nolan and Ilona belied Warlily's claim that she only knew of the CA Decision on October 30, when the office of Atty. William Devilles, Jimmy and Warlily's counsel, received a copy on October 23. Moreover, while Atty. Praile signed as a witness to her receipt of P300,000.00, it was likewise true that Atty. Praile signed as counsel for Jimmy and Warlily in the Amicable Settlement and Motion to Approve Amicable Settlement dated November 19, 2016.<br><br>Meanwhile, Esmeralda filed an Opposition to [the] Motion for Reconsideration/Modification<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> wherein she stated that she is not a party to the Waiver and has no knowledge as to its veracity.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> She further argued that it is incredulous for Nolan to insist that the CA reverse its decision when such decision is even favorable to him. Only the Spouses Terosa would suffer from the decision ordering their title cancelled. She averred that the act of Nolan and Ilona merely bolsters the claim that the alleged deed of sale executed by Nolan and Ilona in favor of the Spouses Terosa is a fictitious and simulated document intended only to deprive Esmeralda and the creditors of their claims against the conjugal assets.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>In its Resolution dated October 7, 2005, the CA denied the Motion for Reconsideration/Modification filed by Nolan and Ilona.<br><br>Hence, this petition by Ilona.<br><br>Ilona argues that by virtue of the Waiver, the CA should have, at the very least, reconsidered or modified its Decision dated October 14, 2003 as Warlily had received from Nolan and Ilona P125,000.00 representing the full and complete satisfaction of her claim in the civil case.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Ilona further argues that in addition to the Waiver, the Amicable Settlement results in the modification of the CA Decision. This is so because the parties agreed that the P425,000.00 payment received by Jimmy and Warlily is the full, final and complete settlement of their claims. Thus, Ilona prays to this Court that the terms of the Amicable Settlement be considered to have modified the terms of the RTC Decision.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Further, the petitioner prays that the deed of sale in favor of Spouses Terosa conveying the house and lot be declared valid, and that the order for the cancellation of TCT No. 107509 in the name of Spouses Terosa be recalled.<br><br><center><b><i>The Issue</i></b><br></center><br>We decide whether the Waiver and the Amicable Settlement can modify the Decision of the CA.<br><br><i><center><b>The Courts’ Ruling</b></center></i><br><br><b>The Waiver is invalid</b><br><br>Petitioners anchored their Motion for Reconsideration/Modification on the Affidavit of Waiver, Quitclaim and Satisfaction of Claim<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> executed by Warlily, which they aver to have rendered the issue of the validity of the transfer of the property moot and academic. We are not persuaded.<br><br>The nullity of the Deed of Sale could not be affected by the subsequent waiver of Warlily. The Court has explained the nature of a waiver:<br><br><blockquote>Waiver is defined as "a voluntary and intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known existing legal right, advantage, benefit, claim or privilege, which except for such waiver the party would have enjoyed x x x."<br><br><center>x x x x<br></center><br>[I]t is the general rule that a person may waive any matter which affects his property, and any alienable right or privilege of which he is the owner or which belongs to him or to which he is legally entitled, whether secured by contract, conferred with statute, or guaranteed by constitution, provided such rights and privileges rest in the individual, are intended for his sole benefit, do not infringe on the rights of others, and further provided the waiver of the right or privilege is not forbidden by law, and does not contravene public policy x x x.<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[41]</sup></font></blockquote><br>Warlily's Waiver cannot cover the issue of the validity of the sale of the property to the Spouses Terosa since the property is neither a right nor a benefit she is entitled to. Moreover, the declaration of nullity due to the existence of fraud was both a finding of fact and of law by the lower courts, and the parties cannot agree amongst themselves and decide otherwise.<br><br><b>The Amicable Settlement is not valid</b><br><br>The Amicable Settlement, intending to put an end to the controversy between jimmy and Warlily and Nolan and Ilona, partakes the nature of a compromise agreement. The Amicable Settlement involves two subjects: 1) the payment of the principal obligation of P510,463.98 to Jimmy and Warlily; and 2) the cancellation of the sale of the house and lot to the Spouses Terosa.<br><br><i>The Amicable Settlement of the <br>payment of the debt to Jimmy and<br>Warlily is not valid</i><br><br>With the payment of P425,000.00, Jimmy and Warlily allegedly released Nolan and Ilona, Esmeralda, and even the Spouses Terosa from their obligations. Specifically:<br><br><blockquote>1. Plaintiffs-appellees and defendants-appellants Nolan Bienvenido Hapitan and llona Hapitan hereby agree to the full, final and complete settlement of the liability of the latter and that of defendants-appellants Sps. Jessie P. Terosa and Ruth 0.

Terosa and Ruth O. Terosa be recalled.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>A compromise agreement is defined as a contract whereby the parties make reciprocal concessions in order to resolve their differences and thus avoid or put an end to a lawsuit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> To have the force of law between the parties, a compromise agreement must comply with the requisites and principles of contracts.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Thus, it must have the following elements: 1) the consent of the parties to the compromise; 2) an object certain that is the subject matter of the compromise; and 3) the cause of the obligation that is established.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>We note that much has been said by the parties on the validity of the Amicable Settlement, specifically on the element of consent. Jimmy and Warlily consistently maintained that they were deceived into executing the Waiver and the Amicable Settlement, and that they were not properly assisted by counsel. They insist that the settlement was proposed and forged by Nolan and llona in bad faith, having advance knowledge of the decision of the CA.<br><br>While compromise agreements are generally favored and encouraged by the courts, it must be proved that they were voluntarily, freely, and intelligently entered into by the parties, who had full knowledge of the judgment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The allegations of Jimmy and Warlily cast doubt on whether they fully understood the terms of the Amicable Settlement when they signed it. They further argued that they did not fully comprehend the CA Decision in their favor. Thus, it may be reasonably inferred that Jimmy and Warlily did not give consent to the Amicable Settlement with Nolan and Ilona.<br><br><i>Nolan cannot waive his and <br>Esmeralda s rights over the house<br>and lot sold to the Spouses Terosa</i><br><br>The Amicable Settlement, which Nolan signed, aims to recall the lower courts1 finding of nullity of the sale of the house and lot to the Spouses Terosa. In effect, by agreeing to the validity of the sale, Nolan disposed of or waived his and Esmeralda's rights over the house and lot, which the lower courts found to be part of their conjugal property.<br><br>Such disposal or waiver by Nolan is not allowed by law. Article 124<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> of the Family Code requires that any disposition or encumbrance of conjugal property must have the written consent of the other spouse; otherwise, such disposition is void.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Further, under Article 89<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> of the Family Code, no waiver of rights, interests, shares, and effects of the conjugal partnership of gains<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> during the marriage can be made except in case of judicial separation of property. Clearly, Esmeralda did not consent to Nolan disposing or waiving their rights over the house and lot through the Amicable Settlement. In fact, she even objected to the Amicable Settlement, as evidenced by her pleadings filed before the courts. She further expressed disbelief that Nolan would want the CA to reverse its decision when its ruling, saving Nolan and Esmeralda's conjugal property, is favorable to him.<br><br>The invalidity of the Amicable Settlement notwithstanding, we find that it still is evidence of payment by Nolan and Ilona of P425,000.00. Even Jimmy and Warlily do not deny that they received the said amount.
