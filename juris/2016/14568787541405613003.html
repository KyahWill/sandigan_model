These Orders were subsequently set aside by the Court of Appeals Ninth Division, and the case was remanded to the trial court for pre-trial.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>On September 12, 1995, an Urgent Motion for Inhibition was filed against Judge Fernando V. Gorospe, Jr.,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> who had issued the writ of seizure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The ground for the motion for inhibition was not provided. Nevertheless, Judge Fernando V. Gorospe Jr. inhibited himself, and the case was reassigned to Branch 65 of the Regional Trial Court, Makati City on October 3, 1995.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In the Decision dated February 26, 1999, the Regional Trial Court found that Kodak Philippines, Ltd. defaulted in the performance of its obligation under its Letter Agreement with the Lam Spouses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> It held that Kodak Philippines, Ltd.'s failure to deliver two (2) out of the three (3) units of the Minilab Equipment caused the Lam Spouses to stop paying for the rest of the installments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> The trial court noted that while the Letter Agreement did not specify a period within which the delivery of all units was to be made, the Civil Code provides "reasonable time" as the standard period for compliance:<br><br><blockquote>The second paragraph of Article 1521 of the Civil Code provides:<br><br><blockquote>Where by a contract of sale the seller is bound to send the goods to the buyer, but no time for sending them is fixed, the seller is bound to send them within a reasonable time.<br></blockquote><br>What constitutes reasonable time is dependent on the circumstances availing both on the part of the seller and the buyer. In this case, delivery of the first unit was made five (5) days after the date of the agreement. Delivery of the other two (2) units, however, was never made despite the lapse of at least three (3) months.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></blockquote><br>Kodak Philippines, Ltd. failed to give a sufficient explanation for its failure to deliver all three (3) purchased units within a reasonable time.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The trial court found:<br><br><blockquote>Kodak would have the court believe that it did not deliver the other two (2) units due to the failure of defendants to make good the installments subsequent to the second. The court is not convinced. First of all, there should have been simultaneous delivery on account of the circumstances surrounding the transaction. . . . Even after the first delivery ... no delivery was made despite repeated demands from the defendants and despite the fact no installments were due. Then in March and in April (three and four months respectively from the date of the agreement and the first delivery) when the installments due were both honored, still no delivery was made.<br><br>Second, although it might be said that Kodak was testing the waters with just one delivery - determining first defendants' capacity to pay - it was not at liberty to do so. It is implicit in the letter agreement that delivery within a reasonable time was of the essence and failure to so deliver within a reasonable time and despite demand would render the vendor in default.<br>. . . .<br><br>Third, at least two (2) checks were honored. If indeed Kodak refused delivery on account of defendants' inability to pay, non-delivery during the two (2) months that payments were honored is unjustified.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></blockquote><br>Nevertheless, the trial court also ruled that when the Lam Spouses accepted delivery of the first unit, they became liable for the fair value of the goods received:<br><br><blockquote>On the other hand, defendants accepted delivery of one (1) unit. Under Article 1522 of the Civil Code, in the event the buyer accepts incomplete delivery and uses the goods so delivered, not then knowing that there would not be any further delivery by the seller, the buyer shall be liable only for the fair value to him of the goods received. In other words, the buyer is still liable for the value of the property received. Defendants were under obligation to pay the amount of the unit. Failure of delivery of the other units did not thereby give unto them the right to suspend payment on the unit delivered. Indeed, in incomplete deliveries, the buyer has the remedy of refusing payment unless delivery is first made. In this case though, payment for the two undelivered units have not even commenced; the installments made were for only one (1) unit.<br><br>Hence, Kodak is right to retrieve the unit delivered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote><br>The Lam Spouses were under obligation to pay for the amount of one unit, and the failure to deliver the remaining units did not give them the right to suspend payment for the unit already delivered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> However, the trial court held that since Kodak Philippines, Ltd. had elected to cancel the sale and retrieve the delivered unit, it could no longer seek payment for any deterioration that the unit may have suffered while under the custody of the Lam Spouses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>As to the generator set, the trial court ruled that Kodak Philippines, Ltd. attempted to mislead the court by claiming that it had delivered the generator set with its accessories to the Lam Spouses, when the evidence showed that the Lam Spouses had purchased it from Davao Ken Trading, not from Kodak Philippines, Ltd.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Thus, the generator set that Kodak Philippines, Ltd. wrongfully took from the Lam Spouses should be replaced.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the Regional Trial Court Decision reads:<br><br><blockquote>PREMISES CONSIDERED, the case is hereby dismissed. Plaintiff is ordered to pay the following:<br><br>1) PHP 130,000.00 representing the amount of the generator set, plus legal interest at 12% per annum from December 1992 until fully paid; and<br><br>2) PHP 1,300,000.00 as actual expenses in the renovation of the Tagum, Davao and Rizal Ave., Manila outlets.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote><br>On March 31, 1999, the Lam Spouses filed their Notice of Partial Appeal, raising as an issue the Regional Trial Court's failure to order Kodak Philippines, Ltd. to pay: (1) P2,040,000 in actual damages; (2) P50,000,000 in moral damages; (3) P20,000,000 in exemplary damages; (4) P353,000 in attorney's fees; and (5) P3 00,000 as litigation expenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The Lam Spouses did not appeal the Regional Trial Court's award for the generator set and the renovation expenses.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>Kodak Philippines, Ltd. also filed an appeal. However, the Court of Appeals<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> dismissed it on December 16, 2002 for Kodak Philippines, Ltd.'s failure to file its appellant's brief, without prejudice to the continuation of the Lam Spouses' appeal.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> The Court of Appeals' December 16, 2002 Resolution denying Kodak Philippines, Ltd.'s appeal became final and executory on January 4, 2003.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In the Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> dated March 30, 2005, the Court of Appeals Special Fourteenth Division modified the February 26, 1999 Decision of the Regional Trial Court:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the Assailed Decision dated 26 February 1999 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 65 in Civil Case No. 92-3442 is hereby <b>MODIFIED.</b> Plaintiff-appellant is ordered to pay the following:<br><ol><li>P130,000.00 representing the amount of the generator set, plus legal interest at 12% per annum from December 1992 until fully paid; and<br><br></li><li><i>P440.000.00 as actual damages;</i><br><br></li><li><i>P25,000.00 as moral damages; and</i><br><br></li><li><i>P50,000.00 as exemplary damages</i>.<br></li></ol><b>SO ORDERED</b>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court's Decision, but extensively discussed the basis for the modification of the dispositive portion.<br><br>The Court of Appeals ruled that the Letter Agreement executed by the parties showed that their obligations were susceptible of partial performance. Under Article 1225 of the New Civil Code, their obligations are divisible:<br><br><blockquote>In determining the divisibility of an obligation, the following factors may be considered, to wit: (1) the will or intention of the parties, which may be expressed or presumed; (2) the objective or purpose of the stipulated prestation; (3) the nature of the thing; and (4) provisions of law affecting the prestation.<br><br>Applying the foregoing factors to this case, <i>We found that the intention of the parties is to be bound separately for each Minilab Equipment to be delivered as shown by the separate purchase price for each of the item, by the acceptance ofSps. Lam of separate deliveries for the first Minilab Equipment and for those of the remaining two and the separate payment arrangements for each of the equipment.</i> Under this premise, Sps. Lam shall be liable for the entire amount of the purchase price of the Minilab Equipment delivered considering that Kodak had already completely fulfilled its obligation to deliver the same.. ..<br><br>Third, it is also evident that the <i>contract is one that is severable in character as demonstrated by the separate purchase price for each of the minilab equipment</i>. "If the part to be performed by one party consists in several distinct and separate items and the price is apportioned to each of them, the contract will generally be held to be severable. In such case, each distinct stipulation relating to a separate subject matter will be treated as a separate contract." <i>Considering this, Kodak's breach of its obligation to deliver the other two (2) equipment cannot bar its recovery for the full payment of the equipment already delivered. As far as Kodak is concerned, it had already fully complied with its separable obligation to deliver the first unit of Minilab Equipment.</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals held that the issuance of a writ of replevin is proper insofar as the delivered Minilab Equipment unit and its standard accessories are concerned, since Kodak Philippines, Ltd. had the right to possess it:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br><blockquote>The purchase price of said equipment is P1,796,000.00 which, under the agreement is payable with forty eight (48) monthly amortization. It is undisputed that Sps. Lam made payments which amounted to Two Hundred Seventy Thousand Pesos (P270,000.00) through the following checks: Metrobank Check Nos. 00892620 and 00892621 dated 31 March 1992 and 30 April 1992 respectively in the amount of Thirty Five Thousand Pesos (P35,000.0O) each, and BPI Family Check dated 31 July 1992 amounting to Two Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00). This being the case, Sps. Lam are still liable to Kodak in the amount of One Million Five Hundred Twenty Six Thousand Pesos (P1,526,000.00), which is payable in several monthly amortization, pursuant to the Letter Agreement. <i>However, Sps. Lam admitted that sometime in May 1992, they had already ordered their drawee bank to stop the payment on all the other checks they had issued to Kodak as payment for the Minilab Equipment delivered to them. Clearly then, Kodak hafdj the right to repossess the said equipment, through this replevin suit. Sps. Lam cannot excuse themselves from paying in full the purchase price of the equipment delivered to them on account of Kodak's breach of the contract to deliver the other two (2) Minilab Equipment, as contemplated in the Letter Agreement</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Echoing the ruling of the trial court, the Court of Appeals held that the liability of the Lam Spouses to pay the remaining balance for the first delivered unit is based on the second sentence of Article 1592 of the New Civil Code.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> The Lam Spouses' receipt and use of the Minilab Equipment before they knew that Kodak Philippines, Ltd. would not deliver the two (2) remaining units has made them liable for the unpaid portion of the purchase price.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals noted that Kodak Philippines, Ltd. sought the rescission of its contract with the Lam Spouses in the letter dated October 14, 1992.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> The rescission was based on Article 1191 of the New Civil Code, which provides: "The power to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> In its letter, Kodak Philippines, Ltd. demanded that the Lam Spouses surrender the lone delivered unit of Minilab Equipment along with its standard accessories.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals likewise noted that the Lam Spouses rescinded the contract through its letter dated November 18, 1992 on account of Kodak Philippines, Inc.'s breach of the parties' agreement to deliver the two (2) remaining units.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>As a result of this rescission under Article 1191, the Court of Appeals ruled that "both parties must be restored to their original situation, as far as practicable, as if the contract was never entered into."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> The Court of Appeals ratiocinated that Article 1191 had the effect of extinguishing the obligatory relation as if one was never created:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br><blockquote>To rescind is to declare a contract void in its inception and to put an end to it as though it never were. It is not merely to terminate it and to release parties from further obligations to each other but abrogate it from the beginning and restore parties to relative positions which they would have occupied had no contract been made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></blockquote><br>The Lam Spouses were ordered to relinquish possession of the Minilab Equipment unit and its standard accessories, while Kodak Philippines, Ltd. was ordered to return the amount of P270,000.00, tendered by the Lam Spouses as partial payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>As to the actual damages sought by the parties, the Court of Appeals found that the Lam Spouses were able to substantiate the following:<br><br><blockquote>Incentive fee paid to Mr. Ruales in the amount of P100,000.00; the rider to the contract of lease which made the Sps. Lam liable, by way of advance payment, in the amount of P40,000.00, the same being intended for the repair of the flooring of the leased premises; and lastly, the payment of P300,000.00, as compromise agreement for the pre-termination of the contract of lease with Ruales.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></blockquote><br>The total amount is P440,000.00. The Court of Appeals found that all other claims made by the Lam Spouses were not supported by evidence, either through official receipts or check payments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>As regards the generator set improperly seized from Kodak Philippines, Ltd. on the basis of the writ of replevin, the Court of Appeals found that there was no basis for the Lam Spouses' claim for reasonable rental of P5,000.00. It held that the trial court's award of 12% interest, in addition to the cost of the generator set in the amount of P130,000.00, is sufficient compensation for whatever damage the Lam Spouses suffered on account of its improper seizure.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals also ruled on the Lam Spouses' entitlement to moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees and litigation expenses:<br><br><blockquote>In seeking recovery of the Minilab Equipment, Kodak cannot be considered to have manifested bad faith and malevolence because as earlier ruled upon, it was well within its right to do the same. However, with respect to the seizure of the generator set, where Kodak misrepresented to the court a quo its alleged right over the said item, Kodak's bad faith and abuse of judicial processes become self-evident. Considering the off-setting circumstances attendant, the amount of P25,000.00 by way of moral damages is considered sufficient.<br><br>In addition, so as to serve as an example to the public that an application for replevin should not be accompanied by any false claims and misrepresentation, the amount of P50,000.00 by way of exemplary damages should be pegged against Kodak.<br><br>With respect to the attorney's fees and litigation expenses, We find that there is no basis to award Sps. Lam the amount sought for.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></blockquote><br>Kodak Philippines, Ltd. moved for reconsideration of the Court of Appeals Decision, but it was denied for lack of merit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> However, the Court of Appeals noted that the Lam Spouses' Opposition correctly pointed out that the additional award of P270,000.00 made by the trial court was not mentioned in the decretal portion of the March 30, 2005 Decision:<br><br><blockquote>Going over the Decision, specifically page 12 thereof, the Court noted that, in addition to the amount of Two Hundred Seventy Thousand (P270,000.00) which plaintiff-appellant should return to the defendants-appellants, the Court also ruled that defendants-appellants should, in turn, relinquish possession of the Minilab Equipment and the standard accessories to plaintiff-appellant. Inadvertently, these material items were not mentioned in the decretal portion of the Decision. Hence, the proper correction should herein be made.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></blockquote><br>The Lam Spouses filed this Petition for Review on April 14, 2005. On the other hand, Kodak Philippines, Ltd. filed its Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> before the Court of Appeals on April 22, 2005.<br><br>While the Petition for Review on Certiorari filed by the Lam Spouses was pending before this court, the Court of Appeals Special Fourteenth Division, acting on Kodak Philippines, Ltd.'s Motion for Reconsideration, issued the Amended Decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> dated September 9, 2005.

Clearly the objective or purpose of the prestation, the obligation is divisible.<br><br>The nature of each unit of the three (3) Minilab Equipment is such that one can perform its own functions, without awaiting for the other units to perform and complete its job. So much so, the nature of the object of the Letter Agreement is susceptible of partial performance, thus the obligation is divisible.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup></blockquote><br>With the contract being severable in character, respondent argues that it performed its obligation when it delivered one unit of the Minilab Equipment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> Since each unit could perform on its own, there was no need to await the delivery of the other units to complete its job.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Respondent then is of the view that when petitioners ordered the depository bank to stop payment of the issued checks covering the first delivered unit, they violated their obligations under the Letter Agreement since respondent was already entitled to full payment.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup><br><br>Respondent also argues that petitioners benefited from the use of the Minilab Equipment for 10 months—from March to December 1992— despite having paid only two (2) monthly installments.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> Respondent avers that the two monthly installments amounting to P70,000.00 should be the subject of an offset against the amount the Court of Appeals awarded to petitioners.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup><br><br>Respondent further avers that petitioners have no basis for claiming damages since the seizure and recovery of the Minilab Equipment was not in bad faith and respondent was well within its right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup><br><br><center>III<br></center><br>The Letter Agreement contained an indivisible obligation.<br><br>Both parties rely on the Letter Agreement<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> as basis of their respective obligations. Written by respondent's Jeffrey T. Go and Antonio V. Mines and addressed to petitioner Alexander Lam, the Letter Agreement contemplated a "package deal" involving three (3) units of the Kodak Minilab System 22XL, with the following terms and conditions:<br><br><blockquote>This confirms our verbal agreement for Kodak Phils., Ltd. to provide Colorkwik Laboratories, Inc. with three (3) units Kodak Minilab System 22XL . . . for your proposed outlets in Rizal Avenue (Manila), Tagum (Davao del Norte), and your existing Multicolor photo counter in Cotabato City under the following terms and conditions:<br><br>1. Said Minilab Equipment packages will avail a total of 19% multiple order discount based on prevailing equipment price provided said equipment packages will be purchased not later than June 30, 1992.<br><br>2. 19% Multiple Order Discount shall be applied in the form of merchandise and delivered in advance immediately after signing of the contract.<br>* Also includes start-up packages worth P61,000.00.<br><br>3. NO DOWNPAYMENT.<br><br>4. Minilab Equipment Package shall be payable in 48 monthly installments at THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P35,000.00) inclusive of 24% interest rate for the first 12 months; the balance shall be re-amortized for the remaining 36 months and the prevailing interest shall be applied.<br><br>5. Prevailing price of Kodak Minilab System 22XL as of January 8, 1992 is at ONE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX THOUSAND PESOS.<br><br>6. Price is subject to change without prior notice.<br>*Secured with PDCs; 1st monthly amortization due 45 days after installation[.]<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup></blockquote><br>Based on the foregoing, the intention of the parties is for there to be a single transaction covering all three (3) units of the Minilab Equipment. Respondent's obligation was to deliver all products purchased under a "package," and, in turn, petitioners' obligation was to pay for the total purchase price, payable in installments.<br><br>The intention of the parties to bind themselves to an indivisible obligation can be further discerned through their direct acts in relation to the package deal. There was only one agreement covering all three (3) units of the Minilab Equipment and their accessories. The Letter Agreement specified only one purpose for the buyer, which was to obtain these units for three different outlets. If the intention of the parties were to have a divisible contract, then separate agreements could have been made for each Minilab Equipment unit instead of covering all three in one package deal. Furthermore, the 19% multiple order discount as contained in the Letter Agreement was applied to all three acquired units.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[99]</sup> The "no downpayment" term contained in the Letter Agreement was also applicable to all the Minilab Equipment units. Lastly, the fourth clause of the Letter Agreement clearly referred to the object of the contract as "Minilab Equipment Package."<br><br>In ruling that the contract between the parties intended to cover divisible obligations, the Court of Appeals highlighted: (a) the separate purchase price of each item; (b) petitioners' acceptance of separate deliveries of the units; and (c) the separate payment arrangements for each unit.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[100]</sup> However, through the specified terms and conditions, the tenor of the Letter Agreement indicated an intention for a single transaction. This intent must prevail even though the articles involved are physically separable and capable of being paid for and delivered individually, consistent with the New Civil Code:<br><br><blockquote>Article 1225. For the purposes of the preceding articles, obligations to give definite things and those which are not susceptible of partial performance shall be deemed to be indivisible.<br><br>When the obligation has for its object the execution of a certain number of days of work, the accomplishment of work by metrical units, or analogous things which by their nature are susceptible of partial performance, it shall be divisible.<br><br><i>However, even though the object or service may be physically divisible, an obligation is indivisible if so provided by law or intended by the parties.</i> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>In <i>Nazareno v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[101]</sup> the indivisibility of an obligation is tested against whether it can be the subject of partial performance:<br><br><blockquote><i>An obligation is indivisible when it cannot be validly performed in parts, whatever may be the nature of the thing which is the object thereof</i>. The indivisibility refers to the prestation and not to the object thereof. In the present case, the Deed of Sale of January 29, 1970 supposedly conveyed the six lots to Natividad. The obligation is clearly indivisible because the performance of the contract cannot be done in parts, otherwise the value of what is transferred is diminished. Petitioners are therefore mistaken in basing the indivisibility of a contract on the number of obligors.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[102]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citation omitted)</blockquote><br>There is no indication in the Letter Agreement that the units petitioners ordered were covered by three (3) separate transactions. The factors considered by the Court of Appeals are mere incidents of the execution of the obligation, which is to deliver three units of the Minilab Equipment on the part of respondent and payment for all three on the part of petitioners. The intention to create an indivisible contract is apparent from the benefits that the Letter Agreement afforded to both parties. Petitioners were given the 19% discount on account of a multiple order, with the discount being equally applicable to all units that they sought to acquire. The provision on "no downpayment" was also applicable to all units. Respondent, in turn, was entitled to payment of all three Minilab Equipment units, payable by installments.<br><br><center>IV<br></center><br>With both parties opting for rescission of the contract under Article 1191, the Court of Appeals correctly ordered for restitution.<br><br>The contract between the parties is one of sale, where one party obligates himself or herself to transfer the ownership and deliver a determinate thing, while the other pays a certain price in money or its equivalent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> A contract of sale is perfected upon the meeting of minds as to the object and the price, and the parties may reciprocally demand the performance of their respective obligations from that point on.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>The Court of Appeals correctly noted that respondent had rescinded the parties' Letter Agreement through the letter dated October 14, 1992.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup> It likewise noted petitioners' rescission through the letter dated November 18, 1992.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup> This rescission from both parties is founded on Article 1191 of the New Civil Code:<br><br><blockquote>The power to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him.<br><br>The injured party may choose between the fulfilment and the rescission of the obligation, with the payment of damages in either case. He may also seek rescission, even after he has chosen fulfilment, if the latter should become impossible.<br><br>The court shall decree the rescission claimed, unless there be just cause authorizing the fixing of a period.<br></blockquote><br>Rescission under Article 1191 has the effect of mutual restitution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> In <i>Velarde v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Rescission abrogates the contract from its inception and requires a mutual restitution of benefits received.<br>. . . .<br><br><i>Rescission creates the obligation to return the object of the contract. It can be carried out only when the one who demands rescission can return whatever he may be obliged to restore. To rescind is to declare a contract void at its inception and to put an end to it as though it never was. It is not merely to terminate it and release the parties from further obligations to each other, but to abrogate it from the beginning and restore the parties to their relative positions as if no contract has been made</i>. (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)</blockquote><br>The Court of Appeals correctly ruled that both parties must be restored to their original situation as far as practicable, as if the contract was never entered into. Petitioners must relinquish possession of the delivered Minilab Equipment unit and accessories, while respondent must return the amount tendered by petitioners as partial payment for the unit received. Further, respondent cannot claim that the two (2) monthly installments should be offset against the amount awarded by the Court of Appeals to petitioners because the effect of rescission under Article 1191 is to bring the parties back to their original positions before the contract was entered into. Also in <i>Velarde</i>:<br><br><blockquote>As discussed earlier, the breach committed by petitioners was the nonperformance of a reciprocal obligation, not a violation of the terms and conditions of the mortgage contract. Therefore, the automatic rescission and forfeiture of payment clauses stipulated in the contract does not apply. Instead, Civil Code provisions shall govern and regulate the resolution of this controversy.<br><br><i>Considering that the rescission of the contract is based on Article 1191 of the Civil Code, mutual restitution is required to bring back the parties to their original situation prior to the inception of the contract. Accordingly, the initial payment of P800.000 and the corresponding mortgage payments in the amounts of P27,225, P23.000 and P23.925 (totaling P874,150.00) advanced by petitioners should be returned by private respondents, lest the latter unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of the former</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[110] </sup>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>When rescission is sought under Article 1191 of the Civil Code, it need not be judicially invoked because the power to resolve is implied in reciprocal obligations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup> The right to resolve allows an injured party to minimize the damages he or she may suffer on account of the other party's failure to perform what is incumbent upon him or her.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[112]</sup> When a party fails to comply with his or her obligation, the other party's right to resolve the contract is triggered.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[113]</sup> The resolution immediately produces legal effects if the non-performing party does not question the resolution.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[114]</sup> Court intervention only becomes necessary when the party who allegedly failed to comply with his or her obligation disputes the resolution of the contract.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> Since both parties in this case have exercised their right to resolve under Article 1191, there is no need for a judicial decree before the resolution produces effects.<br><br><center>V<br></center><br>The issue of damages is a factual one.

WE rule that the liability of Island Savings Bank for damages in not furnishing the entire loan is offset by the liability of Sulpicio M. Tolentino for damages, in the form of penalties and surcharges, for not paying his overdue P17,000.00 debt. The liability of Sulpicio M. Tolentino for interest on his P17,000.00 debt shall not be included in offsetting the liabilities of both parties. Since Sulpicio M.

Where the seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods larger than he contracted to sell, the buyer may accept the goods included in the contract and reject the rest. If the buyer accepts the whole of the goods so delivered he must pay for them at the contract rate. Where the seller delivers to the buyer the goods he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description not included in the contract, the buyer may accept the goods which are in accordance with the contract and reject the rest.<br><br>In the preceding two paragraphs, if the subject matter is indivisible, the buyer may reject the whole of the goods.<br><br>The provisions of this article are subject to any usage of trade, special agreement, or course of dealing between the parties, (n)"<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Id<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Id. at 80.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Id. at 23.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Id.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> Id. at 129.
