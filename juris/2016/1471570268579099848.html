Navarro:<br><br>This is in reply to your letter dated August 19, 1992 which our office received on August 20, 1992.<br><br>My clients, Spouses Jesus and Letecia Bardilas, disagree with Mr. Bernabe Mercader's claim that he is entitled to the use of their road right of way. Attached as Annex "A" is a photocopy of my clients' TCT No. 107915 of the property in question which clearly states that my clients' property is subject to three (3) meters wide right of way. Mr. Mercader's TCT No 107914, which was issued on the same day and time as my clients' TCT on March 30, 1989 at 10:10 a.m., don't (sic) have the same provision regarding the use of a right of way. This is because Mr. Mercader's property is fronting the street while my clients' property is situated at the back of Mr. Mercader's property; hence, the provision regarding the right of way on my clients' TCT.<br><br>It is true that my clients' road right of way has been closed since June, 1992 due to a wall constructed by the Clarita Village Association resulting in much inconvenience to my clients since they have to pass through a circuitous and muddy road. However, in a meeting with their Barangay Captain, the officers of the Clarita Village Association already agreed to let my clients pass through the wall provided they will put up a gate between the walls. My clients already have a three (3) meter wide gate ready to be put up only to discover that it won't fit because Mr. Mercader has encroached their road right of way. Hence, my letter to Mr. Mercader on August 14, 1992, informing him to pay P30,000.00 to my clients or to demolished (sic) his wall fence and portions of his house which encroached my clients' road right of way.<br><br>Since Mr. Mercader opts to pay my clients, we reiterate our demand for P30,000.00 which is the fair market value of my clients' property.<br><br>We hope we could settle this matter within this week.<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Civil Case No. CEB-12783</b><br></div><br>Finding the demand for payment of P30,000.00 by the Spouses Bardilas to be unlawful, unwarranted and unfounded, the Spouses Mercader commenced on September 8, 1992 their action for declaratory relief, injunction and damages against the Spouses Bardilas in the RTC in Cebu City (Civil Case No. CEB-12783).

They contend that the technical description of their property contained the phrase "with existing Right of Way (3.00 meters wide)," which signified that they were equally "entitled to the road-right-of-way being conferred upon them by TITLE pursuant to Article 622 of the New Civil Code." They submit that:<br><blockquote>Hence, they too should equally share in its retention for uses other than the easement after its non-user brought about by the closure of the exit point by Clarita Village Association. As borne out by the evidence, the respective properties of petitioners Sps. Bernabe and Lorna Mercader, on one hand, and Sps. Jesus and Letecia Bardilas, on the other hand, used to be a whole Lot 5808-F-2 with an area of 338 square meters before the same was subdivided into Lot 5808-F-2-A with an area of 89 square emters for the petitioner spouses and Lot 5808-F-2-B with an area of 249 square meters for the respondents. Before the subdivision, there was already a 3-meter wide road right of way leading towards Clarita Village. Thus, after the subdivision, the subject easement was annotated in both certificates of title as earlier stated. Very clearly, petitioners Bernabe and Lorna Mercader, and respondents Jesus and Letecia Bardilas, should equally share in the area of the easement. Consequently, the petitioners cannot be ordered to return the portion of easement on which part of petitioners' house and fence stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></div><br>We cannot sustain the petitioners' claim that they acquired their right to the road right of way by title.<br><br>Easement or servitude, according to <i>Valdez v.

"It exists only when the servient and dominant estates belong to two different owners. It gives the holder of the easement an incorporeal interest on the land but grants no title thereto. Therefore, an acknowledgment of the easement is an admission that the property belongs to another."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>It is settled that road right of way is a discontinuous apparent easement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> in the context of Article 622 of the <i>Civil Code</i>, which provides that continuous non-apparent easements, and discontinuous ones, whether apparent or not, may be acquired only by virtue of title. But the phrase <i>with existing Right of Way</i> in the TCT is not one of the modes of acquisition of the easement by virtue of a title. Acquisition <i>by virtue of title</i>, as used in Art. 622 of the <i>Civil Code</i>, refers to "the juridical act which gives birth to the easement, such as law, donation, contract, and will of the testator."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>A perusal of the technical description of Lot No. 5808-F-2-A indicates that the phrase <i>with existing Right of Way (3.00 meters wide)</i> referred to or described Lot No. 5808-F-2-B,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> which was one of the boundaries defining Lot F-2-A. Moreover, under the Torrens system of land registration, the certificate of title attests "to the fact that the person named in the certificate is the owner of the property therein described, subject to such liens and encumbrances as thereon noted or what the law warrants or reserves. The objective is to obviate possible conflicts of title by giving the public the right to rely upon the face of the Torrens certificate and to dispense, as a rule, with the necessity of inquiring further. The Torrens system gives the registered owner complete peace of mind, in order that he will be secured in his ownership as long as he has not voluntarily disposed of any right over the covered land."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> The Torrens certificate of title is merely an evidence of ownership or title in the particular property described therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>What really defines a piece of land is not the area mentioned in its description, but the boundaries therein laid down, as enclosing the land and indicating its limits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> As shown in the subdivision plan of Lot No. 5808-F-2,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and based on the technical description of Lot No. 5808-F-2-B as appearing in TCT No. 107915,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> the right of way in dispute, which is "(B)ounded on the SW, along line 1-2 by Lot 5808-F-1, Psd-07-01 -004579; on the West along line 2-3 by Lot 5726, Cebu Cad.; on the North along line 3-4-5 by Lot 5725, Cebu Cadastre" was part of Lot No. 5808-F-2-B of the Spouses Bardilas.<br><br>It is noteworthy that an encumbrance "subject to 3 meters wide right of way" was annotated on TCT No. 107915, which covers Lot No. 5808-F-2-B of the Spouses Bardilas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> As the owners of the servient estate, the Spouses Bardilas retained ownership of the road right of way even assuming that said encumbrance was for the benefit of Lot No. 5808-F-2-A of the Spouses Mercader. The latter could not claim to own even a portion of the road right of way because Article 630 of the <i>Civil Code</i> expressly provides that "[t]he owner of the servient estate retains ownership of the portion on which the easement is established, and may use the same in such manner as not to affect the exercise of the easement."<br><br>With the right of way rightfully belonging to them as the owners of the burdened property, the Spouses Bardilas remained entitled to avail themselves of all the attributes of ownership under the <i>Civil Code</i>, specifically: <i>jus utendi, jus fruendi, jus abutendi, jus disponendi</i> and <i>jus vindicandi</i>. Article 428 of the Civil Code recognizes that the owner has the right to enjoy and dispose of a thing, without other limitations than those established by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> In that regard, the CA cogently pointed out:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><blockquote>Moreover, as owners of the three (3) square meter wide road in dispute, the appellants (referring to the Bardilas spouses) may rightfully compel the petitioners-appellees to pay to them the value of the land upon which a portion of their (petitioners-appellees) house encroaches, and in case the petitioners-appellees fail to pay, the appellants may remove or demolish the encroaching portion of the petitioners-appellees' house. xxxx<br></blockquote>The second issue concerns the award of attorney's fees. Relying on <i>Bernardo v. Court of Appeals</i>, (<i>Special Sixth Division</i>),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> the petitioners argue that the CA erred "in awarding attorney's fees to the appellants after eliminating or refusing to award moral and exemplary damages;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> that the CA did not make any finding to the effect "that the appellants were compelled to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect their interest;"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> and that, consequently, the grant of attorneys' fees to the Spouses Bardillas lacked legal basis.<br><br>The award of attorney's fees and expenses of litigation is governed by Article 2208 of the <i>Civil Code</i>, to wit:<br><blockquote>Art. 2208. In the absence of stipulation, attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, cannot be recovered, except:<br><br>(1) When exemplary damages is awarded;<br><br>(2) When the defendant's act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third persons or incur expenses to protect his interest;<br><br>(3) In criminal cases of malicious prosecution against the plaintiff;<br><br>(4) In case of a clearly unfounded civil case or proceeding against the plaintiff;<br><br>(5) Where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiffs plainly valid, just and demandable claim;<br><br>(6) In actions for legal support;<br><br>(7) In actions for the recovery of wages of household helpers, laborers and skilled workers;<br><br>(8) In actions for indemnity under workmen's compensation and employer's liability laws;<br><br>(9) In a separate civil action to recover civil liability arising from a crime;<br><br>(10) When at least double judicial costs are awarded;<br><br>(11) In any other case where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney's fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.<br><br>In all cases, the attorney's fees and expenses of litigation must be reasonable.<br></blockquote>In <i>Philippine National Construction Corporation v. APAC Marketing Corporation</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> the Court opined that whenever attorney's fees are granted, the basis for the grant must be clearly expressed in the judgment of the court. It expounded on why this is so:<br><blockquote>In <i>ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp. v. CA</i>, this Court had the occasion to expound on the policy behind the grant of attorney's fees as actual or compensatory damages:<br><blockquote>(T)he law is clear the in the absence of stipulation, attorney's fees may be recovered as actual or compensatory damages under any of the circumstance provided for in Article 2208 of the Civil Code.<br><br>The general rule is that attorney's fees cannot be recovered as part of damages because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate. They are not to be awarded every time a party wins a suit. The power of the court to award attorney's fees under Article 2208 demands factual, legal, and equitable justification. Even when a claimant is compelled to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his rights, still attorney's fees may not be awarded where no sufficient showing of bad faith could be reflected in a party's persistence in a case other than an erroneous conviction of the righteousness of his cause.<br></blockquote>In <i>Benedicto v. Villafores</i>, we explained the reason behind the need for the courts to arrive upon an actual finding to serve as basis for a grant of attorney's fees, considering the dual concept of these fees as ordinary and extraordinary:<br><blockquote>It is settled that the award of attorney's fees is the exception rather than the general rule; counsel's fees are not awarded every time a party prevails in a suit because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate. Attorney's fees, as part of damages, are not necessarily equated to the amount paid by a litigant to a lawyer. In the ordinary sense, attorney's fees represent the reasonable compensation paid to a lawyer by his client for the legal services he has rendered to the latter; while in its extraordinary concept, they may be awarded by the court as indemnity for damages to be paid by the losing party to the prevailing party. Attorney's fees as part of damages are awarded only in the instances specified in Article 2208 of the Civil Code. As such, it is necessary for the court to make findings of fact and law that would bring the case within the ambit of these enumerated instances to justify the grant of such award, and in all cases it must be reasonable.<br></blockquote>We can glean from the above ruling that attorney's lees are not awarded as a matter of course every time a party wins. We do not put a premium on the right to litigate. On occasions that those fees are awarded, the basis for the grant must be clearly expressed in the decision of the court.<br></blockquote>In awarding attorney's fees, the CA relied on Article 2208 (11) of the <i>Civil Code</i>. The exercise of the discretion to allow attorney's fees must likewise be justified. In <i>Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Margarine-Verkaufs-Union</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> the Court said:<br><blockquote>Insofar as the present case is concerned, the lower court made no finding that it fells within any of the exceptions that would justify the award of attorney's fees, such as gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy a plainly valid, just and demandable claim. Even under the broad eleventh exception of the cited article which allows the imposition of attorney's fees "in any other case where the court deems it just and equitable that attorney's fees and expenses in litigation should be recovered," the Court stressed in <i>Buan, supra</i>, that "the conclusion must be borne out by findings of facts and law. What is just and equitable in a given case is not a mere matter of feeling but of demonstration. . . . Hence, the exercise of judicial discretion in the award of attorney's fees under Article 2208 (11) of the Civil Code demands a factual, legal or equitable justification upon the basis of which the court exercises its discretion. Without such justification, the award is a conclusion without a premise, its basis being improperly left to speculation and conjecture." The summary award of counsel's fees made in the appealed judgment must therefore be set aside.<br></blockquote>Considering that the decision of the CA does not express any justification other than stating that attorney's fees were being awarded to the respondents "pursuant to paragraph 11 of Article 2208 of the New <i>Civil Code</i>" the award by the CA must be set aside; otherwise, attorney's fees would be turned into a premium on the right to litigate, which is prohibited. Moreover, attorney's fees, being in the nature of actual damages, should be based on the facts on record and the Court must delineate the legal reason for such award.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>AFFIRMS</b> the judgment promulgated on March 18, 2003 in C.A.-G.R.
