  <p>Thereafter, joint trial on the merits ensued. The prosecution 
presented the testimonies of four (4) members of the PDEA who 
participated in the apprehension of appellants, namely, PO3 Rudy 
Gepaneca, P/Sr. Inspector Leroy Rapiz, PO1 Rommel Aguenido and SPO3 
Novemito Calaor. The prosecution also presented SPO4 Glicerio Gafate, 
Exhibit Custodian of the PDEA, who took initial custody of the items 
seized from appellants, and P/Insp. Agustina Ompoy, the one who examined
 the items subject of the cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></p>
  <p> The evidence of the prosecution may be summed up as follows: On 
July 22, 2004, PO3 Gepaneca of the PDEA was informed by a confidential 
agent that one<em> alias</em> "Susan Kana" was selling shabu in Brgy. 
Gustilo, Zone 6, Lapaz, Iloilo City. The following day, PO3 Gepaneca and
 the agent conducted a surveillance of the said area wherein the agent 
pointed to a woman identified as "Susan Kana."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
  </p><p> On July 27, 2004, after confirmation from the agent that that 
they could purchase shabu from "Susan Kana," a buy-bust team was formed 
by P/Sr. Inspector Rapiz. Around 11:30 in the morning, the team 
proceeded to the target area in Brgy. Gustilo. After waiting for a 
while, appellants arrived. PO3 Gepaneca was introduced by the agent to 
one Susan Kana who turned out to be appellant Susan Tamaño. Then, PO3 
Gepaneca took the P500 buy-bust money and handed it to appellant Tamaño 
who, in turn, told appellant Gulmatico to give a sachet of<em> shabu</em> to PO3 Gepaneca. After appellant Gulmatico handed to PO3 Gepaneca one (1) plastic sachet of<em> shabu</em> weighing 0.220 gram (<em>Exhibits "J-1"</em>),
 the latter took off his cap as a signal that the transaction was 
consummated. At that point, PO1 Aguenido immediately arrested and 
searched the persons of appellants. The P500.00 bill (<em>Exhibits "M-1"</em>)
 was recovered from the right hand of appellant Tamaño; and from her 
right pocket, a big plastic sachet was recovered containing three (3) 
plastic sachets of suspected <em>shabu</em> with markings "Susan", "Merriam and "Kelly" (<em>Exhibits "I-2 ", "I-3 ", "I-4"</em>) with a total weight of 0.345 gram. Also, four (4) empty plastic sachets and two (2) pieces of disposable lighters (<em>Exhibits "P-1 " and "P-2"</em>),
 among others, were recovered from the bag of appellant Tamaño. On the 
other hand, PO1 Aguenido recovered from the right pocket of appellant 
Gulmatico twenty­ four (24) sachets of suspected shabu (<em>Exhibits "K-2" to "K-25 ", "E-2-A"</em>) with a total weight of 8.695 grams and two (2) small sachets of suspected<em> shabu</em> (<em>Exhibits "K-27" and "K-28''</em>); and, from his plastic bag were recovered fifteen (15) empty plastic sachets, one (1) plastic straw (<em>Exhibits "L-1"</em>) and nine (9) sliced aluminum foils (<em>Exhibits "T-1" to "T-9"</em>).
 The seized items were brought to the police officers' office and were 
accordingly marked by SPO3 Calaor and turned over to PDEA Exhibit 
Custodian SPO4 Gafate. The following day, SPO3 Calaor took the same 
items to the Iloilo City Prosecution Office where they were all 
inventoried. Thereafter, SPO3 Calaor submitted some of the items, 
including the sachets of suspected <em>shabu</em>, to the PNP Crime 
Laboratory for examination. P/Insp. Ompoy, Forensic Chemical Officer, 
examined the sachets, and the contents turned positive to the test for 
methampheatmine hydrochloride (<em>shabu</em>), while the plastic straw revealed traces of shabu, as stated in Chemistry Report No. D-17304 (<em>Exhibits "E" and "E-3''</em>).</p><p>
 The defense, on the other hand, presented appellants and offered a 
different version of what transpired on the day of the arrest. 
Appellants narrated that around 9:00 o'clock in the morning of July 27, 
2004, appellant Tamaño was helping her aunt at the latter's "carenderia"
 situated at the Lapaz Public Market. She was, at the same time, waiting
 for appellant Gulmatico because they agreed to visit their friend, Joel
 Amihan, in Brgy. Gustilo, Lapaz. Appellant Tamaño's friend named Gigi 
arrived and requested appellant Tamaño to bring to Gigi's boyfriend, in 
Bo. Obrero, Iloilo City, pieces of clothing placed in a plastic bag. 
When appellant Gulmatico arrived, the two appellants proceeded to Brgy. 
Gustilo. Along the way, appellant Tamaño got suspicious of the contents 
of the plastic bag, so she let appellant Gulmatico carry the same. When 
the two were at the house of Joel Amihan, Jeffrey Valenzuela, who is a 
common friend, arrived. After some conversations, the four decided to 
leave the place. While leaving, appellants were accosted by the police 
officers and brought to Camp Delgado where they were searched. As a 
result of the search, sachets of suspected <em>shabu</em> and <em>shabu </em>paraphernalia, among others, were recovered from the plastic bag of Gigi which was then being carried by appellant Gulmatico.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> During the trial of the cases, two other witnesses corroborated some portions of the testimonies of appellants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p>
 On May 29, 2007, the RTC rendered a Decision convicting appellants of 
Violation of Sections 5, 11 and 12, Article II of R.A. No. 9165. The 
pertinent portions of the<em> fallo</em> read as follows:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:</p>

 they voluntarily agree in writing to abide by the conditions imposed on
 convicted prisoners pursuant to the provision of Article 29 of the 
Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Aggrieved, appellants appealed the aforesaid Decision to the CA<em> via</em> a Notice of Appeal.</p><p> On August 31, 2012, the CA affirmed the appellants' conviction. The<em> fallo</em> of the Decision reads, thus:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, in view of the foregoing premises, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court convicting both appellants is hereby AFFIRMED<em> in toto</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Still unsatisfied, appellants elevated the aforesaid Decision of the CA to this Court <em>via</em> a Notice of Appeal.</p><p>
 In a Resolution dated October 9, 2013, this Court required the parties 
to submit their respective Supplemental Briefs if they so desire.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Both parties manifested that they are no longer filing a Supplemental Brief. </p><p> In their Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 appellants stated that the trial court has "misapplied some facts of 
value which if considered could probably alter the result of the 
decision convicting both accused-appellants of the crime/crimes as 
charged, such as:"
  </p><ol start="" type="A"><li>  THAT THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES COMMITTED CONTRADICTION AS TO 
THE IDENTITY OF THEIR SUBJECT PERSON WHICH POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THERE
 WAS NO BUY-BUST OPERATION AT ALL; <br><br></li><li> THE TIME OF THE RECORDING OF THE BUY-BUST MONEY CAME LATER THAN THE TIME OF ARREST; <br><br></li><li> THAT NO INVENTORY OF THE RECOVERIES WERE MADE AT THE PLACE WHERE THE ALEGED BUY-BUST WAS HELD; <br><br></li><li> THAT THERE IS NO CLEAR STATEMENT AS TO WHO ACTUALLY CARRIED THE
 ARTICLES SEIZED FROM THE PLACE OF THE ALLEGED BUY-BUST OPERATION;<br><br></li><li>THAT THE EXAMINATION CONDUCTED BY THE FORENSIC OFFICER OF THE 	
SPECIMEN SUBJECT OF THE CASE IS NOT SUFFICIENT COMPLIANCE UNDER SECTION 
21 OF R.A. 9165.</li></ol>
  <p> We dismiss the appeal. From the issues raised by the appellants, 
they are basically questioning the validity of the buy-bust operation 
and the compliance with the chain of custody rule.</p><p> In every prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs, like <em>shabu</em>
 in this case, the following elements must be sufficiently proved to 
sustain a conviction therefor: (1) the identity of the buyer, as well as
 the seller, the object and consideration of the sale; and (2) the 
delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. What is material is
 proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with 
the presentation in court of the dangerous drugs seized as evidence. The
 commission of the offense of illegal sale of dangerous drugs requires 
merely the consummation of the selling transaction, which happens the 
moment the buyer receives the drug from the seller. Settled is the rule 
that as long as the police officer went through the operation as a buyer
 and his offer was accepted by appellant and the dangerous drugs 
delivered to the former, the crime is considered consummated by the 
delivery of the goods.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></p><p>
 In Criminal Case No. 04-59517, We agree with the lower courts that the 
aforesaid elements of illegal sale of dangerous drugs were adequately 
and satisfactorily established by the prosecution.</p><p> The appellants who were caught<em> in flagrante delicto</em>
 were positively identified by the prosecution witnesses as the same 
persons who sold one (1) plastic sachet containing 0.220 gram of white 
crystalline substance, later confirmed as <em>shabu</em>, for a consideration of P500.00. The said plastic sachet of <em>shabu</em>
 was presented in court, which the prosecution identified to be the same
 object sold by appellants. Likewise, the testimonies of the prosecution
 witnesses established how the transaction with appellants happened from
 the moment the informant introduced PO3 Gepaneca, the poseur-buyer, to 
appellants, as someone interested in buying their stuff, up to the time 
PO3 Gepaneca handed to appellant Tamaño the P500.00 bill and, in turn, 
appellant Gulmatico handed to him the plastic sachet of suspected <em>shabu</em>, thus, consummating the sale transaction between them. SPO3 Calaor caused the plastic sachet of suspected <em>shabu</em>
 be examined at the PNP Crime Laboratory. The item weighing 0.220 gram 
was tested positive to the test for methamphetamine hydrochloride (<em>shabu</em>),
 as evidenced by Chemistry Report No. D-17304 prepared by P/Insp. Ompoy,
 the Forensic Chemical Officer. It must be noted that the defense 
admitted the expertise of P/Insp. Ompoy who examined the drug specimens.</p><p>
 Thus, the collective evidence presented during the trial by the 
prosecution adequately established that a valid buy-bust operation was 
conducted. Appellants conspired and confederated with each other to sell
 <em>shabu</em>. Appellant Tamaño received the P500 bill, while 
appellant Gulmatico handed the shabu to the buyer. Their respective acts
 lead to no other conclusion except that they have a common design and 
purpose - to sell shabu.</p><p> Appellants argue that the prosecution 
witnesses committed contradiction as to the identity of their subject 
person which was identified as one Susan Kana, and which allegedly 
points to the fact that there was no buy-bust operation at all. This 
argument is flawed. The fact that appellants were caught<em> in flagrante delicto</em>
 makes the discrepancies between the names of the suspects in the 
surveillance reports and the names of the accused immaterial. What is 
material is that the transaction or sale actually took place, as in this
 case. What matters is not the existing familiarity between the buyer 
and the seller or the time and venue of the sale, but the fact of 
agreement and the acts constituting sale and delivery of the prohibited 
drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p><p> With respect
 to the prosecution for illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the 
following facts must be proved: (a) the accused was in possession of 
dangerous drugs, (b) such possession was not authorized by law, and (c) 
the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of 
dangerous drugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p><p> In
 the cases under consideration specifically Criminal Case Nos. 04- 
595118 and 04-59520, We also conform to the lower courts' findings that 
all the elements of illegal possession of dangerous drugs were 
adequately proven by the prosecution. When an accused is caught <em>in flagrante delicto</em>
 in accordance with Section 5(a) of Rule 113 of the Revised Rules on 
Criminal Procedure, the police officers are not only authorized, but are
 duty-bound, to arrest him even without a warrant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Thus, since appellants' arrest was legal, the search and seizure that resulted from it were likewise lawful.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
  </p><p> As a result of the lawful search on the persons of appellants,
 appellant Tamaño was found to be in possession of a big plastic sachet 
containing three (3) plastic sachets of <em>shabu</em>, a dangerous drug, with markings "Susan", "Merriam and "Kelly", and with a total weight of 0.345 gram (<em>Exhibits ''I-2 ", "I-3 ", "I-4"</em>).
 On the other hand, appellant Gulmatico was found to be in possession of
 twenty-four (24) sachets of<span style="font-style: italic;"> shabu</span> with a total weight of 8.695 grams (<em>Exhibits "K-2" to "K-25 ", "E-2-A"</em>) and two (2) small sachets of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> (<em>Exhibits "K-27" and "K-28"</em>).
 Both could not present any proof or justification that they were fully 
authorized by law to possess the same. The mere possession of a 
prohibited drug constitutes prima facie evidence of knowledge or<em> animus possidendi</em> (intent to possess) sufficient to convict an accused in the absence of any satisfactory explanation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Both appellants were found in possession of dangerous drugs.</p><p>
 We find untenable the contention of appellants that since the provision
 of Section 21, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 was not strictly 
complied with, the prosecution allegedly failed to prove the identity 
and integrity of the seized prohibited drugs.</p><p> Section 21, paragraph 1, of Article II of R.A. No. 9165 reads:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> Section 21. <em>Custody and Disposition of  Confiscated, Seized 
and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, 
Controlled Precursors and Essentials Chemicals, 
Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment</em>. - The PDEA 
shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources
 of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as 
well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so 
confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the 
following manner:</p>
    <p> (1) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and 
control of the drugs shall immediately, after seizure and confiscation, 
physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the 
accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or 
seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the 
media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public 
official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and 
be given a copy thereof.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Further, Section 21 (a), Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. No. 9165 similarly provides that:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> (a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and 
control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, 
physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the 
accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or 
seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the 
media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public 
official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and 
be given a copy thereof: x x x Provided, further, that non-compliance 
with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the 
integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly 
preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and 
invalid such seizures of and custody over said items. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In the prosecution of illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the dangerous drug itself constitutes the very <em>corpus delicti</em> of the offense and, in sustaining a conviction therefor, the identity and integrity of the <em>corpus delicti </em>must
 definitely be shown to have been preserved. This requirement 
necessarily arises from the illegal drug's unique characteristic that 
renders it indistinct, not readily identifiable, and easily open to 
tampering, alteration or substitution either by accident or otherwise. 
Thus, to remove any doubt or uncertainty on the identity and integrity 
of the seized drug, evidence must definitely show that the illegal drug 
presented in court is the same illegal drug actually recovered from the 
accused-appellant; otherwise, the prosecution for illegal possession of 
dangerous drugs under R.A. No. 9165 fails.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 In this regard, the aforesaid provisions outline the procedure to be 
observed by the apprehending officers in the seizure and custody of 
dangerous drugs.</p><p> Similarly, in the prosecution of illegal sale of dangerous drugs, the dangerous drug itself constitutes the very <em>corpus delicti</em>
 of the offense, and the fact of its existence beyond reasonable doubt, 
plus the fact of its delivery and/or sale, are both vital and essential 
to a judgment of conviction. And more than just the fact of sale, of 
prime importance is that the identity of the dangerous drug be likewise 
established beyond reasonable doubt. In other words, it must be 
established with unwavering exactitude that the dangerous drug presented
 in court as evidence against the accused is the same as that seized 
from him in the first place. The chain of custody requirement performs 
this function in that it ensures that unnecessary doubts concerning the 
identity of the evidence are removed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></p><p>
 However, under the same proviso aforecited, non-compliance with the 
stipulated procedure, under justifiable grounds, shall not render void 
and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items, for as long as
 the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly 
preserved by the apprehending officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 While nowhere in the prosecution's evidence would show the "justifiable
 ground" which may excuse the police operatives involved from making an 
immediate physical inventory of the drugs confiscated and/or seized, 
such omission shall not render appellants' arrest illegal or the items 
seized/confiscated from them as inadmissible in evidence. Said 
"justifiable ground" will remain unknown in the light of the apparent 
failure of appellants to specifically challenge the custody and 
safekeeping or the issue of disposition and preservation of the subject 
drug before the trial court. They cannot be allowed too late in the day 
to question the police officers' alleged non-compliance with Section 21 
for the first time on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></p><p>
 Moreover, the rule on chain of custody under the foregoing enactments 
expressly demands the identification of the persons who handled the 
confiscated items for the purpose of duly monitoring the authorized 
movements of the illegal drugs from the time they are seized from the 
accused until the time they are presented in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>
 The chain of custody requirement performs the function of ensuring that
 the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are preserved, 
so much so that unnecessary doubts as to the identity of the evidence 
are removed. To be admissible, the prosecution must show by records or 
testimony, the continuous whereabouts of the exhibit at least between 
the time it came into possession of the police officers until it was 
tested in the laboratory to determine its composition up to the time it 
was offered in evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></p><p>
 Section 1(b) of Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002,
 implementing R.A. No. 9165, defines chain of custody as follows:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> Chain of Custody means the duly recorded authorized movements 
and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plant sources of 
dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment of each stage, from the time of 
seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to 
safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction. Such record of 
movements and custody of seized item shall include the identity and 
signature of the person who held temporary custody of the seized item, 
the date and time when such transfer of custody were made in the course 
of safekeeping and use in court as evidence, and the final disposition.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In the cases at bar, PO1 Aguenido immediately searched the persons
 of appellants. From the right pocket of appellant Tamaño, a big plastic
 sachet was recovered containing three (3) plastic sachets of <em>shabu</em>
 with a total weight of 0.345 gram. On the other hand, PO1 Aguenido 
recovered from the right pocket of appellant Gulmatico twenty-four (24) 
sachets of <em>shabu</em> with a total weight of 8.695 grams and two (2) small sachets of <em>shabu</em>.
 The seized items were brought to the police officers' office and were 
accordingly marked by SPO3 Calaor and turned over to PDEA Exhibit 
Custodian SPO4 Gafate. The following day, SPO3 Calaor took the same 
items to the Iloilo City Prosecution Office where they were all 
inventoried. Thereafter, SPO3 Calaor submitted some of the items 
including the sachets of <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> to the PNP Crime Laboratory for 
examination. P/Insp. Ompoy, Forensic Chemical Officer, examined the 
sachets and the contents were positive to the test for methampheatmine 
hydrochloride (<em>shabu</em>). During the trial of the cases, PO3 
Gepaneca, P/Sr. Inspector Rapiz, PO1 Aguenido, SPO3 Calaor, SPO4 Gafate 
and P/Insp. Ompoy testified for the prosecution. They properly 
identified the Chemistry Report and the subject specimens when presented
 in court.</p><p> From the foregoing, the prosecution was able to 
demonstrate that the integrity and evidentiary value of the confiscated 
drugs had not been compromised because it established the crucial link 
in the chain of custody of the seized item from the time it was first 
discovered until it was brought to the court for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>
 The chain of custody rule requires the identification of the persons 
who handled the confiscated items for the purpose of duly monitoring the
 authorized movements of the illegal drugs and/or drug paraphernalia 
from the time they were seized from the accused until the time they are 
presented in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></p><p> In these subject cases, the facts persuasively proved that the sachets of <em>shabu</em>,
 including the drug paraphernalia presented in court, were the same 
items sold/seized from appellants. The integrity and evidentiary value 
thereof were duly preserved. The marking and the handling of the 
specimens were testified to by PO1 Aguenido, SPO3 Calaor, SPO4 Gafate 
and P/Sr. Inspector Agustina Ompoy. It must be noted that appellants 
admitted the expertise of Police Senior Inspector Ompoy, the chemist who
 conducted the laboratory tests. Hence, the aforesaid prosecution 
witnesses testified about every link in the chain, from the moment the 
seized items were picked up to the time they were offered into evidence 
in court. </p><p> To reiterate, We discussed in the case of <em>Mallillin v. People</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> how the chain of custody of seized items should be established, thus:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> As a method of authenticating evidence, the chain of custody 
rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence 
sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the 
proponent claims it to be. It would include testimony about every link 
in the chain, from the moment the item was picked up to the time it is 
offered into evidence, in such a way that every person who touched the 
exhibit would describe how and from whom it was received, where it was 
and what happened to it while in the witness' possession, the condition 
in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to 
the next link in the chain. These witnesses would then describe the 
precautions taken to ensure that there had been no change in the 
condition of the item and no opportunity for someone not in the chain to
 have possession of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> However, while the procedure on the chain of custody should be 
perfect and unbroken, in reality, it is almost always impossible to 
obtain an unbroken chain.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> 
Thus, failure to strictly comply with Section 21(1), Article II of R.A. 
No. 9165 does not necessarily render an accused's arrest illegal or the 
items seized or confiscated from him inadmissible. The most important 
factor is the preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the
 seized item.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></p><p> In a number of cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
 We held that with the implied judicial recognition of the difficulty of
 complete compliance with the chain of custody requirement, substantial 
compliance is sufficient as long as the integrity and evidentiary value 
of the seized item are properly preserved by the apprehending officers. 
We ruled that the failure to photograph and conduct physical inventory 
of the seized items are not fatal to the case against the accused, and 
do not <em>ipso facto </em>render inadmissible in evidence the items 
seized. What is important is that the seized item marked at the police 
station is identified as the same item produced in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></p><p>
 Therefore, in the cases under consideration, even though there was no 
inventory of the items at the place where the buy bust was held, this 
will not render appellants' arrest illegal or the items seized from them
 inadmissible. There is substantial compliance by the police officers as
 to the required procedure on the custody and control of the confiscated
 items. The succession of events established by evidence and the overall
 handling of the seized items by the prosecution witnesses all show that
 the items seized were the same evidence subsequently identified and 
testified to in open court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p><p> Specifically, in <em>People v. Padua</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>
  We stated that the purpose of the procedure outlined in the 
implementing rules is centered on the preservation of the integrity and 
evidentiary value of the seized items. We also reiterated in <em>People v. Hernandez, et al</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>
  that non-compliance with Section 21 would not render an accused's 
arrest illegal or the items seized/confiscated from him inadmissible. 
What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and 
the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized
 in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.</p><p> 
We now go to the charge of illegal possession of drug paraphernalia. The
 elements of illegal possession of equipment, instrument, apparatus and 
other paraphernalia for dangerous drugs under Section 12, Article II of 
R.A. No. 9165 are: (1) possession or control by the accused of any 
equipment, apparatus or other paraphernalia fit or intended for smoking,
 consuming, administering, injecting, ingesting, or introducing any 
dangerous drug into the body; and (2) such possession is not authorized 
by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></p><p> In Criminal
 Case Nos. 04-59519 and 04-59521, the prosecution has convincingly 
established that appellants were in possession of drug paraphernalia, 
particularly (2) pieces of disposable lighters, plastic straw and nine 
(9) sliced aluminum foils, all of which were offered and admitted in 
evidence.</p><p> To reiterate, considering that appellants' arrest was 
legal, the search and seizure that resulted from it were likewise 
lawful. The various drug paraphernalia that the police officers found 
and seized from appellants are, therefore, admissible in evidence for 
having proceeded from a valid search and seizure. The confiscated drug 
paraphernalia are the very<em> corpus delicti</em> of the crime charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></p><p>
 However, the four (4) empty plastic sachets recovered from appellant 
Tamaño and the fifteen (15) empty plastic sachets recovered from 
appellant Gulmatico are not drug paraphernalia. They are not instruments
 or equipment which could be used to inject, administer or introduce 
into the body any dangerous drug as defined in Section 12 of Article II.
 As correctly held by the RTC, they could be merely used to pack or 
repack <span style="font-style: italic;">shabu</span> for safekeeping. Nor are scissors and the blade considered 
drug paraphernalia in view of the limited explanation made by the 
prosecution, and they do not appear to be instruments that could be 
directly used to introduce shabu into the body.</p><p> All told, We 
therefore sustain the judgment of conviction of herein appellants. Their
 mere denial cannot prevail over the positive and categorical 
identification and declarations of the police officers. The defense of 
denial, frame-up or extortion, like <em>alibi</em>, has been invariably 
viewed by the courts with disfavor for it can easily be concocted and is
 a common and standard defense ploy in most cases involving violation of
 the Dangerous Drugs Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> As evidence that is both negative and self-serving, this defense of <em>alibi</em>
 cannot attain more credibility than the testimony of the prosecution 
witness who testified clearly, providing thereby positive evidence on 
the crime committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> One 
such positive evidence, in this case, is the result of the laboratory 
examination conducted on the drugs recovered from the appellants which 
revealed that the plastic sachets tested positive for the presence of <em>"shabu</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></p><p>
 Furthermore, the defense of frame-up or denial in drug cases requires 
strong and convincing evidence because of the presumption that the law 
enforcement agencies acted in the regular performance of their official 
duties. The presumption that official duty has been regularly performed 
can only be overcome through clear and convincing evidence showing 
either of two things: (1) that they were not properly performing their 
duty, or (2) that they were inspired by any improper motive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></p><p>
 In the present cases, appellants failed to overcome such presumption. 
The bare denial of the appellants cannot prevail over the positive 
testimony of the prosecution witnesses<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  that appellants are the persons who sold <em>shabu</em>.
 As correctly stated by the RTC, the version of the appellants appeared 
to be a well-rehearsed prefabricated story, not worthy of credence. It 
is not natural that the friends of appellants would simply walk away 
while appellants were accosted for no apparent reason. If indeed 
appellants were accosted for no apparent reason, it was easy for their 
friends to intervene, as it happened in a busy place and around 
noontime. They could have even reported the incident to the barangay 
officials or to the nearest police station. It is hard to believe that 
appellant Tamaño would simply receive a plastic bag from a friend 
without knowing or verifying its contents, considering that the bag 
could be easily opened and somewhat transparent. And that it was harder 
to believe that appellant Tamaño would continue to hold on to the bag 
even if she already suspected that the contents thereof are illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></p><p>
 Settled is the rule that, unless some facts or circumstances of weight 
and influence have been overlooked or the significance of which has been
 misinterpreted, the findings and conclusion of the trial court on the 
credibility of witnesses are entitled to great respect and will not be 
disturbed because it has the advantage of hearing the witnesses and 
observing their deportment and manner of testifying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> The rule finds an even more stringent application where said findings are sustained by the CA as in these cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>
 Hence, We find no compelling reason to deviate from the CA's findings 
that, indeed, the appellants' guilt were sufficiently proven by the 
prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.</p><p> Turning now to the imposable
 penalty, We sustain the penalty imposed by the RTC and affirmed by the 
CA in Criminal Case Nos. 04-59517 to 04- 59519 and 04-59521. But, We 
modify the penalty imposed in Criminal Case No. 04-59520.</p><p> The penalty for illegal sale of <em>shabu</em>
 regardless of its quantity and purity, as provided for in Section 5, 
Article II of R.A. No. 9165, is life imprisonment to death and a fine 
ranging from P500,000.00 to P10 million. With the enactment of R.A. No. 
9346, only life imprisonment and fine shall be the imposed. Thus, the 
penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of P500,000.00 imposed on the 
appellants in Criminal Case No. 04-59517 is proper.</p><p> The penalty 
for illegal possession of dangerous drug paraphernalia, as provided for 
in Section 12, Article II of the same law, is imprisonment ranging from 
six (6) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and a fine ranging from
 Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00). 
Hence, the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) 
months and one (1) day, as minimum, to two (2) years, as maximum, and a 
fine of P10,000.00 was correctly imposed on both appellants in Criminal 
Case Nos. 04-59519and 04-59521.</p><p> For illegal possession of dangerous drugs, Section 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 provides:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> Section 11. <em>Possession of Dangerous Drugs.</em>- The penalty
 of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from Five Hundred 
Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00) to Ten Million Pesos (P10,000,000.00) shall
 be imposed upon any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall 
possess any dangerous drug in the following quantities, regardless of 
the degree of purity thereof:</p>
    <p> xxxx</p>
    <p> Otherwise, if the quantity involved is less than the foregoing quantities, the penalties shall be graduated as follows:</p>
    <p> xxxx</p>
    <p> (2) <strong>Imprisonment of twenty (20) years and one (1) day to
 life imprisonment and a fine ranging from Four Hundred Thousand Pesos 
(P400,000.00) to Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00)</strong>, if the quantities of dangerous drugs are<strong> five (5) grams or more but less than ten (10) grams</strong> of opium, morphine, heroin, cocaine or cocaine hydrochloride, marijuana resin or marijuana resin oil, <strong>methamphetamine hydrochloride or "shabu"</strong>,
 or other dangerous drugs such as, but not limited to, MDMA or 
"ecstasy", PMA, TMA, LSD, GHB, and those similarly designed or newly 
introduced drugs and their derivatives, without having any therapeutic 
value or if the quantity possessed is far beyond therapeutic 
requirements; or three hundred (300) grams or more but less than five 
hundred (500) grams of marijuana. (Emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p> (3)<strong> Imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to
 twenty (20) years and a fine ranging from Three hundred thousand pesos 
(P300,000.00) to Four hundred thousand pesos (P400,000.00)</strong>, if the quantities of dangerous drugs are<strong> less than five (5) grams</strong>
 of opium, morphine, heroin, cocaine, or cocaine hydrochloride, 
marijuana resin or marijuana resin oil, methamphetamine hydrochloride or
 "shabu," or other dangerous drugs such as, but not limited to, MDMA or 
"ecstacy," PMA, TMA, LSD, GHB, and those similarly designed or newly 
introduced drugs and their derivatives, without having any therapeutic 
value or if the quantity possessed is far beyond therapeutic 
requirements; or three hundred (300) grams or more but less than five 
hundred (500) grams of marijuana.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> From the aforecited provision, if the quantity of the dangerous 
drug is less than five (5) grams, the penalty for illegal possession of 
dangerous drugs is imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day to 
twenty (20) years and a fine ranging from P300,000.00 to P400,000.00. In
 Criminal Case No. 04-59518, appellant Tamaño was found to have been in 
illegal possession of 0.345 gram of <em>shabu</em>. She was properly 
meted the penalty of imprisonment ranging from twelve (12) years and one
 (1) day to 14 years and to pay a fine of P300,000.00.</p><p> Moreover, 
if the quantity of the dangerous drug is five (5) grams or more but less
 than ten (10) grams, the penalty for illegal possession of dangerous 
drugs is imprisonment of twenty (20) years and one (1) day to life 
imprisonment and a fine ranging from Four Hundred Thousand Pesos 
(P400,000.00) to Five Hundred Thousand Pesos (P500,000.00). In Criminal 
Case No. 04-59520, appellant Gulmatico was found to have been in illegal
 possession of twenty-four (24) sachets of <em>shabu</em> with a total weight of 8.695 grams and two (2) small sachets of<em> shabu</em>
 weighing 0.192 gram, all with the aggregate weight of 8.887 grams. He 
was correctly sentenced to imprisonment ranging from twenty (20) years 
and one (1) day to life imprisonment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> But the imposed fine of P300,000.00 is not in accord with law. Therefore, for the illegal possession of <em>shabu</em> in the amount of 8.887 grams, the fine that must be imposed is Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (P400,000.00).</p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the appeal is<strong> DISMISSED</strong> and the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated August 31, 2012 in CA-G.R. CEB-CR-H.C. No. 00762 is <strong>AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION</strong> on the fine imposed in Criminal Case No. 04-59520.
