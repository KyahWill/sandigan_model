				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> involves a dispute as to the validity of the closure of respondent Tritran, Inc. (Tritran) and the legality of the ensuing dismissal of petitioners, who were its former employees. Petitioners seek the reversal of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 97788. The CA affirmed the Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), which set aside the earlier Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of the labor arbiter (LA) in favor of petitioners. The LA had ruled that petitioners had been illegally dismissed by Tritran and were consequently entitled to separation benefits. <p align="center"><strong> FACTUAL ANTECEDENTS </strong> </p><p> Petitioners Danilo Reyes, Rodrigo S.

Despite its financial condition, however, Tritran undertook to pay separation benefits to its employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p><p> A few months earlier, Tritran had informed the DOLE Regional Office of its decision to temporarily close the establishment and cease operations effective 15 January 2004.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The decision was made after the company had laid off a total of 114 employees in 2003<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> pursuant to a retrenchment program implemented to cut down costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> It cited financial reverses as the reason for both the temporary closure and the retrenchment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> </p><p> In March and April 2004, petitioners filed complaints<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> before the NLRC against Tritran; its president, Jose C. Alvarez, and its vice president for finance and administration, Jehu C. Sebastian. </p><p> In their Position Paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> petitioners alleged that they were illegally terminated from employment as a result of the invalid closure of the company and were thus entitled to reinstatement. They claimed that Tritran never ceased its business as shown by the continued operation of its buses on the same routes under the management of JAM Transit, Inc.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> a company also owned by Alvarez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> It was also alleged that the employees of the company were asked to sign voluntary resignation letters if they wanted to avail themselves of employment under the new management.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> To petitioners, these circumstances proved that the closure was a mere ploy for the company to circumvent their security of tenure and avoid its obligation to pay them separation benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> In their Position Paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> respondents denied these allegations and asserted that the closure was justified under Article 283 of the Labor Code. They cited the serious and irreversible losses sustained by the company from 2000 to 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> In support of this allegation, they submitted the Audited Financial Statements (AFS) of Tritran for the years ending 31 December 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> and 31 December 2002<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which were prepared by its external auditors, Sicangco Menor Villanueva &amp; Co. These documents showed that the company had incurred the following losses: P30,023,774.45 in 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> P37,621,961.71 in 2001<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and P34,620,587.61 in 2002.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Respondents also emphasized their compliance with the requirements of the Labor Code. For their part, Alvarez and Sebastian insisted that they could not be held personally liable, since the closure of Tritran was based on the "collective business judgment" of the officers of the company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> </p><p> In their Reply-Position Paper,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> petitioners emphasized that the figures contained in the AFS were ridiculous and illogical. In particular, they questioned the fact that Tritran, a bus company, spent around P10 million for security services, but paid only about P1.5 million for the salaries and wages of its drivers and conductors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> They also pointed out that there was no evidence of the alleged sale of assets to JAM Transit; hence, the continued operation of the buses of Tritran, even under this new management, contradicted the alleged reason for the closure of former's business. </p><p> Respondents refuted the foregoing allegations in their Reply to Complainants' Position Paper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> They maintained that (a) Tritran suffered serious business losses as shown by the AFS; and (b) JAM Transit purchased the vehicles and other assets of Tritran after the closure. </p><p align="center"> <strong>THE RULING OF THE LA</strong> </p><p>In a Decision dated 15 August 2005,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> LA Numeriano D. Villena ruled in favor of petitioners and awarded them full back wages, separation pay, and attorney's fees. He observed that the AFS submitted by respondents to substantiate their supposed losses contained "highly suspicious" expenditures for security.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> He thus gave little weight to these documents and concluded that the closure was meant to circumvent the law on termination of employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p><p align="center"><strong> THE RULING OF THE NLRC </strong> </p><p> On appeal,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> the NLRC initially affirmed the foregoing ruling. In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> dated 28 April 2006, it agreed with the observations of the LA with respect to the doubtful expenses included in Tritran's AFS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> On this basis, it concluded that serious business losses were not sufficiently proven; therefore, the closure was not undertaken in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> </p><p> Respondents sought reconsideration of the NLRC Decision on 30 May 2006.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> They insisted that the expenses incurred by Tritran, particularly for security services, were legitimate and justified by the need to maintain the safety of the terminals and premises of the bus company. They also argued that there was sufficient evidence of serious business losses, i.e., financial statements audited by independent external auditors,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> loan agreements<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and a schedule of rollables.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </p><p> In a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> dated 18 August 2006, the NLRC granted the Motion for Reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Reversing its earlier ruling, it declared that the closure of Tritran was justified, given the serious business losses suffered by the company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> This time, the NLRC gave weight to the AFS as well other supporting documents submitted by respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> It also referred to its Decision in <em>Antonio de Chavez, et al. v. Tritran, Inc., et al.</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> in which it upheld the validity of the dismissal of certain employees of Tritran on the basis of the closure of the company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Citing the principle of<em> stare decisis</em>, the NLRC declared that <em>De Chavez </em>must be followed in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> </p><p align="center"><strong> THE RULING OF THE CA </strong> </p><p> On 5 February 2007, petitioners elevated the case to the CA via a Petition for Certiorari.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Apart from reiterating their arguments on the incredulous figures contained in Tritran's AFS,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> they challenged the application of <em>De Chavez </em>to this case. They pointed out that (a) because <em>De Chavez </em>was issued two months after the NLRC had promulgated the original Decision in this case, the ruling cannot be used as binding precedent;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> and (b)<em> stare decisis</em> only applies to final decisions of the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Petitioners also emphasized that there was no justification for the reversal of the earlier Decision, as no new evidence or argument had been submitted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> They particularly questioned the sudden turnaround of the NLRC on the issue of the credibility of the AFS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> In a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> dated 18 October 2007, the CA dismissed the Petition for Certiorari. It declared that the NLRC did not commit grave abuse of discretion when the latter reversed its earlier Decision: </p><blockquote> <p> In rectifying its previous assessment of petitioners' termination of employment and Tritran's closure or cessation of business. respondent NLRC did not commit any abuse of discretion, much less grave. The reasons are as follows: </p> <p> Petitioners reiterate their argument that no evidentiary weight should be given to the Audited Financial Statements and supporting documents such as the Balance Sheet, Statement of Income and Expenses and Statements of Cash Flow presented by private respondents in substantiation of their contention of continuing irreversible financial losses necessitating the closure of the respondent company. However, petitioners' disagreement with respondent NLRC on the weight it gave to certain evidence is no basis to strike down the assailed decision as capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. If respondent NLRC gave more weight to Tritran's evidence, it was simply because such evidence clearly demonstrated the facts it intended to establish. </p> <p> xxxx </p> <p> The respondent NLRC's decision in the Antonio De Chavez case was based on the same facts and issues present in this case. It is thus logically expected that, after such error had been discovered and rectified, respondent NLRC would abandon its former stance and proceed to resolve the issues raised in the case below to the end that the latter may be finally disposed of its merits, and to avoid possible conflicting decisions. Such abandonment is demanded by public interest and the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> With respect to the issues raised by petitioners concerning Tritran's supposed losses, the CA refused to interfere with the NLRC's assessment of the evidence presented by the parties. The appellate court noted, however, that the suspicions brought up by petitioners were "based on tenuous, if nonexistent evidentiary support."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> In contrast, respondents were deemed to have proven the losses incurred by Tritran, as well as the validity of the dismissal of the company's employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Hence, the appellate court found no reason to doubt the conclusions of the NLRC. </p><p> Petitioners sought reconsideration of the Decision. However, their motion <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> was denied by the CA in a Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> dated 6 October 2008. </p><p align="center"><strong> PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THIS COURT </strong> </p><p> Petitioners again challenge the credibility of the evidence presented to prove Tritran 's supposed losses<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> and the applicability of the doctrine of<em> stare decisis</em> to this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> They insist that the "sudden reversal of the NLRC's previous Decision dated 28 April 2006 was done in such a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary and anomalous manner that it so brazenly misapplied and violated the basic principle of<em> stare decisis</em>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> and thereby warrants a review. </p><p> In their Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> respondents maintain the propriety of the CA's dismissal of the Petition for Certiorari. They assert that there was no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC, since the reversal of the latter's earlier ruling was supported by law and evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> They also reiterate their arguments on the company's serious business losses, which supposedly rendered the closure of Tritran legitimate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> </p><p align="center"><strong> ISSUES </strong> </p><p> The fo1lowing issues are presented for resolution: </p><p> 1. Whether the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>was correctly applied by the NLRC </p><p> 2. Whether the closure of Tritran was justified </p><p> 3. Whether petitioners were validly dismissed from employment </p><p align="center"><strong> OUR RULING </strong> </p><p> The Petition is <strong>DENIED</strong>. </p><p> The Court believes that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> was erroneously applied by the NLRC to this case, and that the CA should have rectified this error. However, we agree with the conclusion of the CA that the NLRC did not act with grave abuse of discretion when the latter reversed its earlier Decision. As will be further discussed, the closure of Tritran was justified considering the serious business losses sustained by the company from 2000 to 2002. Given its legitimate closure, petitioners were validly terminated from employment. </p><p> The Court, however, deems it proper to modify the CA Decision and Resolution to take into account Tritran 's voluntary undertaking to pay separation benefits to its terminated employees. </p><p><em><strong> The doctrine of stare decisis was <br> erroneously applied by the NLRC to<br> justify the reversal of its earlier Decision. </strong></em> </p><p> The doctrine of <em>stare decisis et non quieta movere</em> requires courts "to adhere to precedents, and not unsettle things which are established."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> Following this directive, when a court has laid down a principle of law applicable to a certain state of facts, it must apply the same principle to all future cases in which the facts sued upon are substantially the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> </p><p> In this case, the NLRC referred to the principle of<em> stare decisis</em> in its Resolution dated 18 August 2006 as one of the reasons for the reversal of its original Decision affirming the LA ruling. As earlier discussed, it cited the Decision in <em>De Chavez v. Tritran, Inc., </em>in support of its finding that Tritran 's closure was due to serious business losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> </p><p> The Court rejects the foregoing reasoning. We find that the <em>stare decisis</em> principle was erroneously applied to this case. </p><p> It must be emphasized that only final decisions of this Court are deemed precedents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> that form part of our legal system.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> Decisions of lower courts or other divisions of the same court are not binding on others.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> Consequently, it was incorrect for the NLRC to consider <em>De Chavez</em> - a ruling rendered by the same NLRC division - as a binding precedent applicable to the present case. </p><p> We stress, however, that the erroneous application of the <em>stare decisis</em> principle to this case does not automatically lead to the conclusion that the NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion when it reversed its original Decision. </p><p> The Court notes that the NLRC set aside its own ruling only after taking a second hard look at the records; in particular, at the documentary evidence submitted by respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> Clearly, <em>De Chavez</em> was not the only basis of the NLRC for reversing its original ruling. Consequently, we agree with the CA's observation that the reversal was made pursuant to the inherent power of the NLRC to amend and control its processes and orders, so as to make them conformable to law and justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> </p><p> Like any other tribunal, the NLRC has the right to reverse itself, "especially when in its honest opinion it has committed an error or mistake in judgment, and that to adhere to its decision will cause injustice to a party litigant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> In this case, we find that there was sufficient ground for the NLRC to reverse its original ruling. </p><p><em><strong> The closure of Tritran was justified by the<br> serious business losses it incurred. </strong></em> </p><p> It is settled that employers can lawfully close their establishments at any time and for any reason.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> The law considers the decision to close and cease business operations as a management prerogative that courts cannot interfere with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> Our review of this case is therefore limited to a determination of whether the closure was made in good faith to advance the employer's interest, and not for the purpose of circumventing the rights of the employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup> </p><p> In this case, the Court agrees with the conclusion of the CA and the NLRC that the closure of Tritran was legitimate, having been brought about by serious business losses as shown in the company's AFS. </p><p> We have consistently ruled that a company's economic status may be established through the submission of financial statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> If prepared by independent external auditors, these statements are particularly entitled to weight and credence. In <em>Manatad v. Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Corp</em>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> this Court explained: </p><blockquote> <p> That the financial statements are audited by independent auditors safeguards the same from the manipulation of the figures therein to suit the company's needs. The auditing of financial reports by independent external auditors are strictly governed by national and international standards and regulations for the accounting profession. It bears to stress that the financial statements submitted by respondent were audited by reputable auditing firms. Hence, petitioner's assertion that respondent merely manipulated its financial statements to make it appear that it was suffering from business losses that would justify the retrenchment is incredible and baseless. </p> <p> In addition, the fact that the financial statements were audited by independent auditors settles any doubt on the authenticity of these documents for lack of signature of the person who prepared it. As reported by SGV &amp; Co., the financial statements presented fairly, in all material aspects, the financial position of the respondent as of 30 June 1998 and 1997, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended, in conformity with the generally accepted accounting principles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> </p> </blockquote> <p> Here, the AFS submitted by respondents were sufficient proofs of the serious business losses incurred by Tritran. These financial statements were prepared by Sicangco Menor Villanueva &amp; Co., an independent external auditor, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup> The AFS were also attested to as fair presentations of the financial position of the company for the specified periods.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> </p><p> The Court is aware of the objections of petitioners to the AFS on the ground that irregular and suspiciously bloated expenses and cash advances were included therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup> We also note their argument that respondents failed to present receipts, vouchers, contracts, or other documents to substantiate the figures in the financial statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup> </p><p> After judicious consideration, the Court finds that petitioners' arguments cannot prevail over the AFS or the attestations of the independent external auditor as to the fairness and accuracy of the figures contained therein. Bare allegations of "suspicious figures" cannot destroy the credibility of the documents, especially considering the strict national and international standards governing the accounting and auditing profession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup> </p><p> With respect to the alleged failure of respondents to submit other evidence to support their claimed expenses, the Court agrees with the CA that they do not have this burden. Since petitioners are the ones claiming that the expenditures are dubious and false, it is their duty to prove their assertion. Only after the amounts spent on security services are shown to be bloated would the burden of evidence shift to respondents. Absent any evidence that the expenses are actually irregular, there is no basis for questioning the amounts stated in the AFS. </p><p> In the same manner, the allegation of petitioners that Tritran's buses continued to ply the same routes remained unsubstantiated. We note that the LA,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup> the NLRC,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> and the CA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup> all confirmed the fact of the closure and cessation of operations. None of them gave credence to petitioners' assertion that Tritran continued to operate its buses, albeit under the management of JAM Transit. The Court finds no reason to reverse these conclusions. </p><p> Based on the foregoing, we affirm the ruling of the CA on this point. We find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in according evidentiary weight to the AFS and concluding that Tritran suffered serious business losses that led to its closure. </p><p><em><strong>Petitioners were validly terminated from<br> employment. </strong> </em> </p><p> Proceeding from the conclusion that the closure of Tritran was carried out for legitimate reasons, this Court affirms the validity of the dismissal of petitioners from employment. Article 283<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> of the Labor Code expressly sanctions termination of employment due to closure of establishment, subject to certain notice requirements. If the closure is not due to serious business losses or financial reverses, the company is likewise required to grant separation benefits to dismissed employees. </p><p> Here, Tritran's compliance with the notice requirement under the Labor Code has been sufficiently proven. The company sent a written notice to its workers at least one month prior to the effective date of its closure. It also informed the DOLE Regional Office of the intended cessation of operations within the deadline.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> </p><p> Since the closure of Tritran was due to serious business losses, petitioners would ordinarily not be entitled to separation benefits under Article 283. However, the Court notes that the company voluntarily obligated itself to pay severance benefits to the employees, notwithstanding its financial condition. In its letter to the DOLE Regional Office and the written notices it sent to its workers, Tritran expressly promised to pay separation benefits to the employees, less their actual accountabilities with the company. In fact, it repeatedly alleged that it had paid its other employees these benefits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup> and offered the same remuneration to petitioners,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> as shown by photocopies of the check vouchers<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> prepared in the latter's name. </p><p> We likewise note that the undertaking to pay severance benefits was made to all affected workers and relayed to the DOLE Regional Office even prior to the filing of this case. Consequently, this promise must be considered a binding commitment, and not a mere settlement offer. </p><p> Having voluntarily assumed the obligation to pay separation benefits to its terminated employees,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup> Tritran must now fulfill its obligation. The CA Decision must therefore be modified in this respect. </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Petition for Review is <strong>DENIED</strong>. The CA Decision dated 18 October 2007 and Resolution dated 6 October 2008 are <strong>AFFIRMED</strong> with <strong>MODIFICATION</strong>. Respondent Tritran, Inc. is hereby ordered to pay petitioners their corresponding separation benefits less their accountabilities to the company. </p><p> <b>SO ORDERED. </b> </p><p><em>Leonardo-De Castro, Bersamin,</em> and <em>Caguioa, JJ</em>., concur. <br> <em>Perlas-Bernabe, J</em>., on official leave. <br><br></p><p> </p><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> ''Elarpis" in some parts of the record.<p> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Petition for Review dated 27 October 2008, <em>rollo</em>, pp. 3-60.</p><p> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Decision dated 18 October 2007 penned by Associate Justice Bienvenido L.
