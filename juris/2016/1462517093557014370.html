Retrenchment is the employer's cutting down of personnel to reduce the costs of business operations and avert business losses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[184]</sup> As a rule, this court will respect management prerogative to retrench where there is "faithful compliance . . . with the substantive and procedural requirements laid down by law and jurisprudence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[185]</sup><br><br>There are several guidelines that PAL should observe to validly dismiss Dawal, et al. due to retrenchment. Among others, the following are the four (4) criteria that the employer must meet:<br><blockquote><i>Firstly</i>, the losses expected should be substantial and not merely <i>de minimis</i> in extent. If the loss purportedly sought to be forestalled by retrenchment is clearly shown to be insubstantial and inconsequential in character, the <i>bonafide</i> nature of the retrenchment would appear to be seriously in question. <i>Secondly</i>, the substantial loss apprehended must be reasonably imminent, as such imminence can be perceived objectively and in good faith by the employer. There should, in other words, be a certain degree of urgency for the retrenchment, which is after all a drastic recourse with serious consequences for the livelihood of the employees retired or otherwise laid-off. Because of the consequential nature of retrenchment, it must, <i>thirdly</i>, be reasonably necessary and likely to effectively prevent the expected losses. The employer should have taken other measures prior or parallel to retrenchment to forestall losses, i.e., cut other costs other than labor costs. An employer who, for instance, lays off substantial numbers of workers while continuing to dispense fat executive bonuses and perquisites or so-called "golden parachutes," [severance packages] can scarcely claim to be retrenching in good faith to avoid losses. To impart operational meaning to the constitutional policy of providing "full protection" to labor, the employer's prerogative to bring down labor costs by retrenching must be exercised essentially as a measure of last resort, after less drastic means — <i>e.g.</i>, reduction of both management and rank-and-file bonuses and salaries, going on reduced time, improving manufacturing efficiencies, trimming of marketing and advertising costs, <i>etc.</i> — have been tried and found wanting.<br><br><i>Lastly</i>, but certainly not the least important, alleged losses if already realized, and the expected imminent losses sought to be forestalled, must be proved by sufficient and convincing evidence.
