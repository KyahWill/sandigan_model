Petitioner prayed in his Supplemental Position Paper that respondents be held guilty of unfair labor practices and ordered to indemnify him moral damages in the amount of P100,000.00, exemplary damages amounting to P50,000.00, and 10% attorney's fees.<br><br>In their joint Position Paper and other pleadings,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> respondents claimed that the Labor Arbiter had no jurisdiction over the dispute, which is intra-union in nature; that the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR) was the proper venue, in accordance with Article 226 of the Labor Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and Section 1, Rule XI of Department Order 40-03, series of 2003, of the DOLE;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and that they were not guilty of unfair labor practices, discrimination, coercion or restraint.<br><br>On May 29, 2009, Labor Arbiter Virginia T.

The same shall be approved/disapproved by a majority vote of the general membership assembly in a meeting duly called for the purpose.<br></blockquote>On the basis of the foregoing, the parties shall exhaust first all the administrative remedies before resorting to compulsory arbitration.

Further, complainant avers that he was denied the right to appeal his suspension and expulsion in accordance with the provisions of the Union's Constitution and By-Laws. In addition, complainant claims that respondents attempted to cause the management to discriminate against the members of WATER-AFWC thru the proposed CBA.<br><br>Pertinent to the issue then on hand, the Labor Arbiter ordered that the case be referred back to the Union level for the General Assembly to act on complainant's appeal. Hence, these appeals.<br><br>After a careful look at all the documents submitted and a meticulous review of the facts, We find that this Commission lacks the jurisdictional competence to act on this case.<br><br>Article 217 of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> as amended, specifically enumerates the cases over which the Labor Arbiters and the Commission have original and exclusive jurisdiction.

SP No. 115639, petitioner sought to reverse the NLRC Decision and be awarded his claim for damages and attorney's fees on account of respondents' unfair labor practices, arguing among others that his charge of unfair labor practices is cognizable by the Labor Arbiter; that the fact that the dispute is inter- or intra-union in nature cannot erase the fact that respondents were guilty of unfair labor practices in interfering and restraining him in the exercise of his right to self-organization as member of both MWEU and WATER-AFWC, and in discriminating against him and other members through the provisions of the proposed 2008 CBA which they drafted; that his failure to pay the increased union dues was proper since the approval of said increase was arrived at without observing the prescribed voting procedure laid down in the Labor Code; that he is entitled to an award of damages and attorney's fees as a result of respondents' illegal acts in discriminating against him; and that in ruling the way it did, the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>On April 24, 2012, the CA issued the assailed Decision containing the following pronouncement:<br><blockquote>The petition lacks merit.<br><br>Petitioner's causes of action against MWEU are inter/intra-union disputes cognizable by the BLR whose functions and jurisdiction are largely confined to union matters, collective bargaining registry, and labor education. Section 1, Rule XI of Department Order (D.O.) No. 40-03, Series of 2003, of the Department of Labor and Employment enumerates instances of inter/intra-union disputes, <i>viz</i>:<br><blockquote>Section 1.

"Intra-Union Dispute" refers to any conflict between and among union members, including grievances arising from any violation of the rights and conditions of membership, violation of or disagreement over any provision of the union's constitution and by-laws, or disputes arising from chartering or affiliation of union. On the other hand, the circumstances of unfair labor practices (ULP) of a labor organization are stated in Article 249 of the Labor Code, to wit:<br><blockquote>Article 249. Unfair labor practices of labor organizations. It shall be unlawful for labor organization, its officers, agents, or representatives to commit any of the following unfair labor practices:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%"><div align="justify">(a) </div></td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">To restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization; Provided, That the labor organization shall have the right to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership;</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify"></div></td><td><div align="justify"></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td><div align="justify">(b) </div></td><td><div align="justify">To cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee, including discrimination against an employee with respect to whom membership in such organization has been denied or terminated on any ground other than the usual terms and conditions under which membership or continuation of membership is made available to other members;<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br><center>x x x x<br></center></blockquote>Applying the aforementioned rules, We find that the issues arising from petitioner's right to information on the increased membership dues, right to appeal his suspension and expulsion according to CBL provisions, and right to vote and be voted on are essentially intra-union disputes; these involve violations of rights ;and conditions of union membership. But his claim that a director of MWEU warned that non-MWEU members would not receive CBA benefits is an inter-union dispute. It is more of an "interference" by a rival union to ensure the loyalty of its members and to persuade non-members to join their union. This is not an actionable wrong because interfering in the exercise of the right to organize is itself a function of self-organizing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> As long as it does not amount to restraint or coercion, a labor organization may interfere in the employees' right to self-organization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Consequently, a determination of validity or illegality of the alleged acts necessarily touches on union matters, not ULPs, and are outside the scope of the labor arbiter's jurisdiction.<br><br>As regards petitioner's other accusations, <i>i.e.</i>, discrimination in terms of meting out the penalty of expulsion against him alone, and attempt to cause the employer, MWC, to discriminate against non-MWEU members in terms of retrenchment or reduction of personnel, and signing bonus, while We may consider them as falling within the concept of ULP under Article 249(a) and (b), still, petitioner's complaint cannot prosper for lack of substantial evidence. Other than his bare allegation, petitioner offered no proof that MWEU did not penalize some union members who failed to pay the increased dues. On the proposed discriminatory CBA provisions, petitioner merely attached the pages containing the questioned provisions without bothering to reveal the MWEU representatives responsible for the said proposal. Article 249 mandates that "x x x only the officers, members of the governing boards, representatives or agents or members of labor associations or organizations <i>who have actually participated in, authorized or ratified unfair labor practices shall be held criminally liable</i>." Plain accusations against all MWEU officers, without specifying their actual participation, do not suffice. Thus, the ULP charges must necessarily fail.<br><br>In administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings, only substantial evidence is necessary to establish the case for or against a party. Substantial evidence is that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. Petitioner failed to discharge the burden of proving, by substantial evidence, the allegations of ULP in his complaint. The NLRC, therefore, properly dismissed the case.<br><br>FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is DISMISSED. <br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br></blockquote>Thus, the instant Petition.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>In an August 28, 2013 Resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> this Court resolved to give due course to the Petition, which claims that the CA erred:<br><blockquote><ol type="A"><li>IN DECLARING THAT THE PRESENCE OF INTER/INTRA-UNION CONFLICTS NEGATES THE COMPLAINT FOR UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES AGAINST A LABOR ORGANIZATION AND ITS OFFICERS, AND IN AFFIRMING THAT THE NLRC PROPERLY DISMISSED THE CASE FOR ALLEGED LACK OF JURISDICTION.<br><br></li><li>IN NOT RULING THAT RESPONDENTS ARE GUILTY OF UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES UNDER ARTICLE 249(a) AND (b) OF THE LABOR CODE.<br><br></li><li>IN DECLARING THAT THE THREATS MADE BY A UNION OFFICER AGAINST MEMBERS OF A RIVAL UNION IS (sic) MERELY AN "INTERFERENCE" AND DO NOT AMOUNT TO "RESTRAINT' OR "COERCION".<br><br></li><li>IN DECLARING THAT PETITIONER FAILED TO PRESENT SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IN PROVING RESPONDENTS' SPECIFIC ACTS OF UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES.<br><br></li><li>IN NOT RULING THAT RESPONDENTS ARE SOLIDARILY LIABLE TO PETITIONER FOR MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, AND ATTORNEY'S FEES.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><b><i>Petitioner's Arguments</i></b><br><br>Praying that the assailed CA dispositions be set aside and that respondents be declared guilty of unfair labor practices under Article 249(a) and (b) and adjudged liable for damages and attorney's fees as prayed for in bis complaint, petitioner maintains in his Petition and Reply<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> that respondents are guilty of unfair labor practices which he clearly enumerated and laid out in his pleadings below; that these unfair labor practices committed by respondents fall within the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter; that the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC, and the CA failed to rule on his accusation of unfair labor practices and simply dismissed his complaint on the ground that his causes of action are intra- or inter-union in nature; that admittedly, some of his causes of action involved intra- or inter-union disputes, but other acts of respondents constitute unfair labor practices; that he presented substantial evidence to prove that respondents are guilty of unfair labor practices by failing to observe the proper procedure in the imposition of the increased monthly union dues, and in unduly imposing the penalties of suspension and expulsion against him; that under the union's constitution and by-laws, he is given the right to appeal his suspension and expulsion to the general membership assembly; that in denying him his rights as a union member and expelling him, respondents are guilty of malice and evident bad faith; that respondents are equally guilty for violating and curtailing his rights to vote and be voted to a position within the union, and for discriminating against non-MWEU members; and that the totality of respondents' conduct shows that they are guilty of unfair labor practices.<br><br><b><i>Respondent's Arguments</i></b><br><br>In their joint Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> respondents maintain that petitioner raises issues of fact which are beyond the purview of a petition for review on certiorari; that the findings of fact of the CA are final and conclusive; that the Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and CA are one in declaring that there is no unfair labor practices committed against petitioner; that petitioner's other allegations fall within the jurisdiction of the BLR, as they refer to intra- or inter-union disputes between the parties; that the issues arising from petitioner's right to information on the increased dues, right to appeal his suspension and expulsion, and right to vote and be voted upon are essentially intra-union in nature; that his allegations regarding supposed coercion and restraint relative to benefits in the proposed CBA do not constitute an actionable wrong; that all of the acts questioned by petitioner are covered by Section 1, Rule XI of Department Order 40-03, series of 2003 as intra-/inter-union disputes which do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter; that in not paying his union dues, petitioner is guilty of insubordination and deserved the penalty of expulsion; that petitioner failed to petition to convene the general assembly through the required signature of 30% of the union membership in good standing pursuant to Article VI, Section 2(a) of MWEU's Constitution and By-Laws or by a petition of the majority of the general membership in good standing under Article VI, Section 3; and that for his failure to resort to said remedies, petitioner can no longer question his suspension or expulsion and avail of his right to appeal.<br><br><center><b>Our Ruling</b><br></center><br>The Court partly grants the Petition.<br><br>In labor cases, issues of fact are for the labor tribunals and the CA to resolve, as this Court is not a trier of facts. However, when the conclusion arrived at by them is erroneous in certain respects, and would result in injustice as to the parties, this Court must intervene to correct the error. While the Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and CA are one in their conclusion in this case, they erred in failing to resolve petitioner's charge of unfair labor practices against respondents.<br><br>It is true that some of petitioner's causes of action constitute intra-union cases cognizable by the BLR under Article 226 of the Labor Code.<br><blockquote>An intra-union dispute refers to any conflict between and among union members, including grievances arising from any violation of the rights and conditions of membership, violation of or disagreement over any provision of the union's constitution and by-laws, or disputes arising from chartering or disaffiliation of the union.

In addition, Article 247 of the same Code provides that "the civil aspects of all cases involving unfair labor practices, which may include claims for actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages, attorney's fees and other affirmative relief, shall be under the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiters."<br><br>Unfair labor practices may be committed both by the employer under Article 248 and by labor organizations under Article 249 of the Labor Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> which provides as follows:<br><blockquote>ART. 249.

Specifically, petitioner claims that he was suspended and expelled from MWEU illegally as a result of the denial of his right to appeal his case to the general membership assembly in accordance with the union's constitution and by­laws. On the other hand, respondents counter that such charge is intra-union in nature, and that petitioner lost his right to appeal when he failed to petition to convene the general assembly through the required signature of 30% of the union membership in good standing pursuant to Article VI, Section 2(a) of MWEU's Constitution and By-Laws or by a petition of the majority of the general membership in good standing under Article VI, Section 3.<br><br>Under Article VI, Section 2(a) of MWEU's Constitution and By-Laws, the general membership assembly has the power to "review revise modify affirm repeal [sic] resolution and decision of the Executive Board and/or committees upon petition of thirty percent (30%) of the Union in good standing,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> and under Section 2(d), to "revise, modify, affirm or reverse all expulsion cases."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> Under Section 3 of the same Article, "[t]he decision of the Executive Board may be appealed to the General Membership which by a simple majority vote reverse the decision of said body. If the general Assembly is not in session the decision of the Executive Board may be reversed by a petition of the majority of the general membership in good standing."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> And, in Article X, Section 5, "[a]ny dismissed and/or expelled member shall have the right to appeal to the Executive Board within seven days from notice of said dismissal and/or expulsion which, in [turn] shall be referred to the General membership assembly. In case of an appeal, a simple majority of the decision of the Executive Board is imperative. The same shall be approved/disapproved by a majority vote of the general membership assembly in a meeting duly called for the purpose."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>In regard to suspension of a union member, MWEU's Constitution and By-Laws provides under Article X, Section 4 thereof that "[a]ny suspended member shall have the right to appeal within three (3) working days from the date of notice of said suspension. In case of an appeal a simple majority of vote of the Executive Board shall be necessary to nullify the suspension."<br><br>Thus, when an MWEU member is suspended, he is given the right to appeal such suspension within three working days from the date of notice of said suspension, which appeal the MWEU Executive Board is obligated to act upon by a simple majority vote. When the penalty imposed is expulsion, the expelled member is given seven days from notice of said dismissal and/or expulsion to appeal to the Executive Board, which is required to act by a simple majority vote of its members. The Board's decision shall then be approved/disapproved by a majority vote of the general membership assembly in a meeting duly called for the purpose.<br><br>The documentary evidence is clear that when petitioner received Borela's August 21, 2007 letter informing him of the Executive Board's unanimous approval of the grievance committee recommendation to suspend him for the second time effective August 24, 2007, he immediately and timely filed a written appeal. However, the Executive Board - then consisting of respondents Borela, Tierra, Bolo, Casañas, Fernandez, Rendon, Montemayor, Torres, Quebral, Pagulayan, Cancino, Maga, Cometa, Mancenido, and two others who are not respondents herein - did not act thereon. Then again, when petitioner was charged for the third time and meted the penalty of expulsion from MWEU by the unanimous vote of the Executive Board, his timely appeal was again not acted upon by said board - this time consisting of respondents Borela, Quebral, Tierra, Imana, Rendon, Yeban, Cancino, Torres, Montemayor, Mancenido, Mandilag, Fernandez, Buenaventura, Apilado, Maga, Barbero, Cometa, Bolo, and Manlapaz.<br><br>Thus, contrary to respondents' argument that petitioner lost his right to appeal when he failed to petition to convene the general assembly through the required signature of 30% of the union membership in good standing pursuant to Article VI, Section 2(a) of MWEU's Constitution and By-Laws or by a petition of the majority of the general membership in good standing under Article VI, Section 3, this Court finds that petitioner was illegally suspended for the second time and thereafter unlawfully expelled from MWEU due to respondents' failure to act on his written appeals. The required petition to convene the general assembly through the required signature of 30% (under Article VI, Section 2[a]) or majority (under Article VI, Section 3) of the union membership does not apply in petitioner's case; the Executive Board must first act on his two appeals before the matter could properly be referred to the general membership. Because respondents did not act on his two appeals, petitioner was unceremoniously suspended, disqualified and deprived of his right to run for the position of MWEU Vice-President in the September 14, 2007 election of officers, expelled from MWEU, and forced to join another union, WATER-AFWC. For these, respondents are guilty of unfair labor practices under Article 249 (a) and (b) - that is, violation of petitioner's right to self-organization, unlawful discrimination, and illegal termination of his union membership - which case falls within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiters, in accordance with Article 217 of the Labor Code.<br><br>The primary concept of unfair labor practices is stated in Article 247 of the Labor Code, which states:<br><blockquote>Article 247. Concept of unfair labor practice and procedure for prosecution thereof. — Unfair labor practices violate the constitutional right of workers and employees to self-organization, are inimical to the legitimate interests of both labor and management, including their right to bargain collectively and otherwise deal with each other in an atmosphere of freedom and mutual respect, disrupt industrial peace and hinder the promotion of healthy and stable labor-management relations.<br></blockquote>"In essence, [unfair labor practice] relates to the commission' of acts that transgress the workers' right to organize."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> "[A]ll the prohibited acts constituting unfair labor practice in essence relate to the workers' right to self-organization."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> "[T]he term unfair labor practice refers to that gamut of offenses defined in the Labor Code which, at their core, violates the constitutional right of workers and employees to self-organization."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><blockquote>Guaranteed to all employees or workers is the 'right to self-organization and to form, join, or assist labor organizations of their own choosing for purposes of collective bargaining.' This is made plain by no less than three provisions of the Labor Code of the Philippines. Article 243 of the Code provides as follows:<br><blockquote>ART. 243. Coverage and employees' right to self-organization. — All persons employed in commercial, industrial and agricultural enterprises and in religious, charitable, medical, or educational institutions whether operating for profit or not, shall have the right to serf-organization and to form, join, or assist labor organizations of their own choosing for purposes or collective bargaining. Ambulant, intermittent and itinerant workers, self-employed people, rural workers and those without any definite employers may form labor organizations for their , mutual aid and protection.<br></blockquote>Article 248 (a) declares it to be an unfair labor practice for an employer, among others, to 'interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization.' Similarly, Article 249 (a) makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to 'restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights to self-organization...'<br><br>x x x x<br><br>The right of self-organization-includes the right to organize or affiliate with a labor union or determine which of two or more unions in an establishment to join, and to engage in concerted activities with co-workers for purposes of collective bargaining through representatives of their own choosing, or for their mutual aid and protection, <i>i.e.</i>, the protection, promotion, or enhancement of their rights and interests.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br></blockquote>As members of the governing board of MWEU, respondents are presumed to know, observe, and apply the union's constitution and by-laws. Thus, their repeated violations, thereof and their disregard of petitioner's rights as a union member - their inaction on his two appeals which resulted in his suspension, disqualification from running as MWEU officer, and subsequent expulsion without being accorded the foil benefits of due process - connote willfulness and bad faith, a gross disregard of his rights thus causing untold suffering, oppression and, ultimately., ostracism from MWEU. "Bad faith implies breach of faith and willful failure to respond to plain and well understood obligation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> This warrants an award of moral damages in the amount of P100,000.00. Moreover, the Civil Code provides:<br><blockquote>Art. 32. Any public officer or employee, or any private individual, who directly or indirectly obstructs, defeats, violates or in any manner impedes or impairs any of the following rights and liberties of another person shall be liable to the latter for damages:<br><br>x x x x<br><br>(12) The right to become a member of associations or societies for purposes not contrary to law;<br></blockquote>In <i>Vital-Gozon v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> this Court declared, as follows:<br><blockquote>Moral damages include physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and similar injury. They may be recovered if they are the proximate result of the defendant's wrongful act or omission. The instances when moral damages may be recovered are, <i>inter alia</i>, 'acts and actions referred to in Articles 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34 and 35 of the Civil Code,' which, in turn, are found in the Chapter on Human Relations of the Preliminary Title of the Civil Code. x x x<br></blockquote>Under the circumstances, an award of exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00, as prayed for, is likewise proper. "Exemplary damages are designed to permit the courts to mould behavior that has socially deleterious consequences, and their imposition is required by public policy to suppress the wanton acts of the offender."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> This should prevent respondents from repeating their mistakes, which proved costly for petitioner.<br><blockquote>Under Article 2229 of the Civil Code, '[e]xemplary or corrective damages are imposed, by way of example or correction for the public good, in addition to the moral, temperate, liquidated or compensatory damages.' As this court has stated in the past: 'Exemplary damages are designed by our civil law to permit the courts to reshape behaviour that is socially deleterious in its consequence by creating negative incentives or deterrents against such behaviour.'<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br></blockquote>Finally, petitioner is also entitled to attorney's fees equivalent to 10per cent (10%) of the total award. The unjustified acts of respondents clearly compelled him to institute an action primarily to vindicate his rights and protect his interest. Indeed, when an employee is forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect his rights and interest, he is entitled to an award of attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is <b>PARTIALLY GRANTED</b>.
