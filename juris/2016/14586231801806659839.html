Cortes (Cortes) and Dave Somido (Somido) (respondents) were illegally dismissed from employment by Echo. Edward N. Enriquez (Enriquez), Leonora K. Benedicto (Benedicto) and Atty. Gina Wenceslao (Atty. Wenceslao) used to be Echo's General Manager, Operations and Human Resources Officer, and External Counsel, respectively (Echo and the three officers are to be referred collectively as the petitioners).

In 2008, Somido was made a Warehouse Checker, while Cortes, a Forklift Operator.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In January of 2009, the respondents and their co-workers formed Obrero Pilipino-Echo 2000 Commercial Chapter (Union). Cortes was elected as Vice-President while Somido became an active member.

After an immediate audit, Echo suspected that there was a conspiracy among the employees in the warehouse. Since an uninterrupted investigation was necessary, Echo, in the exercise of its management prerogative, decided to re-assign the staff. The respondents were among those affected.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On July 7, 2009, Enriquez issued a memorandum informing the respondents of their transfer to the Delivery Section, which was within the premises of Echo's warehouse.

He explained that he was already happy as a Warehouse Checker. Further, he was not ready to be a Delivery Supervisor since the position was sensitive and required more expertise and training, which he did not have.<br><br>Cortes similarly declined Echo's offer of promotion claiming that he was contented in his post then as a Forklift Operator.

The appealed decision of the [LA] dated April 20, 2010 is <b>REVERSED and SET ASIDE</b> and a new one is entered declaring [the petitioners] guilty of unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal of the [respondents].

There were no prior untoward incidents. However, things changed when the Union was formed. When the two did not agree to be transferred, they were terminated for insubordination, a mere ploy to lend a semblance of legality to a pre-conceived management strategy.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>The NLRC denied the petitioners' motion for reconsideration.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>The Proceedings Before the CA The petitioners thereafter filed a Petition for<i> Certiorari</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In the herein assailed Decision dated September 24, 2013, the CA affirmed<i> in toto</i> the NLRC's ruling citing the following as grounds:<br><br><blockquote>A transfer is a movement from one position to another which is of equivalent rank, level or salary, without break in service. Promotion, on the other hand, is the advancement from one position to another with an increase in duties and responsibilities as authorized by law, and usually accompanied by an increase in salary.<br><br>xxx There is no doubt that said position of Delivery Supervisor/Coordinator entails great duties and responsibilities of overseeing ECHO's business and involves discretionary powers, xxx What is important is the change in the nature of work which resulted in an upgrade of their work condition and increase of duties and responsibilities which constitute promotion and not a mere transfer.<br><br>A transfer that results in promotion cannot be done without the employee's consent since there is no law that compels an employee to accept a promotion for the reason that a promotion is in the nature of a gift or reward, which a person has a right to refuse. When [the respondents] refused to accept their promotion as Delivery Supervisors/Coordinators, they were exercising a right and they cannot be punished for it. He who uses his own legal right injures no one. Thus, [the respondents'] refusal to be promoted was not a valid cause for their dismissal.<br><br>Anent the award of moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney's fees, We agree with the NLRC that [the respondents] are entitled to the same.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>x x x We agree with the NLRC that the dismissal of [the respondents] was tainted with bad faith as they were dismissed by ECHO for refusing to accept their promotion as Delivery Supervisor[s]/Coordinator[s]. x x x The NLRC also found that ECHO'S act of transferring [the respondents] from Forklift Operator and Warehouse Checker x x x to Delivery Supervisors/Coordinators was aimed to remove them among the rank-and-file employees which amounts to union interference. Without the leadership of Cortes, as Vice-President, and Somido, as an active member, the union would be severely weakened, especially since most of its officers were already terminated by ECHO, x x x.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (Citations omitted)</blockquote><br>The petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, which the CA denied through the Resolution<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> dated March 28, 2014.<br><br><center><b>Issues</b><br></center><br>Unperturbed, the petitioners are now before the Court raising the issues of whether or not:<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="TOP"> <td width="9%"><div align="CENTER">(1)</div></td> <td width="91%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">the respondents were illegally suspended and terminated, hence, entitled to payment of their money claims, damages and attorney's fees; </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(2) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Echo and its officers are guilty of unfair labor practice; and</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">(3) </div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Echo's officers, who are sued as nominal parties, should be held liable to pay the respondents their money claims.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>In support thereof, the petitioners claim that the respondents' refusal to comply with the management's transfer order constitutes just cause to terminate the latter from employment. Echo also points out that before it closed shop on July 6, 2011, the Union continued existing despite the respondents' dismissal from service. Hence, there is no factual basis in the NLRC and CA's ruling that the respondents' termination is intertwined with union-busting.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>The petitioners further argue that the respondents failed to establish by substantial evidence that Echo's officers, namely, Enriquez, Benedicto and Atty.

All employees not falling within any of the above definitions are considered <i>rank-and-file employees</i> for purposes of this Book. (Italics ours)</blockquote><br>As to the extent of management prerogative to transfer/promote employees, and the differences between transfer on one hand, and promotion, on the other, <i>Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. Del Villar</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> is instructive, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><blockquote>[L]abor laws discourage interference in employers" judgment concerning the conduct of their business.<br><br>In the pursuit of its legitimate business interest, <u>management has the prerogative to transfer or assign employees from one office or area of operation to another - provided there is no demotion in rank or diminution of salary, benefits, and other privileges; and the action is not motivated by discrimination, made in bad faith, or effected as a form of punishment or demotion without sufficient cause</u>. x x x.<br><br>x x x In the case of<i> Blue Dairy Corporation v.

In particular, the employer must be able to show that the transfer is not unreasonable, inconvenient or prejudicial to the employee; nor does it involve a demotion in rank or a diminution of his salaries, privileges and other benefits, xxx.<br><br>x x x x</blockquote>A <i>transfer</i> is a movement from one position to another which is of equivalent rank, level or salary, without break in service. <u><i>Promotion</i>, on the other hand, is the advancement from one position to another with an increase in duties and responsibilities as authorized by law, and <b>usually accompanied by an increase in salary</b></u>. Conversely, demotion involves a situation where an employee is relegated to a subordinate or less important position constituting a reduction to a lower grade or rank, with a corresponding decrease in duties and responsibilities, and usually accompanied by a decrease in salary.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> (Citations omitted and emphasis and underscoring ours)<br></blockquote><br>For promotion to occur, there must be an advancement from one position to another or an upward vertical movement of the employee's rank or position.

Refusal to be promoted is a valid exercise of a right.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Such exercise cannot be considered in law as insubordination, or willful disobedience of a lawful order of the employer, hence, it cannot be the basis of an employee's dismissal from service.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>In the case at bench, a Warehouse Checker and a Forklift Operator are rank-and-file employees. On the other hand, the job of a Delivery Supervisor/Coordinator requires the exercise of discretion and judgment from time to time. Specifically, a Delivery Supervisor/Coordinator assigns teams to man the trucks, oversees the loading of goods, checks the conditions of the trucks, coordinates with account specialists in the outlets regarding their delivery concerns, and supervises other personnel about their performance in the warehouse. A Delivery Supervisor/Coordinator's duties and responsibilities are apparently not of the same weight as those of a Warehouse Checker or Forklift Operator. Hence, despite the fact that no salary increases were effected, the assumption of the post of a Delivery Supervisor/Coordinator should be considered a promotion. The respondents' refusal to accept the same was therefore valid.<br><br>Notwithstanding the illegality of the respondents' dismissal, the Court finds no sufficient basis to award moral and exemplary damages.<br><br>A dismissal may be contrary to law but by itself alone, it does not establish bad faith to entitle the dismissed employee to moral damages. The award of moral and exemplary damages cannot be justified solely upon the premise that the employer dismissed his employee without just or authorized cause.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the right not to accept an offered promotion pertained to each of the respondents. However, they exhibited disrespectful behavior by their repeated refusal to receive the memoranda issued by Echo and by their continued presence in their respective areas without any work output.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> The Court thus finds that although the respondents' dismissal from service for just cause was unwarranted, there is likewise no basis for the award of moral and exemplary damages in their favor. Echo expectedly imposed disciplinary penalties upon the respondents for the latter's intransigence. Albeit the Court is not convinced of the character and extent of the measures taken by Echo, bad faith cannot be inferred solely from the said impositions.<br><br>Anent the NLRC and CA's conclusion that Echo committed unfair labor practice, the Court disagrees.<br><br>Unfair labor practices violate the constitutional right of workers and employees to self-organization, are inimical to the legitimate interests of both labor and management, including their right to bargain collectively and otherwise deal with each other in an atmosphere of freedom and mutual respect, disrupt industrial peace and hinder the promotion of healthy and stable labor-management relations.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The respondents allege that their transfer/promotion was intended to deprive the Union of leadership and membership. They claim that other officers were already dismissed. The foregoing, however, lacks substantiation. Unfair labor practice is a serious charge, and the respondents failed to show that the petitioners conclusively interfered with, restrained, or coerced employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization.<br><br><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="40%"><div align="JUSTIFY"><b>Enriquez, Benedicto and Atty.

Binamira</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> expounds on the liabilities of corporate officers to illegally dismissed employees. The Court declared:<br><br><blockquote><u>As a general rule, only the employer-corporation, partnership or association or any other entity, and not its officers, which may be held liable for illegal dismissal of employees or for other wrongful acts.</u> This is as it should be because a corporation is a juridical entity with legal personality separate and distinct from those acting for and in its behalf and, in general, from the people comprising it. A corporation, as a juridical entity, may act only through its directors, officers and employees. Obligations incurred as a result of the directors' and officers' acts as corporate agents, are not their personal liability but the direct responsibility of the corporation they represent. <u>It is settled that in the absence of malice and bad faith, a stockholder or an officer of a corporation cannot be made personally liable for corporate liabilities.</u> They are only solidarity liable with the corporation for the illegal ermination of services of employees if they acted with malice or bad faith. In <i>Philippine American Life and General Insurance v. Gramaje</i>, <u>bad faith is defined as a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or with some motive of self-interest or ill will or for ulterior purpose. It implies a conscious and intentional design to do a wrongful act for a dishonest purpose or moral obliquity</u>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> (Citations omitted and underlining ours)</blockquote><br>In the instant petition, the respondents failed to specify and sufficiently prove the alleged acts of Enriquez, Benedicto and Atty. Wenceslao from which malice or bad faith can be concluded. Hence, there is no reason to invoke the exception to the general rule on non-liability of corporate officers.<br><br><b>In<i> lieu</i> of actual reinstatement, <br>the respondents are entitled to <br>separation pay.</b><br><br>"In cases of illegal dismissal, the accepted doctrine is that separation pay is available in<i> lieu</i> of reinstatement when the latter recourse is no longer practical or in the best interest of the parties."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>The Court notes that the respondents were terminated from service on August 15, 2009, or more than six years ago.
