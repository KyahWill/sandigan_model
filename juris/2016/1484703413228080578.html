				<BR><BR><div><div align="JUSTIFY">The petitioner as taxpayer appeals before the Court the adverse decision entered on March 29, 2010<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the resolution issued on August 12, 2010<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in C.T.A. EB No. 514, whereby the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) <i>En Banc</i> respectively denied its claim for refund of excess input value-added tax (VAT) arising from its zero-rated sales of services for taxable year 2002, and denied its ensuing motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The factual and procedural antecedents, as narrated by the CTA<i> En Banc</i>, are quoted below:<br><br><blockquote>Respondent Takenaka, as a subcontractor, entered into an On-Shore Construction Contract with Philippine Air Terminal Co., Inc.

Case No. 6886.<br><br>After trial on the merits, on November 4, 2008, the Former First Division rendered a Decision partly granting the Petition for Review and ordering herein petitioner CIR to refund to respondent Takenaka the reduced amount of P53,374,366.52, with a Concurring and Dissenting Opinion from Presiding Justice Ernesto D. Acosta.<br><br>Not satisfied, on November 26, 2008, respondent Takenaka filed a "Motion for Reconsideration".<br><br>During the deliberation of respondent Takenaka's "Motion for Reconsideration", Associate Justice Caesar A. Casanova changed his stand and concurred with Presiding Justice Ernesto D. Acosta, while the original <i>Ponente</i>, Associate Justice Lovell R. Bautista, maintained his stand. Thus, respondent Takenaka's "Motion for Reconsideration" was granted by the Former First Division in its Amended Decision dated March 16, 2009, with a Dissenting Opinion from Associate Justice Lovell R. Bautista.<br><br>On April 7, 2009, petitioner CIR filed a "Motion for Reconsideration" of the Amended Decision, which the Former First Division denied in a Resolution dated June 29, 2009, with Associate Justice Lovell R. Bautista reiterating his Dissenting Opinion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br><br>Consequently, the respondent filed a petition for review in the CTA <i>En Banc</i> to seek the reversal of the March 16, 2009 decision and the June 29, 2009 resolution of the CTA Former First Division.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>On March 29, 2010, the CTA En Banc promulgated its decision disposing thusly:<br><br><blockquote><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the present Petition for Review is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.

San Roque Power Corporation</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <br><br>The petitioner timely filed its administrative claim on April 11, 2003, within the two-year prescriptive period after the close of the taxable quarter when the zero-rated sales were made. The respondent had 120 days, or until August 9, 2003, to decide the petitioner's claim. Considering that the respondent did not act on the petitioner's claim on or before August 9, 2003, the latter had until September 8, 2003, the last day of the 30-day period, within which to file its judicial claim. However, it brought its petition for review in the CTA only on March 10, 2004, or 184 days after the last day for the filing. Clearly, the petitioner belatedly brought its judicial claim for refund, and the CTA did not acquire jurisdiction over the petitioner's appeal.<br><br>We note, however, that the petitioner's judicial claim was brought well within the two-year prescriptive period. Be that as it may, it must be stressed that the two-year prescriptive period refers to the period within which the taxpayer can file an administrative claim, not the judicial claim with the CTA.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Accordingly, the CTA should have denied petitioner's claim for tax refund or credit for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>Nonetheless, the CTA did not err in denying the claim for refund on the ground that the petitioner had not established its zero-rated sales of services to PIATCO through the presentation of official receipts. In this regard, as evidence of an administrative claim for tax refund or tax credit, there is a certain distinction between a <i>receipt</i> and an <i>invoice. </i>The Court has reiterated the distinction in <i>Northern Mindanao Power Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>Section 113 of the NIRC of 1997 provides that a VAT invoice is necessary for every sale, barter or exchange of goods or properties, while a VAT official receipt properly pertains to every lease of goods or properties; as well as to every sale, barter or exchange of services.<br><br>The Court has in fact distinguished an invoice from a receipt in <i>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Manila Mining Corporation</i>:<br></blockquote><br><blockquote><blockquote><b>A "sales or commercial invoice" is a written account of goods sold or services rendered indicating the prices charged therefor or a list by whatever name it is known which is used in the ordinary course of business evidencing sale and transfer or agreement to sell or transfer goods and services.<br><br>A "receipt" oh the other hand is a written acknowledgment of the fact of payment in money or other settlement between seller and buyer of goods, debtor or creditor, or person rendering services and client or customer.</b><br></blockquote></blockquote><br><blockquote>A VAT invoice is the seller's best proof of the sale of goods or services to the buyer, while a VAT receipt is the buyer's best evidence of the payment of goods or services received from the seller. A VAT invoice and a VAT receipt should not be confused and made to refer to one and the same thing. Certainly, neither does the law intend the two to be used alternatively. (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)<br></blockquote><br>The petitioner submitted sales invoices, not official receipts, to support its claim for refund. In light of the aforestated distinction between a receipt and an invoice, the submissions were inadequate for the purpose thereby intended. The Court concurs with the conclusion of the CTA <i>En Banc</i>, therefore, that "[w]ithout proper VAT official receipts issued to its clients, the payments received by respondent Takenaka for providing services to PEZA-registered entities cannot qualify for VAT zero-rating. Hence, it cannot claim such sales as zero-rated VAT not subject to output tax."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Under VAT Ruling No. 011-03, the sales of goods and services rendered by the petitioner to PIATCO were subject to zero-percent (0%) VAT, and required no prior approval for zero rating based on Revenue Memorandum Circular 74-99.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> This notwithstanding, the petitioner's claim for refund must still be denied for its failure as the taxpayer to comply with the substantiation requirements for administrative claims for tax refund or tax credit. The Court explains why in <i>Western Mindanao Power Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><blockquote>In a claim for tax refund or tax credit, the applicant must prove not only entitlement to the grant of the claim under substantive law. It must also show satisfaction of all the documentary and evidentiary requirements for an administrative claim for a refund or tax credit. <b>Hence, the mere fact that petitioner's application for zero-rating has been approved by the CIR does not, by itself, justify the grant of a refund or tax credit. The taxpayer claiming the refund must further comply with the invoicing and accounting requirements mandated by the NIRC, as well as by revenue regulations implementing them.</b> (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)</blockquote><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court <b>DENIES</b> the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>; <b>AFFIRMS </b>the decision promulgated on March 29, 2010 in C.T.A.
