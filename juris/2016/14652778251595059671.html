Since January 11, 2014 fell on a Saturday, petitioners could have filed their pleading on the following Monday, or on January 13, 2014.<br><br>In their Motion for Extension of Time, however, petitioners requested an additional 30 days <i>from January 13, 2014</i> within which to file their petition for review on certiorari.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>This Court already clarified the periods of extension in A.M. No. 00-2-14-SC:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Whereas, Section 1, Rule 22 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides:<br><blockquote>Section 1. <i>How to compute time. -</i> In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these Rules, or by order of the court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run is to be excluded and the date of performance included. If the last day of the period, as thus computed, falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday in the place where the court sits, the time shall not run until the next working day.</blockquote>Whereas, the aforecited provision applies in the matter of filing of pleadings in courts when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, in which case, the filing of the said pleading on the next working day is deemed on time;<br><br>Whereas, the question has been raised if the period is extended<i> ipso jure</i> to the next working day immediately following where the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday, so that when a motion for extension of time is filed, the period of extension is to be reckoned from the next working day and not from the original expiration of the period.<br><br>NOW THEREFORE, the Court Resolves, for the guidance of the Bench and the Bar, to declare that <i>Section 1, Rule 22 speaks only of "the last day of the period" so that when a party seeks an extension and the same is granted, the due date ceases to be the last day and hence, the provision no longer applies. Any extension of time to file the required pleading should therefore be counted from the expiration of the period regardless of the fact that said due date is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday</i>. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><br>Thus, petitioners' request for extension of time should have been reckoned from the original due date on January 11, 2014, even if this day fell on a Saturday.

Their case must still stand on its own merits for this Court to grant the relief petitioners pray for.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Common carriers are required to exercise extraordinary diligence in the performance of its obligations under the contract of carriage. This extraordinary diligence must be observed not only in the <i>transportation</i> of goods and services but also in the issuance of the contract of carriage, including its ticketing operations.<br><br><blockquote>Article 1732 of the Civil Code defines a common carrier as "persons, corporations or firms, or associations engaged in the business of carrying or transporting passengers or goods or both, by land, water or air, for compensation, offering their services to the public." Articles 1733, 1755, and 1756 of the Civil Code outline the degree of diligence required of common carriers:<br>. . . .<br><br>ARTICLE 1733. Common carriers, from the nature of their business and for reasons of public policy, are bound to observe extraordinary diligence in the vigilance over the goods and for the safety of the passengers transported by them, according to all the circumstances of each case.<br><br>ARTICLE 1755. A common carrier is bound to carry the passengers safely as far as human care and foresight can provide, using the utmost diligence of very cautious persons, with a due regard for all the circumstances.<br><br>ARTICLE 1756. In case of death of or injuries to passengers, common carriers are presumed to have been at fault or to have acted negligently, unless they prove that they observed extraordinary diligence as prescribed in articles 1733 and 1755.</blockquote><br>Respondent, as one of the four domestic airlines in the country,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup> is a common carrier required by law to exercise extraordinary diligence. Extraordinary diligence requires that the common carrier must transport goods and passengers "safely as far as human care and foresight can provide," and it must exercise the "utmost diligence of very cautious persons . . . with due regard for all the circumstances."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup><br><br>When a common carrier, through its ticketing agent, has not yet issued a ticket to the prospective passenger, the transaction between them is still that of a seller and a buyer. The obligation of the airline to exercise extraordinary diligence commences upon the issuance of the contract of carriage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[92]</sup> Ticketing, as the act of issuing the contract of carriage, is necessarily included in the exercise of extraordinary diligence.<br><br>A contract of carriage is defined as "one whereby a certain person or association of persons obligate themselves to transport persons, things, or news from one place to another for a fixed price."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup> In <i>Cathay Pacific Airways v. Reyes</i>:<font color="#FF0000"><sup>[94]</sup></font><br><br><blockquote>[W]hen an airline issues a ticket to a passenger confirmed on a particular flight, on a certain date, a contract of carriage arises, and the passenger has every right to expect that he would fly on that flight and on that date. If he does not, then the carrier opens itself to a suit for breach of contract of carriage.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[95]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Once a plane ticket is issued, the common carrier binds itself to deliver the passenger safely on the date and time stated in the ticket. The contractual obligation of the common carrier to the passenger is governed principally by what is written on the contract of carriage.<br><br>In this case, both parties stipulated<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[96]</sup> that the flight schedule stated on the nine (9) disputed tickets was the 10:05 a.m. flight of July 22, 2008. According to the contract of carriage, respondent's obligation as a common carrier was to transport nine (9) of the petitioners safely on the 10:05 a.m. flight of July 22, 2008.<br><br>Petitioners, however, argue that respondent was negligent in the issuance of the contract of carriage since the contract did not embody their intention. They insist that the nine (9) disputed tickets should have been scheduled for the 4:15 p.m. flight of July 22, 2008. Respondent, on the other hand, denies this and states that petitioner Jose was fully informed of the schedules of the purchased tickets and petitioners were negligent when they failed to correct their ticket schedule.<br><br>Respondent relies on the Parol Evidence Rule in arguing that a written document is considered the best evidence of the terms agreed on by the parties. Petitioners, however, invoke the exception in Rule 130, Section 9(b) of the Rules of Court that evidence may be introduced if the written document fails to express the true intent of the parties:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup><br><br><blockquote>Section 9. Evidence of written agreements. When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing, it is considered as containing all the terms agreed upon and there can be, between the parties and their successors in interest, no evidence of such terms other than the contents of the written agreement.<br><br>However, a party may present evidence to modify, explain or add to the terms of the written agreement if he puts in issue in his pleading:<br><br>(a) An intrinsic ambiguity, mistake, or imperfection in the written agreement;<br><br>(b) The failure of the written agreement to express the true intent and agreement of the parties thereto;<br><br>(c)&nbsp; The validity of the written agreement; or<br><br>(d) The existence of other terms agreed to by the parties or their successors in interest after the execution of the written agreement.</blockquote><br>In <i>ACI Philippines, Inc. v. Coquia</i>:<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[98]</sup><br><br><blockquote>It is a cardinal rule of evidence, not just one of technicality but of substance, that the written document is the best evidence of its own contents. It is also a matter of both principle and policy that when the written contract is established as the repository of the parties stipulations, any other evidence is excluded and the same cannot be used as a substitute for such contract, nor even to alter or contradict them.

The tickets were comprised of three (3) pages. Petitioners argue that only the first page was recapped to petitioner Jose when he made the purchase.<br><br>The common carrier's obligation to exercise extraordinary diligence in the issuance of the contract of carriage is fulfilled by requiring a full review of the flight schedules to be given to a prospective passenger before payment. Based on the information stated on the contract of carriage, all three (3) pages were recapped to petitioner Jose.<br><br>The only evidence petitioners have in order to prove their true intent of having the entire group on the 4:15 p.m. flight is petitioner Jose's self-serving testimony that the airline failed to recap the last page of the tickets to him. They have neither shown nor introduced any other evidence before the Metropolitan Trial Court, Regional Trial Court, Court of Appeals, or this Court.<br><br>Even assuming that the ticketing agent encoded the incorrect flight information, it is incumbent upon the purchaser of the tickets to at least check if all the information is correct before making the purchase.

"Such provisions have been held to be a part of the contract of carriage, and valid and binding upon the passenger regardless of the latter's lack of knowledge or assent to the regulation." It is what is known as a contract of "adhesion," in regards which it has been said that contracts of adhesion wherein one party imposes a ready made form of contract on the other, as the plane ticket in the case at bar, are contracts not entirely prohibited. The one who adheres to the contract is in reality free to reject it entirely; if he adheres, he gives his consent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[111]</sup><br></blockquote><br>One of the terms stated in petitioners' tickets stipulates that the photo identification of the passenger must match the name entered upon booking:<br><br><blockquote>Guests should present a valid photo ID to airport security and upon check-in.

Since the tickets were for 20 passengers, he was expected to have checked each name on each page of the tickets in order to see if all the passengers' names were encoded and correctly spelled. Had he done this, he would have noticed that there was a different flight schedule encoded on the third page of the tickets since the flight schedule was stated directly above the passengers' names.<br><br>Petitioners' flight information was not written in fine print. It was clearly stated on the left portion of the ticket above the passengers' names. If petitioners had exercised even the slightest bit of prudence, they would have been able to remedy any erroneous booking.<br><br>This is not the first time that this Court has explained that an air passenger has the correlative duty to exercise ordinary care in the conduct of his or her affairs.<br><br>In <i>Crisostomo v.

As correctly observed by the lower court,<i> the plane ticket issued to petitioner clearly reflected the departure date and time,</i> contrary to petitioner's contention. The travel documents, consisting of the tour itinerary, vouchers and instructions, were likewise delivered to petitioner two days prior to the trip.
