				<BR><STRONG>LEONEN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The words of our most fundamental law cannot be read so as to callously exclude all foundlings from public service.<br><br>When the names of the parents of a foundling cannot be discovered despite a diligent search, but sufficient evidence is presented to sustain a reasonable inference that satisfies the quantum of proof required to conclude that at least one or both of his or her parents is Filipino, then this should be sufficient to establish that he or she is a natural-born citizen. When these inferences are made by the Senate Electoral Tribunal in the exercise of its sole and exclusive prerogative to decide the qualifications of the members of the Senate, then there is no grave abuse of discretion remediable by either Rule 65 of the Rules of Court or Article VIII, Section I of the Constitution.<br><br>This case certainly does not decide with finality the citizenship of every single foundling as natural-born. The circumstances of each case are unique, and substantial proof may exist to show that a foundling is not natural-born. The nature of the Senate Electoral Tribunal and its place in the scheme of political powers, as devised by the Constitution, are likewise different from the other ways to raise questions of citizenship.<br><br>Before this Court is a Petition for Certiorari<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> filed by petitioner Rizalito Y.

These powers are granted to a separate and distinct constitutional organ. There are two (2) aspects to the exclusivity of the Senate Electoral Tribunal's power. The power to resolve such contests is exclusive to any other body. The resolution of such contests is its only task; it performs no other function.<br><br>The 1987 Constitution is not the first fundamental law to introduce into our legal system an "independent, impartial and non-partisan body attached to the legislature and specially created for that singular purpose."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> The 1935 Constitution similarly created an Electoral Commission, independent from the National Assembly, to be the sole judge of all contests relating to members of the National Assembly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[116]</sup> This was a departure from the system introduced by prior organic acts enforced under American colonial rule—namely: the Philippine Bill of 1902 and the Jones Law of 1916—which vested the power to resolve such contests in the legislature itself.

Under the amended 1935 Constitution, the power was unqualifiedly reposed upon the Electoral Tribunal . . . and it remained as full, clear and complete as that previously granted the legislature and the Electoral Commission. . . .

It is only before them that post-election challenges against the election, returns, and qualifications of Senators and Representatives (as well as of the President and the Vice-President, in the case of the Presidential Electoral Tribunal) may be initiated.<br><br>The judgments of these tribunals are not beyond the scope of any review. Article VI, Section 17's stipulation of electoral tribunals' being the "sole" judge must be read in harmony with Article VIII, Section 1's express statement that "[j]udicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice . . . to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of <b><i>any branch or instrumentality</i></b> of the Government."

The Court does not, to paraphrase it in <i>Co vs. [House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal]</i>, venture into the perilous area of correcting perceived errors of independent branches of the Government; it comes in only when it has to vindicate a denial of due process or correct an abuse of discretion so grave or glaring that no less than the Constitution itself calls for remedial action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[121]</sup> (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>This Court reviews judgments of the House and Senate Electoral Tribunals not in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.

It was compelled to exercise its original jurisdiction in the face of a constitutional ambiguity that, at that point, was without judicial precedent.<br><br>Acting within this void, the Senate Electoral Tribunal was only asked to make a reasonable interpretation of the law while needfully considering the established personal circumstances of private respondent. It could not have asked the impossible of private respondent, sending her on a proverbial fool's errand to establish her parentage, when the controversy before it arose because private respondent's parentage was unknown and has remained so throughout her life.<br><br>The Senate Electoral Tribunal knew the limits of human capacity. It did not insist on burdening private respondent with conclusively proving, within the course of the few short months, the one thing that she has never been in a position to know throughout her lifetime. Instead, it conscientiously appreciated the implications of all other facts known about her finding. Therefore, it arrived at conclusions in a manner in keeping with the degree of proof required in proceedings before a quasi-judicial body: not absolute certainty, not proof beyond reasonable doubt or preponderance of evidence, but "substantial evidence, or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[131]</sup><br><br>In the process, it avoided setting a damning precedent for all children with the misfortune of having been abandoned by their biological parents. Far from reducing them to inferior, second-class citizens, the Senate Electoral Tribunal did justice to the Constitution's aims of promoting and defending the well-being of children, advancing human rights, and guaranteeing equal protection of the laws and equal access to opportunities for public service.<br><br><center><b>II</b><br></center><br>Article VI, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution spells out the requirement that "[n]o person shall be a Senator unless he [or she] is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines."<br><br>Petitioner asserts that private respondent is not a natural-born citizen and, therefore, not qualified to sit as Senator of the Republic, chiefly on two (2) grounds. First, he argues that as a foundling whose parents are unknown, private respondent fails to satisfy the <i><i>jus sanguinis</i></i> principle: that is, that she failed to establish her Filipino "blood line," which is supposedly the essence of the Constitution's determination of who are natural-born citizens of the Philippines. Proceeding from this first assertion, petitioner insists that as private respondent was never a natural-born citizen, she could never leave reverted to natural-born status despite the performance of acts that ostensibly comply with Republic Act No. 9225, otherwise known as the Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003.<br><br>Petitioner's case hinges on the primacy he places over Article IV, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution and its enumeration of who are Filipino citizens, more specifically on Section 1(2), which identifies as citizens "[t]hose whose fathers or mothers are citizens of the Philippines." Petitioner similarly claims that, as private respondent's foundling status is settled, the burden to prove Filipino parentage was upon her. With private respondent having supposedly failed to discharge this burden, the supposed inevitable conclusion is that she is not a natural-born Filipino.<br><br><center><b>III</b><br></center><br>At the heart of this controversy is a constitutional ambiguity. Definitely, foundlings have biological parents, either or both of whom can be Filipinos. Yet, by the nature of their being foundlings, they may, at critical times, not know their parents. Thus, this controversy must consider possibilities where parentage may be Filipino but, due to no fault of the foundling, remains unknown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[132]</sup> Resolving this controversy hinges on constitutional interpretation.<br><br>Discerning constitutional meaning is an exercise in discovering the sovereign's purpose so as to identify which among competing interpretations of the same text is the more contemporarily viable construction. Primarily, the actual words—text—and how they are situated within the whole document—context—govern. Secondarily, when discerning meaning from the plain text (i.e., verba legis) fails, contemporaneous construction may settle what is more viable. Nevertheless, even when a reading of the plain text is already sufficient, contemporaneous construction may still be resorted to as a means for verifying or validating the clear textual or contextual meaning of the Constitution.<br><br><center><b>III. A</b><br></center><br>The entire exercise of interpreting a constitutional provision must necessarily begin with the text itself. The language of the provision being interpreted is the principal source from which this Court determines constitutional intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[133]</sup><br><br>To the extent possible, words must be given their ordinary meaning; this is consistent with the basic precept of verba legis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[134]</sup> The Constitution is truly a public document in that it was ratified and approved by a direct act of the People exercising their right of suffrage, they approved of it through a plebiscite. The preeminent consideration in reading the Constitution, therefore, is the People's consciousness: that is, popular, rather than technical-legal, understanding. Thus:<br><blockquote><i>We look to the language of the document itself in our search for its meaning. We do not of course stop there, but that is where we begin.</i> It is to be assumed that the words in which constitutional provisions are couched express the objective sought to be attained. They are to be given their ordinary meaning except where technical terms are employed in which case the significance thus attached to them prevails. As the Constitution is not primarily a lawyer's document, it being essential for the rule of law to obtain that it should ever be present in the people's consciousness, its language as much as possible should be understood in the sense they have in common use. What it says according to the text of the provision to be construed compels acceptance and negates the power of the courts to alter it, based on the postulate that the framers and the people mean what they say. Thus, these are the cases where the need for construction is reduced to a minimum.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[135]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Reading a constitutional provision requires awareness of its relation with the whole of the Constitution. A constitutional provision is but a constituent of a greater whole. It is the framework of the Constitution that animates each of its components through the dynamism of these components' interrelations. What is called into operation is the entire document, not simply a peripheral item. The Constitution should, therefore, be appreciated and read as a singular, whole unit—<i>ut magis valeat quam pereat</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[136]</sup> Each provision must be understood and effected in a way that gives life to all that the Constitution contains, from its foundational principles to its finest fixings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[137]</sup><br><br>The words and phrases that establish its framework and its values color each provision at the heart of a controversy in an actual case. In <i>Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[138]</sup><br><blockquote>It is a well-established rule in constitutional construction that no one provision of the Constitution is to be separated from all the others, to be considered alone, but that all the provisions bearing upon a particular subject are to be brought into view and to be so interpreted as to effectuate the great purposes of the instrument. Sections bearing on a particular subject should be considered and interpreted together as to effectuate the whole purpose of the Constitution and one section is not to be allowed to defeat another, if by any reasonable construction, the two can be made to stand together.<br><br>In other words, the court must harmonize them, if practicable, and must lean in favor of construction which will render every word operative, rather than one which may make the words idle and nugatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[139]</sup> (Citations omitted)<br></blockquote>Reading a certain text includes a consideration of jurisprudence that has previously considered that exact same text, if any. Our legal system is founded on the basic principle that "judicial decisions applying or interpreting the laws or the Constitution shall form part of [our] legal system."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[140]</sup> Jurisprudence is not an independent source of law. Nevertheless, judicial interpretation is deemed part of or written into the text itself as of the date that it was originally passed. This is because judicial construction articulates the contemporaneous intent that the text brings to effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[141]</sup> Nevertheless, one must not fall into the temptation of considering prior interpretation as immutable.<br><br>Interpretation grounded on textual primacy likewise looks into how the text has evolved. Unless completely novel, legal provisions are the result of the re-adoption—often with accompanying re-calibration—of previously existing rules. Even when seemingly novel, provisions are often introduced as a means of addressing the inadequacies and excesses of previously existing rules.<br><br>One may trace the historical development of text by comparing its current iteration with prior counterpart provisions, keenly taking note of changes in syntax, along with accounting for more conspicuous substantive changes such as the addition and deletion of provisos or items in enumerations, shifting terminologies, the use of more emphatic or more moderate qualifiers, and the imposition of heavier penalties. The tension between consistency and change galvanizes meaning.<br><br>Article IV, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution, which enumerates who are citizens of the Philippines, may be compared with counterpart provisions, not only in earlier Constitutions but even in organic laws<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[142]</sup> and in similar mechanisms<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup> introduced by colonial rulers whose precepts nevertheless still resonate today.<br><br>Even as ordinary meaning is preeminent, a realistic appreciation of legal interpretation must grapple with the truth that meaning is not always singular and uniform. In <i>Social Weather Stations, Inc. v. Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[144]</sup> this Court explained the place of a holistic approach in legal interpretation:<br><blockquote>Interestingly, both COMELEC and petitioners appeal to what they (respectively) construe to be plainly evident from Section 5.2(a)'s text on the part of COMELEC, that the use of the words "paid for" evinces no distinction between direct purchasers and those who purchase via subscription schemes; and, on the part of petitioners, that Section 5.2(a)'s desistance from actually using the word "subscriber" means that subscribers are beyond its contemplation. The variance in the parties' positions, considering that they are both banking on what they claim to be the Fair Election Act's plain meaning, is the best evidence of an extant ambiguity.<br><br>Second, statutory construction cannot lend itself to pedantic rigor that foments absurdity. The dangers of inordinate insistence on literal interpretation are commonsensical and need not be belabored. These dangers are by no means endemic to legal interpretation. Even in everyday conversations, misplaced literal interpretations are fodder for humor. A fixation on technical rules of grammar is no less innocuous. A pompously doctrinaire approach to text can stifle, rather than facilitate, the legislative wisdom that unbridled textualism purports to bolster.<br><br>Third, the assumption that there is, in all cases, a universal plain language is erroneous. In reality, universality and uniformity in meaning is a rarity. A contrary belief wrongly assumes that language is static.<br><br><b><i>The more appropriate and more effective approach is, thus, holistic rather than parochial: to consider context and the interplay of the historical, the contemporary, and even the envisioned.</i></b> <i>Judicial interpretation entails the convergence of social realities and social ideals. The latter are meant to be effected by the legal apparatus, chief of which is the bedrock of the prevailing legal order: the Constitution. Indeed, the word in the vernacular that describes the Constitution — saligan — demonstrates this imperative of constitutional primacy.</i><br><br>Thus, we refuse to read Section 5.2(a) of the Fair Election Act in isolation. Here, we consider not an abstruse provision but a stipulation that is part of the whole, i.e., the statute of which it is a part, that is aimed at realizing the ideal of fair elections. We consider not a cloistered provision but a norm that should have a present authoritative effect to achieve the ideals of those who currently read, depend on, and demand fealty from the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[145]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>III.

Nevertheless, even when meaning has already been ascertained from a reading of the plain text, contemporaneous construction may serve to verify or validate the meaning yielded by such reading.<br><br>Limited resort to contemporaneous construction is justified by the realization that the business of understanding the Constitution is not exclusive to this Court. The basic democratic foundation of our constitutional order necessarily means that all organs of government, and even the People, read the fundamental law and are guided by it. When competing viable interpretations arise, a justiciable controversy may ensue requiring judicial intervention in order to arrive with finality at which interpretation shall be sustained. To remain true to its democratic moorings, however, judicial involvement must remain guided by a framework or deference and constitutional avoidance. This same principle underlies the basic doctrine that courts are to refrain from issuing advisory opinions. Specifically as regards this Court, only constitutional issues that are narrowly framed, sufficient to resolve an actual case, may be entertained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[147]</sup><br><br>When permissible then, one may consider analogous jurisprudence (that is, judicial decisions on similar, but not the very same, matters or concerns),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[148]</sup> as well as thematically similar statutes and international norms that form part of our legal system. This includes discerning the purpose and aims of the text in light of the specific facts under consideration. It is also only at this juncture—when external aids may be consulted—that the supposedly underlying notions of the framers, as articulated through records of deliberations and other similar accounts, can be illuminating.<br><br><center><b>III. C</b><br></center><br>In the hierarchy of the means for constitutional interpretation, inferring meaning from the supposed intent of the framers or fathoming the original understanding of the individuals who adopted the basic document is the weakest approach.<br><br>These methods leave the greatest room for subjective interpretation. Moreover, they allow for the greatest errors. The alleged intent of the framers is not necessarily encompassed or exhaustively articulated in the records of deliberations. Those that have been otherwise silent and have not actively engaged in interpellation and debate may have voted for or against a proposition for reasons entirely their own and not necessarily in complete agreement with those articulated by the more vocal. It is even possible that the beliefs that motivated them were based on entirely erroneous premises. Fathoming original understanding can also misrepresent history as it compels a comprehension of actions made within specific historical episodes through detached, and not necessarily better-guided, modern lenses.<br><br>Moreover, the original intent of the framers of the Constitution is not always uniform with the original understanding of the People who ratified it. In <i>Civil Liberties Union</i>:<br><blockquote>While it is permissible in this jurisdiction to consult the debates and proceedings of the constitutional convention in order to arrive at the reason and purpose of the resulting Constitution, resort thereto may be had only when other guides fail as said proceedings are powerless to vary the terms of the Constitution when the meaning is clear. Debates in the constitutional convention "are of value as showing the views of the individual members, and as indicating the reasons for their votes, but they give us no light as to the views of the large majority who did not talk, much less of the mass of our fellow citizens whose votes at the polls gave the instrument the force of fundamental law. We think it safer to construe the constitution from what appears upon its face." <i>The proper interpretation therefore depends more on how it was understood by the people adopting it than in the framer's understanding thereof.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[149]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b>IV</b><br></div><br>Though her parents are unknown, private respondent is a Philippine citizen without the need for an express statement in the Constitution making her so. Her status as such is but the logical consequence of a reasonable reading of the Constitution within its plain text. The Constitution provides its own cues; there is not even a need to delve into the deliberations of its framers and the implications of international legal instruments. This reading proceeds from several levels.<br><br>On an initial level, a plain textual reading readily identifies the specific provision, which principally governs: the Constitution's actual definition, in Article IV, Section 2, of "natural-born citizens." This definition must be harmonized with Section 1's enumeration, which includes a reference to parentage. These provisions must then be appreciated in relation to the factual milieu of this case. The pieces of evidence before the Senate Electoral Tribunal, admitted facts, and uncontroverted circumstances adequately justify the conclusion of private respondent's Filipino parentage.<br><br>On another level, the assumption should be that foundlings are natural-born unless there is substantial evidence to the contrary. This is necessarily engendered by a complete consideration of the whole Constitution, not just its provisions on citizenship.

Its origins and rationale for inclusion as a requirement for the presidency are not even found in the records of constitutional deliberations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[176]</sup> However, it has been suggested that, as the United States was under British colonial rule before its independence, the requirement of being natural-born was introduced as a safeguard against foreign infiltration in the administration of national government:<br><blockquote>It has been suggested, quite plausibly, that this language was inserted in response to a letter sent by John Jay to George Washington, and probably to other delegates, on July 25, 1787, which stated:<br><blockquote>Permit me to hint, whether it would be wise and seasonable to provide a strong check to the admission of Foreigners into the administration of our national Government; and to declare expressly that the Command in Chief of the American army shall not be given to nor devolve on, any but a natural <i>born</i> Citizen.<br></blockquote>Possibly this letter was motivated by distrust of Baron Von Steuben, who had served valiantly in the Revolutionary forces, but whose subsequent loyalty was suspected by Jay. Another theory is that the Jay letter, and the resulting constitutional provision, responded to rumors that the Convention was concocting a monarchy to be ruled by a foreign monarch.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[177]</sup><br></blockquote>In the United States, however, citizenship is based on <i>jus soli</i>, not <i><i>jus sanguinis</i></i>.<br><br><center><b>V. C</b><br></center><br>Today, there are only two (2) categories of Filipino citizens: natural-born and naturalized.<br><br>A natural-born citizen is defined in Article IV, Section 2 as one who is a citizen of the Philippines "from birth without having to perform any act to acquire or perfect Philippine citizenship." By necessary implication, a naturalized citizen is one who is not natural-born. <i>Bengson v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[178]</sup> articulates this definition by dichotomy:<br><blockquote>[O]nly naturalized Filipinos are considered not natural-born citizens.

As shall later be discussed, Republic Act No. 9225 is premised on the immutability of natural-born status. It privileges natural-born citizens and proceeds from an entirely different premise from the restrictive process of naturalization.<br><br>So too, the jurisprudential treatment of naturalization vis-a-vis natural-born status is clear. It should be with the actual process of naturalization that natural-born status is to be contrasted, not against other procedures relating to citizenship.

Common sense dictates that actual proof is preferable. Nevertheless, resolving citizenship issues based on presumptions is firmly established in jurisprudence.<br><br>In 2004, this Court resolved <i>Tecson</i> on the basis of presumptions. Ruling on the allegations that former presidential candidate Ronald Allan Poe (more popularly known as Fernando Poe, Jr.) was not a natural-born Filipino citizen, this Court proceeded from the presumptions that: first, Fernando Poe Jr.'s grandfather, Lorenzo Pou, was born sometime in 1870, while the country was still under Spanish colonial rule;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[204]</sup> and second, that Lorenzo Pou's place of residence, as indicated in his dearth certificate, must have also been his place of residence before death, which subjected him to the "en masse Filipinization," or sweeping investiture of Filipino citizenship effected by the Philippine Bill of 1902.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[205]</sup> This Court then noted that Lorenzo Pou's citizenship would have extended to his son and Fernando Poe Jr.'s father, Allan F. Poe. Based on these, Fernando Poe. Jr. would then have been a natural-born Filipino as he was born while the 1935 Constitution, which conferred Filipino citizenship to those born to Filipino fathers, was in effect:<br><blockquote>In ascertaining, in G.R. No. 161824, whether grave abuse of discretion has been committed by the COMELEC, it is necessary to take on the matter of whether or not respondent FPJ is a natural-born citizen, which, in turn, depended on whether or not the father of respondent, Allan F. Poe, would have himself been a Filipino citizen and, in the affirmative, whether or not the alleged illegitimacy of respondent prevents him from taking after the Filipino citizenship of his putative father. Any conclusion on the Filipino citizenship of Lorenzo Pou could only be drawn from the presumption that having died in 1954 at 84 years old, when the Philippines was under Spanish rule, and that San Carlos, Pangasinan, his place of residence upon his death in 1954, in the absence of any other evidence, could have well been his place of residence before death, such that Lorenzo Pou would have benefited from the "en masse Filipinization" that the Philippine Bill had effected in 1902. That citizenship (of Lorenzo Pou), if acquired, would thereby extend to his son, Allan F. Poe, father of respondent FPJ. The 1935 Constitution, during which regime respondent FPJ has seen first light, confers citizenship to all persons whose fathers are Filipino citizens regardless of whether such children are legitimate or illegitimate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[206]</sup><br></blockquote>It is true that there is jurisprudence—<i>Paa v. Chan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[207]</sup> and <i>Go v. Ramos</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[208]</sup> (which merely cites <i>Paa</i>)—to the effect that presumptions cannot be entertained in citizenship cases.<br><br><i>Paa</i>, decided in 1967, stated:<br><blockquote>It is incumbent upon <i>the respondent</i>, who claims Philippine citizenship, to prove to the satisfaction of the court that he is really a Filipino. No presumption can be indulged in favor of <i><b>the</b> claimant</i>, of Philippine citizenship, and any doubt regarding citizenship must be resolved in favor of the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[209]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>These pronouncements are no longer controlling in light of this Court's more recent ruling in <i>Tecson</i>.<br><br>Moreover, what this Court stated in <i>Paa</i> was that "no presumption can be indulged in favor of <b><i>the</i></b> claimant of Philippine citizenship." This reference to "the claimant" was preceded by a sentence specifically referencing the duty of "the respondent." The syntax of this Court's pronouncement—using the definitive article "the"—reveals that its conclusion was specific only to Chan and to his circumstances. Otherwise, this Court would have used generic language. Instead of the definite article "the," it could have used the indefinite article "a" in that same sentence: "no presumption can be indulged in favor of <b><i><u>a</u></i></b> claimant of Philippine citizenship." In the alternative, it could have used other words that would show absolute or sweeping application, for instance: "no presumption can be indulged in favor of <b><i><u>any/every</u></i></b> claimant of Philippine citizenship;" or, "no presumption can be indulged in favor of <b><i><u>all</u></i></b> claimants of Philippine citizenship."<br><br>The factual backdrop of <i>Paa</i> is markedly different from those of this case. Its statements, therefore, are inappropriate precedents for this case. In <i>Paa</i>, clear evidence was adduced showing that respondent Quintin Chan was registered as an alien with the Bureau of Immigration. His father was likewise registered as an alien. These pieces of evidence already indubitably establish foreign citizenship and shut the door to any presumption. In contrast, petitioner in this case presents no proof, direct or circumstantial, of private respondent's or of both of her parents' foreign citizenship.<br><br><i>Go</i> cited <i>Paa</i>, taking the same quoted portion but revising it to make it appear that the same pronouncement was generally applicable:<br><blockquote>It is incumbent upon <b><i>one</i></b> who claims Philippine citizenship to prove to the satisfaction of the court that he is really a Filipino. No presumption can be indulged hi favor of the claimant of Philippine citizenship, and any doubt regarding citizenship must be resolved in favor of the state.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[210]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, <i>Paa</i>'s essential and pivotal nuance was lost in proverbial translation. In any case, Go was decided by this Court sitting in Division. It cannot overturn <i>Tecson</i>, which was decided by this Court sitting En Banc. Likewise, <i>Go</i>'s factual and even procedural backdrops are different from those of this case. <i>Go</i> involved the deportation of an allegedly illegal and undesirable alien, not an election controversy. In <i>Go</i>, copies of birth certificates unequivocally showing the Chinese citizenship of Go and of his siblings were adduced.<br><br><center><b>VII.

Further, this presumption is validated by contemporaneous construction that considers related legislative enactments, executive and administrative actions, and international instruments.<br><br>Article II, Section 13 and Article XV, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution require the state to enhance children's well-being and to project them from conditions prejudicial to or that may undermine their development.

Thus, by definition, they are natural-born citizens.<br><br>Specifically regarding private respondent, several acts of executive organs have recognized her natural-born status. This status was never questioned throughout her life; that is, until circumstances made it appear that she was a viable candidate for President of the Philippines. Until this, as well as the proceedings in the related case of <i>Poe-Llamanzares</i>, private respondent's natural-born status has been affirmed and reaffirmed through various official public acts.<br><br>First, private respondent was issued a foundling certificate and benefitted from the domestic adoption process.

Natural-born Philippine citizens who, after Republic Act 9225 took effect, are naturalized in foreign countries "<b><i>retain</i></b>," that is, keep, their Philippine citizenship, although the effectivity of this retention and the ability to exercise the rights and capacities attendant to this status are subject to certain solemnities (i.e., oath of allegiance and other requirements for specific rights and/or acts, as enumerated in Section 5). On the other hand, those who became citizens of another country before the effectivity of Republic Act No. 9225 "<b><i>reacquire</i></b>" their Philippine citizenship and may exercise attendant rights and capacities, also upon compliance with certain solemnities. Read in conjunction with Section 2's declaration of a policy of immutability, this reacquisition is not a mere restoration that leaves a vacuum in the intervening period.

It is wrong to postulate that compliance with Republic Act No. 9225 signifies the performance of acts to perfect citizenship.<br><br>To do so is to completely disregard the unequivocal policy of permanence and immutability as articulated in Section 2 of Republic Act No. 9225 and as illuminated in jurisprudence. It is to erroneously assume that a natural-born Filipino citizen's naturalization elsewhere is an irreversible termination of his or her natural-born status.<br><br>To belabor the point, those who take the Oath of Allegiance under Section 3 of Republic Act No. 9225 reacquire natural-born citizenship. The prefix "re" signifies reference to the preceding state of affairs. It is to this status quo ante that one returns. "Re"-acquiring can only mean a reversion to "the way things were." Had Republic Act No. 9225 intended to mean the investiture of an entirely new status, it should not have used a word such as "reacquire." Republic Act No. 9225, therefore, does not operate to make new citizens whose citizenship commences only from the moment of compliance with its requirements.<br><br><i>Bengson</i>, speaking on the analogous situation of repatriation, ruled that repatriation involves the restoration of former status or the recovery of one's original nationality:<br><blockquote>Moreover, repatriation results in the recovery of the original nationality. This means that a naturalized Filipino who lost his citizenship will be restored to his prior status as a naturalized Filipino citizen. On the other hand, <i>if he was originally a natural-born citizen before he lost his Philippine citizenship, he will be restored to his former status as a natural-born Filipino</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[263]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Although Bengson was decided while Commonwealth Act No. 63 was in force, its ruling is in keeping with Republic Act No. 9225 's policy of permanence and immutablity: "all Philippine citizens of another country shall be deemed not to have lost their Philippine citizenship."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[264]</sup> In <i>Bengson</i>'s words, the once naturalized citizen is "restored" or brought back to his or her natural-<b><i>born</i></b> status. There may have been an interruption in the recognition of this status, as, in the interim, he or she was naturalized elsewhere, but the restoration of natural-born status expurgates this intervening fact. Thus, he or she does not become a Philippine citizen only from the point of restoration and moving forward. He or she is recognized, <b><i>de jure</i></b>, as a Philippine citizen from birth, although the intervening fact may have consequences de facto.<br><br>Republic Act No. 9225 may involve extended processes not limited to taking the Oath of Allegiance and requiring compliance with additional solemnities, but these are for facilitating the enjoyment of other incidents to citizenship, not for effecting the reacquisition of natural-born citizenship itself. Therefore, it is markedly different from naturalization as there is no singular, extended process with which the former natural-born citizen must comply.<br><br><center><b>IX</b><br></center><br>To hold, as petitioner suggests, that private respondent is stateless<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[265]</sup> is not only to set a dangerous and callous precedent.

Election contests consist of eitheir an election protest or a quo warranto which, although two distinct remedies, would have one objective in view, i.e. to dislodge the whining candidate from office.

A <i>quo warranto</i> proceeding is generally defined as being an action against a person who usurps, intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises a public office. In such context, the election contest can only contemplate a post-election <i>scenario</i>. In Rule 14, only a registered candidate who would have received either the second or third highest number of votes could file an election protest. This rule again presupposes a post-election <i>scenario</i>.<br><br>"It is fair to conclude that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court [sitting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal], defined by Section 4, paragraph 7, of the 1987 Constitution, would not include cases directly brought before it, questioning the qualifications of a candidate for the presidency or vice-presidency before the elections are held."<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[115]</sup> <i>Lazatin v.

In the [Commission on Elections'] view (expressly voiced out by the Division and fully concurred in by the En Banc), the Maligaya Feedmill building could not have been Mitra's residence because it is cold and utterly devoid of any indication of Mitra's personality and that it lacks loving attention and details inherent in every home to make it one's residence. This was the main reason that the [Commission on Elections] relied upon for its conclusion.<br><br>"Such assessment, in our view, based on the interior design and furnishings of a dwelling as showm by and examined only through photographs, is far from reasonable; the [Commission on Elections] thereby determined the fitness of a dwelling as a person's residence based solely on very personal and subjective assessment standards when the law is replete with standards that can be used.

David to show that respondent lacked the qualifications of a Senator. However, upon respondent's voluntary admission that she was a foundling, the burden of evidence was shifted to her. In his Dissenting Opinion before the SET, Associate Justice Arturo D. Brion pertinently explains:<br><blockquote>[I]n <i>quo warranto</i>, the petitioner who challenges the respondent's qualification to office carries the burden of proving, by preponderance of evidence, the facts constituting the disqualification. Upon such proof, the burden shifts to the respondent who must now present opposing evidence constituting his or her defense or establishing his or her affirmative defense.<br><br>x x x x<br><br>In the present case, the petitioner has alleged that the respondent is a foundling.

With the admission, the fact necessary to establish the petitioner's claim is considered established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>In this case, respondent failed to present competent and sufficient evidence to prove her blood relation to a Filipino parent which is necessary to determine natural-born citizenship pursuant to the <i>jus sanguinis</i> principle. This notwithstanding, the <i>ponencia</i> concludes that the following circumstances are substantial evidence justifying the inference that respondent's biological parents are Filipino:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>(<i>a</i>) <b>Circumstances of abandonment:</b> Respondent was found as a newborn infant outside the Parish Church of Jaro, Iloilo on September 3, 1968. In 1968, Iloilo, as did most if not all other Philippine provinces, had a predominantly Filipino population. In 1968, there was also no international airport in Jaro, Iloilo.<br><br>(<i>b</i>) <b>Physical features:</b> She is described as having "brown almond-shaped eyes, a low nasal bridge, straight black hair and an oval-shaped face."

Commission on Elections</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> former Solicitor General Florin T. Hilbay underscored how it was statistically more probable that respondent was born a Filipino citizen, submitting that out of 900,165 recorded births in the Philippines in 1968, over 1,595 or 0.18% were foreigners. This translates to, roughly, a 99.8% probability that respondent was born a Filipino citizen.<br><br>However, the foregoing "circumstantial evidence" do not adequately prove the determination sought to be established: that is, whether or not respondent can trace her parentage to a Filipino citizen. These circumstances can be easily debunked by contrary but likewise rationally-sounding suppositions. Case law holds that "[m]atters dealing with qualifications for public elective office must be strictly complied with."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The proof to hurdle a substantial challenge against a candidate's qualifications must therefore be solid. This Court cannot make a definitive pronouncement on a candidate's citizenship when there is a looming possibility that he/she is not Filipino. The circumstances surrounding respondent's abandonment (both as to the milieu of time and place), as well as her physical characteristics, hardly assuage this possibility. By parity of reasoning, they do not prove that she was born to a Filipino: her abandonment in the Philippines is just a restatement of her foundling status, while her physical features only tend to prove that her parents likely had Filipino features and yet it remains uncertain if their citizenship was Filipino. More so, the statistics cited - assuming the same to be true - do not account for all births but only of those recorded. To my mind, it is uncertain how "encompassing" was the Philippine's civil registration system at that time - in 1968 - to be able to conclude that those statistics logically reflect a credible and representative sample size. And even assuming it to be so, 1,595 were reflected as foreigners, rendering it factually possible that respondent belonged to this class. Ultimately, the opposition against respondent's natural-born citizenship claim is simple but striking: the fact that her parents are unknown directly puts into question her Filipino citizenship because she has no <i>prima facie</i> link to a Filipino parent from which she could have traced her Filipino citizenship.<br><br>Absent satisfactory proof establishing any blood relation to a Filipino parent, and without any mention in the 1935 Constitution that foundlings are considered or even presumed to be Filipino citizens at birth, it is my view that, under the auspices of the 1935 Constitution, respondent could not be considered a natural-born Filipino citizen. As worded, the provisions of Section 1, Article IV of the 1935 Constitution are clear, direct, and unambiguous. This Court should therefore apply the statutory construction principles of <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i> and <i>verba legis non est recedendum</i>. Consequently, it would be unnecessary to resort to the constitutional deliberations or to examine the underlying intent of the framers of the 1935 Constitution. In <i>Civil Liberties Union v. The Executive Secretary</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> this Court remarked that:<br><blockquote>Debates in the constitutional convention "are of value <b>as showing the views of the individual members, and as indicating the reasons for their votes</b>, but they give us no light as to the views of the large majority who did not talk, much less of the mass of our fellow citizens whose votes at the polls gave that instrument the force of fundamental law. <b><u>We think it [is] safer to construe the constitution from what appears upon its face.</u></b>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>In fact, it should be pointed out that the 1935 Constitution, as it was adopted in its final form, <b>never carried over any proposed provision on foundlings being considered or presumed to be Filipino citizens</b>. Its final exclusion is therefore indicative of the framers' prevailing intent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> The <i>ponencia</i>'s theorized "harmonization"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> of the constitutional provisions on citizenship with the provisions on the promotion of children's well-being,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> equal protection,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> public service,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and even human dignity and human rights<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> appears to be a tailor-fitted advocacy for allowing foundlings to run for key national posts that, quite frankly, stretches the import of these distinct provisions to the separate and unique matter of citizenship. There seems to be an evident logical problem with the argument that since the Constitution protects its children, and respects human rights and equality to run for office, then <i>ergo</i>, foundlings should be presumed to be natural-born. It appears that this approach aims to collate all possibly related constitutional text, albeit far-flung, just to divine a presumption when unfortunately, there is none.<br><br>Moreover, as Senior Associate Justice Antonio T. Carpio (Justice Carpio) aptly pointed out in his Dissenting Opinion before the SET, it would be insensible to suppose that the framers of the 1935 Constitution intended that foundlings be considered as natural-born citizens:<br><blockquote>[N]one of the framers of the 1935 Constitution mentioned the term natural-born in relation to the citizenship of foundlings. Again, under the 1935 Constitution, only those whose fathers were Filipino citizens were considered natural-born citizens. Those who were born of Filipino mothers and alien fathers were still required to elect Philippine citizenship, preventing them from being natural-born citizens. If, as respondent would like us to believe, the framers intended that foundlings be considered natural-born Filipino citizens, this would create an absurd situation where a child with unknown parentage would be placed in a better position than child whose mother is actually known to be a Filipino citizen. The framers of the 1935 Constitution could not have intended to create such absurdity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>While the predicament of foundlings of having their parents unknown would seem to entail the difficult, if not impossible, task of proving their Filipino parentage, the current state of the law which requires evidence of blood relation to a Filipino parent to establish natural-born citizenship under the <i>jus sanguinis</i> principle must be respected at all costs. This is not to say that the position of foundlings in relation to their endeavors for high public offices has been overlooked in this discourse. Rather, the correction of this seeming "misfortune" - as the <i>ponencia</i> would suppose<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> - lies in legislative revision, not judicial supplication. For surely, it is not for this Court to step in and supply additional meaning when clarity is evoked in the citizenship provisions of the Constitution.<br><br>For another, I would also like to express my reservations on the <i>ponencia</i>'s reliance on <i>Tecson v. Commission on Elections</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (<i>Tecson</i>) wherein this Court resolved that respondent's adoptive father, Ronald Allan Kelley Poe, more popularly known as Fernando Poe Jr. (FPJ), was qualified to run for the presidential post during the 2004 National Elections which, according to the <i>ponencia</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> was based on the basis of "presumptions" that proved his status as a natural-born citizen. In that case, the identity of FPJ's parents, Allan F. Poe and Bessie Kelley, was never questioned. More importantly, there was direct documentary evidence to trace Allan F. Poe's parentage to Lorenzo Pou, whose death certificate identified him to be a Filipino. Thus, by that direct proof alone, there was a substantial trace of Allan F. Poe's parentage to a Filipino (Lorenzo Pou), which in turn, allowed the substantial tracing of FPJ's parentage to a Filipino (Allan F. Poe). As such, FPJ was declared qualified to run for the presidential post in 2004. The Court further explained that while the birth certificate of FPJ's grandfather, Lorenzo Pou, was not presented, it could be assumed that the latter was born in 1870 while the Philippines was still a colony of Spain. This inference was drawn from the fact that Lorezo Pou died at the age of 84 years old in 1954. Thus, absent any evidence to the contrary, and against petitioner therein's bare allegation, Lorenzo Pou was deemed to be a resident of the Philippines and hence, a Filipino citizen by operation of the Philippine Organic Act of 1902,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> on the premise that the place of residence of a person at the time of his death was also his residence before his death. In any event, the certified true copy of the original death certificate of Lorenzo Pou reflecting that he was a Filipino citizen was enough basis to trace FPJ's Filipino natural-born citizenship. As the Court aptly cited, according to Section 44, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, "entries in official records made in the performance of his duty by a public officer of the Philippines, or by a person in the performance of a duty specially enjoined by law, are <b><i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts therein stated</b>."<br><br>In contrast, by her admission as a foundling whose parents are unknown, and without presenting any other evidence to show any substantial tracing of Filipino parentage similar to FPJ, the legal and factual nuances of respondent's case should be treated differently. Accordingly, <i>Tecson</i> provides no authoritative jurisprudential anchorage to this case.<br><br>Finally, it bears stressing that they <i>jus sanguinis</i> principle of citizenship established in the 1935 Constitution was subsequently carried over and adopted in the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Thus, notwithstanding the existence of any treaty or generally accepted principle of international law which purportedly evince that foundlings are accorded natural-born citizenship in the State in which they are found, the same, nonetheless, could not be given effect as it would contravene the Constitution. To recall, should international law be adopted in this jurisdiction, it would only form part of the sphere of domestic law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Being relegated to the same level as domestic laws, they could not modify or alter, much less prevail, over the express mandate of the Constitution. In this relation, I deem it fitting to echo the point made by Associate Justice Teresita J. Leonardo-De Castro, likewise in her Separate Opinion before the SET:<br><blockquote>Citizenship is not automatically conferred under the international conventions cited but will entail an affirmative action of the State, by a national law or legislative enactment, so that the nature of citizenship, if ever acquired pursuant thereto, is citizenship by naturalization. There must be a law by which citizenship can be acquired. By no means can this citizenship be considered that of a natural-born character under the principle of <i>jus sanguinis</i> in the Philippine Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></blockquote>For all these reasons, I unfortunately depart from the ruling of the majority and perforce submit that the SET committed grave abuse of discretion in declaring respondent a natural-born citizen. The majority ruling runs afoul of and even distorts the plain language of the Constitution which firmly and consistently follows the <i>jus sanguinis</i> principle. In the final analysis, since respondent has not presented any competent and sufficient evidence to prove her blood relation to a Filipino parent in these proceedings, she should not be deemed to be a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, which, thus, renders the instant petition meritorious. Nonetheless, it is important to point out that respondent is not precluded from later on proving her natural-born citizenship through such necessary evidence in the appropriate proceeding therefor, considering that a decision determining natural-born citizenship never becomes final.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> I reach these conclusions solely under the peculiar auspices of this case and through nothing but my honest and conscientious assessment of the facts parallel to the applicable legal principles.
