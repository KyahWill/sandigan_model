				<BR><STRONG>SERENO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari</em> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court on the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) affirming the assailed Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). DOLE allowed the conduct of certification election among the rank-and-file employees of Super Lamination Services (Super Lamination), Express Lamination Services, Inc. (Express Lamination), and Express Coat Enterprises, lnc. (Express Coat). <p align="center"><strong> THE ANTECEDENT FACTS </strong> </p><p> Petitioner Erson Ang Lee (petitioner), through Super Lamination, is a duly registered entity principally engaged in the business of providing lamination services to the general public. Respondent Samahan ng mga Manggagawa ng Super Lamination Services (Union A) is a legitimate labor organization, which is also a local chapter affiliate of the National Federation of Labor Unions - Kilusang Mayo Uno.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> It appears that Super Lamination is a sole proprietorship under petitioner's name,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> while Express Lamination and Express Coat are duly incorporated entities separately registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p><p> On 7 March 2008, Union A filed a Petition for Certification Election<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> to represent all the rank-and-file employees of Super Lamination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p><p> Notably, on the same date, Express Lamination Workers' Union (Union B) also filed a Petition for Certification Election to represent all the rank-and-file employees of Express Lamination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p><p> Also on the same date, the Samahan ng mga Manggagawa ng Express Coat Enterprises, Inc. (Union C) filed a Petition for Certification Election to represent the rank-and-file employees of Express Coat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p><p> Super Lamination, Express Lamination, and Express Coat, all represented by one counsel, separately claimed in their Comments and Motions to Dismiss that the petitions must be dismissed on the same ground — lack of employer-employee relationship between these establishments and the bargaining units that Unions A, B, and C seek to represent as well as these unions' respective members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Super Lamination, in its Motion, posited that a majority of the persons who were enumerated in the list of members and officers of Union A were not its employees, but were employed by either Express Lamination or Express Coat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Interestingly, both Express Lamination and Express Coat, in turn, maintained the same argument that a majority of those who had assented to the Petition for Certification Election were not employees of either company, but of one of the two other companies involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p><p> All three Petitions for Certification Election of the Unions were denied. On 21 May 2008, an Order was issued by DOLE National Capital Region (NCR) Med-Arbiter Michael Angelo Parado denying the respective petitions of Unions B and C on the ground that there was no existing employer-employee relationship between the members of the unions and the companies concerned. On 23 May 2008, DOLE NCR Med-Arbiter Alma Magdaraog-Alba also denied the petition of respondent Union A on the same ground.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p><p> The three unions filed their respective appeals before the Office of the DOLE Secretary, which consolidated the appeal because the involved companies alternately referred to one another as the employer of the members of the bargaining units sought to be represented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The unions argued that their petitions should have been allowed considering that the companies involved were unorganized, and that the employers had no concomitant right to oppose the petitions. They also claimed that while the questioned employees might have been assigned to perform work at the other companies, they were all under one management's direct control and supervision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> </p><p> DOLE, through Undersecretary Romeo C. Lagman, rendered the assailed Decision, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows: </p><blockquote> <p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, premises considered, the appeals filed by Express Lamination Workers Union (ELWU-NAFLU-KMU), Samahang Manggagawa ng Express Coat Enterprises, Inc. (SMEC-NAFLU-KMU) and Samahang Manggagawa ng Super Lamination Services (SMSLS­ NAFLU-KMU) are hereby <strong>GRANTED</strong> and the Orders dated 21 May 2008 of DOLE-NCR Mediator-Arbiter Michael Angelo T. Parado are hereby<strong> REVERSED</strong> <strong>and SET ASIDE</strong>. The Order dated 23 May 2008 of DOLE NCR Mediator-Arbiter Alma E. Magdaraog-Alba is likewise <strong>REVERSED and SET ASIDE</strong>. </p> <p> Accordingly, let the entire records of this be remanded to the regional office of origin for the immediate conduct of certification election among the rank-and-file employees of Express Lamination Services, Inc., Super Lamination Services and Express Coat Enterprises Inc., after the conduct of pre-election conference/s, with the following as choices; </p> <blockquote> <p> 1. Express Lamination Workers Union-NAFLU-KMU; </p> <p>2. Samahan ng mga Manggagawa ng Super Lamination Services­ NAFLU-KMU; </p> <p>3. Samahang ng mga Manggagawa ng Express Coat Enterprises, Inc.-NAFLU-KMU; and </p> <p>4. "No Union." </p> </blockquote> <p> The employer/s and/or contending union(s) are hereby directed to submit to the Regional Office of origin, within ten (10) days from receipt of this Decision, a certified list of employees in the bargaining unit or the payrolls covering the members of the bargaining unit for the last three (3) months prior to the issuance of the Decision. </p> <p> SO DECIDED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>(Emphases in the original) </p> </blockquote> <p> DOLE found that Super Lamination, Express Lamination, and Express Coat were sister companies that had a common human resource department responsible for hiring and disciplining the employees of the three companies. The same department was found to have also given them daily instructions on how to go about their work and where to report for work. It also found that the three companies involved constantly rotated their workers, and that the latter's identification cards had only one signatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> </p><p> To DOLE, these circumstances showed that the companies were engaged in a work-pooling scheme, in light of which they might be considered as one and the same entity for the purpose of determining the appropriate bargaining unit in a certification election.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> DOLE applied the concept of multi-employer bargaining under Sections 5 and 6 of DOLE Department Order 40-03, Series of 2003. Under that concept, the creation of a single bargaining unit for the rank-and-file employees of all three companies was not implausible and was justified under the given circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Thus, it considered these rank-and-file employees as one bargaining unit and ordered the conduct of a certification election as uniformly prayed for by the three unions. </p><p> Aggrieved, petitioner instituted an appeal before the CA, which denied his Petition and affirmed the Decision of DOLE. It sided with DOLE in finding that Super Lamination, Express Lamination, and Express Coat were sister companies that had adopted a work-pooling scheme. Therefore, it held that DOLE had correctly applied the concept of multi-employer bargaining in finding that the three companies could be considered as the same entity, and their rank-and-file employees as comprising one bargaining unit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the CA Decision, but the motion was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Therefore, he now comes to this Court through the present Petition. </p><p align="center"><strong> ISSUES </strong> </p><p> From the established facts and arguments, we cull the issues as follows: </p><ol><li> Whether the application of the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is warranted <br><br> </li><li> Whether the rank-and-file employees of Super Lamination, Express Lamination, and Express Coat constitute an appropriate bargaining unit </li></ol> <p align="center"><strong> THE COURT'S RULING </strong> </p><p><em> We deny the petition. </em> </p><p><strong><em> An application of the doctrine of <br> piercing the corporate veil is <br> warranted. </em></strong> </p><p> Petitioner argues that separate corporations cannot be treated as a single bargaining unit even if their businesses are related,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> as these companies are indubitably distinct entities with separate juridical personalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Hence, the employees of one corporation cannot be allowed to vote in the certification election of another corporation, lest the above­mentioned rule be violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p><p> Petitioner's argument, while correct, is a general rule. This Court has time and again disregarded separate juridical personalities under the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil. It has done so in cases where a separate legal entity is used to defeat public convenience, justify wrong, protect fraud, or defend crime, among other grounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In any of these situations, the law will regard it as an association of persons or, in case of two corporations, merge them into one.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> </p><p> A settled formulation of the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is that when two business enterprises are owned, conducted, and controlled by the same parties, both law and equity will, when necessary to protect the rights of third parties, disregard the legal fiction that these two entities are distinct and treat them as identical or as one and the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </p><p> This formulation has been applied by this Court to cases in which the laborer has been put in a disadvantageous position as a result of the separate juridical personalities of the employers involved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Pursuant to veil-piercing, we have held two corporations jointly and severally liable for an employee's back wages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> We also considered a corporation and its separately­ incorporated branches as one and the same for purposes of finding the corporation guilty of illegal dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> These rulings were made pursuant to the fundamental doctrine that the corporate fiction should not be used as a subterfuge to commit injustice and circumvent labor laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </p><p> Here, a certification election was ordered to be held for all the rank-and-file employees of Super Lamination, Express Lamination, and Express Coat. The three companies were supposedly distinct entities based on the fact that Super Lamination is a sole proprietorship while Express Lamination and Express Coat were separately registered with the SEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> The directive was therefore, in effect, a piercing of the separate juridical personalities of the corporations involved. We find the piercing to be proper and in accordance with the law as will be discussed below. </p><p> The following established facts show that Super Lamination, Express Lamination, and Express Coat are under the control and management of the same party — petitioner Ang Lee. In effect, the employees of these three companies have petitioner as their common employer, as shown by the following facts: </p><ol><li> Super Lamination, Express Lamination, and Express Coat were engaged in the same business of providing lamination services to the public as admitted by petitioner in his petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> <br><br> </li><li> The three establishments operated and hired employees through a common human resource department as found by DOLE in a clarificatory hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Though it was not clear which company the human resource department was officially attached to, petitioner admits in his petition that such department was<em> shared </em>by the three companies for purposes of convenience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> <br><br> </li><li> The workers of all three companies were constantly rotated and periodically assigned to Super Lamination or Express Lamination or Express Coat to perform the same or similar tasks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> This finding was further affirmed when petitioner admitted in his petition before us that the Super Lamination had entered into a work-pooling agreement with the two other companies and shared a number of their employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> <br><br> </li><li> DOLE found and the CA affirmed that the common human resource department imposed disciplinary sanctions and directed the daily performance of all the members of Unions A, B, and C.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> <br><br> </li><li> Super Lamination included in its payroll and SSS registration not just its own employees, but also the supposed employees of Express Lamination and Express Coat. This much was admitted by petitioner in his Motion to Dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> which was affirmed by the Med-Arbiter in the latter's Order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> <br><br> </li><li> Petitioner admitted that Super Lamination had issued and signed the identification cards of employees who were actually working for Express Lamination and Express Coat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> <br><br> </li><li> Super Lamination, Express Lamination, and Express Coat were represented by the same counsel who interposed the same arguments in their motions before the Med-Arbiters and DOLE.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> </li></ol> <p> Further, we discern from the synchronized movements of petitioner and the two other companies an attempt to frustrate or defeat the workers' right to collectively bargain through the shield of the corporations' separate juridical personalities. We make this finding on the basis of the motions to dismiss filed by the three companies. While similarly alleging the absence of an employer-employee relationship, they alternately referred to one another as the employer of the members of the bargaining units sought to be represented respectively by the unions. This fact was affirmed by the Med-Arbiters' Orders finding that indeed, the supposed employees of each establishment were found to be alternately the employees of either of the two other companies as well. This was precisely the reason why DOLE consolidated the appeals filed by Unions A, B, and C.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </p><p> Due to the finger-pointing by the three companies at one another, the petitions were dismissed. As a result, the three unions were not able to proceed with the conduct of the certification election. This also caused confusion among the employees as to who their real employer is, as Union A claims in its Comment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> </p><p> We hold that if we allow petitioner and the two other companies to continue obstructing the holding of the election in this manner, their employees and their respective unions will never have a chance to choose their bargaining representative. We take note that all three establishments were unorganized. That is, no union therein was ever duly recognized or certified as a bargaining representative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> </p><p> Therefore, it is only proper that, in order to safeguard the right of the workers and Unions A, B, and C to engage in collective bargaining, the corporate veil of Express Lamination and Express Coat must be pierced. The separate existence of Super Lamination, Express Lamination, and Express Coat must be disregarded. In effect, we affirm the lower tribunals in ruling that these companies must be treated as one and the same unit for purposes of holding a certification election. </p><p> Petitioner has cited <em>Diatagon Labor Federation Local v. Ople</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> and<em> Indophil Textile Mill Worker Union v. Calica</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> in which this Court refused to treat separate corporations as a single bargaining unit. Those cases, however, are not substantially identical with this case and would not warrant their application herein. Unlike in the instant case, the corporations involved were found to be completely independent or were not involved in any act that frustrated the laborers' rights. </p><p> In <em>Diatagon</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> we refused to include the 236 employees of Georgia Pacific International Corporation in the bargaining unit of the employees of Liangga Bay Logging Co., Inc. This Court's refusal was in light of the fact that the two corporations were indubitably distinct entities with separate corporate identities and origins. Moreover, there was no discernible attempt to frustrate any of their labor-related rights, as the only conflict was over which bargaining unit they belonged to. </p><p> In<em> Indophil</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> this Court refused to pierce the corporate veil of Indophil Textile Mill and Indophil Acrylic Manufacturing. We found that the creation of Indophil Acrylic was not a device to evade the application of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between petitioner union and Indophil Textile Mill. This Court further found that despite the similarity in their business operations, the separate personalities of the two corporations were maintained and were not used for any of the purposes specified under the law that would warrant piercing. It is also apparent in this case that the workers' rights were not being hampered by the employers concerned, as the only issue between them was the extent of the subject CBA's application. </p><p> In this case, not only were Super Lamination, Express Lamination, and Express Coat found to be under the control of petitioner, but there was also a discernible attempt to disregard the workers' and unions' right to collective bargaining. </p><p> The foregoing considered, we find no error in the CA's affirmance of the DOLE directive. We affirm DOLE's application by analogy of the concept of multi-employer bargaining to justify its Decision to treat the three companies as one. While the multi-employer bargaining mechanism is relatively new and purely optional under Department Order No. 40-03, it illustrates the State's policy to promote the primacy of free and responsible exercise of the right to collective bargaining.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> The existence of this mechanism in our labor laws affirm DOLE's conclusion that its treatment of the employees of the three companies herein as a single bargaining unit is neither impossible nor prohibited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> It is justified under the circumstances discussed above. </p><p> Besides, it is an established rule that factual findings of labor officials, who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded by the courts not only respect but even finality when supported by substantial evidence; <em>i.e</em>., that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> </p><p><em><strong> The bargaining unit of the rank-and­ <br> file employees of the three companies<br> is appropriate. </strong></em> </p><p> Petitioner argues that there is no showing that the rank-and-file employees of the three companies would constitute an appropriate bargaining unit on account of the latter's different geographical locations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> This contention lacks merit. The basic test for determining the appropriate bargaining unit is the application of a standard whereby a unit is deemed appropriate if it affects a grouping of employees who have substantial, mutual interests in wages, hours, working conditions, and other subjects of collective bargaining.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> We have ruled that geographical location can be completely disregarded if the communal or mutual interests of the employees are not sacrificed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> </p><p> In the present case, there was communal interest among the rank-and-file employees of the three companies based on the finding that they were constantly rotated to all three companies, and that they performed the same or similar duties whenever rotated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> Therefore, aside from geographical location, their employment status and working conditions were so substantially similar as to justify a conclusion that they shared a community of interest. This finding is consistent with the policy in favor of a single-employer unit, unless the circumstances require otherwise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> The more solid the employees are, the stronger is their bargaining capacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> </p><p> As correctly observed by the CA and DOLE, while there is no prohibition on the mere act of engaging in a work-pooling scheme as sister companies, that act will not be tolerated, and the sister companies' separate juridical personalities will be disregarded, if they use that scheme to defeat the workers' right to collective bargaining. The employees' right to collectively bargain with their employers is necessary to promote harmonious labor-management relations in the interest of sound and stable industrial peace.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> </p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari</em> under Rule 45 is <strong>DENIED</strong> for lack of merit.

A union's right to file a petition for certification election is founded on the existence of an employer-employee relationship. The workers whom the union intends to represent must therefore be employees of the enterprise in which an election is sought. (C.A. Azucena, Jr., THE LABOR CODE WITH COMMENTS AND CASES, 461 [Eighth Edition, 2013]).
