Its version of the case is as follows:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li>On the night of June 6, 1994, a dance was taking place at the barangay plaza of Barangay Datag, Municipality of Caramoran, Catanduanes. Alberto Mariano, a barangay <i>tanod</i> in said barangay was assigned the task of seeing to it that anybody who entered the gate to the dance hall at the plaza must have a ribbon (pp. 4-5, tsn, Mariano, July 11, 1995; pp. 6-7, tsn, Lopez, July 10, 1995).<br><br></li><li>Appellant Allan Bulan came to the dance and entered the gate without the required ribbon. Alberto Mariano followed appellant Allan Bulan into the dance hall and asked him why he entered the gate without a ribbon. Instead of answering Alberto's question, Allan boxed him on the head. Accused Estemson Bulan, Allan's brother, who had entered the dance hall, likewise, boxed Alberto. Estemson then held Alberto, while Allan boxed the latter on the chest. Perlita Mariano, Alberto's sister, who was present at the dance, embraced her brother as Allan and Estemson unceasingly pummeled him (pp. 5-7, Mariano, July 11, 1995; pp. 22-25, tsn, Lopez, July 10, 1995; pp. 5-6, Decision).<br><br></li><li>The other barangay <i>tanods</i> present at the dance, Ceferino Ceballo and Juan Boribor, and a barangay <i>kagawad</i>, Dante Ereso, stopped Allan and Estemson from further beating Alberto. After being pacified by the barangay officials, Allan and Estemson left the dance hall. Alberto, on the other hand, went back to where he originally stood to resume his duty. His sister Perlita stood beside him (p. 7, tsn, Mariano, July 11, 1995; p. 26, tsn, Lopez, July 10, 1995).<br><br></li><li>One Edwin Solo, a policeman, suddenly came into the dance hall and dragged Alberto into the street just outside the entrance. Perlita embraced Alberto as he was dragged outside the barangay plaza. Appellants Jose Bulan and Allan Bulan were waiting for Alberto and immediately held the latter by his shoulders. Jose held Alberto's right shoulder while Allan held his left shoulder. Perlita was still embracing her brother but she was pulled away from him (pp. 8-9 and 25, tsn, Mariano, July 11, 1995; pp. 27-28 and 31-33, tsn, Lopez, July 10, 1995).<br><br></li><li>Accused Estemson Bulan suddenly appeared behind Alberto and stabbed him twice in the back with a small bolo. Perlita screamed for help. However, despite the fact that there were people at the entrance gate, nobody came to help Alberto and Perlita. After stabbing Alberto, Estemson immediately escaped, while Jose and Allan dragged the fatally wounded Alberto away from the barangay plaza to the store of Valentin Talion, which was forty meters away from the scene of the stabbing. They dropped Alberto face down on the ground in front of Valentin's store and then left, running towards the direction of [the] barangay plaza (pp. 10-11, tsn, Mariano, July 11, 1995; pp. 18 and 33-37, tsn, Lopez, July 10, 1995).<br><br></li><li>Perlita, who followed Jose and Allan as they dragged her brother, kept on shouting for help but nobody came to help them. After Jose and Allan left, Perlita returned to the barangay plaza and sought help from her relatives who were at the dance. She, likewise, sought the help of the barangay officials present and informed them that Alberto was already dead (pp. 12-13, tsn, Mariano, July 11, 1995).<br><br></li><li>Minutes later, Nelson Rubio, a policeman, went to the place where Alberto lay. When the policeman tried to lift Alberto, the small bolo which was used in stabbing Alberto and which remained embedded in his back, fell to the ground. The Municipal Mayor of Caramoran and Dr. Rico Lareza, a doctor and the Chief of the Caramoran Municipal Hospital, also went to the site where Alberto lay. The doctor then requested the mayor to bring Alberto's body to the hospital for a post-mortem examination (pp. 13-14, tsn, Mariano, July 11, 1995; pp. 37-38, tsn, Lopez, July 10, 1995; pp. 4-5, tsn, Lareza, May 22, 1995).<br><br></li><li>On the same night, at around 11:30, Dr. Lareza examined Alberto and found that his body bore the following wounds and injuries:<br><blockquote>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Stab wound, 6 cms. in length and 13 cms. in depth, located at back of the victim at the level of the fifth intercostals space of the right middle back, penetrating towards the heart;<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Stab wound, 3.5 cms. in length and 11 cms. in depth, located on the left side of the back of the victim, directed upward towards the scapular bone area from the left middle back;<br><br>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Linear hematoma, 4.5 cms. in length, located at the right side of the neck, lateral aspect;<br><br>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple abrasions located on the left third of the left little finger;<br><br>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple abrasions located at the back middle part of the left index finger; and<br><br>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple abrasions located on the middle third of the right lower arm. (pp. 7-9, tsn, Lareza, May 22, 1995)<br></blockquote></li><li>According to Dr. Lareza, "(t)he most fatal wound is wound No. 1" (p. 9, tsn, Lareza, May 22, 1995) and that Alberto Mariano died of Cardio-Respiratory Arrest due to a stab wound penetrating towards the heart (<u><i>vide</i></u>, pp. 10-11, tsn, Lareza, May 22, 1995; pp. 20-21, Record).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote><b><center>The Case for the Appellants<br></center><br></b>Jose, a businessman from Datag East, Caramoran, Catanduanes, denied the charge. He testified that on the night of June 6, 1994, he was with Mayor Idanan of Caramoran and the latter's son-in-law Ely Ty. He was with them from 10:00 p.m. onwards and never left their company; hence, had no inkling that Alberto had been stabbed near the gate of the dance hall.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> He further alleged that he and his companions were drinking around a table and left the plaza only when a commotion ensued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> He found out that he had been charged with murder only on June 17, 1994, when policemen informed him that the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Caramoran had issued a warrant for his arrest. He, likewise, had no knowledge that Alberto had been manhandled by his sons, and that Estemson was the one who stabbed the victim. He admitted having received the warrant of arrest issued against him by the MTC on June 17, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> At the police station, he was told that he would be allowed to get out of jail if he could produce his son Estemson.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Allan, likewise, denied the charge. He admitted that he and Alberto had an altercation inside the dance hall; the latter had boxed him on the upper lip, and he retaliated by punching Alberto on the stomach.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> He claimed that he went home after the incident. As he was in front of the store of one Valentin Talion, Alberto and five to six companions accosted him, and gave him fist blows on the forehead and neck. He was also kicked on different parts of the body. Alberto even bit the upper part of his wrist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Allan averred that his injuries were evidenced by the medical certificate issued by Dr. Rico Lareza dated June 7, 1994. Afterwards, he fled to the house of his uncle Rudy Frondero. He told his father of the incident, but did not inform the police or barangay authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> He left for Legaspi City on June 10, 1994 and attended school as an irregular student at the Polytechnic College Foundation. Upon his mother's request, Allan accompanied her to Manila on June 27, 1994 to locate his brother Estemson. It was only then that he learned that his father was in jail for the death of Alberto. Allan also confirmed that he was arrested by NBI agents on August 7, 1994.<br><br>The appellants presented Mariano Ereso, a <i>barangay kagawad</i>, to corroborate the testimony of Jose Bulan. Another witness, Barangay Captain Magin Isuela, testified that he did not notice any commotion before Irma Cabrera's announcement at the dance floor that somebody had been stabbed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He was so shocked that he went home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Dr. Lareza testified that considering the wounds of the victim, the assailant could not have held the bolo with the tip of the blade pointed to the elbow, then lifted the arm holding the bolo to the level of the victim's head, before stabbing the latter on the right middle portion of the back. The doctor averred that in such a case, the trajectory of the wound would be downward and not horizontal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Moreover, Wound No. 2 could not have been inflicted by one who held the bolo above the victim's head, then thrusted it downwards.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The doctor also explained that the road from the plaza gate to the store was stony; if the victim had been dropped on the road, face and chest down, it was possible that he would have a blackeyed face or sustained abrasions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Considering that there was a pool of blood where the body was found, the victim could have been stabbed in front of the store.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Rudy Tuqueño testified that he was drinking beer near the gate but did not witness any stabbing incident. Apropriano Selsona, Jr. corroborated Tuqueño's testimony.<br><br>After trial, the trial court rendered judgment convicting the accused of murder as accomplices. The <i>fallo</i> of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, Jose and Allan Bulan, considering the Indeterminate Sentence Law in their favor, are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment ranging from ten (10) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i> as minimum to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months of <i>prision temporal</i> as maximum and to indemnify the heirs of the accused in the amount of P50,000.00. The period of their detention is credited in full in their favor in the service of their sentence.<br><br>The case as against Estemson Bulan who remains at large up to present is hereby placed in the archive till after his arrest.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>The trial court declared that there was no conspiracy between the appellants and Estemson.<br><br>On appeal to the CA, the appellate court rendered judgment on June 13, 2000 affirming the decision of the RTC, with the modification that the appellants and Estemson were guilty of murder as principals by indispensable cooperation. The appellate court declared that as gleaned from the evidence on record, the three of them conspired to kill the deceased. The <i>fallo</i> of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, pursuant to Article VIII, Section 5 of the 1987 Constitution which provides:<br><blockquote>"The Supreme Court shall have the following powers:<br><br><center>. . .<br></center><br>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; all criminal cases in which the penalty imposed is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or higher"<br></blockquote>and Par. 2, Section 13, Rule 124, Rules of Court, which states:<br><blockquote>"Whenever a Criminal Cases Division should be of the opinion that the penalty of death or life imprisonment be imposed in a case, the said Division after the discussion of the evidence and the law involved, shall render judgment imposing the penalty of death or <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or higher as circumstances warrant, refrain from entering judgment and forthwith certify the case and elevate the entire record thereof to the Supreme Court for review."<br></blockquote>and finding the accused-appellants, Jose Bulan and Allan Bulan, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of conspiring in murdering Alberto Mariano, as penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death. We hereby certify this case to the Honorable Supreme Court for final determination and proper action.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>On March 22, 2001, the Court resolved to accept the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The appellants opted not to file a supplemental brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>The appellants aver that the trial court committed the following errors:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION WITNESS MARIANO LOPEZ THAT WITHIN TWO METERS FROM THE GATE OF THE DATAG PLAZA WHERE A DANCE WAS BEING HELD, THE DECEASED ALBERTO MARIANO WAS STABBED BY ESTEMSON BULAN WHILE BEING HELD BY ACCUSED-APPELLANTS JOSE AND ALLAN BULAN WHO THEN ALLEGEDLY DRAGGED HIM FROM THE GATE TOWARDS THE STORE OF VALENTIN TALION FORTY METERS AWAY.<br><br></li><li>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION WITNESS PERLITA MARIANO THAT WITHIN TWO METERS FROM THE GATE OF THE DATAG PLAZA WHERE A DANCE WAS BEING HELD, THE DECEASED ALBERTO MARIANO WAS STABBED BY ESTEMSON BULAN WHILE BEING HELD BY ACCUSED-APPELLANTS JOSE AND ALLAN BULAN WHO THEN ALLEGEDLY DRAGGED HIM FROM THE GATE TOWARDS THE STORE OF VALENTIN TALION FORTY METERS AWAY.<br><br></li><li>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF ACCUSED ALLAN BULAN ALLEGING THAT HE WAS MAULED BY ALBERTO MARIANO AND COMPANIONS IN FRONT OF VALENTIN'S STORE AND DENYING THE ALLEGED HOLDING AND STABBING AT AND DRAGGING FROM THE GATE OF THE DATAG PLAZA.<br><br></li><li>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT JOSE BULAN DENYING THE ALLEGED HOLDING AND STABBING AT AND DRAGGING FROM THE DATAG PLAZA.<br><br></li><li>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>The appellants assert that the trial court erred in giving credence and probative weight to the testimony of Mariano and Perlita that Alberto was stabbed about two meters away from the gate of the plaza. They aver that the physical evidence on record even negates their testimony, as to where and how the victim was stabbed. They point out that the pool of blood was found in front of Talion's store, and not within the vicinity of the plaza gate where the dance was being held. Moreover, the deceased still had his slippers on, and his feet and face bore no abrasions or hematoma; according to the appellants, this proved that the victim was not dragged from near the plaza gate to the place near Talion's store as testified to by Mariano and Perlita. The appellants maintain that the absence of any reaction from those in the dance hall and the vendors near the gate negates their testimony – that Perlita saw her brother being stabbed near the plaza gate. Moreover, the testimony of Mariano Lopez and Perlita Mariano were replete with inconsistencies on material points; hence, are barren of probative weight. In contrast, the testimony of appellant Allan Bulan is consistent with and corroborated by his medical certificate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> as well as Dr. Lareza's post-mortem report.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>For its part, the OSG asserts that while Dr. Lareza's testimony on the trajectory of the wounds of the deceased did not jibe with that of Mariano, the undeniable fact is that the deceased was stabbed twice at the back. The OSG posits that Mariano was not expected to have a recorded memory of the incident. Moreover, the only evidence relied upon by the appellants to prove the absence of blood trails from the plaza gate going to the store where the stabbing occurred was their own testimony. The OSG surmises that Mariano's shouts for help went unnoticed; as such, the appellants still managed to carry the deceased from the gate to the place near the store where he was eventually found. The OSG further points out that the bolo the appellants used to stab the victim remained embedded on his back. The bare fact that the victim did not suffer any abrasions on the face and that one of his slippers remained on his left toe did not negate Mariano and Perlita's testimony (that the appellants carried the victim and dropped him near the said store). The OSG avers that while there may have been inconsistencies between the testimonies of Perlita and Mariano, their respective accounts were still consistent on material points.<br><center><br><b>The Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>The general rule is that the factual findings of the trial court, including its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the probative weight thereof, as well as the conclusions of the trial court based on its factual findings, are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect, especially if such findings are affirmed by the CA. This is so because the trial court is able to observe at close range the demeanor and deportment of the witnesses as they testify.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> However, the general rule does not apply if the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances which, if considered, will warrant a modification or reversal of the outcome of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The prosecution is burdened to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Indeed, the testimony of a lone witness, if found positive and credible by the trial court, is sufficient to support a conviction especially when the testimony bears the earmarks of truth and sincerity. While the number of witnesses may be considered a factor in the appreciation of evidence, proof beyond reasonable doubt is not necessarily with the greatest number. Conviction of the accused may still be had on the basis of the credible and positive testimony of a single witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>It must be stressed that evidence to be believed must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it must also be credible in itself, such that common experience and observation of mankind lead to the inference its probability under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> On the other hand, inconsistencies as to minor details and peripheral or collateral matters do not affect the credibility of witnesses nor the probative weight of their testimonies. Such minor inconsistencies may even serve to strengthen their credibility as they negate any suspicion that their testimonies are fabricated or rehearsed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Even the most candid of witnesses commit mistakes and make confused and inconsistent statements. As the Court declared in <i>People v. Alolod:</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><blockquote>... Not all persons who witness an incident are impressed in the same manner and it is but natural that in relating their impressions, they disagree on the minor details and that there be contradictions in their testimonies. Witnesses cannot be expected to recollect with exactitude every minute detail of an event. This is especially true when the witnesses testify as to facts which transpired in rapid succession, attended by flurry and excitement. The testimony of each witness should not be expected to be identical to and coinciding with each other. It is enough that the principal points covered by their testimonies are established although they do not dovetail in all details – which would even prove well-rehearsed and studied declarations. ...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>Absent evidence showing any reason or motive for a witness to falsely testify against the accused, the logical conclusion is that no such improper motive exists and the testimony should be accorded full faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The testimony of a witness must be considered and calibrated in its entirety and not by truncated portions thereof or isolated passages therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It is perfectly reasonable to believe the testimony of a witness with respect to some facts and disbelieve it with respect to other facts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> as there is hardly a witness who can perfectly remember the details of a crime. Human memory is not as unerring as a photograph.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Thus, corroborative evidence in order to be credible need not coincide on all aspects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>In this case, the prosecution relied on the collective testimonies of Perlita and Mariano, who claimed to have seen Estemson stab Alberto; the prosecution also anchored its case on the testimony of Dr. Lareza and his medico-legal report. The Court declares that Perlita's testimony, the medico-legal certificate and the expert testimony of Dr. Lareza would have been enough to prove the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Perlita, the sister of the deceased, testified that Estemson stabbed her brother with a small bolo at the back, about two meters more or less from the plaza gate. She declared that Jose held the deceased by the right shoulder, while Allan held him by the left; Estemson then appeared from behind the victim. Perlita was near her brother when he was stabbed: <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q</td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Please inform the court what happened afterwards?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Immediately, a man came and went inside the dance hall, then held my brother and told us that he would bring my brother outside, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">And at that period of time, what was your reaction, if any?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">That man who came in was Edwin Solo and I asked him why he would bring my brother outside and asked him he is doing so (sic) are you a barangay captain?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">Then what was the reaction of Edwin Solo after you told him that?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">He did not mind me and dragged my brother out while I was embracing my brother, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">Was Edwin Solo able to drag your brother out of the gate?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">And what happened after your brother and you had been dragged out of the plaza?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Upon reaching outside, Jose Bulan and Allan Bulan immediately held my brother on his shoulders, Sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

This seeming inconsistency, however, does not detract from the verisimilitude of Perlita's testimony that she saw Estemson stab her brother. As Perlita recounted, she was so shocked and horrified by the sudden appearance of Estemson and the subsequent stabbing of her brother that she frantically shouted for help. It is possible that it was at that precise moment when Estemson stabbed her brother anew at the back, hence, Perlita failed to witness it. Indeed, this Court declared in<i> People v. Bihison</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> –<br><blockquote>Eyewitnesses to a horrifying event cannot be expected, nor be faulted if they are unable, to be completely accurate in picturing to the court all that has transpired and every detail of what they have seen or heard. Various reasons, mostly explainable, can account for this reality; the Court has long acknowledged the verity that different human minds react distinctly and diversely when confronted with a sudden and shocking event, and that a witness may sometimes ignore certain details which at the time might have appeared to him to be insignificant but which to another person under the same circumstances, would seem noteworthy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court notes that the only evidence of the appellants to prove that there were no traces of human blood from near the gate to the store of Talion was the testimony of Dr. Lareza. However, the doctor did not testify that he investigated the condition of the path from the gate to the store to ascertain the presence or absence of blood.<br><br>The appellants contend that Perlita's testimony is incredible, since she claimed to have shouted for help, but there was no reaction from the crowd. The Court rejects this contention. It bears stressing that festivities were then ongoing at the plaza, the blaring music thus drowned out Perlita's shouts for help. Perlita must have realized this and thus went back to the plaza from the store and informed her relatives that Alberto had been stabbed. With the dancing and partying, no one in the plaza noticed the appellants dragging Alberto towards the direction of the store. Perlita then managed to talk to her cousin Irma Cabrera, the barangay captain and policeman Nelson Rubio who, with the municipal mayor, responded to her report. When Perlita relayed the stabbing to Irma Cabrera, the latter, in turn, hurriedly announced the incident over the microphone; it was only then that the public became aware of the tragedy. Rubio then recovered the <span style="font-style: italic;">palas </span>(small bolo) when it fell from the victim's back as he lifted the lifeless body. The Court agrees with the following submissions of the OSG:<br><blockquote>Moreover, it cannot be discounted that other people may have seen the stabbing of Alberto but they chose not to volunteer and reveal what they had seen to the police authorities. It must be pointed out that the natural tendency of most people not to get involved in criminal cases is of judicial notice [<span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Tulop</span>, 289 SCRA 316 (1998)] and that "(i)t is of common human experience that people overcome by great fear, not only for their lives but also of those of their loved ones, will choose to remain tight-lipped about an incident and suffer in silence rather than expose to risk their own safety and of those for whom they care" [P<i>eople v. Dadles</i>, 278 SCRA 393 (1997)].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>The pool of blood in the vicinity where the appellants dropped Alberto face down near Talion's store, and the absence of any traces of blood from the gate to the store cannot be the basis of a conclusion that Alberto was stabbed in that place and not near the plaza gate. Considering that the appellants dropped Alberto face down near the store and the cadaver remained thereat for some time, it is but logical that a pool of blood would have formed near the body. Thus: <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q</td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">And by the time that a person was carried at a distance of about 40 to 50 meters, the bulk or the greater quantity of the blood will flow or ooze and dropped in that place where he was rested?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q</td> <td><div align="justify">Doctor, we will have the question reread to you and answer it accordingly.

In fact, even the absence of blood near the gate would not negate Perlita's claim that her brother was stabbed there. The evidence on record shows that immediately after Estemson stabbed the victim, the appellants dragged Alberto face down from the gate towards the store. It is entirely possible that the blood from the victim's wounds had not yet accumulated and dripped to the ground before he was dragged:  <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

The inscrutable fact is that he stabbed the victim with a small bolo; where the assailant secured the weapon is irrelevant.<br><br>The absence of any abrasions or bruises on the face and feet of the victim, and the fact that his Spartan slipper was still hanging from his left foot, do not negate Perlita's testimony that he was dragged 40 meters away from the gate. We agree with the following submission of the OSG:<br><blockquote>(6) The fact that Alberto still had his "Spartan" slipper on his left toe and that his toes and feet did not bear abrasions do not necessarily indicate that Alberto was not dragged by appellants forty meters away from where he was stabbed. Moreover, appellants' assertion that Alberto's face did not bear any abrasions does not necessarily mean that he was not dropped by appellants face down on the ground in front of the store.<br><br>It must be pointed out that the fact that Alberto still had his "Spartan" slipper on his left toe (<i>sic</i>) could also indicate that he had been dragged for some distance before being left in front of the store. In the process of being dragged, Alberto lost his right slipper and his left slipper remained entangled on his left toe.<br><br>The fact that his toes did not bear abrasions could also indicate that his right slipper was only dislodged as appellants were nearing Valentin Talion's store and that his left slipper, though partially dislodged as it remained on Alberto's left toe, still afforded minimum protection to Alberto's left foot. Moreover, there was no official finding that the terrain of the path through which Alberto had been dragged was rough and stony as to damage Alberto's feet.<br><br>As regards the absence of abrasions on Alberto's face, it must be pointed out that the height from which Alberto was dropped was never determined or established. It is possible that Alberto may have been dropped by appellants with his face only a few inches from the ground. Thus, when Alberto was dropped, the impact of the fall was not enough to cause abrasions or bruises on his face.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br></blockquote>Significantly, the victim's other slipper has not been accounted for by the police investigators.<br><br>There is, likewise, no evidence that Perlita had any ill or devious motive to falsely implicate Estemson and the appellants to the stabbing of her brother. Barely two days after the incident (on June 8, 1994), Perlita gave her sworn statement to SPO4 Ruben T. Sarmiento, naming Estemson as her brother's assailant, with the appellants as companions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Hence, the testimony of Perlita must be accorded full faith and credit.<br><br>The next issue is whether or not the appellants are guilty of the crime charged as principals by direct participation as ruled by the CA, or, as ruled by the RTC, mere accomplices to the crime of murder.<br><br>Article 8 of the Revised Penal Code provides that there is conspiracy when two or more persons agree to commit a crime and decide to commit it. Direct proof is not essential to prove conspiracy; it may be established by acts of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime charged, from which it may be logically inferred the existence of a common purpose to commit the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The prosecution must prove conspiracy by the same quantum of evidence as the felony charged itself. Indeed, proof of previous agreement among the malefactors to commit the crime is not essential to prove conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> It is not necessary to show that all the conspirators actually hit and killed the victim; what is primordial is that all the participants performed specific acts with such closeness and coordination as to indicate a common purpose or design to bring out the victim's death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Once conspiracy is established, it is unnecessary to prove who among the conspirators inflicted the fatal injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> If conspiracy is proved, all the conspirators are criminally liable for the crime charged and proved. The act of one is the act of all.<br><br>In this case, the appellants were waiting outside the dance hall near the gate when Edwin Solo brought the victim towards them, onto the street. Jose held the victim by the right shoulder, while Allan held him by the left. Estemson suddenly appeared from behind the victim and stabbed the latter at the back with a small bolo. The appellants continued holding the victim as Estemson stabbed him yet again. Even as Estemson fled, the appellants dragged the victim from the gate, towards the store, where they dropped the victim's body and fled from the scene. Allan then left Catanduanes and hid in Pasay City where he was arrested by the NBI on August 7, 1994.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>Considering the foregoing, the Court affirms the finding of the CA that the appellants are guilty as principals by direct participation in the killing of Alberto Mariano.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the only defenses proffered by the appellants are denial and alibi, which are, however, the weakest of defenses in criminal cases. The well-established rule is that denial and alibi are self-serving negative evidence; they cannot prevail over the spontaneous, positive and credible testimony of Perlita Mariano who pointed to and identified the appellants as the two of the malefactors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Indeed, alibi is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> The Court notes that the appellants even admitted that they were in the dance hall before the stabbing, and that Jose left only after the incident. Moreover, Jose did not present any other witness to corroborate his alibi.<br><br>The crime committed by the appellants is murder qualified by treachery. Although there was an altercation between Estemson and the victim shortly before the latter was stabbed, treachery nevertheless attended the commission of the crime. As this Court held in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Teston:</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><blockquote>We disagree with the trial court's ruling that treachery did not attend the killing. Treachery is present when the attack is sudden and unexpected, depriving the victim of any real chance to defend himself and thereby ensuring the commission of the crime without risk to the offender. The lower court held that since Vladiner and FORCA fought on the day of the killing, Vladiner was forewarned of the danger to himself. Also, it considered the fight as evidence that the accused did not consciously adopt their mode of attack "as their confrontation was coincidental." <br><br>That the victim and the accused had an altercation immediately before the attack upon the victim does not negate the presence of treachery. In <i>People v. Molina</i>, we held that "[t]reachery may also be appreciated even when the victim was warned of danger or initially assaulted frontally, but was attacked again after being rendered helpless and had no means to defend himself or to retaliate." Similarly, in <i>People v. Villonez,</i> this Court declared that –<blockquote>However, we do not share the assessment of the trial court that there was no treachery in this case because the victim had engaged in a fight previous to the killing and was thus forewarned of an attack against him. Treachery may still be appreciated even when the victim was forewarned of danger to his person. What is decisive is that the execution of the attack made it impossible for the victim to defend himself or to retaliate. The overwhelming number of the accused, their use of weapons against the unarmed victim, and the fact that the victim's hands were held behind him preclude the possibility of any defense by the victim.<br></blockquote>In the instant case, it has been established that while Vladiner was being held down by GACO and OSORIO, FORCA stabbed him several times. However, despite Vladiner's helpless and vulnerable condition, TESTON still hacked him repeatedly, guaranteeing that the victim would not survive the attack. This undoubtedly constitutes treachery for the means employed by accused ensured the execution of their nefarious designs upon the victim without risk to themselves arising from any defense which the offended party might have made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br></blockquote>Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, murder is punishable by reclusion perpetua to death.
