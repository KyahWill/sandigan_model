  <div align="JUSTIFY">At bar are four (4) motions for reconsideration 
separately filed by appellants (1) Francisco Juan Larrañaga, (2) Josman 
Aznar, (3) Rowen Adlawan, Alberto Caño and Ariel Balansag, and (4) James
 Anthony Uy and James Andrew Uy, assailing our Decision dated February 
3, 2004 convicting them of the crimes of (a) special complex crime of 
kidnapping and serious illegal detention and (b) simple kidnapping and 
serious illegal detention, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br>
  <br>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 7, 
Cebu City in Criminal Cases Nos.&nbsp; CBU-45303 and 45304 is AFFIRMED with 
the following MODIFICATIONS:<br>
        <br>
        (1) In Criminal Case No. CBU-45303, appellants FRANCISCO JUAN 
LARRAÑAGA alias ‘PACO;’ JOSMAN AZNAR; ROWEN ADLAWAN alias ‘WESLEY;’ 
ALBERTO CAÑO alias ‘ALLAN PAHAK;’ ARIEL BALANSAG; and JAMES ANDREW UY 
alias ‘MM,’ are found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the special 
complex crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention with homicide 
and rape&nbsp; and are sentenced to suffer the penalty of DEATH &nbsp;by lethal 
injection;<br>
        <br>
        (2) In Criminal Case No. CBU-45304, appellants FRANCISCO JUAN 
LARRAÑAGA alias ‘PACO;’ JOSMAN AZNAR; ROWEN ADLAWAN alias ‘WESLEY;’ 
ALBERTO CAÑO alias ‘ALLAN PAHAK;’ ARIEL BALANSAG; and JAMES ANDREW UY 
alias ‘MM,’ are found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 
simple kidnapping and serious illegal detention and are sentenced to 
suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA;<br>
        <br>
      (3) In Criminal Case No. CBU-45303, appellant JAMES ANTHONY UY, 
who was a minor at the time the crime was committed, is likewise found 
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the special complex crime of 
kidnapping and serious illegal detention with homicide and rape and is 
hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA; in 
Criminal Case No. CBU-45304, he is declared guilty of simple kidnapping 
and serious illegal detention and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
TWELVE (12) years of prision mayor in its maximum period, as MINIMUM, to
 seventeen (17) years of reclusion temporal in its medium period, as 
MAXIMUM;<br>
      <br>
      (4) Appellants are ordered to pay jointly and severally the heirs 
of Marijoy and Jacqueline, in each case, the amounts&nbsp; of (a) P100,000.00
 as civil indemnity, (b) P25,000.00 as&nbsp;&nbsp; temperate damages, (c) 
P150,000.00 as moral damages, and&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) P100,000.00 as exemplary 
damages.<br>
       <br>
       Three (3) Justices of the Court maintain their position that RA 
7659 is unconstitutional insofar as it prescribes the death penalty; 
nevertheless, they submit to the ruling of the majority that the law is 
constitutional and the death penalty can be lawfully imposed in the case
 at bar.<br>
       <br>
       In accordance with Article 83 of The Revised Penal Code, as 
amended by Section 25 of RA No. 7659, upon the finality of this 
Decision, let the records of this case be forthwith forwarded to the 
Office of the President for the possible exercise of Her Excellency’s 
pardoning power.<br>
       <br>
       SO ORDERED.”</p>

    </blockquote>
         <p>In his supplemental motion for reconsideration dated&nbsp; March 
25, 2004, Larrañaga submitted a separate study of Dr. Racquel Del 
Rosario-Fortun, Forensic Pathologist, to show that the examination 
conducted by the prosecution expert witnesses on the body found in 
Tan-awan, Carcar is inadequate.</p>
         <br>
      In a similar supplemental motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>,
 Aznar submitted to this Court the Affidavit dated February 27, 2004 of 
Atty. Florencio Villarin, Regional Director of the National Bureau of 
Investigation, Central Visayas, to show that: (1) the police 
investigation of this case was flawed; (2) he (Aznar) was arrested in 
1997 not because of his involvement in this case but because he had in 
his possession a pack of shabu and firearms; and (3) David Rusia is not a
 credible witness.<br>
       <br>
       On July 15, 2004, the Solicitor General filed a consolidated comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 praying that the four (4) motions for reconsideration be denied with 
finality, there being no new argument raised.&nbsp;&nbsp; He responded to 
appellants’ assignments of errors by exhaustively quoting portions of 
our challenged Decision.<br>
       <br>
      In his consolidated comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 to Aznar’s supplemental motion for reconsideration, the Solicitor 
General enumerated the grounds why Atty. Villarin’s Affidavit should not
 be given consideration.&nbsp; On February 15, 2005, Aznar filed a reply 
alleging that the Solicitor General “read out of context” certain 
portions of the Affidavit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He argued that the<br>
      <br>
      Affidavit only exposes the flawed investigation of the Chiong case
 and that, at the time of his arrest, there was no evidence against 
him.&nbsp; On March 4, 2005, the Solicitor General filed a rejoinder stating 
that Aznar’s reply “actually supports the undersigned counsel’s 
(Solicitor General’s) position that Atty. Villarin’s Affidavit is 
utterly inadequate to prove his innocence or at least even acquit them 
on reasonable doubt,” thus, “it would be useless to call for new trial 
on the basis of such Affidavit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 29, 2005, Aznar filed a 
sur-rejoinder insisting that the Affidavit should be given due 
consideration.<br>
      <br>
      Except for the motion filed by appellants Uy brothers with respect
 to James Andrew’s alleged minority, we find all the motions bereft of 
merit.<br>
      <br>
      At the inception, let it be emphasized that the filing of a motion
 for reconsideration does not impose on us the obligation to discuss and
 rule again on the grounds relied upon by the movant which are mere 
reiteration of the issues previously raised and thoroughly determined 
and evaluated in our Decision being questioned.&nbsp; In Ortigas and Company 
Limited Partnership vs. Velasco,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp;
 we ruled that, "this would be a useless formality of ritual invariably 
involving merely a reiteration of the reasons already set forth in the 
judgment or final order for rejecting the arguments advanced by the 
movant."<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing principle applies squarely to the motions filed by 
appellants Larrañaga, Aznar, Adlawan, Caño and Balansag, it being 
apparent that the points raised therein are not neoteric matters 
demanding new judicial determination.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are mere rehash of the 
arguments set forth in their respective briefs which we already 
considered, weighed and resolved before we rendered the Decision sought 
to be reconsidered.<br>
      <br>
      However, in view of the severity of the penalties for the crimes 
charged, we deem it necessary to stress once more our basis in 
convicting appellants.<br>
      <br>
      <p>The following is a précis of the issues submitted by appellants in their motions:</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>This Court erred –<br>
          <br>
          first, in according credence to Rusia’s testimony;<br>
          <br>
          second, in rejecting appellants’ alibi;<br>
          <br>
          third,&nbsp; in&nbsp; holding&nbsp; that&nbsp; the trial court did&nbsp; not&nbsp; violate&nbsp; 
their&nbsp; right&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to due process when it excluded the&nbsp; testimony of other 
defense witnesses; and<br>
          <br>
        fourth, in holding that the body found in Tan-awan, Carcar was not that of Marijoy.</p>
      </blockquote>
      In deciding a criminal case, the policy of the courts is 
always to look at the case in its entirety.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The totality of the 
evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defense are weighed, 
thus, averting general conclusions from isolated pieces of evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This means that an appeal of a criminal case opens its entire records 
for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br>
      <br>
     
<div style="text-align: center;">I<br>
  </div>
  <br>
  Appellants vigorously contend that we should not have sustained 
Rusia’s testimony hook, line and sinker, owing to his tainted record and
 reputation.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it must be stressed that Rusia’s testimony was 
not viewed in isolation.&nbsp; In giving credence to Rusia’s testimony, the 
trial court took into consideration the physical evidence and the 
corroborative testimonies of other witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, we find no reason 
why we should not uphold the trial court’s findings.<br>
  <br>
  We reiterate our pronouncement in our Decision that what makes Rusia’s
 testimony worthy of belief is its striking compatibility with the 
physical evidence.&nbsp; Physical evidence is one of the highest degrees of 
proof.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It speaks more eloquently than all witnesses put together.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The presence of Marijoy’s ravished body in a deep ravine at Tan-awan, 
Carcar with tape on her mouth and handcuffs on her wrists certainly 
bolstered Rusia’s testimony on what actually took place from Ayala 
Center to Tan-awan.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the details he supplied to the trial court
 are of such nature and quality that only a witness who actually saw the
 commission of the crimes could furnish.&nbsp; Reinforcing his testimony is 
its corroboration by several other witnesses who saw incidents of what 
he narrated.&nbsp; Rolando Dacillo and Mario Minoza witnessed Jacqueline’s 
two&nbsp;&nbsp; failed attempts to escape from appellants near Ayala Center.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Benjamin Molina and Miguel Vergara recognized Rowen as the person who 
inquired from them where he could find a vehicle for hire on the evening
 of July 16, 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alfredo Duarte saw Rowen when he bought barbeque 
and Tanduay at Nene’s Store while the white van, driven by Caño, was 
waiting on the side of the road and he heard voices of “quarreling male 
and female“ emanating from the van.&nbsp;&nbsp; And lastly, Manuel Camingao and 
Rosendo Rio testified on the presence of Larrañaga and Josman at 
Tan-awan, Carcar at dawn of July 17, 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All these bits and pieces 
of story form part of Rusia’s narration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, with such strong 
anchorage on the physical evidence and the testimonies of disinterested 
witnesses, why should we not accord credence to Rusia’s testimony?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Even assuming that his testimony standing alone might indeed be unworthy
 of belief in view of his character, it is not so when considered with 
the other evidence presented by the prosecution.<br>
  <br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">II<br>
  </div>
  <br>
  Appellants likewise claimed that we should have not sustained the 
trial court’s rejection of their alibi.&nbsp;&nbsp; Settled is the rule that the 
defense of alibi is inherently weak and crumbles in the light of 
positive declarations of truthful witnesses who testified on affirmative
 matters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Being evidence
 that is negative in nature and self-serving, it cannot attain more 
credibility than the testimonies of prosecution witnesses who testify on
 clear and positive evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 On top of its inherent weakness, alibi becomes less plausible as a 
defense when it is corroborated only by relatives or close friends of 
the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br>
  <br>
  This case presents to us a balance scale whereby perched on one end is
 appellants’ alibi supported by witnesses who were either their 
relatives, friends or classmates, while on the other end is the positive
 identification of the herein appellants by the prosecution witnesses 
who were not, in any way, related to the victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the above 
jurisprudence as guide, we are certain that the balance must tilt in 
favor of the latter.<br>
  <br>
  Besides, a thorough examination of the evidence for the prosecution 
shows that the appellants failed to meet the requirements of alibi, 
i.e., the requirements of time and place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 They failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that it was 
physically impossible for them to be at the Ayala Center, Cebu City when
 the Chiong sisters were abducted. What is clear from the evidence is 
that Rowen, Josman, Ariel, Alberto, James Anthony and James Andrew were 
all within the vicinity of Cebu City on July 16, 1997.<br>
  <br>
  Not even Larrañaga who claimed to be in Quezon City satisfied the 
required proof of physical impossibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the hearing, it was 
shown that it takes only one (1) hour to travel by plane from Manila to 
Cebu and that there are four (4) airline companies plying the route.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
One of the defense witnesses admitted that there are several flights 
from Manila to Cebu each morning, afternoon and evening. &nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, 
Larrañaga’s presence in Cebu City on July 16, 1997 was proved to be not 
only a possibility but a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four (4) witnesses identified 
Larrañaga as one of the two men talking to Marijoy and Jacqueline on the
 night of July 16, 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shiela Singson testified that on July 16, 
1997, at around 7:20 in the evening, she saw Larrañaga approach Marijoy 
and Jacqueline at the West Entry of Ayala Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The incident 
reminded her of Jacqueline’s prior story that he was Marijoy’s 
admirer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shiela confirmed that she knows Larrañaga since she had seen 
him on five (5) occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Analie Konahap also testified that on the 
same evening of July 16, 1997, at about 8:00 o’clock, she saw Marijoy 
and Jacqueline talking to two (2) men at the West Entry of Ayala 
Center.&nbsp;&nbsp; She recognized the two (2) men as Larrañaga and Josman, having
 seen them several times at Glicos, a game zone, located across her 
office at the third level of Ayala Center.&nbsp; Williard Redobles, the 
security guard then assigned at Ayala Center, corroborated the foregoing
 testimonies of Shiela and Analie.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Rosendo Rio, a 
businessman from Cogon, Carcar, declared that he saw Larrañaga at 
Tan-awan at about 3:30 in the morning of July 17, 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter 
was leaning against the hood of a white van.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; And over and above all, Rusia categorically identified Larrañaga as one of the participes criminis.
   
   <p>Taking the individual testimonies of the above witnesses in 
relation with that of Rusia, we are convinced that Larrañaga was indeed 
in Cebu City at the time of the commission of the crimes and was one of 
the principal perpetrators thereof.</p>
  <p>At this juncture, it bears mentioning that this case is not the 
first time that Larrañaga was charged with or complained of pruriently 
assaulting young female students in Cebu. &nbsp;&nbsp;Months before the abduction 
of Marijoy and Jackie, the parents of a certain Rochelle Virtucio, 
complained about Larrañaga’s attempt to snatch their young daughter and 
drag her in a black, stylish Honda Civic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It happened just near the 
gate of Rochelle’s school, thus, showing his impudence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We quote a 
portion of the transcript of stenographic notes dated September 23, 
1998, thus:</p>

ride home near the school campus, a black Honda Civic with five young 
male teenagers including the driver, suddenly stopped beside them, and 
simultaneously one of them, which was later identified as FRANCISCO JUAN
 LARRANAGA, a BSHRM I student of your school, grabbed Rochelle by her 
hand to try to get Rochelle to their vehicle. She resisted and got away 
from him. Sensing some people were watching what they were doing, they 
hurriedly sped away.<br>
      <br>
      We are very concerned about Rochelle’s safety. Still now, she is 
suffering the shock and tension that she is not supposed to experience 
in her young life. It is very hard for us parents to think about what 
she’d been through.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The presence of such complaint in the record of this case certainly
 does not enhance Larrañaga’s chance of securing an acquittal.<br>
  <br>
  </p><div style="text-align: center;">III<br>
  </div>
  <br>
  Larrañaga and Aznar bewail our refusal to overturn the trial court’s 
exclusion of Professor Jerome Bailen and Atty. Florencio Villarin, NBI, 
Regional Director, as defense witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Bailen was 
properly excluded.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, he is not a finger-print expert but an 
archaeologist.&nbsp; And second, his report consists merely of the results of
 his visual inspection of the exhibits already several months old.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Anent Atty. Villarin’s failure to testify before the trial court, 
suffice it to say that his belated Affidavit, which Aznar submitted via 
his supplemental motion for reconsideration dated May 5, 2004, raises 
nothing to change our findings and conclusions.&nbsp;&nbsp; What clearly appears 
in said Affidavit is a man trying to impress people that he was the one 
responsible for solving the Chiong case and for that, he deserves a 
promotion.&nbsp; The trial court, at the onset, must have seen such 
immateriality in his intended testimony. Indeed, we agree with the 
Solicitor General’s observation that such Affidavit “is neither helpful 
nor encouraging to Aznar’s cause.” We quote his keen reflection on the 
matter:
  <blockquote>
    <p>“ x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp; x<br>
        <br>
        Third. Atty. Villarin’s affidavit, in paragraphs 19 and 20 
thereof, acknowledged that the body found in the Carcar ravine was that 
of Marijoy. This assertion immediately conflicts with accused-appellant 
Aznar’s claim in his Motion for Reconsideration that the corpse was not 
Marijoy’s. Surely, something is amiss in accused-appellant Aznar’s 
recollection of his defense.<br>
        <br>
        Fourth. Atty. Villarin confirmed in paragraph 24 of his 
affidavit that accused-appellant Francisco Larranaga was a suspect in 
the subject crimes. Evidently, this statement completely supports this 
Honorable Court’s findings in its Decision dated February 3, 2004.<br>
        <br>
        Fifth. In paragraph 30 of Atty. Villarin’s affidavit, he stated 
that: ‘The arrest of Juzman Aznar was the major breakthrough in the 
investigation of the case because witnesses came out and identified 
Juzman Aznar as one of those allegedly seen talking to the victims on 
the night they disappeared.’&nbsp; Hence, accused-appellant Aznar was in the 
beginning already a first-grade suspect in the Chiong sisters’ 
celebrated abduction and killing.<br>
        <br>
        Sixth. Atty. Villarin admitted in paragraph 36 of his affidavit 
that: ‘x&nbsp; x x&nbsp; I did not take this against [Supt. Labra] for preempting 
our next move to get Juzman Aznar as we were already placing him under 
surveillance because I knew [Supt. Labra] did it in his honest desire&nbsp; 
to help solve the crime x &nbsp;x&nbsp; x.’&nbsp; Clearly, this statement is not an 
indictment of the investigation that the police undertook in the subject
 crimes.<br>
        <br>
        Seventh. Paragraphs 37 to 40 are nothing but personal tirades 
against alleged influence peddling by Mrs. Thelma Chiong, mother of the 
victims, and the purportedly undue promotions of the lawyers and police 
officers who unearthed the evidence against accused-appellants and 
successfully prosecuted the latter.&nbsp; In executing the affidavit, it 
appears that Atty. Villarin would want to impress that he, rather than 
those promoted, deserved the promotion.<br>
        <br>
        Eighth. Atty. Villarin’s inability to testify in the criminal 
cases was not due solely to the prosecution’s action. Whether he ought 
to testify or not was an argument openly discussed in court. Hence, for 
the resulting inability, Atty. Villarin has no one to blame but the 
defense lawyers who did everything to make a mockery of the criminal 
proceedings.<br>
        <br>
        And lastly, there is nothing in Atty. Villarin’s affidavit of 
the quality of a “smoking gun” that would acquit accused-appellants of 
the crimes they have been convicted. For he did not finish the police 
investigation of the subject crimes; this is the long and short of his 
miniscule role in the instant case. Indeed, judging by the substance of 
his affidavit, he would not be testifying in case a new trial is held on
 anything that has not been said and rejected heretofore, except his own
 unsubstantiated opinions (i.e. not facts as required by evidentiary 
rules), his self-congratulatory remarks, and his unmitigated frustration
 over failing to get a promotion when almost everyone else did.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Neither can we entertain at this late stage Dr. Fortun’s separate 
study to show that the examination conducted on the body found in&nbsp; 
Tan-awan, Carcar is inadequate.&nbsp; Such study cannot be classified as 
newly-discovered evidence warranting belated reception.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, 
Larrañaga could have produced it during trial had he wished to.<br>
   <br>
   </p><div style="text-align: center;">IV<br>
   </div>
   <br>
   Knowing that the prosecution’s theory highly rests on the truth of 
Rusia’&nbsp; testimony,&nbsp; appellants endeavor&nbsp; to&nbsp; destroy&nbsp; it by claiming 
that the body found at the foot of a deep ravine in Tan-awan, Carcar was
 not that of Marijoy.&nbsp;&nbsp; We must reiterate the reasons why we cannot give
 our assent to such argument.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Inspector Edgardo Lenizo,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> a fingerprint expert, testified that the fingerprints of the corpse match those of Marijoy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Second, the packaging tape and the handcuff found on the dead body were
 the same items placed on Marijoy and Jacqueline while they were being 
detained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the body had the same clothes worn by Marijoy on the day she was abducted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; And fourth, the members of the Chiong family personally identified the corpse to be that of Marijoy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 which they eventually buried.&nbsp;&nbsp; They erected commemorative markers at 
the ravine, cemetery and every place which mattered to Marijoy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a 
matter of fact,&nbsp;&nbsp; at this very moment, appellants still fail to bring to
 the attention of this Court any person laying a claim on the said 
body.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely, if the body was not that of Marijoy, other families who
 had lost someone of similar age and gender as Marijoy would have 
surfaced and claimed the body.&nbsp;&nbsp; The above circumstances only bolster 
Rusia’s narration that Rowen and Ariel pushed Marijoy into the deep 
ravine, following Josman’s instruction "to get rid" of her.<br>
  <br>
  On the issue raised by appellants Uy brothers that James Andrew was 
only seventeen (17) years and two hundred sixty two (262) days old at 
the time the crimes were committed, the records bear that on March 1, 
1999, James Andrew’s birth certificate was submitted to the trial court 
as part of the Formal Offer of Additional Evidence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 with the statement that he was eighteen (18) years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On March 18,
 1999, appellants filed a Manifestation of Erratum correcting in part 
the Formal Offer of Additional Evidence by alleging that James Andrew 
was only seventeen (17) years old.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br>
  <br>
  Now, James Andrew begs leave and prays that this Court admits at this 
stage of the proceedings his (1) Certificate of Live Birth issued by the
 National Statistics Office, and (2) Baptismal Certificate.&nbsp;&nbsp; He prays 
that his penalty be reduced, as in the case of his brother James 
Anthony.<br>
  <br>
  The entry of James Andrew’s birth in the Birth Certificate is not 
legible, thus it is extremely difficult for us to determine the veracity
 of his claim.&nbsp; However, considering that minority is a significant 
factor in the imposition of penalty, we find it proper to require the 
Solicitor General&nbsp; &nbsp;(a) to secure from the Local Civil Registrar of 
Cotobato City, as well as the National Statistics Office, a clear and 
legible copy of James Andrew’s Birth Certificate, and thereafter, (b) to
 file an extensive comment on the motion for reconsideration filed by 
James Andrew and James Anthony Uy, solely on James Andrews’ claim of 
minority.<br>
  <br>
  Insofar as James Anthony is concerned, we maintain his conviction and 
penalty, there being nothing in his motion which warrants a 
reconsideration of our Decision.<br>
  <br>
  In resolving the instant motions, we have embarked on this painstaking
 task of evaluating every piece and specie of evidence presented before 
the trial court in response to appellants’ plea for the reversal of 
their conviction.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, even the element of reasonable doubt so 
seriously sought by appellants is an ignis fatuus which has eluded any 
intelligent ratiocination of their submissions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Verily, our conscience
 can rest easy on our affirmance of the verdict of the trial court, in 
light of appellants’ clear culpability which demands retribution.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the motions for reconsideration filed by 
appellants Francisco Juan Larrañaga, Josman Aznar, Rowen Adlawan, 
Alberto Caño and Ariel Balansag are hereby DENIED.&nbsp; The Solicitor 
General is DIRECTED (a) to secure from the Local Civil Registrar of 
Cotobato City, as well as the National Statistics Office, a clear and 
legible copy of James Andrew’s Birth Certificate, and (b) within ten 
(10) days therefrom, to file an extensive comment on the motion for 
reconsideration filed by James Andrew and James Anthony Uy, solely on 
James Andrews’ claim of minority.&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion is likewise DENIED 
insofar as James Anthony Uy is concerned.<br>
