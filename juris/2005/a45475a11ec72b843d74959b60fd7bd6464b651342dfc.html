				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The Constitution expects judges to be embodiments of competence, integrity, probity and independence.  They must personify four <i>ins</i>; namely, integrity, independence, industry and intelligence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  Their judgments must be characterized by excellence, their conduct by ethics, and their outlook by eternity.  They are not common individuals whose gross errors "men forgive and time forgets."<br><center><b><u><br>The Case and the Facts</u></b><br></center><br>In a Complaint-Affidavit dated June 24, 2003, the Community Rural Bank of Guimba (N. E.), Inc. -- through its chief operating officer, Olga M. Samson -- charged Judge Tomas B. Talavera of the Regional Trial Court (Branch 28) of Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija, with (1) serious misconduct and/or gross inefficiency and (2) violation of Rules 1.01,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 3.01<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and 3.02<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Code of Judicial Conduct.  The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) summarized the factual antecedents as follows:<br><blockquote>"In September 1997, the Bank lodged a complaint with the City Prosecutor's Office of Cabanatuan charging several persons (the accused, for brevity) with the offense of Estafa in relation to P.D. Nos. 818 and 1689.  After a preliminary investigation, the Investigating Fiscal recommended the filing --of six (6) Informations for Estafa against the accused.  These were docketed as Criminal Case Nos. 8760 to 8765 and were raffled to Branches 25, 26, 28, and 86 of RTC, Cabanatuan City.  Respondent was the presiding judge of Branch 28 to whom Criminal Case Nos. 8761 and 8763 were raffled.<br><br>"On 28 December 1998, the accused appealed the findings of the Investigating Fiscal to the Department of Justice (DOJ, for brevity).  On 19 November 1999, the DOJ denied the petition of the accused.  Then, the accused filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by the DOJ through a resolution, dated 15 August 2000.  Hence, respondent issued a Warrant of Arrest fixing no bail against the accused.<br><br>"On 20 November 2000, the accused filed a Motion for Reinvestigation and to Lift the Issuance of Warrant of Arrest (Motion for Reinvestigation, for brevity).  However, neither the Bank nor its counsel was furnished a copy of said Motion.  There was also no hearing on the said motion to afford the Bank an opportunity to oppose the same.<br><br>"On 4 December 2000, respondent granted the Motion for Reinvestigation without any hearing thereon.  Thus, a reinvestigation proceeding was conducted by Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Virgilio Caballero.  Again, the Bank was not notified of said proceedings.<br><br>"Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Caballero, in his Joint Resolution dated 28 December 2000, reversed the earlier findings of the previous Investigating Fiscal.  Thus, on the same day, a Motion to Dismiss was filed by Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Caballero.  Neither the bank nor its counsel was notified about the said Motion and no hearing thereon was held to afford the Bank an opportunity to oppose the same.<br><br>"Respondent granted the Motion to Dismiss and ordered the release of the accused on 29 December 2000.<br><br>"On 11 January 2001, the Bank, arguing that it had been deprived of due process, filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Opposition/Comment to the Motion to Dismiss and Omnibus Motion for the Reinstatement of the Criminal Information and for the Recall of Order for Release.<br><br>"Respondent denied the afore-mentioned Motion of the Bank for lack of merit on 23 March 2001.  Thus, the Bank filed a Petition for Review under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court with the Court of Appeals.<br><br>"In view of the foregoing, Ms. Samson argued that respondent transgressed Sections 2, 5 and 6 of Rule 15 of the Revised Rules of Court, when he granted the Motion for Reinvestigation of the accused and Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Caballero's Motion to Dismiss without notice and hearing in favor of the Bank or its counsel.  Furthermore, the granting by respondent of the Motion to Dismiss based solely on the Resolution issued by Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Caballero, without making his own independent findings of the merits of the case, is repugnant to the principle laid down in <i>Crespo vs. Mogul</i> (151 SCRA 462 [30 June 1987]) which held that once a complaint or information is filed in court any disposition or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the court.<br><br>"2.<span style="font-weight: bold;">  </span><b>COMMENT/OPPOSITION WITH MOTION TO DISMISS</b> dated 11 August 2003 of Respondent Judge Tomas B. Talavera where he refutes the foregoing Complaint-Affidavit as follows:<br><br>"There was no need to set the Motion for Reinvestigation for hearing because the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor - who has direct control and supervision of all criminal cases - was furnished a copy of said motion.  Furthermore, it should be noted that, in the Motion for Reinvestigation filed before the court, the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor through the Assistant Provincial Prosecutor signified his intention not to object to the Motion for Reinvestigation as can be seen from his handwritten note and signature appearing on said motion.  Hence, setting the same for hearing would be an exercise in futility and it could just delay the immediate disposition of the case.<br><br>"The Office of the Provincial Prosecutor, after the reinvestigation, issued a Joint Resolution dated 28 December 2000 through Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Virgilio Caballero recommending the dismissal of the criminal case.  On the basis of said Joint Resolution, a Motion to Dismiss was filed by Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Caballero, which was granted by respondent on 29 December 2003.<br><br>"The Motion to Dismiss was not set anymore for hearing because it was filed by the public prosecutor who conducted the reinvestigation.  Since the Motion to Dismiss was filed by prosecutor and the same was not prejudicial to the adverse party (the accused), it is just proper for the court to treat the said motion as non-litigious.<br><br>"The private prosecutor filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals seeking to amend and set aside the Order dated 23 March 2003 of Respondent Judge which denied the Motion for Reconsideration of the private complainant.  The said petition is still pending before the Court of Appeals.  The grounds used by the private complainant in her petition for certiorari are the same grounds in the administrative complaint.  Hence, the administrative complaint filed by the private complainant is a violation of the principle on <i>sub judice</i>.<br><br>"3.<span style="font-weight: bold;">  </span><b>REPLY</b> dated 15 September 2003 of the Bank through its legal counsel stating the following arguments:<br><br>"The reasoning of respondent in allowing the Motion for Reinvestigation without notice to private counsel and hearing is erroneous.  The said motion is litigious.  Therefore, sound judicial discretion should have prompted the respondent to treat said motion as a mere scrap of paper for violating the general rules on motions under Sections 2, 5 and 6 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court and in view of the principles enunciated in <i>Brizuela vs. Judge Mendiola</i> (A.M. No. RTJ-00-1560 dated 5 July 2000) and <i>Bajet vs. Judge Areola</i> (A.M. No. RTJ-01-1615 dated 19 June 2001).  In <i>Brizuela</i> and <i>Bajet</i>, the Supreme Court held that failure to serve notice on the adverse party rendered a litigious motion a mere scrap of paper.<br><br>"Furthermore, the rule on <i>sub judice</i> was not violated by complainant.  The cause of action and reliefs prayed for in the instant administrative complaint are different from the petition filed by the Bank before the Court of Appeals.  The petition filed before the Court of Appeals was filed on the ground of "grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction, there being no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, seeking to annul and set aside" respondent's Order dated 23 March 2001 denying complainant Bank's Motion for Reconsideration of an earlier Order dated 29 December 2000 granting Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Caballero's Motion to Dismiss.  On the other hand, the administrative complaint filed by the Bank aims to subject respondent to the appropriate administrative sanctions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>In a Resolution dated October 20, 2004,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> this Court resolved to re-docket the Complaint as a regular administrative matter.<br><center><br><b><u>Evaluation and Recommendation of the OCA</u></b><br></center><br>The OCA opined that by dismissing the criminal case without giving complainant the opportunity to object to the Motion for Reinvestigation and Motion to Dismiss, respondent showed gross ignorance of the law, for which he should be sanctioned.  The OCA added that the presence of the offended party was required in the hearing of a motion to dismiss as much as in the arraignment.  The dismissal of the criminal cases covered the litigation's civil aspect (recovery of damages by the offended party), which was deemed included in the Information.<br><br>Pursuant to Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, the OCA recommended that respondent judge be fined in the amount of P21,000.<br><br>On the other hand, the OCA recommended that the charge of gross misconduct be dismissed for lack of substantial evidence.  It found no clear proof of malice or wrongful intent on the part of respondent.<br><center><br><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>We agree with the findings and recommendations of the OCA.<br><center><br><b><u>Administrative Liability</u></b><br></center><br>Courts exist to dispense and promote justice.

Indeed, they must be the embodiments of competence, integrity and independence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  They owe it to the dignity of the court over which they preside, to the public who depend on them, and to the legal profession to which they belong, to know the very law they are supposed to interpret and apply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  Party litigants will have great faith in the administration of justice only if judges can demonstrate their grasp of legal principles.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the gross ignorance of respondent judge and his notorious violation of simple legal precepts were clearly shown by his issuance of the Orders dated December 4, 2000 granting the Motion for Reinvestigation of the accused and December 29, 2000 granting the prosecutor's Motion to Dismiss.<br><br><i>First</i>, respondent should not have entertained the Motion for Reinvestigation filed by the accused.  The former was fully aware that the latter had appealed the unfavorable ruling of the investigating prosecutor to the Department of Justice (DOJ).  Respondent judge must have in fact taken that appeal into consideration when he issued a warrant of arrest against all the accused only on September 19, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> after Justice Secretary Serafin R. Cuevas had denied their Petition for Review and affirmed the presence of prima facie evidence against them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  Subsequently, on August 15, 2000, the secretary also denied with finality the Motion for Reconsideration filed by the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Inasmuch as the Resolution of the provincial prosecutor has been affirmed by the secretary of justice, the existence of probable cause to hold the accused for trial may be deemed to be the finding of the secretary himself, not merely of the prosecutor who had first investigated the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  Therefore, what the prosecutor reviewed and overruled in the reinvestigation was not the actuation and resolution of his predecessor, but of the secretary of justice no less.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The justice secretary's superior authority in the prosecution of offenses was elucidated upon by this Court in <i>Ledesma v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> which we quote:<br><blockquote>"Section 39, Chapter 8, Book IV in relation to Sections 5, 8, and 9, Chapter 2, Title III of the [Revised Administrative] Code gives the secretary of justice supervision and control over the Office of the Chief Prosecutor and the Provincial and City Prosecution Offices.  The scope of his power of supervision and control is delineated in Section 38, paragraph 1, Chapter 7, Book IV of the Code:<br><blockquote>'(1) <i>Supervision and Control</i>. - Supervision and control shall include authority to act directly whenever a specific function is entrusted by law or regulation to a subordinate; direct the performance of duty; restrain the commission of acts; review, approve, reverse or modify acts and decisions of subordinate officials or units; x x x'<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x                       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;                       x x x<br></div></blockquote>"'Supervision' and 'control' of a department head over his subordinates have been defined in administrative law as follows:<br><blockquote>'In administrative law, supervision means overseeing or the power or authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their duties.  If the latter fail or neglect to fulfill them, the former may take such action or step as prescribed by law to make them perform such duties.  Control, on the other hand, means the power of an officer to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter.'<br></blockquote>"Review as an act of supervision and control by the justice secretary over the fiscals and prosecutors finds basis in the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies which holds that mistakes, abuses or negligence committed in the initial steps of an administrative activity or by an administrative agency should be corrected by higher administrative authorities, and not directly by courts. x x x"<br></blockquote>The actions of prosecutors are not unlimited; they are subject to review by the secretary of justice who may affirm, nullify, reverse or modify their actions or opinions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  Consequently the secretary may direct them to file either a motion to dismiss the case or an information against the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>In short, the secretary of justice, who has the power of supervision and control over prosecuting officers, is the ultimate authority who decides which of the conflicting theories of the complainants and the respondents should be believed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  The provincial or city prosecutor has neither the personality nor the legal authority to review or overrule the decision of the secretary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  This principle is elementary.<br><br>Consistent with this administrative superior-subordinate relationship between them, Section 7 of Department Order No. 223<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> (the rules governing appeals from resolutions in preliminary investigations or reinvestigations) provides:<br><blockquote>Sec. 7.<span style="font-style: italic;">  </span><i>Motion for Reinvestigation</i>. - At any time after the appeal has been perfected and before the resolution thereof, the appellant may file a motion for reinvestigation on the ground that new and material evidence has been discovered which appellant could not with reasonable diligence have discovered during the preliminary investigation and which if produced and admitted would probably change the resolution.<br></blockquote>From the above-quoted provision, a motion for reinvestigation on the ground of newly discovered evidence must be filed before the justice secretary rules on an appeal from a resolution in a preliminary investigation.<br><br>In the present case, the accused filed their Motion for Reinvestigation on November 29, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> about three months after the August 15, 2000 Resolution of the secretary denying with finality their Motion for Reconsideration of the denial of their Petition for Review.  Clearly, therefore, it was grossly erroneous for respondent judge to order the reinvestigation of the case by the prosecutor.  This action enabled the latter to reprobate and reverse the secretary's Resolution.  In granting the Motion for Reinvestigation, respondent effectively demolished the DOJ's power of control and supervision over prosecutors.<br><br>Furthermore, the judge perfunctorily granted the Motion for Reinvestigation on the basis of an alleged newly discovered evidence -- a one-page Affidavit executed by Ms Gloria Sacramento, one of the co-accused in the criminal case.  The Affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> dated October 29, 1997, was clearly not newly discovered; it was already known to the accused even during the preliminary investigation.  There was no explanation whatsoever as to why this piece of evidence was never presented during the preliminary investigation.  Nonetheless, respondent hastily granted the Motion.<br><br>Considering that a prima facie case had been found to exist against the accused during the preliminary investigation -- a fact affirmed by the justice secretary -- respondent judge should have exercised great restraint in granting a reinvestigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>It must be stressed here that a preliminary investigation is essentially prefatory and inquisitorial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  It is not a trial of the case on the merits and has no purpose except to determine whether a crime has been committed, and whether there is probable cause to believe that the accused is guilty of that crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  A preliminary investigation is not the occasion for a full and exhaustive display of the parties' evidence, which needs to be presented only to engender a well-grounded belief that an offense has been committed, and that the accused is probably guilty thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br><i>Second</i>, in granting the Motion to Dismiss, respondent relied solely on the Resolution of the prosecutor who had conducted the reinvestigation and recommended the dismissal of the case for alleged insufficiency of evidence.  The December 29, 2000 Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> granting the Motion to Dismiss reads in full as follows:<br><blockquote>"Finding the Motion to Dismiss in these cases to be meritorious, the same is hereby granted, and Fernando del Rosario and Flordeliza del Rosario, both accused in the above-entitled cases are hereby ordered released unless they are being detained for some other lawful cause.<br><br>"Cabanatuan City, December 29, 2000."<br></blockquote>This perfunctory Order does not demonstrate an independent evaluation or assessment of the evidence (or the lack thereof) against the accused.  In other words, the dismissal of the case was not shown to be based upon the judge's own individual conviction that there was no viable case against them.<br><br>This Court also observes that respondent acted with undue haste when he granted the Motion on December 29, 2000,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> only a day after the reinvestigation was concluded on December 28, 2000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  Coupled with the absence of the required evaluation in the Resolution granting the dismissal of the case, this hasty action leads to the indubitable conclusion that the judge did not personally evaluate the parties' evidence before acting on the Motion.<br><br>Settled is the legal doctrine that the discretion to accede to a Motion to Dismiss filed by the prosecutor rests solely with the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>  Mere approval of the position taken by the prosecution is not equivalent to the discretion required in cases like this.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>  The trial judge must be convinced that there was indeed no sufficient evidence against the accused.  Such a conclusion can be arrived at only after a thorough assessment of the prosecution evidence.  For a valid and proper exercise of judicial discretion, accepting the prosecution's word that the evidence is insufficient is not enough;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> strictly required of the order disposing of the motion is the trial judge's own evaluation of such evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  Once a complaint or an information is filed in court, the judge -- not the prosecutor -- assumes full control of the controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>  Thus, a grant of the motion to dismiss is equivalent to a disposition of the case itself,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> a subject clearly within the court's exclusive jurisdiction and competence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, when respondent judge issued the warrants of arrest without bail against all the accused, it is presumed that he had studied the Information and the Resolution of the prosecutor and agreed with the latter's findings of probable cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>  Consequently, the grant of the Motion for Reinvestigation and of the Motion to Dismiss for alleged insufficiency of evidence posed a serious contradiction of the earlier finding of probable cause.<br><br><i>Third</i>, respondent granted the Motions despite the obvious lack of notice to complainant (the private offended party in the criminal case) and lack of hearing.  This lapse effectively deprived it of its day in court.<br><br>The Rules of Court require that, with the exception of motions that the court may act upon without prejudicing the rights of the adverse party, every written motion should be set for hearing by the movant.  Sections 4, 5 and 6 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court explicitly require that notices be sent at least three days before the hearing and directed at the parties concerned; and that they state the time and place of hearing of the motion, with proper proof of notice thereof.  Without such proof, the motion is considered pro forma; thus, the court cannot act upon it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>The purpose of the notice is to enable the adverse party to appear for its own protection and to contest the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  Elementary due process mandates that the other party be notified of the adverse action of the opposing party,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> so as to avoid a capricious change of mind and to ensure impartiality of the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  Here, the Motions for Reinvestigation and to Dismiss were fatally defective, as neither contained any proper notice of hearing.  Respondent thus grossly erred in taking cognizance of these Motions.<br><br>In criminal proceedings, the word "party" is held to mean not only the government and the accused, but also other persons who may be affected by the orders issued and/or judgment rendered therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Undoubtedly, complainant had an interest in the maintenance of the criminal prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>  Its right to intervene therein was  practically beyond question, as it neither instituted a separate civil action nor reserved or waived the right to do so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>  Thus, as the party injured by the crime, it had the right to be heard on a motion that was derogatory to its interest in the civil aspect of the case.  Due process<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> necessitates that it be afforded this opportunity, especially because of a conflict between the positions of the public prosecutor and of the offended party.<br><br>Respondent judge does not deny that no notice was given to complainant.  Neither was a hearing conducted before the issuance of the subject Orders.  By such failure of notice and hearing, he effectively deprived complainant of the opportunity to appear and to oppose the said Motions.  That the offended party, not only the accused, must be accorded due process was explained by the Court in <i>Dimatulac v. Villon</i>, which ruled thus:<br><blockquote>"x x x Although the determination of a criminal case before a judge lies within his exclusive jurisdiction and competence, his discretion is not unfettered, but rather must be exercised within reasonable confines.  The judge's action must not impair the substantial rights of the accused, nor the right of the State and offended party to due process of law.<br><br>"Indeed, for justice to prevail, the scales must balance; justice is not to be dispensed for the accused alone.  The interests of society and the offended parties which have been wronged must be equally considered.  Verily, a verdict of conviction is not necessarily a denial of justice; and an acquittal is not necessarily a triumph of justice, for, to the society offended and the party wronged, it could also mean injustice.  Justice then must be rendered even-handedly to both the accused, on one hand, and the State and the offended party, on the other." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br></blockquote>All told, respondent showed his lack of understanding, not only of the basic and established superior-subordinate relationship between the secretary of justice and the provincial prosecutors, but also of the functions and duties of the trial court in "the proper scheme of things" in our criminal justice system.  The judge similarly failed to attach importance to the standard and fundamental procedure mandated by the Rules of Court and the rudiments of due process. His actions manifested a marked deficiency in his knowledge of the law.  Where, as in this case, the legal principle involved is basic, simple and elementary, lack of conversance therewith constitutes gross ignorance of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Judges are expected to have more than just a modicum acquaintance with the statutes and procedural rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>  The Code of Judicial Ethics requires them to be embodiments of, among other desirable characteristics, judicial competence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup>  They are not common individuals whose gross errors "men forgive and time forgets."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The OCA recommended the penalty of a fine in the amount of P21,000 for respondent judge's gross ignorance of the law, which is classified by Rule 140 of the Rules of Court as a serious charge.  As to the complaint of serious misconduct, we also adopt the findings of the OCA that no fraud, malice or wrongful intent was imputed, or proved by complainant; hence, respondent cannot be made liable therefor.<br><br>WHEREFORE, Judge Tomas B.
