				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Before us is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 26877, affirming the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Baguio City, Branch 3, convicting Eduardo P. Manuel of bigamy in Criminal Case No. 19562-R.<br><br>Eduardo was charged with bigamy in an Information filed on November 7, 2001, the accusatory portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 22<sup>nd</sup> day of April, 1996, in the City of Baguio, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused EDUARDO P. MANUEL, being then previously and legally&nbsp; married to RUBYLUS [GAÑA] and without the said marriage having been legally dissolved, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously contract a second marriage with TINA GANDALERA-MANUEL, herein complainant, who does not know the existence of the first marriage of said EDUARDO P. MANUEL to Rubylus [Gaña].<br><br>CONTRARY TO LAW. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote>The prosecution adduced evidence that on July 28, 1975, Eduardo was married to Rubylus Gaña before Msgr. Feliciano Santos in Makati, which was then still a municipality of the Province of Rizal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>&nbsp; He met the private complainant Tina B. Gandalera in Dagupan City sometime in January 1996.&nbsp; She stayed in Bonuan, Dagupan City for two days looking for a friend.&nbsp; Tina was then 21 years old, a Computer Secretarial student, while Eduardo was 39.&nbsp; Afterwards, Eduardo went to Baguio City to visit her. Eventually, as one thing led to another, they went to a motel where, despite Tina's resistance, Eduardo succeeded in having his way with her.&nbsp; Eduardo proposed marriage on several occasions, assuring her that he was single.&nbsp; Eduardo even brought his parents to Baguio City to meet Tina's parents, and was assured by them that their son was still single.<br><br>Tina finally agreed to marry Eduardo sometime in the first week of March 1996.&nbsp; They were married on April 22, 1996 before Judge Antonio C. Reyes, the Presiding Judge of the RTC of Baguio City, Branch 61.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; It appeared in their marriage contract that Eduardo was "single."<br><br>The couple was happy during the first three years of their married life.&nbsp; Through their joint efforts, they were able to build their home in Cypress Point, Irisan, Baguio City.&nbsp; However, starting 1999, Manuel started making himself scarce and went to their house only twice or thrice a year.&nbsp; Tina was jobless, and whenever she asked money from Eduardo, he would slap her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; Sometime in January 2001, Eduardo took all his clothes, left, and did not return.&nbsp; Worse, he stopped giving financial support.<br><br>Sometime in August 2001, Tina became curious and made inquiries from the National Statistics Office (NSO) in Manila where she learned that Eduardo had been previously married.&nbsp; She secured an NSO-certified copy of the marriage contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>&nbsp; She was so embarrassed and humiliated when she learned that Eduardo was in fact already married when they exchanged their own vows.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>For his part, Eduardo testified that he met Tina sometime in 1995 in a bar where she worked as a Guest Relations Officer (GRO).&nbsp; He fell in love with her and married her.&nbsp; He informed Tina of his previous marriage to Rubylus Gaña, but she nevertheless agreed to marry him.&nbsp; Their marital relationship was in order until this one time when he noticed that she had a "love-bite" on her neck.&nbsp; He then abandoned her. Eduardo further testified that he declared he was "single" in his marriage contract with Tina because he believed in good faith that his first marriage was invalid.&nbsp; He did not know that he had to go to court to seek for the nullification of his first marriage before marrying Tina.<br><br>Eduardo further claimed that he was only forced to marry his first wife because she threatened to commit suicide unless he did so.&nbsp; Rubylus was charged with <i>estafa</i> in 1975 and thereafter imprisoned.&nbsp; He visited her in jail after three months and never saw her again.&nbsp; He insisted that he married Tina believing that his first marriage was no longer valid because he had not heard from Rubylus for more than 20 years.<br><br>After trial, the court rendered judgment on July 2, 2002 finding Eduardo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of bigamy.&nbsp; He was sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of from six (6) years and ten (10) months, as minimum, to ten (10) years, as maximum, and directed to indemnify the private complainant Tina Gandalera the amount of P200,000.00 by way of moral damages, plus costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The trial court ruled that the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt all the elements of bigamy under Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code.&nbsp; It declared that Eduardo's belief, that his first marriage had been dissolved because of his first wife's 20-year absence, even if true, did not exculpate him from liability for bigamy.&nbsp; Citing the ruling of this Court in <i>People v. Bitdu</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> the trial court further ruled that even if the private complainant had known that Eduardo had been previously married, the latter would still be criminally liable for bigamy.<br><br>Eduardo appealed the decision to the CA.&nbsp; He alleged that he was not criminally liable for bigamy because when he married the private complainant, he did so in good faith and without any malicious intent.&nbsp; He maintained that at the time that he married the private complainant, he was of the honest belief that his first marriage no longer subsisted.&nbsp; He insisted that conformably to Article 3 of the Revised Penal Code, there must be malice for one to be criminally liable for a felony.&nbsp; He was not motivated by malice in marrying the private complainant because he did so only out of his overwhelming desire to have a fruitful marriage.&nbsp; He posited that the trial court should have taken into account Article 390 of the New Civil Code. To support his view, the appellant cited the rulings of this Court in <i>United States v. Pe</i><span style="font-style: italic;">ñ</span><i>alosa</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and <i>Manahan, Jr. v. Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) averred that Eduardo's defense of good faith and reliance on the Court's ruling in <i>United States v. Enriquez</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> were misplaced; what is applicable is Article 41 of the Family Code, which amended Article 390 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; Citing the ruling of this Court in <i>Republic v. Nolasco,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the OSG further posited that as provided in Article 41 of the Family Code, there is a need for a judicial declaration of presumptive death of the absent spouse to enable the present spouse to marry.&nbsp; Even assuming that the first marriage was void, the parties thereto should not be permitted to judge for themselves the nullity of the marriage; the matter should be submitted to the proper court for resolution.&nbsp; Moreover, the OSG maintained, the private complainant's knowledge of the first marriage would not afford any relief since bigamy is an offense against the State and not just against the private complainant.<br><br>However, the OSG agreed with the appellant that the penalty imposed by the trial court was erroneous and sought the affirmance of the decision appealed from with modification.<br><br>On June 18, 2004, the CA rendered judgment affirming the decision of the RTC with modification as to the penalty of the accused.&nbsp; It ruled that the prosecution was able to prove all the elements of bigamy.&nbsp; Contrary to the contention of the appellant, Article 41 of the Family Code should apply.&nbsp; Before Manuel could lawfully marry the private complainant, there should have been a judicial declaration of Gaña's presumptive death as the absent spouse.&nbsp; The appellate court cited the rulings of this Court in <i>Mercado v. Tan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and <i>Domingo v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> to support its ruling.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, the Decision promulgated on July 31, 2002 is hereby <b>MODIFIED </b>to reflect, as it hereby reflects, that accused-appellant is sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>prision correccional</i>, as minimum, to ten (10) years of <i>prision mayor</i> as maximum. Said Decision is <b>AFFIRMED</b> in all other respects.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Eduardo, now the petitioner, filed the instant petition for review on certiorari, insisting that:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR OF LAW WHEN IT RULED THAT PETITIONER'S FIRST WIFE CANNOT BE LEGALLY PRESUMED DEAD UNDER ARTICLE 390 OF THE CIVIL CODE AS THERE WAS NO JUDICIAL DECLARATION OF PRESUMPTIVE DEATH AS PROVIDED FOR UNDER ARTICLE 41 OF THE FAMILY CODE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR OF LAW WHEN IT AFFIRMED THE AWARD OF PHP200,000.00 AS MORAL DAMAGES AS IT HAS NO BASIS IN FACT AND IN LAW.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioner maintains that the prosecution failed to prove the second element of the felony, <i>i.e.</i>, that the marriage has not been legally dissolved or, in case his/her spouse is absent, the absent spouse could not yet be presumed dead under the Civil Code.&nbsp; He avers that when he married Gandalera in 1996, Gaña had been "absent" for 21 years since 1975; under Article 390 of the Civil Code, she was presumed dead as a matter of law.&nbsp; He points out that, under the first paragraph of Article 390 of the Civil Code, one who has been absent for seven years, whether or not he/she is still alive, shall be presumed dead <i>for all purposes</i> except for succession, while the second paragraph refers to the rule on legal presumption of death with respect to succession.<br><br>The petitioner asserts that the presumptive death of the absent spouse arises by operation of law upon the satisfaction of two requirements: the specified period and the present spouse's reasonable belief that the absentee is dead.&nbsp; He insists that he was able to prove that he had not heard from his first wife since 1975 and that he had no knowledge of her whereabouts or whether she was still alive; hence, under Article 41 of the Family Code, the presumptive death of Gaña had arisen by operation of law, as the two requirements of Article 390 of the Civil Code are present.&nbsp; The petitioner concludes that he should thus be acquitted of the crime of bigamy.<br><br>The petitioner insists that except for the period of absences provided for in Article 390 of the Civil Code, the rule therein on legal presumptions remains valid and effective.&nbsp; Nowhere under Article 390 of the Civil Code does it require that there must first be a judicial declaration of death before the rule on presumptive death would apply.&nbsp; He further asserts that contrary to the rulings of the trial and appellate courts, the requirement of a judicial declaration of presumptive death under Article 41 of the Family Code is only a requirement for the validity of the subsequent or second marriage.<br><br>The petitioner, likewise, avers that the trial court and the CA erred in awarding moral damages in favor of the private complainant.&nbsp; The private complainant was a "GRO" before he married her, and even knew that he was already married.&nbsp; He genuinely loved and took care of her and gave her financial support.&nbsp; He also pointed out that she had an illicit relationship with a lover whom she brought to their house.<br><br>In its comment on the petition, the OSG maintains that the decision of the CA affirming the petitioner's conviction is in accord with the law, jurisprudence and the evidence on record.&nbsp; To bolster its claim, the OSG cited the ruling of this Court in <i>Republic v. Nolasco</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The petition is denied for lack of merit.<br><br>Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code, which defines and penalizes bigamy, reads: <br><blockquote>Art. 349. <i>Bigamy.</i> – The penalty of <i>prision mayor</i> shall be imposed upon any person who shall contract a second or subsequent marriage before the former marriage has been legally dissolved, or before the absent spouse has been declared presumptively dead by means of a judgment rendered in the proper proceedings.<br></blockquote>The provision was taken from Article 486 of the Spanish Penal Code, to wit: <br><blockquote><i>El que contrajere Segundo o ulterior matrimonio sin hallarse legítimamente disuelto el anterior, serà castigado con la pena de prision mayor</i>. xxx<br></blockquote>The reason why bigamy is considered a felony is to preserve and ensure the juridical tie of marriage established by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The phrase "or before the absent spouse had been declared presumptively dead by means of a judgment rendered in the proper proceedings" was incorporated in the Revised Penal Code because the drafters of the law were of the impression that "in consonance with the civil law which provides for the presumption of death after an absence of a number of years, <b>the judicial declaration of presumed death like annulment of marriage </b>should be a justification for bigamy."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>For the accused to be held guilty of bigamy, the prosecution is burdened to prove the felony: (a) he/she has been legally married; and&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) he/she contracts a subsequent marriage without the former marriage having been lawfully dissolved.&nbsp; The felony is consummated on the celebration of the second marriage or subsequent marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; It is essential in the prosecution for bigamy that the alleged second marriage, having all the essential requirements, would be valid were it not for the subsistence of the first marriage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Viada avers that a third element of the crime is that the second marriage must be entered into with fraudulent intent (<i>intencion fraudulente</i>) which is an essential element of a felony by <i>dolo</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> On the other hand, Cuello Calon is of the view that there are only two elements of bigamy: (1) the existence of a marriage that has not been lawfully dissolved; and (2) the celebration of a second marriage.&nbsp; It does not matter whether the first marriage is void or voidable because such marriages have juridical effects until lawfully dissolved by a court of competent jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>&nbsp; As the Court ruled in <i>Domingo v. Court of Appeals</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> and <i>Mercado v. Tan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> under the Family Code of the Philippines, the judicial declaration of nullity of a previous marriage is a defense.<br><br>In his commentary on the Revised Penal Code,&nbsp; Albert is of the same&nbsp;&nbsp; view as Viada and declared that there are three (3) elements of bigamy:&nbsp; (1) an undissolved marriage; (2) a new marriage; and (3) fraudulent intention constituting the felony of the act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; He explained that:<br><blockquote>... This last element is not stated in Article 349, because it is undoubtedly incorporated in the principle antedating all codes, and, constituting one of the landmarks of our Penal Code, that, where there is no willfulness there is no crime.&nbsp; There is no willfulness if the subject believes that the former marriage has been dissolved; and this must be supported by very strong evidence, and if this be produced, the act shall be deemed not to constitute a crime.&nbsp; Thus, a person who contracts a second marriage in the reasonable and well-founded belief that his first wife is dead, because of the many years that have elapsed since he has had any news of her whereabouts, in spite of his endeavors to find her, cannot be deemed guilty of the crime of bigamy, because there is no fraudulent intent which is one of the essential elements of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br></blockquote>As gleaned from the Information in the RTC, the petitioner is charged with bigamy, a felony by <i>dolo </i>(deceit).&nbsp; Article 3, paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code provides that there is deceit when the act is performed with deliberate intent. Indeed, a felony cannot exist without intent. Since a felony by <i>dolo</i> is classified as an intentional felony, it is deemed voluntary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Although the words "with malice" do not appear in Article 3 of the Revised Penal Code, such phrase is included in the word "voluntary."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Malice is a mental state or condition prompting the doing of an overt act without legal excuse or justification from which another suffers injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; When the act or omission defined by law as a felony is proved to have been done or committed by the accused, the law presumes it to have been intentional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Indeed, it is a legal presumption of law that every man intends the natural or probable consequence of his voluntary act in the absence of proof to the contrary, and such presumption must prevail unless a reasonable doubt exists from a consideration of the whole evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>For one to be criminally liable for a felony by <i>dolo</i>, there must be a confluence of both an evil act and an evil intent.&nbsp; <i>Actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the prosecution proved that the petitioner was married to Gaña in 1975, and such marriage was not judicially declared a nullity; hence, the marriage is presumed to subsist.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; The prosecution also proved that the petitioner married the private complainant in 1996, long after the effectivity of the Family Code.<br><br>The petitioner is presumed to have acted with malice or evil intent when he married the private complainant.&nbsp; As a general rule, mistake of fact or good faith of the accused is a valid defense in a prosecution for a felony by <i>dolo</i>; such defense negates malice or criminal intent.&nbsp; However, ignorance of the law is not an excuse because everyone is presumed to know the law.&nbsp; <i>Ignorantia legis neminem excusat</i>.<br><br>It was the burden of the petitioner to prove his defense that when he married the private complainant in 1996, he was of the well-grounded belief that his first wife was already dead, as he had not heard from her for more than 20 years since 1975.&nbsp; He should have adduced in evidence a decision of a competent court declaring the presumptive death of his first wife as required by Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Article 41 of the Family Code.&nbsp; Such judicial declaration also constitutes proof that the petitioner acted in good faith, and would negate criminal intent on his part when he married the private complainant and, as a consequence, he could not be held guilty of bigamy in such case.&nbsp; The petitioner, however, failed to discharge his burden.<br><br>The phrase "or before the absent spouse has been declared presumptively dead by means of a judgment rendered on the proceedings" in Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code was not an aggroupment of empty or useless words.&nbsp; The requirement for a judgment of the presumptive death of the absent spouse is for the benefit of the spouse present, as protection from the pains and the consequences of a second marriage, precisely because he/she could be charged and convicted of bigamy if the defense of good faith based on mere testimony is found incredible.<br><br>The requirement of judicial declaration is also for the benefit of the State.&nbsp; Under Article II, Section 12 of the Constitution, the "State shall protect and strengthen the family as a basic autonomous social institution."&nbsp; Marriage is a social institution of the highest importance.&nbsp; Public policy, good morals and the interest of society require that the marital relation should be surrounded with every safeguard and its severance only in the manner prescribed and the causes specified by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; The laws regulating civil marriages are necessary to serve the interest, safety, good order, comfort or general welfare of the community and the parties can waive nothing essential to the validity of the proceedings.&nbsp; A civil marriage anchors an ordered society by encouraging stable relationships over transient ones; it enhances the welfare of the community.<br><br>In a real sense, there are three parties to every civil marriage; two willing spouses and an approving State.&nbsp; On marriage, the parties assume new relations to each other and the State touching nearly on every aspect of life and death.&nbsp; The consequences of an invalid marriage to the parties, to innocent parties and to society, are so serious that the law may well take means calculated to ensure the procurement of the most positive evidence of death of the first spouse or of the presumptive death of the absent spouse<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> after the lapse of the period provided for under the law.&nbsp; One such means is the requirement of the declaration by a competent court of the presumptive death of an absent spouse as proof that the present spouse contracts a subsequent marriage on a well-grounded belief of the death of the first spouse.&nbsp; Indeed, "men readily believe what they wish to be true," is a maxim of the old jurists.&nbsp; To sustain a second marriage and to vacate a first because one of the parties believed the other to be dead would make the existence of the marital relation determinable, not by certain extrinsic facts, easily capable of forensic ascertainment and proof, but by the subjective condition of individuals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Only with such proof can marriage be treated as so dissolved as to permit second marriages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code has made the dissolution of marriage dependent not only upon the personal belief of parties, but upon certain objective facts easily capable of accurate judicial cognizance,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> namely, a judgment of the presumptive death of the absent spouse.<br><br>The petitioner's sole reliance on Article 390 of the Civil Code as basis for his acquittal for bigamy is misplaced.<br><br>Articles 390 and 391 of the Civil Code provide – <br><blockquote>Art. 390.&nbsp; After an absence of seven years, it being unknown whether or not, the absentee still lives, he shall be presumed dead for all purposes, except for those of succession.<br><br>The absentee shall not be presumed dead for the purpose of opening his succession till after an absence of ten years.&nbsp; If he disappeared after the age of seventy-five years, an absence of five years shall be sufficient in order that his succession may be opened.<br><br>Art. 391.&nbsp; The following shall be presumed dead for all purposes, including the division of the estate among the heirs:&nbsp;  <br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">(1)</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">A person on board a vessel lost during a sea voyage, or an aeroplane which is missing, who has not been heard of for four years since the loss of the vessel or aeroplane;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(2)</td> <td> <div align="justify">A person in the armed forces who has taken part in war, and has been missing for four years;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>(3)</td> <td> <div align="justify">A person who has been in danger of death under other circumstances and his existence has not been known for four years.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></div></blockquote>The presumption of death of the spouse who had been absent for seven years, it being unknown whether or not the absentee still lives, is created by law and arises without any necessity of judicial declaration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Article 41 of the Family Code, which amended the foregoing rules on presumptive death, reads:<br><blockquote>Art. 41.&nbsp; A marriage contracted by any person during the subsistence of a previous marriage shall be null and void, unless before the celebration of the subsequent marriage, the prior spouse had been absent for <i>four consecutive years</i> and the spouse present had a well-founded belief that the absent spouse was already dead.&nbsp; In case of disappearance where there is danger of death under the circumstances set forth in the provisions of Article 391 of the Civil Code, <i>an absence of only two years shall be sufficient.<br></i><br><i>For the purpose of contracting the subsequent marriage under the preceding paragraph, the spouse present must institute a summary proceeding as provided in this Court for the declaration of presumptive death of the absentee, without prejudice to the effect of reappearance of the absent spouse.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br></blockquote>With the effectivity of the Family Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> the period of seven years under the first paragraph of Article 390 of the Civil Code was reduced to four consecutive years.&nbsp; Thus, before the spouse present may contract a subsequent marriage, he or she must institute summary proceedings for the declaration of the presumptive death of the absentee spouse,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> without prejudice to the effect of the reappearance of the absentee spouse.&nbsp; As explained by this Court in <i>Armas v. Calisterio</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><blockquote>In contrast, under the 1988 Family Code, in order that a subsequent bigamous marriage may exceptionally be considered valid, the following conditions must concur, <span style="font-style: italic;">viz.</span>: (a) The prior spouse of the contracting party must have been absent for four consecutive years, or two years where there is danger of death under the circumstances stated in Article 391 of the Civil Code at the time of disappearance; (b) the spouse present has a well-founded belief that the absent spouse is already dead; and (c) there is, unlike the old rule, a judicial declaration of presumptive death of the absentee for which purpose the spouse present can institute a summary proceeding in court to ask for that declaration.&nbsp; The last condition is consistent and in consonance with the requirement of judicial intervention in subsequent marriages as so provided in Article 41, in relation to Article 40, of the Family Code.<br></blockquote>The Court rejects petitioner's contention that the requirement of instituting a petition for declaration of presumptive death under Article 41 of the Family Code is designed merely to enable the spouse present to contract a valid second marriage and not for the acquittal of one charged with bigamy.&nbsp; Such provision was designed to harmonize civil law and Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code, and put to rest the confusion spawned by the rulings of this Court and comments of eminent authorities on Criminal Law.<br><br>As early as March 6, 1937, this Court ruled in <i>Jones v.

Aquino was of the view that "the provision of Article 349 or "before the absent spouse has been declared presumptively dead by means of a judgment reached in the proper proceedings" is erroneous and should be considered as not written.&nbsp; He opined that such provision presupposes that, if the prior marriage has not been legally dissolved and the absent first spouse has not been declared presumptively dead in a proper court proceedings, the subsequent marriage is bigamous.&nbsp; He maintains that the supposition is not true.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; A second marriage is bigamous only when the circumstances in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 83 of the Civil Code are not present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Former Senator Ambrosio Padilla was, likewise, of the view that Article 349 seems to require judicial decree of dissolution or judicial declaration of absence but even with such decree, a second marriage in good faith will not constitute bigamy.&nbsp; He posits that a second marriage, if not illegal, even if it be annullable, should not give rise to bigamy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; Former Justice Luis B.

Such rulings, however, conflict with Art. 349 of the Revised Penal Code providing that the present spouse must first ask for a declaration of presumptive death of the absent spouse in order not to be guilty of bigamy in case he or she marries again.<br><br>The above Article of the Family Code now clearly provides that for the purpose of the present spouse contracting a second marriage, he or she must file a summary proceeding as provided in the Code for the declaration of the presumptive death of the absentee, without prejudice to the latter's reappearance. This provision is intended to protect the present spouse from a criminal prosecution for bigamy under Art. 349 of the Revised Penal Code because with the judicial declaration that the missing spouses presumptively dead, the good faith of the present spouse in contracting a second marriage is already established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br></blockquote>Of the same view is former Dean Ernesto L.

For two years or so until the petitioner heartlessly abandoned her, the private complainant had no inkling that he was already married to another before <i>they</i> were married.<br><br>Thus, the private complainant was an innocent victim of the petitioner's chicanery and heartless deception, the fraud consisting not of a single act alone, but a continuous series of acts.&nbsp; Day by day, he maintained the appearance of being a lawful husband to the private complainant, who changed her status from a single woman to a married woman, lost the consortium, attributes and support of a single man she could have married lawfully and endured mental pain and humiliation, being bound to a man who it turned out was not her lawful husband.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup><br><br>The Court rules that the petitioner's collective acts of fraud and deceit before, during and after his marriage with the private complainant were willful, deliberate and with malice and caused injury to the latter.&nbsp; That she did not sustain any physical injuries is not a bar to an award for moral damages.&nbsp; Indeed, in <i>Morris v.

St. Rep. 721, the court said that a false representation by the defendant that he was divorced from his former wife, whereby the plaintiff was induced to marry him, gave her a remedy in tort for deceit.&nbsp; It seems to have been assumed that the fact that she had unintentionally violated the law or innocently committed a crime by cohabiting with him would be no bar to the action, but rather that it might be a ground for enhancing her damages.&nbsp; The injury to the plaintiff was said to be in her being led by the promise to give the fellowship and assistance of a wife to one who was not her husband and to assume and act in a relation and condition that proved to be false and ignominious.&nbsp; Damages for such an injury were held to be recoverable in Sherman v.
