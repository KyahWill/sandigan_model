On April 24, 1980, Leandro Rigonan executed the assailed Affidavit of Adjudication in favor of his son, Teodoro Rigonan (the deceased husband of Petitioner Delfina vda. de Rigonan).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Under this instrument, Leandro declared himself to be the sole heir of Hilarion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> while Teodoro obtained the cancellation of Tax Declaration No. 00267,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and acquired Tax Declaration No. 00667 in his own name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>During the same year, Teodoro mortgaged the subject property&nbsp; to the Rural Bank of Compostela of Cebu.&nbsp; Dreading foreclosure, he settled his obligations with the bank<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> by securing the aid of Spouses Valerio and Visminda Laude.&nbsp; On April 5, 1984, Teodoro executed the assailed Deed of Absolute Sale of Unregistered Land in favor of Valerio Laude,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> who then obtained Tax Declaration No. 00726 under the latter's name on May 10, 1984.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On November 10, 1993, respondents -- as the alleged heirs of Hilarion and <span style="font-style: italic;">pro indiviso</span> owners of the subject realty -- brought an action before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Danao City (Branch 25), <span style="font-style: italic;">first</span>, to recover the property; and, <span style="font-style: italic;">second</span>, to annul the Deed of Sale in favor of Laude<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> and the Affidavit of Adjudication, whose validity and authenticity they assailed on the ground of fraud.&nbsp; They likewise maintained that the subject property had not been partitioned among the heirs; thus, it was still co-owned at the time it was conveyed to Petitioner Laude.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Petitioners did not deny the imputed fraud in the execution of the Affidavit of Adjudication.&nbsp; They, however, averred that the document had no bearing on their claim of ownership, which had long pertained to the Rigonan spouses following the 1928 conveyance from the absolute owner, Lacambra.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> They theorized that the co-ownership over the property ended when the period for redemption lapsed without any action on the part of the co-owners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Therefore, the Rigonan spouses bought the property as legitimate vendees for value and in good faith, not in the capacity of redeeming co-owners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Petitioners likewise argued that they and their predecessors-in-interest had continuously owned and possessed the subject property for 72 years.&nbsp; Accordingly, acquisitive prescription had allegedly set in, in their favor, when the case was filed in 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Lastly, petitioners maintained that they were entitled to the equitable defense of laches.&nbsp; Respondents and their forebears were rebuked for not asserting their rights over the property for the past 72 years.&nbsp; They supposedly did so only after finding that the land had been developed, and that it had appreciated in value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>On appeal, the CA held that the Affidavit of Adjudication and the Deed of Absolute Sale were both void.&nbsp; The Affidavit was deemed fraudulent because of the undisputed factual finding that some of the heirs of Hilarion were still alive at the time of its execution; hence, the statement that Leandro was the sole heir was indubitably false.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The Deed of Sale in favor of Laude was held void because the vendor, Teodoro, had no legal right to dispose of the entire co-owned property.&nbsp; Moreover, the appellate court found that the evident purpose of the Contract was to deprive the other lawful heirs of their claims over the realty.&nbsp; Under Article 1409 (pars. 1 &amp; 2), of the Civil Code, the Contract was considered void ab initio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>As the Contracts were void, the defense of prescription was inapplicable.&nbsp; Article 1410 of the Civil Code states that actions for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract do not prescribe.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>As for the defense that the co-ownership ended when the period to redeem expired, the CA ruled that the redemption or repurchase by the Rigonan spouses did not end the state of co-ownership.&nbsp; At most, the repurchase gave rise to an implied trust in favor of the other co-owners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The CA added that prescription was inapplicable, because it did not run in favor of a co-owner as long as the latter recognized the co-ownership.&nbsp; In the present case, petitioners failed to show that the co-heirs, except Dolores, had repudiated their rights over the inherited property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The appellate court further ruled that Valerio Laude was not a buyer in good faith for two reasons; one, he had been forewarned by Respondent Ruben Derecho that the property was still co-owned; and, two, Valerio had admitted seeing the cancelled Tax Declaration under the name of the heirs of Hilarion.&nbsp; These matters should have alerted Valerio, who should have then exercised prudence as a buyer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Finally, the appellate court held that the action for recovery&nbsp; prescribed within ten years from the issuance of the Certificate of Title, which operated as a constructive notice.&nbsp; Considering, however, that the subject property was unregistered, the CA ruled that the prescriptive period should be reckoned from the issuance of the Tax Declaration on May 10, 1984.&nbsp; It concluded that the action was filed well within the period allowed by law for its recovery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;

To all intents and purposes, therefore, the vendors <span style="font-style: italic;">a retro ceased to be co-owners </span>on July 16, 1926.<br><br>Clearly then, the parties to the sale -- Leonardo, Apolinar, Andres, and Honorata (but not Dolores, as will be explained later), as well as all their successors-in-interest -- no longer had any legal interest in the disputed property, none that they could have asserted in this action.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Purchase Beyond the</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Redemption Period</span><br><br>As for Dolores, she reacquired legal interest in the property by virtue of the purchase in 1928, two years <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> the period to redeem had already expired.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>This purchase cannot be considered as a redemption in the concept of a <span style="font-style: italic;">pacto de retro</span> sale, which would imply that the period to redeem was extended long <span style="font-style: italic;">after </span>it had already expired.&nbsp; Such automatic extension is&nbsp; not possible because, as succinctly stated by Manresa, "if the extension is made after the expiration of the period, then it is void and of no effect because there is nothing to extend."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Adiarte v. Tumaneng</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> illustrates the legal effect of the expiration of the stipulated period for redemption.&nbsp; In that case, Amanda Madamba sold two parcels of land to Spouses Cirilo Agudong and Emiliana Tumaneng.&nbsp; However, she reserved for herself the right to repurchase the lots within ten years.&nbsp; Five years after the period expired, Agudong executed a Contract promising to resell the land to Madamba.&nbsp; When the former died without fulfilling his promise, the latter filed a suit to compel the widow to execute a deed of sale in the plaintiff's favor.&nbsp; The widow argued that Madamba could no longer redeem the property, because the period for redemption had already expired.<br><br>In debunking the widow's defense, this Court ruled that the Contract did not constitute a promise to resell, because the right to repurchase had been lost <span style="font-style: italic;">after the expiration of the stipulated period</span>.&nbsp; The original Contract of Sale with a right of repurchase <span style="font-style: italic;">no longer existed</span> at the time Agudong made the promise to sell.&nbsp; Therefore, the parties entered into an <span style="font-style: italic;">entirely new and independent</span> agreement to sell, which was binding on the widow.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Umale v. Fernandez,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> the Court ruled that the vendors were entitled to redeem the property despite the lapse of the period for redemption, inasmuch as the vendees had renounced their right.&nbsp; On April 13, 1905, a parcel of land was sold <span style="font-style: italic;">a retro</span> by Emigdio Umale and his wife to Spouses Fernandez, <span style="font-style: italic;">without</span> fixing any period for redemption. On June 12, 1909, Fernandez executed a Contract allowing the Umale spouses to redeem the land despite the lapse of the four-year period of redemption.&nbsp; This period was mandated by Article 1508<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> of the Spanish Civil Code for cases in which no period had been stipulated.&nbsp; In 1911, Emigdio Umale redeemed the land and took possession of it.<br><br>He then sued to compel the Fernandez couple to execute the instrument of redemption.&nbsp; The defendants countered that the land belonged to them, because the vendors had failed to redeem it within the term allowed by law.&nbsp; The Court ruled:<br><blockquote>"<span style="font-style: italic;">In the absence of an express stipulation </span>with regard to the period of redemption, the purchaser, in the exercise of the freedom to make contracts that is possessed by all, has the power to extend the period allowed by law, provided that the new period stipulated does not exceed the ten years fixed by article 1508 of the code.&nbsp; For nothing in this article prohibits an extension, by agreement, of the four years, which is the period prescribed by law in cases where, in sales with right of repurchase, no period for redemption has been fixed by the parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> [Emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote>In his Concurring Opinion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43] </sup>Justice Torres arrived at the same conclusion, but on a different ground.&nbsp; He explained that the contracting parties had no right to extend the legal period for redemption after it had already lapsed; and that, when the vendees alienated and returned the property afterwards, they did so by virtue of a new Contract of Sale, independent of and distinct from the previous one already terminated.<br><br>It is clear from <span style="font-style: italic;">Adiarte </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Umale</span> that after the expiration of the period for redemption, the parties could either (1) enter into an entirely new contract involving the same property; or (2) if they did not expressly stipulate the period, extend the time for redemption, provided the extension did not exceed the maximum period of ten years allowed by Article 1508.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In the present case, Lacambra and the heirs stipulated a five-year redemption period.&nbsp; When it lapsed, the vendee acquired absolute title, while the five co-owners-sellers were stripped of their co-ownership of the property.<br><br>Therefore, when Dolores repurchased the property in 1928, she did so in her personal capacity, no longer as a co-owner-seller.
