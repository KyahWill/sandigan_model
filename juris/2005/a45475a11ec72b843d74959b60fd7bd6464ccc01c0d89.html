No. 1986 does not violate respondents’ constitutional freedom of expression and of the press.<br><br>Respondents take the opposite stance.<br><br>The issue for our resolution is whether the MTRCB has the power or authority to review the “<span style="font-style: italic;">The Inside Story</span>” prior to its exhibition or broadcast by television.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The petition is impressed with merit.</span><br><br>The present controversy brings into focus the provisions of Section 3 of P. D. No. 1986, partly reproduced as follows:<br><blockquote>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">SEC. 3. <span style="font-style: italic;">Powers and Functions</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span> – The BOARD shall have the following functions, powers and duties:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x<br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">b)</span> To screen, review and examine <span style="font-weight: bold;">all</span> motion pictures as herein defined, <span style="font-weight: bold;">television programs</span>, including publicity materials such as advertisements, trailers and stills, whether such motion pictures and publicity materials be for theatrical or non-theatrical distribution, for television broadcast or for general viewing, imported or produced in the Philippines, and in the latter case, whether they be for local viewing or for export.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">c)</span> To approve or disapprove, delete objectionable portions from and/or prohibit the importation, exportation, production, copying, distribution, sale, lease exhibition and/or television broadcast of the motion pictures, television programs and publicity materials subject of the preceding paragraph, which, in the judgment of the BOARD applying contemporary Filipino cultural values as standard, are objectionable for being immoral, indecent, contrary to law and/or good customs, injurious to the prestige of the Republic of the Philippines or its people, or with a dangerous tendency to encourage the commission of violence or of a wrong or crime, such as but not limited to:<br><br>x&nbsp; x&nbsp; x<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">d)</span> To supervise, regulate, and grant, deny or cancel, permits for the importation, exportation, production, copying, distribution, sale, lease, exhibition, and/or television broadcast of all motion pictures, television programs and publicity materials, to the end and that no such pictures, programs and materials as are determined by the BOARD to be objectionable in accordance with paragraph (c) hereof shall be imported, exported, produced, copied, reproduced, distributed, sold, leased, exhibited and/or broadcast by television;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x.”<br></div></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Vis-a-vis</span> the foregoing provisions, our task is to decide whether or not petitioner has the power to review the television program “<span style="font-style: italic;">The Inside Story</span>.”&nbsp; The task is not Herculean because it merely resurrects this Court <span style="font-style: italic;">En Banc’s</span> ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Iglesia ni Cristo vs. Court of Appeals</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> There, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Iglesia ni Cristo</span> sought exception from petitioner’s review power contending that the term “<span style="font-style: italic;">television programs</span>” under Sec. 3 (b) does not include “religious programs” which are protected under Section 5, Article III of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> This Court, through Justice Reynato Puno, categorically ruled that P.D. No. 1986 gives petitioner “the power to screen, review and examine “<span style="font-style: italic;">all television programs</span>,”&nbsp; emphasizing the phrase “<span style="font-style: italic;">all television programs</span>,” thus:<br><blockquote>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">The law gives the Board the power to screen, review and examine <span style="font-style: italic;">all ‘television programs.</span></span>’&nbsp; By the clear terms of the law, the Board has the power to ‘approve, delete x x x and/or prohibit the x x x exhibition and/or television broadcast of x x x television programs x x x.’&nbsp;&nbsp; The law also directs the Board to apply ‘contemporary Filipino cultural values as standard’ to determine those which are objectionable for being ‘immoral, indecent, contrary to law and/or good customs, injurious to the prestige of the Republic of the Philippines and its people, or with a dangerous tendency to encourage the commission of violence or of a wrong or crime.’”<br></blockquote>Settled is the rule in statutory construction that where the law does not make any exception, courts may not except something therefrom, unless there is compelling reason apparent in the law to justify it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Ubi lex non distinguit nec distinguere debemos.&nbsp;</span> Thus, when the law says “<span style="font-style: italic;">all television programs</span>,” the word “<span style="font-style: italic;">all</span>” covers all television programs, whether religious, public affairs, news documentary, etc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The principle assumes that the legislative body made no qualification in the use of general word or expression.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>It then follows that since “<span style="font-style: italic;">The Inside Story</span>” is a television program, it is within the jurisdiction of the MTRCB over which it has power of review.<br><br>Here, respondents sought exemption from the coverage of the term “<span style="font-style: italic;">television programs</span>” on the ground that the “<span style="font-style: italic;">The Inside Story</span>” is a “public affairs program, news documentary and socio-political editorial” protected under Section 4,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Article III of the Constitution.&nbsp; Albeit, respondent’s basis is not freedom of religion, as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Iglesia ni Cristo</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> but freedom of expression and of the press, the ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Iglesia ni Cristo</span> applies squarely to the instant issue.&nbsp; It is significant to note that in <span style="font-style: italic;">Iglesia ni Cristo</span>, this Court declared that freedom of religion has been accorded a <span style="font-style: italic;">preferred status</span> by the framers of our fundamental laws, past and present, “designed to protect the broadest possible liberty of conscience, to allow each man to believe as his conscience directs x x x.”&nbsp; Yet despite the fact that freedom of religion has been accorded a <span style="font-style: italic;">preferred status</span>, still this Court, did not exempt the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Iglesia ni Cristo’s</span> religious program from petitioner’s review power.<br><br>Respondents claim that the showing of “<span style="font-style: italic;">The Inside Story</span>” is protected by the constitutional provision on freedom of speech and of the press.&nbsp; However, there has been no declaration at all by the framers of the Constitution that freedom of expression and of the press <span style="font-weight: bold;">has a preferred status</span>.<br><br>If this Court, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Iglesia ni Cristo</span>, did not exempt religious programs from the jurisdiction and review power of petitioner MTRCB, with more reason, there is no justification to exempt therefrom “<span style="font-style: italic;">The Inside Story</span>” which, according to respondents, is protected by the constitutional provision on freedom of expression and of the press, a freedom bearing <span style="font-weight: bold;">no preferred status</span>.<br><br>The only exceptions from the MTRCB’s power of review are those expressly mentioned in Section 7 of P. D. No. 1986, such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">(1)</span> television programs imprinted or exhibited by the Philippine Government and/or its departments and agencies, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">(2)</span> newsreels.&nbsp; Thus:<br><blockquote>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">SEC. 7. <span style="font-style: italic;">Unauthorized showing or exhibition.</span></span> – It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to exhibit or cause to be exhibited in any moviehouse, theatre, or public place or by television within the Philippines any motion picture, television program or publicity material, including trailers, and stills for lobby displays in connection with motion pictures, not duly authorized by the owner or his assignee and passed by the BOARD; or to print or cause to be printed on any motion picture to be exhibited in any theater or public place or by television a label or notice showing the same to have been officially passed by the BOARD when the same has not been previously authorized,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> except motion pictures, television programs or publicity material imprinted or exhibited by the Philippine Government and/or its departments and agencies, and newsreels.</span>”<br></blockquote>Still in a desperate attempt to be exempted, respondents contend that the “<span style="font-style: italic;">The Inside Story</span>” falls under the category of newsreels.<br><br>Their contention is unpersuasive.<br><br>P. D. No. 1986 does not define “newsreels.”&nbsp; Webster’s dictionary defines newsreels as short motion picture films portraying or dealing with current events.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> A glance at actual samples of newsreels shows that they are mostly reenactments of events that had already happened.&nbsp; Some concrete examples are those of Dziga Vertov’s Russian <span style="font-style: italic;">Kino-Pravda</span> newsreel series (<span style="font-style: italic;">Kino-Pravda</span> means literally “film-truth,” a term that was later translated literally into the French <span style="font-style: italic;">cinema verite</span>) and Frank Capra’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Why We Fight</span> series.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Apparently, newsreels are straight presentation of events. They are depiction of “actualities.”</span> Correspondingly, the MTRCB Rules and Regulations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> implementing P. D. No. 1986 define newsreels as “<span style="font-weight: bold;">straight news reporting, as distinguished from news analyses, commentaries and opinions.&nbsp; Talk shows on a given issue are not considered newsreels.”</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Clearly, the “<span style="font-style: italic;">The Inside Story</span>” cannot be considered a newsreel.&nbsp; It is more of a public affairs program which is described as a variety of news treatment; a cross between pure television news and news-related commentaries, analysis and/or exchange of opinions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Certainly, such kind of program is within petitioner’s review power</span>.<br><br>It bears stressing that the sole issue here is whether petitioner MTRCB has authority to review “<span style="font-style: italic;">The Inside Story</span>.”&nbsp; Clearly, we are not called upon to determine whether petitioner violated Section 4, Article III (Bill of Rights) of the Constitution providing that no law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, of oppression or the press.&nbsp; Petitioner did not disapprove or ban the showing of the program.&nbsp; Neither did it cancel respondents’ permit.&nbsp; Respondents were merely penalized for their failure to submit to petitioner “<span style="font-style: italic;">The Inside Story</span>” for its review and approval.&nbsp; Therefore, we need not resolve whether certain provisions of P. D. No. 1986 and the MTRCB Rules and Regulations specified by respondents contravene the Constitution.<br><br>Consequently, we cannot sustain the RTC’s ruling that Sections 3 (c) (d), 4, 7 and 11 of P. D. No. 1986 and Sections 3, 7 and 28 (a) of the MTRCB Rules and Regulations are unconstitutional.&nbsp; It is settled that no question involving the constitutionality or validity of a law or governmental act may be heard and decided by the court unless there is compliance with the legal requisites for judicial inquiry, namely: <span style="font-weight: bold;">(1)</span> that the question must be raised by the proper party; <span style="font-weight: bold;">(2)</span> that there must be an actual case or controversy; <span style="font-weight: bold;">(3)</span> that the question must be raised at the earliest possible opportunity; and, <span style="font-weight: bold;">(4)</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">that the decision on the constitutional or legal question must be necessary to the determination of the case itself</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, the instant petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span>.&nbsp; The assailed RTC Decision dated November 18, 1997 and Order dated August 26, 2002 are hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">REVERSED</span>.&nbsp; The Decision dated March 12, 1993 of petitioner MTRCB is <span style="font-weight: bold;">AFFIRMED</span>.&nbsp; Costs against respondents.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED.</span><br><br><i>Panganiban, (Chairman), Corona, Carpio-Morales,</i> and <i>Garcia, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Penned by Judge Normandie B.

For instance, much of the battle footage from the early 20th century was staged – the cameramen would usually arrive on site after a major battle and reenact scenes to film them.<br><br>In the Kino-Pravda series, Vertov focused on everyday experiences, eschewing bourgeois concerns and filming marketplaces, bars, and schools instead, sometimes with a hidden camera, without asking permission first.&nbsp; The stories were typically descriptive, not narrative, and included vignettes and exposes, showing for instance the renovation of a trolley system, the organization of farmers into communes, and the trial of Social Revolutionaries; one story shows starvation in the nascent Marxist state. Vertov’s driving vision was to capture “film-truth” – that is, fragments of actuality, which when organized together, have a deeper truth that cannot be seen with the naked eye.
