Paño</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> we held that Section 2 (c), requiring consultations with the appropriate local government units, should apply to national government projects affecting the environmental or ecological balance of the particular community implementing the project.&nbsp; Rejecting the petitioners' contention that Sections 2(c) and 27 of the Local Government Code applied mandatorily in the setting up of lotto outlets around the country, we held that:<br><blockquote>From a careful reading of said provisions, we find that these apply only to national programs and/or projects which are to be implemented in a particular local community. Lotto is neither a program nor a project of the national government, but of a charitable institution, the PCSO. Though sanctioned by the national government, it is far fetched to say that lotto falls within the contemplation of Sections 2 (c) and 27 of the Local Government Code.<br><br>Section 27 of the Code should be read in conjunction with Section 26 thereof.&nbsp; Section 26 reads: <br><blockquote>SECTION 26.&nbsp; Duty of National Government Agencies in the Maintenance of Ecological Balance. It shall be the duty of every national agency or government-owned or controlled corporation authorizing or involved in the planning and implementation of any project or program that may cause pollution, climatic change, depletion of non-renewable resources, loss of crop land, range-land, or forest cover, and extinction of animal or plant species, to consult with the local government units, nongovernmental organizations, and other sectors concerned and explain the goals and objectives of the project or program, its impact upon the people and the community in terms of environmental or ecological balance, and the measures that will be undertaken to prevent or minimize the adverse effects thereof.</blockquote>Thus, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the projects and programs mentioned in Section 27 should be interpreted to mean projects and programs whose effects are among those enumerated in Section 26 and 27, to wit, those that: (1) may cause pollution; (2) may bring about climatic change; (3) may cause the depletion of non-renewable resources; (4) may result in loss of crop land, range-land, or forest cover; (5) may eradicate certain animal or plant species from the face of the planet; and (6) other projects or programs that may call for the eviction of a particular group of people residing in the locality where these will be implemented</span>. Obviously, none of these effects will be produced by the introduction of lotto in the province of Laguna.&nbsp; (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>We reiterated this doctrine in the recent case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Bangus Fry Fisherfolk v. Lanzanas</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> where we held that there was no statutory requirement for the <span style="font-style: italic;">sangguniang bayan</span> of Puerto Galera to approve the construction of a mooring facility, as Sections 26 and 27 are inapplicable to projects which are not environmentally critical.<br><br>Moreover, Section 447, which enumerates the powers, duties and functions of the municipality, grants the <span style="font-style: italic;">sangguniang bayan</span> the power to, among other things, "enact ordinances, approve resolutions and appropriate funds for the general welfare of the municipality and its inhabitants pursuant to Section 16 of th(e) Code."&nbsp; These include:<blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="5%">(1)</td><td width="95%"> <div align="justify">Approving ordinances and passing resolutions to <span style="font-weight: bold;">protect the environment and impose appropriate penalties for acts which endanger the environment</span>, such as dynamite fishing and other forms of destructive fishing, illegal logging and smuggling of logs, smuggling of natural resources products and of endangered species of flora and fauna, slash and burn farming, <span style="font-weight: bold;">and such other activities which result in pollution, acceleration of eutrophication of rivers and lakes, or of ecological imbalance; </span>[Section 447 (1)(vi)]</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(2)</td><td><div align="justify"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prescribing reasonable limits and restraints on the use of property within the jurisdiction of the municipality, </span>adopting a comprehensive land use plan for the municipality, reclassifying land within the jurisdiction of the city, subject to the pertinent provisions of this Code, <span style="font-weight: bold;">enacting integrated zoning ordinances</span> in consonance with the approved comprehensive land use plan, subject to existing laws, rules and regulations; establishing fire limits or zones, particularly in populous centers; and regulating the construction, repair or modification of buildings within said fire limits or zones in accordance with the provisions of this Code; [Section 447 (2)(vi-ix)]</div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="justify"></div><br></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>(3)</td><td> <div align="justify">Approving ordinances which shall ensure the efficient and effective delivery of the basic services and facilities as provided for under Section 17 of this Code, and in addition to said services and facilities, ...<span style="font-weight: bold;">providing for the establishment, maintenance, protection, and conservation of communal forests and watersheds, tree parks, greenbelts, mangroves, and other similar forest development projects ...</span>.and, subject to existing laws, establishing and providing for the maintenance, repair and operation of an efficient waterworks system to supply water for the inhabitants and <span style="font-weight: bold;">purifying the source of the water supply; </span>regulating the construction, maintenance, repair and use of hydrants, pumps, cisterns and reservoirs; <span style="font-weight: bold;">protecting the purity and quantity of the water supply of the municipality and, for this purpose, extending the coverage of appropriate ordinances over all territory within the drainage area of said water supply and within one hundred (100) meters of the reservoir, conduit, canal, aqueduct, pumping station, or watershed used in connection with the water service;</span> and regulating the consumption, use or wastage of water."
