				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition assails the <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated 10 January 1997 of the Court of Appeals which affirmed the Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dated 25 October 1993 and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated 27 December 1993 of National Appellate Board (Board), Third Division, National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM).&nbsp; The Board’s ruling in turn, which likewise affirmed the <span style="font-style: italic;">Decision</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> dated 31 October 1992 of Acting PNP Chief and Police Deputy Director General dismissing PO3 Felino Quiambao from the police service.<br><br>The operative facts of the case follow:<br><br>On 22 December 1990, at around 8:00 in the evening, Espie Catolico (Catolico) was walking along Capulong Street in Tondo, Manila,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;inquiring as to the whereabouts of her housemaid Gynalin Garais who left the house the day before. After having asked her neighbors and bystanders to no avail, an old woman told her that a certain policeman was looking for her as her housemaid was in his custody. She went to the area as directed by the old woman but there she was allegedly accosted by petitioner, PO3 Felino Quiambao, a member of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Western Police District Command, and five (5) other persons. Quiambao and his companions forcibly took Catolico’s handbag and carried away its contents consisting of precious assorted merchandise, jewelry and other personal items worth approximately Nine Thousand Pesos (P9,000.00). Thereafter, petitioner forcibly herded Catolico to his owner-type jeep and brought her to the dimly lit portion of North Harbor and, while thereat, he slapped her on the face several times and warned her not to look anymore for her housemaid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In view of the incident, Catolico filed a sworn statement on 24 June 1991 with the PNP Inspectorate Division, accusing petitioner and six (6) others, with robbery-holdup and mauling committed on 22 December 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The complaint was corroborated by Grace Commendador who witnessed the actual incident and confirmed the statement of Catolico.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On 22 August 1991, Catolico filed another administrative complaint with the Office of the Hearing Officer at NAPOLCOM, Western Police District, Manila, charging petitioner with grave misconduct for the same incident which occurred on 22 December 1990.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;An investigation was conducted on this administrative charge by the Office of the Hearing Officer of NAPOLCOM. On 30 March 1993, the case was forwarded to the City of Manila’s People’s Law Enforcement Board (PLEB) for adjudication.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The PNP Inspectorate Division likewise conducted an investigation on the charges filed. On 31 October 1992, the Summary Dismissal Hearing Officer (SDHO) recommended the dismissal of petitioner. This recommendation was approved by Acting PNP Chief and Police Deputy Director General, Raul S. Imperial (Acting PNP Chief).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Petitioner appealed the 31 October 1992 resolution to the National Appellate Board (NAB) of the NAPOLCOM. On 25 October 1993, the Third Division of the NAB, rendered a decision affirming the dismissal of petitioner from police service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner was denied in a Resolution dated 27 December 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> But it was only on 23 September 1996 when petitioner received a certified xerox copy of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> of the NAB denying his petition for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On 7 October 1996, petitioner filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> On 10 January 1997, the appellate court dismissed the petition for review for lack of merit.<br><br>The appellate court ruled that the petition did not state all the&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;specific material dates showing that it was filed within the reglementary period provided by law as it failed to state the date when petitioner received a copy of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> of NAB dated 27 December 1993, denying his&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;motion for reconsideration of NAB’s decision dated 25 October 1993. It found out that NAB’s decision dated 25 October 1993 was received by petitioner on 22 November 1993, and on 2 December 1993, he filed his motion for reconsideration. The said motion, however, was denied on 27 December 1993, but according to the appellate court, petitioner did not disclose the date when he received such denial. The fifteen-day reglementary period for filing a petition for review with the Court of Appeals started to run from such date.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Further, the appellate court ruled that the issue of which administrative disciplinary authority had jurisdiction over the case was raised by petitioner only for the first time before it. He did not raise it before the SDHO nor before the NAB. More importantly, it found that the PNP Inspectorate Division had original, exclusive and summary jurisdiction over the instant case, and that NAB did not commit any reversible error in deciding the appealed case without a <span style="font-style: italic;">priori </span>pronouncement as to which among the disciplinary authorities under Republic Act No. 6975 had jurisdiction over the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> It also added that NAB’s not having all the records requested by petitioner after it had rendered its decision did not necessarily mean that it did not have such documents at the time it rendered its decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Petitioner’s claim was further belied by the fact that Catolico was able to obtain certified true copies of the relevant documents which the PNP Chief transmitted to the NAPOLCOM.<br><br>Additionally, the appellate court found that a perusal of the annexes to the comment of Catolico would readily show that NAB resolved petitioner’s case based on substantial evidence appearing on the record before it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> It observed that petitioner’s claim that his case was decided on the basis of an incomplete record was merely an afterthought. Said defense was not raised by petitioner in his motion for reconsideration of NAB’s decision dated 25 October 1993.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Likewise, petitioner was not denied due process as he was afforded reasonable opportunity to be heard and to submit his evidence before the SDHO and to appeal to NAB the decision of the Acting PNP Chief dismissing him from the police service, the Court of Appeals ruled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>On 27 January 1997, petitioner filed a <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Extension of Time to File Motion for Reconsideration</span> followed by the filing of his <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration</span> on 17 February 1997. On the same day, the appellate court issued a <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> denying petitioner’s motion for extension of time. On 5 March 1997, it issued a resolution stating that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration </span>was merely “NOTED,” the <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> dated 10 January 1997 being already final.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Hence, the instant judicial recourse.<br><br>The primordial thrust of the petition seeks the reversal of the decisions and resolutions of Acting PNP Chief, the NAB and the Court of Appeals, all upholding the validity of the dismissal of petitioner from police service, and his corresponding reinstatement in the police service.<br><br>Petitioner argues that the appellate court erred and acted without or in excess of jurisdiction and/or with grave abuse of discretion in holding that the petition is not meritorious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> He specifically assigns the following as errors which need to be rectified, to wit: (1) that the appellate court ruled that petition did not state the date when petitioner received a copy of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> of NAB dated 27 December 1993 to determine if it was filed within the reglementary period;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> (2) that the appellate court sustained the findings of the Acting PNP Chief and the NAB without first resolving and/or giving a reason why it was the Acting PNP Chief and neither the NAPOLCOM Hearing Officer nor the PLEB that had the power to hear and decide the case;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> (3) that the appellate court sustained, through misapprehension of facts and/or contrary to evidence, the decision of NAB which was not based on the complete records of the case;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> (4) that the&nbsp; appellate court ruled that the petition was not meritorious and sustained the findings of the Acting PNP Chief and the NAB although such findings were arrived at without a hearing and absent substantial evidence;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (5) that the appellate court’s denial of the motion for reconsideration was based on purely technical considerations;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and (6) that the appellate court had been passive to Catolico’s surreptitious introduction into the records of the case evidentiary documents of which petitioner was not furnished and to the latter’s prejudice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The petition is not imbued with merit.<br><br>Readily glaring upon examination of the petition filed by petitioner is its title “Petition for Review on Certiorari.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The title would immediately lead us to conclude that the petition is primarily anchored on Rule 45 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure. Under this mode of appeal, only questions of law may be entertained by this Court and factual issues raised are beyond the ambit of this review. Yet, the issues raised by petitioner in the petition are fundamentally factual in nature which are inappropriate for resolution via the mode of review he availed of.<br><br>However, a perusal of issues in the petition would indicate that the petition is actually anchored on Rule 65 as the issues principally sought to assail the resolution rendered by the appellate court on the ground of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Nonetheless, even assuming that the petition was brought under Rule 65, the petition would still not lie as the implausibility of the grounds on which the petition rests are convincingly manifest and the grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction as the core of this mode of review is strikingly wanting.<br><br>Grave abuse of discretion means such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment which is equivalent to an excess, or a lack of jurisdiction, and the abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion or hostility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> In <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari</span> proceedings under Rule 65, questions of fact are not generally permitted, the inquiry being limited essentially to whether or not the respondent tribunal had acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> These grounds under Rule 65 are not attendant in the instant case. Even if we take this case as so exceptional as to permit a factual review, the petition at bar fails to persuade us to rule in favor of petitioner.<br><br>Petitioner contends that the appellate court acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in holding that the petition was not meritorious since the petition filed with the appellate court did not state the date when petitioner received a copy of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Resolution</span> of NAB dated 27 December 1993 to determine if the petition was indeed filed within the reglementary period. There is reason basis for such contention.<br><br>The petition with the appellate court by petitioner substantially complied with Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>.&nbsp; The pertinent portion of the circular reads,<br><blockquote>SECTION 6. <span style="font-style: italic;">Contents of the petition.</span> – The petition for review shall (a) state the full names of the parties to the case, without impleading the court or agencies either as petitioners or respondents; (b) contain a concise statement of the facts and issues involved and the grounds relied upon for the review; (c) be accompanied by a clearly legible duplicate original or a certified true copy of the award, judgment, final order or resolution appealed from, together with certified true copies of such material portions of the record as are referred to therein and other supporting papers; and (d) contain a sworn certification against forum shopping as provided in Revised Circular No. 28-91. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The petition shall state the specific material dates showing that it was filed within the period fixed herein.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></blockquote>The records reveal that the petition filed with the Court of Appeals by petitioner provides the following,<br><blockquote>18. On December 27, 1993, respondent National Appellate Board rendered its Resolution denying the motion in this manner:<br><br>WHEREFORE, finding no merit on this instant petition, the same is hereby denied.</blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">A certified xerox copy thereof, duly RECEIVED BY PETITIONER ON SEPTEMBER 23, 1996 is hereto attached as ANNEX “M.”</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>A reading of the foregoing allegation, however, disclosed the fact that on 27 December 1993, NAB rendered a resolution denying petitioner’s motion for reconsideration. Although it would seem anomalous as it is unnatural that the purported resolution was received only by petitioner on 23 September 1996, we are inclined to sustain petitioner’s assertion for the same is supported by the certified xerox copy of the resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> and the evidence is bereft of any showing that will warrant a contrary conclusion. Thus, the aforecited allegation substantially complied with the requirements under Section 6. The appellate court believed that petitioner had already been served with a copy of the resolution prior to 23 September 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> Such a conclusion, however, is bereft of any evidentiary basis and, thus, has no leg to stand on. It is noteworthy that the date when petitioner received NAB’s resolution denying his motion for reconsideration is material in determining when the fifteen (15)-day reglementary period for filing a petition for review with the Court of Appeals starts to run.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The failure to specifically state in the petition on material dates such as the date when the resolution or order denying a motion for reconsideration was received is a ground for dismissal in accordance with Section 7 of the administrative circular and Rule 43.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> But the scenario is not present in the case at bar for the aforecited paragraph 18 of the petition filed with the appellate court reflected the date when petitioner actually received the resolution denying his motion for reconsideration, which is 23 September 1996. Procedural rules must be liberally interpreted and applied so as not to frustrate substantial justice that this Court seeks to achieve.<br><br>Now, on substantial issues rather than on mere technicality. The pivotal questions posed in this petition are whether the Acting Chief of the PNP had authority to conduct summary dismissal proceedings over members of the PNP and whether the summary dismissal of petitioner was sufficiently established by the evidence on record.<br><br>Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6975 or the <span style="font-style: italic;">Department of the Interior and Local Government Act of 1990,</span> which took effect on 1 January 1991, defines the structural components, powers and functions of the PNP as the citizens’ guardian of peace and order and enforcer of the law. The statute likewise delineates the procedural framework in pursuing administrative complaints against erring members of the police organization. Section 41 of the law enumerates the authorities to which a complaint against an erring member of the PNP may be filed, thus;<br><blockquote>Section 41. (a) <span style="font-style: italic;">Citizen’s Complaints.</span> – Any complaint by an individual person against any member of the PNP shall be brought before the following:<br><br>(1) Chiefs of police, where the offense is punishable by withholding of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; privileges, restriction to specified limits, suspension or forfeiture of salary, or any combination thereof, for a period not exceeding fifteen (15) days;<br><br>(2) Mayors of cities or municipalities, where the offense is punishable by withholding of privileges, restriction to specified limits, suspension or forfeiture of salary, or any combination thereof, for a period of not less than sixteen (16) days but not exceeding thirty (30) days;<br><br>(3) <span style="font-weight: bold;">People’s Law Enforcement Board</span>, as created under Section 43 hereof, where the offense is punishable by withholding of privileges, restriction to specified limits, suspension or forfeiture of salary, or any combination thereof, for a period exceeding thirty (30) days; or <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">by dismissal</span>. . . . (Emphasis added)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote>It is readily apparent that a complaint against a PNP member which would warrant dismissal from service is within the jurisdiction of the PLEB. However, Section 41 should be read in conjunction with Section 42 of the same statute which reads, thus:<br><blockquote>Sec. 42. <span style="font-style: italic;">Summary Dismissal Powers of the PNP Chief and Regional Directors.</span> - The <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Chief of the PNP and regional directors</span>, after due notice and summary hearings, may immediately remove or dismiss any respondent PNP member in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">any</span> of the following cases:<br><br>(a) When the charge is serious and the evidence of guilt is strong;<br><br>(b) When the respondent is a recidivist or has been repeatedly charged and there are reasonable grounds to believe that he is guilty of the charges; and<br><br>(c) When the respondent is guilty of conduct unbecoming of a police officer. (Emphasis ours)</blockquote>Evidently, the PNP Chief and regional directors are vested&nbsp; with the power to summarily dismiss erring PNP members if any of the causes for summary dismissal enumerated in Section 42 is attendant. Thus, the power to dismiss PNP members is not only the prerogative of PLEB but concurrently exercised by the PNP Chief and regional directors. This shared power is likewise evident in Section 45.<br><blockquote>SEC. 45. <span style="font-style: italic;">Finality of Disciplinary Action.</span> – The disciplinary action imposed upon a member of the PNP shall be final and executory: Provided, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">That a disciplinary action imposed by the regional director or by the PLEB involving demotion or dismissal from the service</span> may be appealed to the regional appellate board within ten (10) days from receipt of the copy of the notice of decision: Provided, further, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">That the disciplinary action imposed by the Chief of the PNP involving demotion or dismissal may be appealed to the National Appellate Board within ten (10) days from receipt thereof</span>: <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided, furthermore,</span> That the regional or National Appellate Board, as the case may be, shall decide the appeal within sixty (60) days from receipt of the notice of appeal: Provided, finally, That failure of the regional appellate board to act on the appeal within said period shall render the decision final and executory without prejudice, however, to the filing of an appeal by either party with the Secretary. (Emphasis ours)<br><br>Once a complaint is filed with any of the disciplining authorities under R.A. No. 6975, the latter shall acquire exclusive original jurisdiction over the case although other disciplining authority has concurrent jurisdiction over the case. Paragraph (c) of Section 41 explicitly declares this point.<br><br>(c) <span style="font-style: italic;">Exclusive Jurisdiction</span> – <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">A complaint or a charge filed against a PNP member shall be heard and decided exclusively by the disciplining authority who has acquired original jurisdiction over the case and notwithstanding the existence of concurrent jurisdiction as regards the offense;</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Provided,</span> That offenses which carry higher penalties referred to a disciplinary authority shall be referred to the appropriate authority which has jurisdiction over the offense. (Emphasis ours)</blockquote>Clearly, the PLEB and the PNP Chief and regional directors have concurrent jurisdiction over administrative cases filed against members of the PNP which may warrant dismissal from service.<br><br>This Court in <span style="font-style: italic;">Summary Dismissal Board and the Regional Appellate Board, PNP, Region VI, Iloilo City v. Torcita</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> recognized the authority of both the Summary Dismissal Board and the Regional Appellate Board of the PNP, Region VI, Iloilo City, to act on twelve (12) administrative complaints filed against C/Insp. Lazaro Torcita, even though the controversy occurred in 1994, after the effectivity of R.A. No. 6975. The Court further declared that R.A. No. 6975 defines the summary dismissal powers of the PNP Chief and regional directors, among others in cases, “where the respondent is guilty of conduct unbecoming of a police officer.”<br><br>Memorandum Circular No. 92-006 prescribes the rules and regulations in the conduct of summary dismissal proceedings against erring PNP members and defines conduct unbecoming of&nbsp; a police officer under Section 3(c), Rule II, as follows:<br><blockquote>Conduct unbecoming of a police officer refers to any behavior or action of a PNP member, irrespective of rank, done in his official capacity, which, in dishonoring or otherwise disgracing himself as a PNP member, seriously compromise his character and standing as a gentleman in such a manner as to indicate his vitiated or corrupt state of moral character; it may also refer to acts or behavior of any PNP member in an unofficial or private capacity which, in dishonoring or disgracing himself personally as a gentleman,&nbsp; seriously&nbsp;&nbsp; compromises&nbsp; his&nbsp; position as a PNP member and exhibits himself as morally unworthy to remain as a member of the organization.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></blockquote>The same Memorandum Circular also defines the phrase “serious charge” as a ground for summary dismissal of PNP members. This includes charges for commission of heinous crimes and those committed by organized/syndicated crime groups wherein PNP members are involved, gunrunning, illegal logging, <span style="font-style: italic;">robbery</span>, kidnapping for ransom, white slave trade, illegal recruitment, carnapping, smuggling, piracy, drug trafficking, falsification of land title and other government forms, large scale swindling, film piracy, counterfeiting, and bank frauds. Clearly, the robbery-holdup and mauling incident which occurred on 22 December 1990 fall under the summary dismissal power of PNP Chief and regional directors.<br><br>In the case at bar, the complaint for grave misconduct against petitioner was first filed by Catolico before the PNP Inspectorate Division on 24 June 1991. However, another case was filed by Catolico with the Office of the Hearing Officer, NAPOLCOM, WPD, on 22 August 1991. The charges filed with the PNP Inspectorate Division were investigated, and on 31 October 1992, the SDHO recommended the dismissal of petitioner which was approved by the Acting PNP Chief. Petitioner appealed the case to the NAB which affirmed the decision of the Acting PNP Chief. The motion for reconsideration was also denied. Thus, in accordance with paragraph (c) of Section 41, the PNP Inspectorate Division had acquired exclusive original jurisdiction over the complaint of Catolico to the exclusion of other investigating body. It is as if the second complaint filed by Catolico with the Office of the Hearing Officer, NAPOLCOM, WPD, had not been filed.<br><br>Even assuming <span style="font-style: italic;">ex gratia argumenti</span> that the Acting PNP Chief and the NAB were bereft of jurisdiction to rule on the complaint filed by Catolico, petitioner, at the earliest opportunity, neither raised the issue of lack of jurisdiction before the PNP Inspectorate Division nor with the NAB but only before the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Despite the existence of a jurisprudential rule<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> that jurisdictional question may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, an equitable exceptional rule has also been laid down by this Court bars a party from raising jurisdictional question on ground of laches or estoppel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Although the lack of jurisdiction of a court may be raised at any stage of the action, a party may be estopped from raising such questions if he has actively taken part in the very proceedings which he questions, belatedly objecting to the court’s jurisdiction in the event that the judgment or order subsequently rendered is adverse to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Petitioner also argues that the appellate court erred in affirming the findings of the Acting PNP Chief and the NAB, which was arrived at without hearing and substantial evidence. We are not persuaded.<br><br>Summary dismissal proceedings are governed by specific requirements of notification of the charges together with copies of affidavits and other attachments supporting the complaints, and the filing of an answer, together with supporting documents. It is true that consistent with its summary nature, the duration of the hearing is limited, and the manner of conducting the hearing is summary, in that sworn statements may take the place of oral testimonies of witnesses, cross-examination is confined only to material and relevant matters, and prolonged arguments and dilatory proceedings shall not be entertained.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>Notably, the recommendation of the SDHO was approved by the Acting PNP Chief whose decision was affirmed by the NAB. The findings of the NAB was also affirmed by the Court of Appeals. The unanimity in their conclusions cannot just be disregarded and their factual determinations are conclusive upon this Court for the records show that petitioner was afforded reasonable opportunity to defend his side, as he filed position papers to substantiate his defense and arguments and even filed motions for reconsideration to set aside adverse decisions rendered against him. This opportunity to defend himself was more than sufficient to comply with due process requirements in administrative proceedings<br><br>Well-entrenched is the rule that courts will not interfere in matters which are addressed to the sound discretion of the government agency entrusted with the regulation of activities coming under the special and technical training and knowledge of such agency. Administrative agencies are given a wide latitude in the evaluation of evidence and in the exercise of their adjudicative functions, latitude which includes the authority to take judicial notice of facts within their special competence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>The instant case filed by Catolico is an administrative case for grave misconduct against petitioner for the alleged robbery-holdup and mauling incident that took place on 22 December 1990. In resolving administrative cases, conduct of full-blown trial is not indispensable to dispense justice to the parties. The requirement of notice and hearing does not connote full adversarial proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> Submission of position papers may be sufficient for as long as the parties thereto are given the opportunity to be heard. In administrative proceedings, the essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard, or an opportunity to explain one’s side or opportunity to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> This constitutional mandate is deemed satisfied if a person is granted an opportunity to seek reconsideration of an action or a ruling.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> It does not require trial-type proceedings similar to those in the courts of justice. Where opportunity to be heard either through oral arguments or through pleadings is accorded, there is no denial of procedural due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><br>In administrative proceedings, only substantial evidence or that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion is required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Thus, findings of fact of quasi-judicial agencies are generally accorded respect and even finality by the Supreme Court, if supported by substantial evidence, in recognition of their expertise on the specific matters under their consideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> Thus, factual determinations made by the SDHO and the NAB as affirmed by the Court of Appeals are undoubtedly beyond review and conclusive upon this Court, they being triers of facts. The congruence in their conclusion forecloses any possibility of reversible error or misappreciation of facts.

Besides, prior thereto, appeallant (sic) was pointed at and identified as the one responsible for the concealment of complainant’s maid, for which reason a personal confrontation between the parties ensued. Under these circumstances it is highly improbable to maintain that both parties did not know each other’s identity.<br><br>Regarding appellant’s claim that he was exonerated in the administrative aspect of the case by the People’s Law Enforcement Board of Manila, no written decision was submitted in support thereof.
