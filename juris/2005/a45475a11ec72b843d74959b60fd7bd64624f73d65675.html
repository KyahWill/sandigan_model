				<BR><BR><div align="justify">At bottom, the resolution of this case hinges on the credibility of the witnesses and their testimonies.&nbsp; Since the factual findings of the lower courts are disparate, this Court painstakingly reviewed the records.&nbsp; It found no sufficient reason to disbelieve the well-explained findings and equally logical conclusions of the trial court.&nbsp; The evidence proffered by respondent even corroborated relevant portions of those of petitioner.&nbsp; Thus, the evidence supported the ruling of the trial court that the acquittal of petitioner was based on its reasonable finding that she had not committed the crime imputed to her.&nbsp; Consequently, she incurred no civil liability for the alleged offense.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Case</span><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to reverse the July 31, 2001 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and the August 30, 2002 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 53715.&nbsp; The challenged Decision disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the assailed order is <span style="font-weight: bold;">REVERSED </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold;">SET ASIDE.</span>&nbsp; [Petitioner] JOSEPHINE SANCHEZ is hereby ordered to pay [Respondent] Far East Bank and Trust Company, the amount of One Million One Hundred Eighty Seven Thousand Five Hundred Thirty Pesos and Eighty Six Centavos (P1,187,530.86) as actual damages.&nbsp; This is without prejudice to [petitioner]'s recourse of reimbursement from the other persons who participated in the transactions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br></blockquote>The assailed Resolution denied reconsideration.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Facts</span><br></div><br>The antecedents of the case are related by the CA as follows:<br><blockquote>"It is undisputed that Kai J. Chin was the director and representative of Chemical Bank.&nbsp; Its subsidiary, the Chemical International Finance Limited (CIFL), was an investor in [Respondent] Far East Bank and Trust [C]ompany (FEBTC),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x.&nbsp; In representing the interest of CIFL in FEBTC, Chin was made a director and sr. vice president of FEBTC.&nbsp; [Petitioner] Josephine Sanchez was, in turn, assigned as secretary of Chin.&nbsp; CIFL also maintained a checking account (CA# 0009-04212-1) in FEBTC's investment arm, the Far East Bank Investment, Inc. (FEBII).&nbsp; Chin was one of the authorized signatories in the said current and money market accounts.<br><br>"According to [respondent], [petitioner] made unauthorized withdrawals from the account of CIFL in FEBTC through the use of forged or falsified applications for cashier's checks which were deposited to her personal accounts.&nbsp; Once credited to her account, she withdrew the amounts and misappropriated, misapplied and converted them to her personal benefit and advantage, to the damage of FEBTC.<br><br>"[Petitioner supposedly] employed three modes in the said fraudulent transactions, namely:<br><br>"In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">First Mode</span>, [petitioner] caused the issuance of a cashier's check payable to 'bearer' with number 461390, dated September 29, 1992, in the sum of P250,040.86.&nbsp; This is the subject of Crim. Case No. 93-126175.&nbsp; She presented a forged letter of confirmation bearing the forged signature of Chin addressed to Beatriz Bagsit, Cash Department Head of FEBTC.&nbsp; This check was paid pursuant to the said confirmation.&nbsp; [Petitioner] immediately deposited this check to her FEBTC Savings Account No. 0101-39109-9 and on September 30, 1992, she withdrew P200,040.86.<br><br>"Under the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Second Mode</span>, [petitioner] filed applications forms to purchase cashier's checks payable to her, [with] Chin as the supposed purchaser. Said applications were accompanied by a forged memorandum of Chin confirming [petitioner] as the payee-beneficiary. After the approval by Bagsit of the applications and memoranda, checks were issued, as follows:<br><br><table ï¿½="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td style="text-align: center;">Check No.<br><br> </td> <td style="text-align: center;">Date<br><br></td> <td style="text-align: center;">Amount<br><br></td> <td style="text-align: center;">Exhibit<br><br></td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">461739</td> <td style="text-align: center;">10/22/92</td> <td style="text-align: center;">P489,450.00</td> <td style="text-align: center;">'F'</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center;">461963</td> <td style="text-align: center;">04/11/92</td> <td style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;

Chin referred the matter to the FEBTC's audit division for further investigation. All the cashier's checks, funded by an unauthorized debit against the CIFL account, as well as the corresponding applications for their issuance were examined at the Philippine National Police Crime Laboratory.&nbsp; All of Chin's signatures borne on all the checks and applications were found to have been good forgeries.&nbsp; With the damage done, FEBTC had to reimburse the CIFL account and ultimately suffered the total misappropriated amount of P3,787,530.86."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote>The main defense of petitioner consisted of a denial of the forgeries.&nbsp; She asserted that she had deposited the checks to her account, under the authority and instructions of Kai Chin.&nbsp; Afterwards, petitioner withdrew the amounts and gave them to him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Kai Chin denied that he had given that authority to her, and insisted that she had signed the subject documents.&nbsp; However, he did not rebut her testimony that she had turned over the proceeds of the checks to him.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ruling of the Trial Court</span><br></div><br>The Regional Trial Court (RTC) did not find Kai Chin to be a credible witness.&nbsp; According to the RTC, FEBTC's records showed that, contrary to his testimony, he had expressly authorized petitioner to transact matters concerning Chemical Bank's account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The trial judge doubted the integrity of the findings and the report of the PNP handwriting expert.&nbsp; He noted the nonuse during the handwriting analysis of Kai Chin's contemporaneous signatures.&nbsp; Besides, the examination was initiated unilaterally by FEBTC officials, who had submitted sample signatures of their own choice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The RTC added that the allegedly fraudulent transactions had occurred from September 1992 to June 1993, with the use of documents bearing the signatures of other officials and employees of respondent.&nbsp; In other words, all the questioned transactions had been approved and allowed by the bank officials concerned, despite apparent procedural infirmities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Yet, only petitioner was indicted.<br><br>Thus, the RTC disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>"FOR ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the Court finds and so holds that the prosecution failed to prove the culpability of the accused in any of these cases with moral certainty, and consequently acquits her from all the charges, with costs <span style="text-decoration: underline;">de oficio.</span>&nbsp; Her bail bonds are released and the hold departure order as well as the order of attachment are lifted."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>Subsequently, respondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the civil aspect of the RTC Decision.&nbsp; In an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> dated March 20, 1996, the trial court denied reconsideration.&nbsp; Quoting portions of its Decision, the RTC said in its Order that the acquittal of the accused "was not exactly on the ground of 'reasonable doubt,' but that she was not the author of the frauds allegedly perfpetrated (sic)."&nbsp; Thus, it held that "no civil liability against her may properly be made."<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>Granting respondent's appeal, the appellate court ruled that the trial court's judgment of acquittal did not preclude recovery of civil indemnity based on a quasi delict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>&nbsp; The CA held that the outcome of the criminal case, whether conviction or acquittal, was inconsequential in adjudging civil liability arising from the same act that could also be considered a quasi delict.&nbsp; Moreover, FEBTC did not have to reserve its right to file a separate civil action for damages, because the law had already made that reservation on respondent's behalf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The CA further held that, contrary to the trial court's clarifications in its March 20, 1996 Order, petitioner had been acquitted merely on reasonable doubt arising from insufficiency of evidence to establish her identity as perpetrator of the crime.&nbsp; Her acquittal was not due to the nonexistence of the crime for which civil liability could arise.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; Although it agreed with the RTC that forgery had not been satisfactorily proven by FEBTC, the CA nonetheless found petitioner liable for her failure to turn over to respondent the proceeds of the checks.&nbsp; The failure supposedly constituted an actionable fraud.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Thus, the appellate court ordered petitioner to pay respondent P1,187,530.86 as actual damages, representing the value of the checks that had been paid in her name and to her account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Issues</span><br></div><br>Petitioner raises the following issues for this Court's consideration:<br><blockquote>"(1) Whether the judgment of conviction had already become final at the time the motion for reconsideration of the civil aspect was filed by the complainant-appellant?<br><br>"(2) Whether an appeal on the civil aspect may be made from a decision in a criminal case acquitting the accused for being not the author of the crime?<br><br>"(3) Whether a separate civil action is necessary to be instituted after the accused is acquitted in a criminal case based on reasonable doubt?<br><br>"(4) Whether the civil aspect of the criminal offenses where the accused was acquitted may be pursued by a party other than the offended parties?&nbsp; Otherwise stated, whether the civil liability may be pursued by a party which is not a real party in interest after the acquittal of the accused of the offenses charged?"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>The Petition is meritorious.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">First Issue:</span><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Timeliness of the</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Motion for Reconsideration</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></div><br>Because the RTC Decision had been promulgated on December 15, 1995, and respondent's Motion for Reconsideration was filed two months after, on February 14, 1996, petitioner instantly concludes that the Motion was filed out of time.<br><br>Respondent, however, contends that the time for filing the Motion should be counted from February 1, 1996 -- when it received the trial court's Decision -- not from the date of notice to the public prosecutor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>&nbsp; To determine the period for filing from the latter date would undermine the dual aspects of a criminal litigation, in which the right of the offended party to appeal the civil aspect is independent of the decision of the accused on whether or not to appeal the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>We uphold respondent on this issue.&nbsp; Section 6 of Rule 122 of the Rules of Court states as follows: <br><blockquote>"SEC. 6.<span style="font-style: italic;"> When appeal to be taken.</span> – An appeal must be taken within fifteen (15) days from promulgation of the judgment or from notice of the final order appealed from.&nbsp; This period for perfecting an appeal shall be suspended from the time a motion for new trial or reconsideration is filed until notice of the order overruling the motion has been served upon the accused or his counsel at which time the balance of the period begins to run."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br></blockquote>Clearly, the period <span style="font-style: italic;">available to the accused</span> for filing an appeal is fifteen (15) days from the promulgation of the judgment or from notice of the final order appealed from.&nbsp; As early as <span style="font-style: italic;">Landicho v. Tan</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the Court has held that one who desires a review of a criminal case must appeal within fifteen days from the date the decision or judgment was announced in open court in the presence of the accused, or was promulgated in the manner set forth in Section 6 of Rule 116 (now Section 6<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of Rule 120) of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; This ruling was reiterated in <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Tamani,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> in which the Court has further clarified that the word <span style="font-style: italic;">promulgation </span>in the old provision should be construed as referring to "judgment;" and <span style="font-style: italic;">notice</span>, to "order."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>The above ruling, however, is relevant and applicable to the <span style="font-style: italic;">accused </span>who appeals.&nbsp; In the present case, we are confronted with the Motion filed by the<span style="font-style: italic;"> private offended party</span> for reconsideration of the <span style="font-style: italic;">civil aspect</span> of the RTC judgment.&nbsp; It should also be noted that she was not required to be present during the promulgation of the judgment.<br><br>In a long line of cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> as far back as <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Ursua,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> this Court has ruled that the appeal period accorded to the accused should also be available to the offended party who seeks redress of the civil aspect of a decision.&nbsp; Similarly, courts may apply this ruling to the filing of a motion for reconsideration of a judgment.&nbsp; For them to do so will be consistent with this Court's policy of giving lower tribunals a chance to rectify their possible errors<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> and thereby promote the speedy and just disposition of controversies.<br><br>The relevant question is, when should the period for the filing of a motion by a private offended party begin?&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Neplum v. Orbeso</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> this Court explained that the period begins to toll upon service of the notice of judgment upon the offended party.&nbsp; Thus:<br><blockquote>"Indeed, the rules governing the period of appeal in a purely civil action should be the same as those covering the civil aspects of criminal judgments.&nbsp; If these rules are not completely identical, the former may be suppletory to the latter.&nbsp; x x x.&nbsp; Being akin to a civil action, the present appeal may be guided by the Rules on Civil Procedure."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>In the case before us, respondent undisputedly claims that petitioner received notice of the RTC Decision only on February 1, 1996.&nbsp; Records show that FEBTC filed its Motion for Reconsideration on February 14, 1996.&nbsp; The Motion was thus filed within the reglementary period.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Second, Third and Fourth Issues:</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Civil Liability in Case of Acquittal</span><br></div><br>Being interrelated, the second, third and fourth issues will be discussed together.<br><br>Petitioner contends that her acquittal was not based merely on reasonable doubt, but on the determination that she was not the author of the imputed felonies.&nbsp; She reiterates the trial court's ruling in its March 20, 1996 Order that she could not be held civilly liable, because she was not responsible for the crimes charged.<br><br>Arguing on the assumption that she was acquitted on the basis of reasonable doubt, petitioner explains that the appellate court was nevertheless precluded from taking cognizance of the civil aspect of the case, as a separate civil action should have been filed after the judgment of acquittal.&nbsp; She contends that Article 29 of the Civil Code, which mandates the courts to make a finding on the civil liability in case of an acquittal based on reasonable ground, applies only to situations when a crime has been committed but the accused is exempt from criminal liability under the instances enumerated in Article 12 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Petitioner finally argues that the real party-in-interest is not respondent, but Chemical Bank and/or Kai Chin, the owners of the accounts from which the withdrawals were made.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, asserts that the offended party may appeal the civil aspect of the criminal proceeding despite the judgment of acquittal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Civil Action Deemed Instituted</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">in the Criminal Proceeding</span><br><br>Article 100 of the RPC states that every person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly liable.&nbsp; This rule holds true, except in instances when no actual damage results from an offense, such as espionage, violation of neutrality, flight to an enemy country, and crime against popular representation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Clearly, the extinction of the penal liability does not always carry with it the extinction of the civil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Article 29 of the Civil Code, if the acquittal is made on the ground that the guilt has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, the accused may be held civilly liable for damages arising from the same act or omission constituting the offense.&nbsp; As in any ordinary civil case, the liability may be established by a mere preponderance of evidence.<br><br>Section 1 of Rule 111 of the 1985 Rules of Court, the prevailing law during the trial of this case below,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> provided the consequences of acts that produced both civil and criminal liabilities, as follows: <br><blockquote>"SECTION 1.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Institution of criminal and civil actions.</span> – (a) When a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged shall be deemed instituted with the criminal action unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves the right to institute it separately or institutes the civil action prior to the criminal action.<br><br>"Such civil action includes recovery of indemnity under the Revised Penal Code, and damages under Articles 32, 33, 34 and 2176 of the Civil Code of the Philippines arising from the same act or omission of the accused.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

C, C-1 and D) and part of the amount thereof was subsequently withdrawn by her (Exh.

H-2 and I-2 were deposited by her in her personal account.&nbsp; According to the accused the drawing of the checks in her name and their encashments and deposit to her account were upon the authority and instructions of Kai Chin, and that the values thereof were all turned over to Kai Chin.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Re: Crim.

Case No. 93-126175, the value of the Cashier's Checks involve[d] were debited from the Chemical account.&nbsp; Kai Chin is undisputably one of the authorized signatories to the Chemical account, and under ordinary course of things, he must be the payee and/or beneficiary of the checks.<br><br>"Initially, Kai Chin sweepingly testified as follows: <br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">'Q:</td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">In her capacity as your secretary, when she was your secretary did Josephine Sanchez have anything to do with the Chemical International Finance account?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>'A: </td> <td> No, sir.&nbsp; (tsn, p. 9, 8 Nov 1994)' <br></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>"The records of the bank and FEBII, however, show otherwise.&nbsp; Thus, as early as April, 1992, Kai Chin had already authorized the accused to transact matters concerning the Chemical account, through a memorandum he sent to Mrs. Beatriz Bagsit and one Ms. Enriquez, reading as follows:<br><br>'This is to request for the following:<br><blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;">'1) Ms. Enriquez to partially terminate the amount of P250,000.00 from the CIF's placement (P3M) and credit the same to SA#0101-58459-8 maintained at Intramuros Branch.<br><br>'2) Ms. Bagsit to debit SA#0101-58459-8 for P290,000.00 and entrust the same to my Secretary, Ms. Jo Sanchez for proper disposition.<br></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><div style="margin-left: 40px;">'In view of my home leave/business trip scheduled on April 29-June 8, 1992, the above requests will be confirmed by Ms. Sanchez upon my instructions before the end of May, 1992.&nbsp; (Memo [dated] 28 April 1992, attached as Annex B to Exh. 2.)'<br></div><br>"Kai Chin never denied his signature on this document, either on direct evidence or on rebuttal (as he was not presented as a rebuttal witness)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br></blockquote>The authority conferred by Kai Chin upon petitioner was also borne out by the reports of the FEBTC Investigating Committee, pertinent parts of which were quoted in the RTC Decision as follows:<br><blockquote>"4.&nbsp; Initial interview with the officers of FEBII disclosed the following:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">'4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January, 1992, Mr. Kai Chin personally went to the office of MS.

Thus, the critical issue in the present appeal is this: was the civil liability of petitioner duly established by the evidence?<br><br>Answering in the affirmative, the CA explained that a single act or omission may produce two forms of civil liability:&nbsp; one is for <span style="font-style: italic;">ex delicto</span> or that which arises from a crime under our penal statutes; and the other is for a quasi delict or <span style="font-style: italic;">culpa extra-contractual.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the present case, civil liability <span style="font-style: italic;">ex delicto</span> was foreclosed by the acquittal.&nbsp; Nonetheless, "[a]lthough the act from which the civil liability might arise did not exist due to [petitioner's] acquittal, [respondent's] cause of action makes out a case of quasi delict."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Contrary to the trial court, the CA disbelieved petitioner's assertions that she had turned over the proceeds of the checks to Kai Chin.&nbsp; Granting that she was authorized to encash the checks, she supposedly had no like authority to deposit the proceeds to her personal bank account.&nbsp; The appellate court concluded that, in breach of Article 33<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> of the Civil Code, "she abused the confidence reposed in her by [respondent] in the performance of her duty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp;

These are the most significant factors in evaluating the sincerity of witnesses and in unearthing the truth, especially in the face of conflicting testimonies.&nbsp; Through its observations during the entire proceedings, the trial court can be expected to determine, with reasonable discretion, whose testimony to accept and which witness to disbelieve."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>Barring arbitrariness and oversight of facts that might affect the result of the case otherwise, the RTC's assessment of the witnesses and their testimonies in this case binds even this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup>&nbsp; In any event, we scoured the records and, unlike the CA, we found no sufficient reason to reject the trial court's assessment.&nbsp; There was no arbitrariness or oversight of any fact or circumstance of weight and influence to justify a different conclusion.<br><br>Moreover, the CA based its imposition of civil liability upon petitioner on her supposed abuse of her employer's confidence.&nbsp; Granting for the sake of argument that she indeed forged the checks and misappropriated the proceeds to her personal benefit, it must be recalled that it was Kai Chin's signatures that she purportedly forged; and CIFL's account that she, in effect, misappropriated.&nbsp; Be it remembered that respondent's own documentary evidence unequivocally concurred in the assertion of petitioner that Kai Chin had given her express authority to transact CIFL's account on his behalf.&nbsp; Consequently, it was his, not respondent's, confidence that she had exploited.&nbsp; In other words, the factual premises of the CA did not support its conclusion.<br><br>In sum, we hold that petitioner's acquittal was based on the fact that she had not committed the offense imputed to her.&nbsp; Consequently, she cannot be held civilly liable.&nbsp; In concluding that she, as well as her testimony, was credible, the trial court cannot be faulted with arbitrariness or negligence.&nbsp; Tellingly, her testimony that she turned over the proceeds of the subject checks to Kai Chin stands unrebutted.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;

People </span>(427 SCRA 456, April 14, 2004, per Panganiban, J.) thus:<br><blockquote>"Section 1 of Rule 111 of the current Rules of Criminal Procedure provides: <br><blockquote>'When a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged shall be deemed instituted with the criminal action unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves the right to institute it separately or institutes the civil action prior to the criminal action.'<br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>"Only the civil liability of the accused arising from the crime charged is deemed impliedly instituted in a criminal action, that is, unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves the right to institute it separately, or institutes it prior to the criminal action. Hence, the subsidiary civil liability of the employer under Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code may be enforced by execution on the basis of the judgment of conviction meted out to the employee.<br><br>"It is clear that the 2000 Rules deleted the requirement of reserving independent civil actions and allowed these to proceed separately from criminal actions.&nbsp; Thus, the civil actions referred to in Articles 32, 33, 34 and 2176 of the Civil Code shall remain 'separate, distinct and independent' of any criminal prosecution based on the same act.&nbsp; Here are some direct consequences of such revision and omission:<br><blockquote>"1. The right to bring the foregoing actions based on the Civil Code need not be reserved in the criminal prosecution, since they are not deemed included therein.<br><br>"2. The institution or the waiver of the right to file a separate civil action arising from the crime charged does not extinguish the right to bring such action.<br><br>"3. The only limitation is that the offended party cannot recover more than once for the same act or omission.<br><br>"What is deemed instituted in every criminal prosecution is the civil liability arising from the crime or delict per se (civil liability <span style="font-style: italic;">ex delicto</span>), but not those liabilities arising from quasi-delicts, contracts or quasi-contracts.&nbsp; In fact, even if a civil action is filed separately, the <span style="font-style: italic;">ex delicto</span> civil liability in the criminal prosecution remains, and the offended party may -- subject to the control of the prosecutor – still intervene in the criminal action, in order to protect the remaining civil interest therein."<br></blockquote></blockquote><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Roa v.
