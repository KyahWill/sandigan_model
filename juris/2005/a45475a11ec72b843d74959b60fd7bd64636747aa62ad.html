Paguyo, et al.</i>, wherein the RTC of Makati City, Branch 57, rendered a decision on 20 January 1988 approving a Compromise Agreement made between the Armases and the petitioners.&nbsp; The compromise agreement provided that in consideration of the total sum of One Million Seven Hundred Thousand Pesos (P1,700,000.00), the Armases committed to execute in favor of petitioners a deed of sale and/or conveyance assigning and transferring unto said petitioners all their rights and interests over the parcel of land containing an area of 299 square meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In order for the petitioners to complete their title and ownership over the lot in question, there was an urgent need to make complete payment to the Armases, which at that time stood at P917,470.00 considering that petitioners had previously made partial payments to the Armases.<br><br>On 29 November 1988, in order to raise the much needed amount, petitioner Lourdes Paguyo entered into an agreement captioned as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Receipt of Earnest Money</span> with respondent Pierre Astorga, for the sale of the former's property consisting of the lot which was to be purchased from the Armases, together with the improvements thereon, particularly, the existing building known as the Paguyo Building, under the following terms and conditions as stated in the document, to wit:<br><blockquote>RECEIVED from MR. PIERRE M. ASTORGA the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND (P50,000.00) PESOS (U.C.P.B. Manager's Check No. 013085 dated November 29, 1988) as earnest money for the sale of our property consisting of a parcel of land designated as Lot 12 located at Makati Avenue, Makati, Metro Manila, covered by and described in T.C.T. No. 154806 together with the improvements thereon particularly the existing building known as the Paguyo Bldg. under the following terms and conditions:<br><ol><li>The earnest money (Exh.

Nevertheless, the parties maintained their business relationship under the terms and conditions of the above-mentioned Receipt of Earnest Money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On 12 December 1988, petitioners asked for and were given by respondents an additional P50,000.00 to meet the former's urgent need for money in connection with their construction business.&nbsp; Due also to the urgent necessity of obtaining money to finance their construction business, petitioner Lourdes Paguyo, who was also the attorney-in-fact of her husband, proposed to the respondents the separate sale of the building in question while she continued to work on the acquisition of the lot from the Armas family, assuring the respondents that she would succeed in doing so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Aware of the risk of buying an improvement on the lot of a third party who appeared ambivalent on whether to dispose their property in favor of the respondents, respondents took a big business gamble and, relying on the assurance of petitioners that they would eventually acquire the lot and transfer the same to respondents in accordance with their undertaking in the Receipt of Earnest Money, respondents agreed to petitioner Lourdes Paguyo's proposal to buy the building first.&nbsp; Thus, on 5 January 1989, the parties executed the four documents in question namely, the Deed of Absolute Sale of the Paguyo Building, the Mutual Undertaking, the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage, and the Deed of Assignment of Rights and Interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Simultaneously with the signing of the four documents, respondents paid petitioners the additional amount of P500,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>&nbsp; Thereafter, the respondents renamed the Paguyo Building into GINZA Bldg. and registered the same in the name of respondent St. Andrew Realty, Inc. at the Makati Assessor's Office after paying accrued real estate taxes in the total amount of P169,174.95.&nbsp; Since 1990, respondents paid the real estate taxes on subject building as registered owners thereof.&nbsp; Further, respondents obtained fire insurance and applied for the conversion of Paguyo Building into a condominium.&nbsp; All of these acts of ownership exercised by respondents over the building were with the express knowledge and consent of the petitioners.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to their agreement contained in the aforecited documents, particularly in the Mutual Undertaking,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> respondent company filed an ejectment case and obtained a favorable decision against petitioners in the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Makati in Civil Case No. 40050.&nbsp; The case reached this Court which affirmed the decision of the MeTC in favor of respondent company.&nbsp; This decision had already been executed and the respondent company is now in possession of the building.&nbsp; Accordingly, respondents continued to exercise acts of full ownership, possession and use over the building.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On 06 October 1989, petitioners filed a Complaint for the rescission of the <b>Receipt of Earnest Money</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> with the undertaking to return the sum of P763,890.50.&nbsp; They also sought the rescission of the <b>Deed of Real Estate Mortgage</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> the <b>Mutual Undertaking, the Deed of Absolute Sale of Building</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and the <b>Deed of Assignment of Rights and Interest.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <br><br>In their complaint, petitioners alleged that respondents Astorga and St. Andrew Realty, Inc., led them to believe that they would advance the P917,470.00, which was needed by petitioners to complete payment with the Armases, with the understanding that said amount would simply be deducted from the P7 Million total consideration due them for the sale of the lot and the building as agreed upon in their Receipt of Earnest Money.&nbsp; The same, however, did not materialize because instead of making available the check for the said amount, respondents did not produce the amount and even ordered the "stop payment" of the same before it could be deposited in court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Respondents, in their Answer, however, interjected that as gleaned from the <b>Receipt of Earnest Money</b>, the <b>Mutual Undertaking</b>, the <b>Deed of Assignment of Rights and Interest</b>, their original intention was to purchase the Paguyo Building and the lot on which it stands <i>simultaneously</i>.&nbsp; Respondents interposed that at the time the decision on the compromise agreement between petitioners and Armases was rendered, petitioners were badly in need of money because they were financing their construction business and, with the balance payable to the Armases, the former were in a huff to produce an amount sufficient to cover both transactions.&nbsp; Thus, petitioners prevailed upon respondents to purchase the Paguyo Building first with the lot to follow after petitioners have successfully acquired it from the Armas family.<br><br>Respondents, likewise, stated in their Answer that sometime in July of 1989, petitioners asked respondent corporation to execute a check in the amount of P917,470.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> for the final execution of the Deed of Conveyance of the lot, saying that they were finally able to&nbsp; negotiate the purchase of the lot owned by the Armases.&nbsp; To settle the transaction, respondent corporation again complied.&nbsp; After investigation, however, respondents learned that petitioners were not in the position to deliver the land, all the rights and interest thereof having allegedly been transferred already to spouses Rodolfo and Aurora Bacani.&nbsp; They were able to confirm this after obtaining a copy of a letter dated 22 September 1989 of petitioners' counsel (same counsel representing them presently) to the Register of Deeds of Makati a month prior to the filing of the instant case.&nbsp; The letter stated:<br><blockquote>Ms. Mila Flores<br>Register of Deeds<br>Makati, Metro Manila<br><br>Dear Ms. Flores:<br><br>We represent the <i>spouses Rodolfo and Aurora Bacani, who happen to be the assignees of all the rights and interests that the couple Domingo and Lourdes Paguyo have over that parcel of land located along Makati Avenue, the particulars and description of which are indicated on TCT No. 154806 which, for reasons we perceive to be not legitimate, was cancelled.</i><br>. . .<br><div align="right">(SGD.)

Article 1191 states: <br><blockquote>The power to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him.<br><br>The injured party may choose between the fulfillment and the rescission of the obligation, with the payment of damages in either case. He may also seek rescission, even after he has chosen fulfillment, if the latter should become impossible.<br><br>The court shall decree the rescission claimed, unless there be just cause authorizing the fixing of a period.<br><br>This is understood to be without prejudice to the rights of third persons who have acquired the thing, in accordance with Articles 1385 and 1388 and the Mortgage Law.<br></blockquote>The law speaks of the right of the "injured party" to choose between rescission or fulfillment of the obligation, with the payment of damages in either case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Here, petitioners claim to be the injured party and consequently seek the rescission of the Deed of Absolute Sale of the Building and the other documents in question.&nbsp; Petitioners aver that they are entitled to cancel the Deed of Sale altogether in view of fraud, gross inadequacy of price, mistake, and undue influence.<br><br>To boost their claim that the Deed of Absolute Sale was intended merely to document the cash outlays of respondents, petitioners say that the P600,000.00 consideration as contained in the Deed of Absolute Sale of the 5-storey Paguyo building is a far cry from the P3 Million valuation attached to it by respondent Astorga himself and the building's fair market value of P2,848,000.00 assessed by the Cuervo Appraisers, Inc.<br><br>We find no such inadequacy of consideration in the case at bar.&nbsp; <i>For one</i>, on top of the P600,000.00 which petitioners received, respondents had to shoulder the accrued real estate taxes of P169,174.95.&nbsp; <i>For another</i>, respondent Pierre Astorga explained that said price was what St. Andrew Realty, Inc., believed as value for their money inasmuch as the building stands on the lot owned by another and there were separate owners of the land, who appear reluctant to sell it.&nbsp; <i>For a third</i>, said amount was arrived at considering the depreciated value of the building and in view of the economic and political uncertainties in the country at that time, marked by a series of <i>coup d'etat</i>, which caused real estate prices to plummet.&nbsp; Respondent Astorga was explicit on this score <i>â€“</i><blockquote>ATTY. JOSE<br><br>Q:There was statement here by Mrs. Paguyo that this document entitled the deed of absolute sale of a building marked Exhibit "9" was not expressive of the intention of the parties meaning to say that she did not intend to sell the said building and one of the reasons she tried to raise was the fact that the building was only sold for P500,000.00, what can you say to that?<br><br>A: Well, the P500,000.00 amount that she would want to impress to be an inadequate amount is what we in St. Andrew's end believed as value for money <b>for the reason that the building stands on the lot she does not own and there were separate owners and apparent conflict between them even the seeming impossibility of getting the lot ...</b><br><br>Q: By the way, before the plaintiffs decided to dispose the building or sell the building by virtue of this deed of sale marked Exhibit "98" was your company ever interested in acquiring the said building?<br><br>A: The building alone, no. In fact, on December 21 when we had the problem as to acquiring the lot, we did not part with any payment to Mrs. Paguyo demonstrating that we had really and truly intended a simultaneous buy of the building and the lot to acquire the property simultaneously the building and as well as the lot.<br><br>Q: Now, you mentioned that you are a realtor, I will ask you the same question, which Atty. Almeyda asked me when I was on the witness stand, as a realtor will you please tell the court what would be your appraisal of the value of the building?<br><br>ATTY. COLOMA<br><br>-Objection, your Honor. May we know if the witness is going to express an opinion or is he testifying now as an expert realtor?<br><br>COURT<br><br>-As an opinion but it would not bind the Court.<br><br>WITNESS<br><br>-I can explain to you.<br><br>ATTY. JOSE<br><br>-Yes, please explain.<br><br>WITNESS<br><br>A:Okay, appraisal can take many forms if its appraised value based on the construction cost it could be different from appraising per se the building. That is now existing in that address also appraisal will depend on where the building is and there is only one owner of the building and the lot. As the case here is, the building in a manner of speaking stands on thin air.&nbsp; That is so including depreciation and timing that we were doing in this transaction which was 1989, my appraisal will be in the range of a Million may be.<br><br>Q: You made mentioned the word timing in 1989, why did you mention that?<br><br>A: Well, '89 was not the best real estate year. In fact, we have a boom in 1988 but prices were already deep during this year such that it is in 1988 when it could have been another price. But this transaction happened or entered into in 1989, there were no interested buyers during that time, sir.<br><br>Q: Why?<br><br>A: coup de etat was one, and many other issue on hand that causes value to take deep.<br><br>Q: You mentioned that word depreciation, will you please explain to us what that depreciation has got to do with that building?<br><br>A: In appraisal terms the building is in an economic line in every year of which a certain value is allocated as depreciation for wear and tear for breakdowns and all that is depreciation. This is deductible from the amount of the building (sic).<br><br>Q: Before you went into this agreement with the plaintiff Paguyo have you inspected the building?<br><br>A: Yes, sir. Thoroughly, sir.<br><br>Q: Will you please explain to the court the size of the building and the description of the building?<br><br>A: That building is five (5) storey it has only one (1) unit per floor, sir. There is a narrow stairway that leads up to the penthouse.&nbsp; It is, I would say, in an advance deteriorating stage, it needed some renovations here and there.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Moreover, Articles 1355 and 1470 of the Civil Code state:<br><blockquote>Art. 1355.&nbsp; Except in cases specified by law, lesion <b><i>or inadequacy of cause shall not invalidate a contract</i></b>, unless there has been fraud, mistake or undue influence.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br><br>Art. 1470.&nbsp; <b>Gross inadequacy of price does not affect a contract of sale</b>, except as may indicate a defect in the consent, or that the parties really intended a donation or some other act or contract.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioners herein failed to prove any of the instances mentioned in Articles 1355 and 1470 of the Civil Code, which would invalidate, or even affect, the Deed of Sale of the Building and the related documents.&nbsp; Indeed, there is no requirement that the price be equal to the exact value of the subject matter of sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In <i>Sps. Buenaventura v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> the Court was unequivocal:<br><blockquote>Courts cannot follow one every step of his life and extricate him from bad bargains, protect him from unwise investments, relieve him from one-sided contracts, or annul the effects of foolish acts.&nbsp; Courts cannot constitute themselves guardians of persons who are not legally incompetent.&nbsp; Courts operate not because one person has been defeated or overcome by another, but because he has been defeated or overcome <i>illegally</i>.&nbsp; Men may do foolish things, make ridiculous contracts, use miserable judgment, and lose money by them <i>â€“</i> indeed, all they have in the world; but not for that alone can the law intervene and restore.&nbsp; There must be, in addition, a <i>violation</i> of the law, the commission of what the law knows as an <i>actionable</i> wrong, before the courts are authorized to lay hold of the situation and remedy it. (Emphases in the original)<br></blockquote>What is more, petitioners would wish to convince this Court that petitioner Lourdes Paguyo was naÃ¯ve enough to accept at face value the assurance of respondent Astorga that the Deed of Sale was merely to document respondents' cash outlay.<br><br>Far from being the naÃ¯ve and easy to fleece lady that she wants this Court to perceive her to be, evidence on record reveals that petitioner Lourdes Paguyo is in reality an astute businesswoman, having insured that legal minds would be available at her disposal at the time she entered into the transactions she now impugns.&nbsp; As she herself admitted in her testimony before the trial court, during her receipt of the earnest money and during the transactions subject of the instant case, her lawyers, one Atty. Lalin and a certain Atty. CariÃ±o, assisted her.&nbsp; She testified as follows: <br><blockquote>ATTY. JOSE<br><br>Wait, wait, your Honor. I have one question. Now, madam witness, you mentioned that you were accompanied by a certain Atty. Molina when you executed the receipt of the earnest money with me. Now, during the transaction of this subject matter, you will also recall that at times you were represented in dealing with me as counsel for defendant corporation by Atty. Lalin and Atty.
