In support of her allegations, complainant presented the joint affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of Nelson Broncano and Maryann Gonzales-Broncano.<br><br>In his Counter-Affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> respondent Romeo S. Gatcheco, Jr. admitted going to complainant's house on September 11, 2003 to request her to execute an affidavit of desistance regarding her administrative complaint against him. He alleged that upon reaching the house, he called "<span style="font-style: italic;">tao po</span>" and asked the girl who answered him "<span style="font-style: italic;">andyan ba ang mama mo?</span>"  She replied "<span style="font-style: italic;">andito po</span>," then called her mother loudly who was inside the room.  When complainant went out of the room, he introduced himself and greeted her "<span style="font-style: italic;">good evening po, si Sheriff Gatcheco po ito</span>."  She replied "<span style="font-style: italic;">ikaw pala, tuloy ka, maupo ka, pasensya ka na sa bahay naming magulo,</span>" then offered him a seat.  He asked complainant to execute an affidavit of desistance but she replied "<span style="font-style: italic;">tanungin ko muna kay Judge Plata.</span>"  Upon hearing her reply, he asked, "<span style="font-style: italic;">bakit pa po nyo itatanong e kayo naman po ang complainant hindi naman sya?</span>"  She replied "<span style="font-style: italic;">baka magalit sa akin si Judge (Plata).</span>"  He told complainant in a pleading tone, "<span style="font-style: italic;">kasama ko nga po ang misis ko at mga anak, nandoon sila sa tricycle, tulog kasi yung bunso ko kalong ni misis at saka umuulan pa.</span>" Still, complainant refused to execute an affidavit of desistance so he told her "<span style="font-style: italic;">alam kong alam niyo na hindi totoo yung bintang nyo, bahala lang po kayo.</span>"  Then he left the house.<br><br>In her Counter-Affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> respondent Interpreter Ma. Anita Gloria C. Gatcheco contended that the allegations in the complaint are all lies and fabricated. She claimed that on September 11, 2003 at about 5:00 in the afternoon, her husband and their two (2) sons fetched her from the office at San Andres, Santiago City. Together, they proceeded to La Salette University to fetch their daughter but since the latter was still having a lyre and bugle practice, they decided to see complainant to beg her to withdraw the complaint she filed with the Supreme Court against her husband.  She did not alight from the tricycle so only her husband proceeded to complainant's house. After about fifteen (15) minutes, the latter returned and told her that complainant refused to withdraw her complaint. Thereafter, they returned to La Salette University to fetch their daughter. Both respondents presented the affidavit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> of Perlita Sagawinit Mangano to support their claim.<br><br>The matter was referred to Judge Fe Albano Madrid, Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Santiago City, Branch 21, for investigation, report and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In her report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Judge Madrid stated that she scheduled three (3) hearings on October 8, November 12 and November 26, 2004 but complainant failed to appear despite notice.  On account of her non-appearance, respondents opted to submit the case for resolution based on the documents submitted.<br><br>Judge Madrid found respondents guilty of unbecoming conduct.  The investigating judge pointed out that the initial conversation between complainant and respondents must have been polite, friendly and conciliatory. After all, respondent Sheriff went to the house of the complainant to ask her to sign an affidavit of desistance.  It was only when complainant refused to sign that respondent Sheriff became angry and uttered the remarks complained of.<br><br>Judge Madrid did not lend credence to the claim of respondent Ma. Anita Gloria G. Gatcheco that she did not go to complainant's house.  According to the Investigating Judge, it is more logical for respondent Ma. Anita Gloria G. Gatcheco to accompany her husband and talk to complainant on a woman-to-woman level. Judge Madrid also observed that there was no reason for complainant to implicate respondent Sheriff's wife if she was not there and also uttered abusive remarks.<br><br>For such misconduct, Judge Madrid recommended that respondents be admonished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The OCA agreed with the findings of the investigating Judge but recommended that respondents be reprimanded instead.<br><br>Time and again, the Court has stressed that persons involved in the administration of justice ought to live up to the strictest standard of honesty and integrity in the public service. The conduct of every personnel connected with the courts should, <span style="font-style: italic;">at all times</span>, be circumspect to preserve the integrity and dignity of our courts of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Certainly, respondents should not take advantage of their public office in order to oppress or abuse others. This Court has always reminded court personnel that they are part and parcel of the administration of justice and, therefore, <span style="font-style: italic;">whether on or off duty</span>, they should set the example for obedience and respect for the law. They should always remember that boorish and overbearing behavior can only bring their office to disrepute and erode public respect for them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>From the standpoint of conduct and demeanor expected of those who belong to the judicial family, resort to intemperate language only detracts from the respect due those who work in the judiciary and becomes self-destructive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Respondents need to be reminded that government service is people-oriented where high-strung behavior and belligerent attitude cannot be allowed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Patience is an essential part of dispensing justice and courtesy is a mark of culture and good breeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Belligerent behavior has no place in government service where personnel are enjoined to act with self-restraint and civility at all times even when confronted with rudeness and insolence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Maintaining the dignity of courts and enforcing the duty of the citizens to respect them are necessary adjuncts to the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Respondents departed from the judicial decorum demanded of them when they used intemperate and insulting language towards the complainant. Worse, they should know that pressuring anyone to withdraw a complaint is certainly repulsive and unbecoming.  They should be sanctioned for such deplorable behavior.<br><br>An inquiry with the OCA discloses that aside from this case, respondent Sheriff has been administratively charged <span style="font-style: italic;">eight</span> (8) other times.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Of these cases, one (1) has been dismissed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> while six (6) are still pending.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Last January 17, 2005, respondent Sheriff was found guilty of <span style="font-style: italic;">Grave Misconduct, Dishonesty and Conduct Grossly Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service</span>, suspended for one (1) year without pay and warned that a commission of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely in <span style="font-style: italic;">Aldoma v. Gatcheco</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Respondent Ma. Anita Gloria G. Gatcheco is no better.  With this administrative complaint, she has been administratively indicted four (4) times,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> one (1) has been dismissed<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> while two (2) are still pending,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> excluding this case.<br><br>The malfeasance of respondents is classified as a light offense under Section 52 [C], Rule IV, of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service</span> and carries with it the penalty of reprimand, for the first offense, suspension of 1-30 days for the second, and dismissal for the third.<br><br>Given the prevailing facts of this case, the Court finds the penalty of reprimand hardly commensurate with respondent Sheriff's administrative malfeasance as he has been previously - and more severely - chastised. Considering that this is his second offense, the prescribed penalty of suspension should be imposed in its maximum.<br><br>As regards respondent Interpreter Ma. Anita Gloria G. Gatcheco, we agree with the OCA that the penalty of reprimand should be imposed considering that this is her first offense.<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, for Conduct Unbecoming their positions as employees of the Judiciary, respondent Sheriff III Romeo S.
