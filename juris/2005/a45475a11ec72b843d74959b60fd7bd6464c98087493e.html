Savellano (Savellano) to the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) on 24 June 1986.&nbsp; Through his sworn statement, private respondent Savellano informed the BIR that PNB had failed to withhold the 15% final tax on interest earnings and/or yields from the money placements of PNOC with the said bank, in violation of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1931.&nbsp; P.D. No. 1931, which took effect on 11 June 1984, withdrew all tax exemptions of government-owned and controlled corporations.<br><br>In a letter, dated 08 August 1986, the BIR requested PNOC to settle its liability for taxes on the interests earned by its money placements with PNB and which PNB did not withhold.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; PNOC wrote the BIR on 25 September 1986, and made an offer to compromise its tax liability, which it estimated to be in the sum of P304,419,396.83, excluding interest and surcharges, as of 31 July 1986.&nbsp; PNOC proposed to set-off its tax liability against a claim for tax refund/credit of the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR), then pending with the BIR, in the amount of P335,259,450.21.&nbsp; The amount of the claim for tax refund/credit was supposedly a receivable account of PNOC from NAPOCOR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On 08 October 1986, the BIR sent a demand letter to PNB, as withholding agent, for the payment of the final tax on the interest earnings and/or yields from PNOC’s money placements with the bank, from 15 October 1984 to 15 October 1986, in the total amount of P376,301,133.33.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp; On the same date, the BIR also mailed a letter to PNOC informing it of the demand letter sent to PNB.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>PNOC, in another letter, dated 14 October 1986, reiterated its proposal to settle its tax liability through the set-off of the said tax liability against NAPOCOR’S pending claim for tax refund/credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; The BIR replied on 11 November 1986 that the proposal for set-off was premature since NAPOCOR’s claim was still under process.&nbsp; Once more, BIR requested PNOC to settle its tax liability in the total amount of P385,961,580.82, consisting of P303,343,765.32 final tax, plus P82,617,815.50 interest computed until 15 November 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On 09 June 1987, PNOC made another offer to the BIR to settle its tax liability.&nbsp; This time, however, PNOC proposed a compromise by paying P91,003,129.89, representing 30% of the P303,343,766.29 basic tax, in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order (E.O.) No. 44.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Then BIR Commissioner Bienvenido A.

SP No. 29526, affirmed the decision of the CTA in CTA Case No. 4249.&nbsp; The resolution, therefore, of the assigned errors in the Court of Appeals’ decisions essentially requires a review of the CTA decision itself.<br><br>In consolidating the present Petitions, this Court finds that PNOC and PNB are basically questioning the (1) Jurisdiction of the CTA in CTA Case No. 4249; (2) Declaration by the CTA that the compromise agreement was without force and effect; (3) Finding of the CTA that the deficiency withholding tax assessment against PNB had already become final and unappealable and, thus, enforceable; and (4) Order of the CTA directing payment of additional informer’s reward to private respondent Savellano.<br><center><br>I<br><br><i>Jurisdiction of the CTA <br><br></i></center><i>A. The demand letter, dated 16 January 1991 did not constitute a new assessment against PNB.</i><br><br>The main argument of PNB in assailing the jurisdiction of the CTA in CTA Case No. 4249 is that the BIR demand letter, dated 16 January 1991,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> should be considered as a new assessment against PNB.&nbsp; As a new assessment, it gave rise to a new dispute and controversy solely between the BIR and PNB that should be administratively settled or adjudicated, as provided in P.D. No. 242.<br><br>This argument is without merit.&nbsp; The issuance by the BIR of the demand letter, dated 16 January 1991, was merely a development in the continuing effort of the BIR to collect the tax assessed against PNOC and PNB way back in 1986.<br><br>BIR’s first letter, dated 08 August 1986, was addressed to PNOC, requesting it to settle its tax liability.&nbsp; The BIR subsequently sent another letter, dated 08 October 1986, to PNB, as withholding agent, demanding payment of the tax it had failed to withhold on the interest earnings and/or yields from PNOC’s money placements.&nbsp; PNOC wrote the BIR three succeeding letters offering to compromise its tax liability; PNB, on the other hand, did not act on the demand letter it received, dated 08 October 1986.&nbsp; The BIR and PNOC eventually reached a compromise agreement on 22 June 1987.&nbsp; Private respondent Savellano questioned the validity of the compromise agreement because the reduced amount of tax collected from PNOC, by virtue of the compromise agreement, also proportionately reduced his informer’s reward.&nbsp; Private respondent Savellano then requested the BIR Commissioner to review and reconsider the compromise agreement.&nbsp; Acting on the request of private respondent Savellano, the new BIR Commissioner declared the compromise agreement to be without basis and issued the demand letter, dated 16 January 1991, against PNB, as the withholding agent for PNOC.<br><br>It is clear from the foregoing that the BIR demand letter, dated 16 January 1991, could not stand alone as a new assessment.&nbsp; It should always be considered in the factual context summarized above.<br><br>In fact, the demand letter, dated 16 January 1991, actually referred to the withholding tax assessment first issued in 1986 and its eventual settlement through a compromise agreement.&nbsp; In addition, the computation of the deficiency withholding tax was based on the figures from the 1986 assessments against PNOC and PNB, and BIR no longer conducted a new audit or investigation of either PNOC and PNB before it issued the demand letter on 16 January 1991.<br><br>These constant references to past events and circumstances demonstrate that the demand letter, dated 16 January 1991, was not a new assessment, but rather, the latest action taken by the BIR to collect on the tax assessments issued against PNOC and PNB in 1986.<br><br>PNB argues that the demand letter, dated 16 January 1991, introduced a new controversy.&nbsp; We see it differently as the said demand letter presented the resolution by BIR Commissioner Ong of the previous controversy involving the compromise of the 1986 tax assessments.&nbsp; BIR Commissioner Ong explicitly declared therein that the compromise agreement was without legal basis, and requested PNB, as the withholding agent, to pay the amount of withholding tax still due. <br><br><i>B. The CTA correctly retained jurisdiction over CTA Case No. 4249 by virtue of Republic Act No. 1125.</i><br><br>Having established that the BIR demand letter, dated 16 January 1991, did not constitute a new assessment, then, there could be no basis for PNB’s claim that any dispute arising from the new assessment should only be between BIR and PNB.<br><br>Still proceeding from the argument that there was a new dispute between PNB and BIR, PNB sought the suspension of the proceedings in CTA Case No.&nbsp; 4249, after it contested the deficiency withholding tax assessment against it and the demand for payment thereof before the DOJ, pursuant to P.D. No. 242.&nbsp; The CTA, however, correctly sustained its jurisdiction and continued the proceedings in CTA Case No. 4249; and, in effect, rejected DOJ’s claim of jurisdiction to administratively settle or adjudicate BIR’s assessment against PNB.<br><br>The CTA assumed jurisdiction over the Petition for Review filed by private respondent Savellano based on the following provision of Rep. Act No. 1125, the Act creating the Court of Tax Appeals:<br><blockquote>SECTION 7.&nbsp; <i>Jurisdiction</i>. – The Court of Tax Appeals shall exercise <u>exclusive appellate jurisdiction</u> to review by appeal, as herein provided -<br><br>(1) Decisions of the Collector of Internal Revenue in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties imposed in relation thereto, <u>or other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code or other law or part of law administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue; . . .</u> (Underscoring ours.)<br></blockquote>In his Petition before the CTA, private respondent Savellano requested a review of the decisions of then BIR Commissioner Tan to enter into a compromise agreement with PNOC and to reject his claim for additional informer’s reward.&nbsp; He submitted before the CTA questions of law involving the interpretation and application of (1) E.O. No. 44, and its implementing rules and regulations, which authorized the BIR Commissioner to compromise delinquent accounts and disputed assessments pending as of 31 December 1985; and (2) Section 316(1) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1977 (NIRC of 1977), as amended, which granted to the informer a reward equivalent to 15% of the actual amount recovered or collected by the BIR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> These should undoubtedly be considered as matters arising from the NIRC and other laws being administered by the BIR, thus, appealable to the CTA under Section 7(1) of Rep. Act No. 1125.<br><br>PNB, however, insists on the jurisdiction of the DOJ over its appeal of the deficiency withholding tax assessment by virtue of P.D. No. 242.&nbsp; Provisions on jurisdiction of P.D. No. 242 read:<br><blockquote>SECTION 1. Provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding, all disputes, claims and controversies solely between or among the departments, bureaus, offices, agencies, and instrumentalities of the National Government, including government-owned or controlled corporations, but excluding constitutional offices or agencies, arising from the interpretation and application of statutes, contracts or agreements, shall henceforth be administratively settled or adjudicated as provided hereinafter; <i>Provided</i>, That this shall not apply to cases already pending in court at the time of the effectivity of this decree.<br><br>SECTION 2. In all cases involving only questions of law, the same shall be submitted to and settled or adjudicated by the Secretary of Justice, as Attorney General and <i>ex officio</i> legal adviser of all government-owned or controlled corporations and entities, in consonance with Section 83 of the Revised Administrative Code.&nbsp; His ruling or determination of the question in each case shall be conclusive and binding upon all the parties concerned.<br><br>SECTION 3. Cases involving mixed questions of law and of fact or only factual issues shall be submitted to and settled or adjudicated by:<br><blockquote>(a) The Solicitor General, with respect to disputes or claims controversies between or among the departments, bureaus, offices and other agencies of the National Government;<br><br>(b) The Government Corporate Counsel, with respect to disputes or claims or controversies between or among government-owned or controlled corporations or entities being served by the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel; and<br><br>(c) The Secretary of Justice, with respect to all other disputes or claims or controversies which do not fall under the categories mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b).<br></blockquote></blockquote>The PNB and DOJ are of the same position that P.D. No. 242, the more recent law, repealed Section 7(1) of Rep. Act No. 1125,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> based on the pronouncement of this Court in <i>Development Bank of the Philippines v.

No. 242), being the latest expression of the legislative will, should prevail over the earlier.<br></blockquote>In the said case, it was expressly declared that P.D. No. 242 repealed Section 7(2) of Rep. Act No. 1125, which provides for the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the CTA over decisions of the Commissioner of Customs.&nbsp; PNB contends that P.D.

The special act and the general law must stand together, the one as the law of the particular subject and the other as the general law of the land. (<i>Ex Parte United States</i>, 226 U. S., 420; 57 L. ed., 281; <i>Ex Parte Crow Dog</i>, 109 U. S., 556; 27 L. ed., 1030; <i>Partee vs. St. Louis &amp; S. F. R. Co.</i>, 204 Fed. Rep., 970.)<br><br>Where there are two acts or provisions, one of which is special and particular, and certainly includes the matter in question, and the other general, which, if standing alone, would include the same matter and thus conflict with the special act or provision, the special must be taken as intended to constitute an exception to the general act or provision, especially when such general and special acts or provisions are contemporaneous, as the Legislature is not to be presumed to have intended a conflict.

No. 242 is a general law that deals with administrative settlement or adjudication of disputes, claims and controversies between or among government offices, agencies and instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations. Its coverage is broad and sweeping, encompassing all disputes, claims and controversies.&nbsp; It has been incorporated as Chapter 14, Book IV of E.O.

No. 242 should not affect Rep. Act No. 1125.&nbsp; Rep. Act No. 1125, specifically Section 7 thereof on the jurisdiction of the CTA, constitutes an exception to P.D. No. 242.&nbsp; Disputes, claims and controversies, falling under Section 7 of Rep. Act No. 1125, even though solely among government offices, agencies, and instrumentalities, including government-owned and controlled corporations, remain in the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the CTA.&nbsp; Such a construction resolves the alleged inconsistency or conflict between the two statutes, and the fact that P.D. No. 242 is the more recent law is no longer significant.<br><br>Even if, for the sake of argument, that P.D. No. 242 should prevail over Rep.

No. 242 explicitly provides that only disputes, claims and controversies <b><i><u>solely</u></i></b> between or among departments, bureaus, offices, agencies, and instrumentalities of the National Government, including constitutional offices or agencies, as well as government-owned and controlled corporations, shall be administratively settled or adjudicated.&nbsp; While the BIR is obviously a government bureau, and both PNOC and PNB are government-owned and controlled corporations, respondent Savellano is a private citizen.&nbsp; His standing in the controversy could not be lightly brushed aside.&nbsp; It was private respondent Savellano who gave the BIR the information that resulted in the investigation of PNOC and PNB; who requested the BIR Commissioner to reconsider the compromise agreement in question; and who initiated CTA Case No. 4249 by filing a Petition for Review.<br><br>In <i>Bay View Hotel, Inc. v. Manila Hotel Workers’ Union-PTGWO, et al.</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> this Court upheld the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations over the ordinary courts and justified its decision in the following manner:<br><blockquote>We are unprepared to break away from the teaching in the cases just adverted to.&nbsp; To draw a tenuous jurisdictional line is to undermine stability in labor litigations.&nbsp; A piecemeal resort to one court and another gives rise to multiplicity of suits.&nbsp; To force the employees to shuttle from one court to another to secure full redress is a situation gravely prejudicial.&nbsp; The time to be lost, effort wasted, anxiety augmented, additional expense incurred – these are considerations which weigh heavily against split jurisdiction.&nbsp; Indeed, it is more in keeping with orderly administration of justice that all the causes of action here “be cognizable and heard by only one court:&nbsp; the Court of Industrial Relations.”<br></blockquote>The same justification is used in the present case to reject DOJ’s jurisdiction over the BIR and PNB, to the exclusion of the other parties.&nbsp; The rights of all four parties in CTA Case No. 4249, namely the BIR, as the tax collector; PNOC, the taxpayer; PNB, the withholding agent; and private respondent Savellano, the informer claiming his reward; arose from the same factual background and were so closely interrelated, that a pronouncement as to one would definitely have repercussions on the others.&nbsp; The ends of justice were best served when the CTA continued to exercise its jurisdiction over CTA Case No. 4249.&nbsp; The CTA, which had assumed jurisdiction over all the parties to the controversy, could render a comprehensive resolution of the issues raised and grant complete relief to the parties.<br><center><br>II<br><br><i>Validity of the Compromise Agreement <br><br></i></center><i>A. PNOC could not apply for a compromise under E.O. No. 44 because its tax liability was not a delinquent account or a disputed assessment as of 31 December 1985.</i><br><br>PNOC and PNB, on different grounds, dispute the decision of the CTA in CTA Case No. 4249 declaring the compromise agreement between BIR and PNOC without force and effect.<br><br>PNOC asserts that the compromise agreement was in accordance with E.O. No. 44, and its implementing rules and regulations, and should be binding upon the parties thereto.<br><br>E.O. No. 44 granted the BIR Commissioner or his duly authorized representatives the power to compromise any disputed assessment or delinquent account pending as of 31 December 1985, upon the payment of an amount equal to 30% of the basic tax assessed; in which case, the corresponding interests and penalties shall be condoned.&nbsp; E.O. No. 44 took effect on 04 September 1986 and remained effective until 31 March 1987.<br><br>The disputed assessments or delinquent accounts that the BIR Commissioner could compromise under E.O. No. 44 are defined under Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 17-86, as follows:<br><blockquote>a) Delinquent account – Refers to the amount of tax due on or before December 31, 1985 from a taxpayer who failed to pay the same within the time prescribed for its payment arising from (1) a self assessed tax, whether or not a tax return was filed, or (2) a deficiency assessment issued by the BIR which has become final and executory.<br><br>Where no return was filed, the taxpayer shall be considered delinquent as of the time the tax on such return was due, and in availing of the compromise, a tax return shall be filed as a basis for computing the amount of compromise to be paid.<br><br>b) Disputed assessment – refers to a tax assessment disputed or protested on or before December 31, 1985 under any of the following categories:<br><blockquote>1) if the same is administratively protested within thirty (30) days from the date the taxpayer received the assessment, or<br><br>2.) if the decision of the BIR on the taxpayer’s administrative protest is appealed by the taxpayer before an appropriate court.<br></blockquote></blockquote>PNOC’s tax liability could not be considered a delinquent account since (1) it was not self-assessed, because the BIR conducted an investigation and assessment of PNOC and PNB after obtaining information regarding the non-withholding of tax from private respondent Savellano; and (2) the demand letter, issued against it on 08 August 1986, could not have been a deficiency assessment that became final and executory by 31 December 1985.<br><br>The dissenting opinion contends, however, that the tax liability of PNOC constitutes a self-assessed tax, and is, therefore, a delinquent account as of 31 December 1985, qualifying for a compromise under E.O. No. 44.&nbsp; It anchors its argument on the declaration made by this Court in <i>Tupaz v. Ulep</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup> that internal revenue taxes are self-assessing.<br><br>It is not denied herein that the self-assessing system governs Philippine internal revenue taxes.&nbsp; The dissenting opinion itself defines self-assessed tax as, “a tax that the taxpayer himself assesses or computes and pays to the taxing authority.”&nbsp; Clearly, such a system imposes upon the taxpayer the obligation to conduct an assessment of himself so he could determine and declare the amount to be used as tax basis, any deductions therefrom, and finally, the tax due.<br><br>E.O. No. 44 covers self-assessed tax, whether or not a tax return was filed.&nbsp; The phrase “whether or not a tax return was filed” only refers to the compliance by the taxpayer with the obligation to file a return on the dates specified by law, but it does not do away with the requisite that the tax must be self-assessed in order for the taxpayer to avail of the compromise.&nbsp; The second paragraph of Section 2(a) of RR No. 17-86 expressly commands, and still imposes upon the taxpayer, who is availing of the compromise under E.O. No. 44, and who has not previously filed any return, the duty to conduct self-assessment by filing a tax return that would be used as the basis for computing the amount of compromise to be paid.<br><br>Section 2(a)(1) of RR No. 17-86 thus involves a situation wherein a taxpayer, after conducting a self-assessment, discovers or becomes aware that he had failed to pay a tax due on or before 31 December 1985, regardless of whether he had previously filed a return to reflect such tax; voluntarily comes forward and admits to the BIR his tax liability; and applies for a compromise thereof.&nbsp; In case the taxpayer has not previously filed any return, he must fill out such a return reflecting therein his own declaration of the taxable amount and computation of the tax due.&nbsp; The compromise payment shall be computed based on the amount reflected in the tax return submitted by the taxpayer himself.<br><br>Neither PNOC nor PNB, the taxpayer and the withholding agent, respectively, conducted self-assessment in this case.&nbsp; There is no showing that in the absence of the tax assessment issued by the BIR against them, that PNOC and/or PNB would have voluntarily admitted their tax liabilities, already amounting to P385,961,580.82, as of 15 November 1986, and would have offered to compromise the same.&nbsp; In fact, both PNOC and PNB were conspicuously silent about their tax liabilities until they were assessed thereon.<br><br>Any attempt by PNOC and PNB to assess and declare by themselves their tax liabilities had already been overtaken by the BIR’s conduct of its audit and investigation and subsequent issuance of the assessments, dated 08 August 1986 and 08 October 1986, against PNOC and PNB, respectively.&nbsp; The said tax assessments, uncontested and undisputed, presented the results of the BIR audit and investigation and the computation of the total amount of tax liabilities of PNOC and PNB.&nbsp; They should be controlling in this case, and should not be so easily and conveniently ignored and set aside.&nbsp; It would be a contradiction to claim that the tax liabilities of PNOC and PNB are self-assessed and, at the same time, BIR-assessed; when it is clear and simple that it had been the BIR that conducted the assessment and determined the tax liabilities of PNOC and PNB.<br><br>That the BIR-assessed tax liability should be differentiated from a self-assessed one, is supported by the provisions of RR No. 17-86 on the basis for computing the amount of compromise payment.&nbsp; Note that where tax liabilities are self-assessed, the compromise payment shall be computed based on the tax return filed by the taxpayer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> On the other hand, where the BIR already issued an assessment, the compromise payment shall be computed based on the tax due on the assessment notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup><br><br>For instances where the BIR had already issued an assessment against the taxpayer, the tax liability could still be compromised under E.O. No. 44 only if: (1) the assessment had been final and executory on or before 31 December 1985 and, therefore, considered a delinquent account as of said date;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> or (2) the assessment had been disputed or protested on or before 31 December 1985.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup><br><br>RMO No. 39-86, which provides the guidelines for the implementation of E.O. No. 44, does mention different types of assessments that may be compromised under said statute (<i>i.e.</i>, jeopardy assessments, arbitrary assessments, and tax assessments of doubtful validity).&nbsp; RMO No. 39-86 may not have expressly stated any qualification for these particular types of assessments; nonetheless, E.O. No. 44 specifically refers only to assessments that were delinquent or disputed <b><i><u>as of 31 December 1985.</u></i></b><br><br>E.O. No. 44 and all BIR issuances to implement said statute should be interpreted so that they are harmonized and consistent with each other.&nbsp; Accordingly, this Court finds that the different types of assessments mentioned in RMO No. 39-86 would still have to qualify as delinquent accounts or disputed assessments as of 31 Dcember 1985, so that they could be compromised under E.O. No. 44.<br><br>The BIR had first written to PNOC on 08 August 1986, demanding payment of the income tax on the interest earnings and/or yields from PNOC’s money placements with PNB from 15 October 1984 to 15 October 1986.&nbsp; This demand letter could be regarded as the first assessment notice against PNOC.<br><br>Such an assessment, issued only on 08 August 1986, could not have been final and executory as of 31 December 1985 so as to constitute a delinquent account.&nbsp; Neither was the assessment against PNOC an assessment that could have been disputed or protested on or before 31 December 1985, having been issued on a later date.<br><br>Given that PNOC’s tax liability did not constitute a delinquent account or a disputed assessment as of 31 December 1985, then it could not be compromised under E.O. No. 44.<br><br>The assessment against PNOC, instead, was more appropriately covered by Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 31-86.&nbsp; RMC No. 31-86 clarifies the scope of availment of the tax amnesty under E.O. No. 41<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> and compromise payments on delinquent accounts and disputed assessments under E.O. No. 44.&nbsp; The third paragraph of RMC No. 31-86 reads:<br><blockquote>[T]axpayers against whom assessments had been issued from January 1 to August 21, 1986 may settle their tax liabilities by way of compromise under Section 246 of the Tax Code as amended by paying 30% of the basic assessment excluding surcharge, interest, penalties and other increments thereto.<br></blockquote>The above-quoted paragraph supports the position that only assessments that were disputed or that were final and executory by 31 December 1985 could be the subject of a compromise under E.O. No. 44.&nbsp; Assessments issued between 01 January to 21 August 1986 could still be compromised by payment of 30% of the basic tax assessed, not anymore pursuant to E.O. No. 44, but pursuant to Section 246 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended.<br><br>Section 246 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended, granted the BIR Commissioner the authority to compromise the payment of any internal revenue tax under the following circumstances: (1) there exists a reasonable doubt as to the validity of the claim against the taxpayer; or (2) the financial position of the taxpayer demonstrates a clear inability to pay the assessed tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup><br><br>There are substantial differences in circumstances under which compromises may be granted under Section 246 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended, and E.O.

No. 44, neither of them has alleged, much less, has presented any evidence to prove that it may compromise its tax liability under Section 246 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended. <br><i><br>B. The tax liability of PNB as withholding agent also did not qualify for compromise under E.O. No. 44.</i><br><br>Before proceeding any further, this Court reconsiders the conclusion made by BIR Commissioner Ong in his demand letter, dated 16 January 1991, that the compromise settlement executed between the BIR and PNOC was without legal basis because withholding taxes were not actually taxes that could be compromised, but a penalty for PNB’s failure to withhold and for which it was made personally liable.<br><br>E.O.

No. 44.&nbsp; A withholding agent, in such a situation, may compromise the withholding tax assessment against him precisely because he is being held directly accountable for the tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup><br><br>RMO No. 39-86 distinguishes between the withholding agent in the foregoing situation from the withholding agent who withheld the tax but failed to remit the amount to the Government.&nbsp; A withholding agent in the latter situation is the one disqualified from applying for a compromise settlement because he is being made accountable as an agent, who held funds in trust for the Government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup><br><br>Both situations, however, involve withholding agents.&nbsp; The right to compromise under these provisions should have been claimed by PNB, the withholding agent for PNOC.&nbsp; The BIR held PNB personally accountable for its failure to withhold the tax on the interest earnings and/or yields from PNOC’s money placements with PNB.&nbsp; The BIR sent a demand letter, dated 08 October 1986, addressed directly to PNB, for payment of the withholding tax assessed against it, but PNB failed to take any action on the said demand letter.&nbsp; Yet, all the offers to compromise the withholding tax assessment came from PNOC and PNOC did not claim that it made the offers to compromise on behalf of PNB.<br><br>Moreover, the general requirement of E.O. No. 44 still applies to withholding agents – that the withholding tax liability must either be a delinquent account or a disputed assessment as of 31 December 1985 to qualify for compromise settlement.&nbsp; The demand letter against PNB, which also served as its assessment notice, had been issued on 08 October 1986 or two months later than PNOC’s.&nbsp; PNB’s withholding tax liability could not be considered a delinquent account or a disputed assessment, as defined under RR No. 17-86, for the same reasons that PNOC’s tax liability did not constitute as such.&nbsp; The tax liability of PNB, therefore, was also not eligible for compromise settlement under E.O. No. 44. <br><br><i>C. Even assuming arguendo that PNOC and/or PNB qualified under E.O. No. 44, their application for compromise was filed beyond the deadline.</i><br><br>Despite already ruling that the tax liabilities of PNOC and PNB could not be compromised under E.O. No. 44, this Court still deems it necessary to discuss the finding of the CTA that the compromise agreement had been filed beyond the effectivity of E.O. No. 44, since the CTA made a declaration in relation thereto that paragraph 2 of RMO No. 39-86 was null and void for unduly extending the effectivity of E.O. No. 44.<br><br>Paragraph 2 of RMO No. 39-86 provides that:<br><blockquote><ol start="2"><li> Period for availment. – Filing of application for compromise settlement under the said law shall be effective only until March 31, 1987.&nbsp; Applications filed on or before this date shall be valid even if the payment or payments of the compromise amount shall be made after the said date, subject, however, to the provisions of Executive Order No. 44 and its implementing Revenue Regulations No. 17-86.<br></li></ol></blockquote>It is well-settled in this jurisdiction that administrative authorities are vested with the power to make rules and regulations because it is impracticable for the lawmakers to provide general regulations for various and varying details of management. The interpretation given to a rule or regulation by those charged with its execution is entitled to the greatest weight by the court construing such rule or regulation, and such interpretation will be followed unless it appears to be clearly unreasonable or arbitrary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup><br><br>RMO No. 39-86, particularly paragraph 2 thereof, does not appear to be unreasonable or arbitrary.&nbsp; It does not unduly expand the coverage of E.O. No. 44 by merely providing that applications for compromise filed until 31 March 1987 are still valid, even if payment of the compromised amount is made on a later date.<br><br>It cannot be expected that the compromise allowed under E.O. No. 44 can be automatically granted upon mere filing of the application by the taxpayer.&nbsp; Irrefutably, the applications would still have to be processed by the BIR to determine compliance with the requirements of E.O. No. 44.&nbsp; As it is uncontested that a taxpayer could still file an application for compromise on 31 March 1987, the very last day of effectivity of E.O. No. 44, it would be unreasonable to expect the BIR to process and approve the taxpayer’s application within the same date considering the volume of applications filed and pending approval, plus the other matters the BIR personnel would also have to attend to.&nbsp; Thus, RMO No. 39-86 merely assures the taxpayers that their applications would still be processed and could be approved on a later date.&nbsp; Payment, of course, shall be made by the taxpayer only after his application had been approved and the compromised amount had been determined.<br><br>Given that paragraph 2 of RMO No. 39-86 is valid, the next question that needs to be addressed is whether PNOC had been able to submit an application for compromise on or before 31 March 1987 in compliance thereof.&nbsp; Although the compromise agreement was executed only on 22 June 1987, PNOC is claiming that it had already written a letter to the BIR, as early as 25 September 1986, offering to compromise its tax liability, and that the said letter should be considered as PNOC’s application for compromise settlement.<br><br>A perusal of PNOC’s letter, dated 25 September 1986, would reveal, however, that the terms of its proposed compromise did not conform to those authorized by E.O. No. 44.&nbsp;&nbsp; PNOC did not offer to pay outright 30% of the basic tax assessed against it as required by E.O. No. 44; and instead, made the following offer:<br><blockquote>(2) That PNOC be permitted to set-off its foregoing mentioned tax liability of P304,419,396.83 against the tax refund/credit claims of the National Power Corporation (NPC) for specific taxes on fuel oil sold to NPC totaling P335,259,450.21, which tax refunds/credits are actually receivable accounts of our Company from NPC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup><br></blockquote>PNOC reiterated the offer in its letter to the BIR, dated 14 October 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> The BIR, in its letters to PNOC, dated 8 October 1986<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> and 11 November 1986,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> consistently denied PNOC’s offer because the claim for tax refund/credit of NAPOCOR was still under process, so that the offer to set-off such claim against PNOC’s tax liability was premature.<br><br>Furthermore, E.O. No. 44 does not contemplate compromise payment by set-off of a tax liability against a claim for tax refund/credit.&nbsp; Compromise under E.O. No. 44 may be availed of only in the following circumstances:<br><blockquote>SEC. 3.&nbsp; <b>Who may avail</b>. – Any person, natural or juridical, may settle thru a compromise any delinquent account or disputed assessment which has been due as of December 31, 1985, <b><u>by paying an amount equal to thirty percent (30%) of the basic tax assessed</u></b>.<br><br>…<br><br>SEC. 6.&nbsp; <b>Mode of Payment.</b> – Upon acceptance of the proposed compromise, the amount offered as compromise in complete settlement of the delinquent account <b><u>shall be paid immediately in cash or manager’s certified check.</u></b><br><br>Deferred or staggered payments of compromise amounts over P50,000 may be considered on a case to case basis in accordance with the extant regulations of the Bureau upon approval of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, his Deputy or Assistant as delineated in their respective jurisdictions.<br><br>If the Compromise amount is not paid as required herein, the compromise agreement is automatically nullified and the delinquent account reverted to the original amount plus the statutory increments, which shall be collected thru the summary and/or judicial processes provided by law.<br></blockquote>E.O. No. 44 is not for the benefit of the taxpayer alone, who can extinguish his tax liability by paying the compromise amount equivalent to 30% of the basic tax.&nbsp; It also benefits the Government by making collection of delinquent accounts and disputed assessments simpler, easier, and faster.&nbsp; Payment of the compromise amount must be made immediately, in cash or in manager’s check.&nbsp; Although deferred or staggered payments may be allowed on a case-to-case basis, the mode of payment remains unchanged, and must still be made either in cash or in manager’s check.<br><br>PNOC’s offer to set-off was obviously made to avoid actual cash-out by the company. The offer defeated the purpose of E.O. No. 44 because it would not only delay collection, but more importantly, it would not guarantee collection.&nbsp; <i>First of all</i>, BIR’s collection was contingent on whether the claim for tax refund/credit of NAPOCOR would be subsequently granted.&nbsp; <i>Second</i>, collection could not be made immediately and would have to wait until the resolution of the claim for tax refund/credit of NAPOCOR.&nbsp; <i>Third</i>, there is no proof, other than the bare allegation of PNOC, that NAPOCOR’s claim for tax refund/credit is an account receivable of PNOC.&nbsp; A possible dispute between NAPOCOR and PNOC as to the proceeds of the tax refund/credit would only delay collection by the BIR even further.<br><br>It was only in its letter, dated 09 June 1987, that PNOC actually offered to compromise its tax liability in accordance with the terms and circumstances prescribed by E.O. No. 44 and its implementing rules and regulations, by stating that:<br><blockquote>Consequently, we reiterate our previous request for compromise under E.O. No. 44, and convey our preparedness to settle the subject tax assessment liability by payment of the compromise amount of P91,003,129.89, representing thirty percent (30%) of the basic tax assessment of P303,343,766.29, in accordance with E.O. No. 44 and its implementing BIR Revenue Memorandum Order No. 39-86.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br></blockquote>PNOC claimed in the same letter that it had previously requested for a compromise under the terms of E.O. No. 44, but this Court could not find evidence of such previous request.&nbsp; There are stark and substantial differences in the terms of PNOC’s offer to compromise in its earlier letters, dated 25 September 1986 and 14 October 1986 (set-off of the entire amount of its tax liability against the claim for tax refund/credit of NAPOCOR), to those in its letter, dated 09 June 1987 (payment of the compromise amount representing 30% of the basic tax assessed against it), making it difficult for this Court to accept that the letter of 09 June 1987 merely reiterated PNOC’s offer to compromise in its earlier letters.<br><br>This Court likewise cannot give credence to PNOC’s allegation that beginning 25 September 1986, the date of its first letter to the BIR, there were continuing negotiations between PNOC and BIR that culminated in the compromise agreement on 22 June 1987.&nbsp; Aside from the exchange of letters recounted in the preceding paragraphs, both PNOC and PNB failed to present any other proof of the supposed negotiations.<br><br>After the BIR denied the second offer of PNOC to set-off its tax liability against the claim for tax refund/credit of NAPOCOR in a letter, dated 11 November 1986, there is no other evidence of subsequent communication between PNOC and the BIR.&nbsp; It was only after almost seven months, or on 09 June 1987, that PNOC again wrote a letter to the BIR, this time offering to pay the compromise amount of 30% of the basic tax assessed against.&nbsp; This letter was already filed beyond 31 March 1987, after the lapse of the effectivity of E.O. No. 44 and the deadline for filing applications for compromise under the said statute.<br><br>Evidence of meetings between PNOC and the BIR, or any other form of communication, wherein the parties presented their offer and counter-offer to the other, would have been very valuable in explaining and supporting BIR Commissioner Tan’s decision to accept PNOC’s third offer to compromise after denying the previous two.&nbsp; The absence of such evidence herein negates PNOC’s claim of actual negotiations with the BIR.<br><br>Therefore, even assuming arguendo that the tax liabilities of PNOC and PNB qualify as delinquent accounts or disputed assessments as of 31 December 1985, the application for compromise filed by PNOC on 09 June 1987, and accepted by then BIR Commissioner Tan on 22 June 1987, was still filed way beyond 31 March 1987, the expiration date of the effectivity of E.O. No. 44 and the deadline for filing of applications for compromise under RMO No. 39-86. <br><br><i>D. The BIR Commissioner’s discretionary authority to enter into a compromise agreement is not absolute and the CTA may inquire into allegations of abuse thereof.</i><br><br>The foregoing discussion supports the CTA’s conclusion that the compromise agreement between PNOC and the BIR was indeed without legal basis.&nbsp; Despite this lack of legal support for the execution of the said compromise agreement, PNB argues that the CTA still had no jurisdiction to review and set aside the compromise agreement.&nbsp; It contends that the authority to compromise is purely discretionary on the BIR Commissioner and the courts cannot interfere with his exercise thereof.<br><br>It is generally true that purely administrative and discretionary functions may not be interfered with by the courts; but when the exercise of such functions by the administrative officer is tainted by a failure to abide by the command of the law, then it is incumbent on the courts to set matters right, with this Court having the last say on the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup><br><br>The manner by which BIR Commissioner Tan exercised his discretionary power to enter into a compromise was brought under the scrutiny of the CTA amidst allegations of “grave abuse of discretion and/or whimsical exercise of jurisdiction.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup> The discretionary power of the BIR Commissioner to enter into compromises cannot be superior over the power of judicial review by the courts.<br><br>The discretionary authority to compromise granted to the BIR Commissioner is never meant to be absolute, uncontrolled and unrestrained.&nbsp; No such unlimited power may be validly granted to any officer of the government, except perhaps in cases of national emergency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup> In this case, the BIR Commissioner’s authority to compromise, whether under E.O. No. 44 or Section 246 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended, can only be exercised under certain circumstances specifically identified in said statutes.&nbsp; The BIR Commissioner would have to exercise his discretion within the parameters set by the law, and in case he abuses his discretion, the CTA may correct such abuse if the matter is appealed to them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup><br><br>Petitioners PNOC and PNB both contend that BIR Commissioner Tan merely exercised his authority to enter into a compromise specially granted by E.O. No. 44.&nbsp; Since this Court has already made a determination that the compromise agreement did not qualify under E.O. No. 44, BIR Commissioner Tan’s decision to agree to the compromise should have been reviewed in the light of the general authority granted to the BIR Commissioner to compromise taxes under Section 246 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended.&nbsp; Then again, petitioners PNOC and PNB failed to allege, much less present evidence, that BIR Commissioner Tan acted in accordance with Section 246 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended, when he entered into the compromise agreement with PNOC. <br><br> <i>E. The CTA may set aside a compromise agreement that is contrary to law and public policy.</i><br><br>PNB also asserts that the CTA had no jurisdiction to set aside a compromise agreement entered into in good faith.&nbsp; It relies on the decision of this Court in <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup> that a compromise agreement cannot be set aside merely because it is too one-sided.&nbsp; A compromise agreement should be respected by the courts as the <i>res judicata</i> between the parties thereto.<br><br>This Court, though, finds that there are substantial differences in the factual background of <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan</i> and the present case.<br><br>The compromise agreement executed between the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) and Roberto S. Benedicto in <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan</i> was judicially approved by the Sandiganbayan.&nbsp; The Sandiganbayan had ample opportunity to examine the validity of the compromise agreement since two years elapsed from the time the agreement was executed up to the time it was judicially approved.&nbsp; This Court even stated in the said case that, “We are not dealing with the usual compromise agreement perfunctorily submitted to a court and approved as a matter of course. The PCGG-Benedicto agreement was thoroughly and, at times, disputatiously discussed before the respondent court. There could be no deception or misrepresentation foisted on either the PCGG or the Sandiganbayan.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup><br><br>In addition, the new PCGG Chairman originally prayed for the re-negotiation of the compromise agreement so that it could be more just, fair, and equitable, an action considered by this Court as an implied admission that the agreement was not contrary to law, public policy or morals nor was there any circumstance which had vitiated consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup><br><br>The above-mentioned circumstances strongly supported the validity of the compromise agreement in <i>Republic v. Sandiganbayan</i>, which was why this Court refused to set it aside.&nbsp; Unfortunately for the petitioners in the present case, the same cannot be said herein.<br><br>The Court of Appeals, in upholding the jurisdiction of the CTA to set aside the compromise agreement, ruled that:<br><blockquote>We are unable to accept petitioner’s submissions.&nbsp; Its formulation of the issues on CIR and CTA’s lack of jurisdiction to disturb a compromise agreement presupposes a compromise agreement <u>validly</u> entered into by the CIR and not, when as in this case, it was indubitably shown that the supposed compromise agreement is without legal support.&nbsp; In case of arbitrary or capricious exercise by the Commissioner or if the proceedings were fatally defective, the compromise can be attacked and reversed through the judicial process (<i>Meralco Securities Corporation v.

The Government cannot be estopped from collecting taxes by the mistake, negligence, or omission of its agents.</i><br><br>The new BIR Commissioner, Commissioner Ong, had acted well within his powers when he set aside the compromise agreement, dated 22 June 1987, after finding that the said compromise agreement was without legal basis.&nbsp; When he took over from his predecessor, there was still a pending motion for reconsideration of the said compromise agreement, filed by private respondent Savellano on 24 March 1988.&nbsp; To resolve the said motion, he reviewed the compromise agreement and, thereafter, came upon the conclusion that it did not comply with E.O. No. 44 and its implementing rules and regulations.<br><br>It had been declared by this Court in <i>Hilado v.

No. 44 and its implementing rules and regulations differently from that of his predecessor, former Commissioner Tan, which led to Commissioner Ong’s revocation of the BIR approval of the compromise agreement, dated 22 June 1987.&nbsp; Such a revocation was only proper considering that the former BIR Commissioner’s decision to approve the said compromise agreement was based on the erroneous construction of the law (<i>i.e.</i>, E.O.

This should not hold true to government officials with respect to matters not of their own personal concern.

Collector of Internal Revenue</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[103]</sup> this Court pronounced that prescription, being a matter of defense, imposes the burden on the taxpayer to prove that the full period of the limitation has expired; and this requires him to positively establish the date when the period started running and when the same was fully accomplished.<br><br>In making its conclusion that the assessment and collection in this case had prescribed, the dissenting opinion took liberties to assume the following facts even in the absence of allegations and evidences to the effect that: (1) PNB filed returns for its withholding tax obligations for taxable year 1985; (2) PNB reported in the said returns the interest earnings of PNOC’s money placements with the bank; and (3) that the returns were filed on or before the prescribed date, which was 25 January 1986.<br><br>It is not safe to adopt the first and second assumptions in this case considering that Section 269 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended, provides for a different period of limitation for assessment and collection of taxes in case of false or fraudulent return or for failure to file a return.&nbsp; In such cases, the BIR is given 10 years after discovery of the falsity, fraud, or omission within which to make an assessment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[104]</sup><br><br>It is also not safe to accept the third assumption since there can be a possibility that PNB filed the withholding tax return later than the prescribed date, in which case, following the dictates of Section 268 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended, the three-year prescriptive period shall be counted from the date the return was actually filed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[105]</sup><br><br>PNB’s withholding tax returns for taxable year 1985, duly received by the BIR, would have been the best evidence to prove actual filing, the date of filing and the contents thereof.&nbsp; These facts are relevant in determining which prescriptive period should apply, and when such prescriptive period should begin to run and when it had lapsed.&nbsp; Yet, the pleadings did not refer to any return, and no return was made part of the records of the present case.<br><br>This Court could not make a proper ruling on the matter of prescription on the mere basis of assumptions; such an issue should have been properly raised, argued, and supported by evidences submitted by the parties themselves before the BIR and the courts below.<br> <i><br>B. Granting that this Court can take cognizance of the defense of prescription, this Court finds that the assessment of the withholding tax liability against PNOC and collection of the tax assessed were done within the prescriptive period.</i><br><br>Assuming, for the sake of argument, that this Court can give due course to the defense of prescription, it finds that the assessment against PNB for its withholding tax liability for taxable year 1985 and the collection of the tax assessed therein were accomplished within the prescribed periods for assessment and collection under the NIRC of 1977, as amended.<br><br>If this Court adopts the assumption made by the dissenting opinion that PNB filed its withholding tax return for the last quarter of 1985 on 25 January 1986, then the BIR had until 24 January 1989 to assess PNB.&nbsp; The original assessment against PNB was issued as early as 08 October 1986, well-within the three-year prescriptive period for making the assessment as prescribed by the following provisions of the NIRC of 1977, as amended:<br><blockquote><i>SEC. 268.&nbsp; <i>Period of limitation upon assessment and collection</i>. – </i>Except as provided in the succeeding section, internal revenue taxes shall be assessed within three years after the last day prescribed by law for the filing of the return, and no proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such taxes shall be begun after the expiration of such period…<i><br><br>SEC. 269.&nbsp; <i>Exceptions as to period of limitation of assessment and collection of taxes</i>. –<br><br>…<br><br></i>(c) Any internal revenue tax which has been assessed within the period of limitation above-prescribed may be collected by distraint or levy or by a proceeding in court within three years following the assessment of the tax.<br></blockquote>Sections 268 and 269(c) of the NIRC of 1977, as amended, should be read in conjunction with one another.&nbsp; Section 268 requires that assessment be made within three years from the last day prescribed by law for the filing of the return.&nbsp; Section 269(c), on the other hand, provides that when an assessment is issued within the prescribed period provided in Section 268, the BIR has three years, counted from the date of the assessment, to collect the tax assessed either by distraint, levy or court action.&nbsp; Therefore, when an assessment is timely issued in accordance with Section 268, the BIR is given another three-year period, under Section 269(c), within which to collect the tax assessed, reckoned from the date of the assessment.<br><br>In the case of PNB, an assessment was issued against it by the BIR on 08 October 1986, so that the BIR had until 07 October 1989 to enforce it and to collect the tax assessed.&nbsp; The filing, however, by private respondent Savellano of his Amended Petition for Review before the CTA on 02 July 1988 already constituted a judicial action for collection of the tax assessed which stops the running of the three-year prescriptive period for collection thereof.<br><br>A judicial action for the collection of a tax may be initiated by the filing of a complaint with the proper regular trial court; or where the assessment is appealed to the CTA, by filing an answer to the taxpayer’s petition for review wherein payment of the tax is prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[106]</sup><br><br>The present case is unique, however, because the Petition for Review was filed by private respondent Savellano, the informer, against the BIR, PNOC, and PNB.&nbsp; The BIR, the collecting government agency; PNOC, the taxpayer; and PNB, the withholding agent, initially found themselves on the same side.&nbsp; The prayer in the Amended Petition for Review of private respondent Savellano reads: <br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, petitioner respectfully prays that the compromise agreement of June 22, 1987 be reviewed and declared null and void, and <u>that this Court directs</u>:<br><blockquote>a) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondent Commissioner to enforce and collect and respondents PNB and/or PNOC to pay in a joint and several capacity, the total tax liability</span> of P387,987,785.73, plus interests from 31 October 1986; and<br><br>b) respondent Commissioner to pay unto petitioner, as informer’s reward, 15% of the tax liability collected under clause (a) hereof.<br></blockquote>Other equitable reliefs under the premises are likewise prayed for.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[107]</sup> (Underscoring ours.)<br></blockquote>Private respondent Savellano, in his Amended Petition for Review in CTA Case No. 4249, prayed for (1) the CTA to direct the BIR Commissioner to enforce and collect the tax, and (2) PNB and/or PNOC to pay the tax – making CTA Case No. 4249 a collection case.&nbsp; That the Amended Petition for Review was filed by the informer and not the taxpayer; and that the prayer for the enforcement of the tax assessment and payment of the tax was also made by the informer, not the BIR, should not affect the nature of the case as a judicial action for collection.&nbsp; In case the CTA grants the Petition and the prayer therein, as what has happened in the present case, the ultimate result would be the collection of the tax assessed.&nbsp; Consequently, upon the filing of the Amended Petition for Review by private respondent Savellano, judicial action for collection of the tax had been initiated and the running of the prescriptive period for collection of the said tax was terminated.<br><br>Supposing that CTA Case No. 4249 is not a collection case which stops the running of the prescriptive period for the collection of the tax, CTA Case No. 4249, at the very least, suspends the running of the said prescriptive period.&nbsp; Under Section 271 of the NIRC of 1977, as amended, the running of the prescriptive period to collect deficiency taxes shall be suspended for the period during which the BIR Commissioner is prohibited from beginning a distraint or levy or instituting a proceeding in court, and for 60 days thereafter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[108]</sup> Just as in the cases of <i>Republic v.

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his duly authorized representatives may compromise any <b>disputed assessment or delinquent account pending as of December 31, 1985</b>, upon the payment of an amount equal to thirty percent (30%) of the basic tax assessed.

No. 44 applies only to “disputed assessment or delinquent account pending as of December 31, 1985”. This is not an executive issuance meant to give blanket authority on the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to compromise away tax liabilities. In fact, the “cut-off” period stipulated in the executive order refers to a date nine months prior to the date of the promulgation of the issuance, 4 September 1986.<br><br>The authority to compromise was delegated for a specific purpose, as stated in E.O. No. 44.&nbsp; Significantly in that regard, the Executive Order is not a mere executive issuance but a legislative edict in much the same fashion as an Act of Congress, issued as it was by then President Corazon C. Aquino in the exercise of her legislative powers under the Freedom Constitution.&nbsp; The perambulatory clauses of E.O. No. 44 state the need to clear the backlog of pending cases of disputed assessments and delinquent accounts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> in view of the fact that the records of Bureau of Internal Revenue show that over the past ten years, a great number of cases involving disputed assessments and delinquent accounts for internal revenue had accumulated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interpretation of the provisions of E.O. No. 44 cannot be strained in order to cover taxes that accrued after 31 December 1985, since this would no longer be included in the “backlog” adverted to in the issuance. Parenthetically, the Executive Order is akin to a tax exemption statute which should be construed strictly against the taxpayer.<br><br>The taxes sought to be compromised in this case concern the final tax on interest income representing the earnings and/or yield from PNOC’s money placements with the Philippine National Bank (PNB) for the period from 15 October 1984 to 15 October 1986.&nbsp; Evidently, a cursory glance reveals that the PNOC cannot invoke E.O. No. 44 with reference to its entire tax liability, as the period covered under the Executive Order was only up to 31 December 1985. The withholding taxes due for the period of 01 January 1986 to 16 October 1986 are neither disputed assessments nor delinquent accounts pending as of 31 December 1985.<br><br>Moreover, these are taxes that accrue from the yield of interest income of money market placements, and clearly not at the time such placements were made by the PNOC. Even if the money market placements were made in 1984 or 1985, it would not necessarily mean that the interest yields on these placements were paid out or credited during those years. It is unclear when exactly between 1984 to 1986 did such interest incomes had accrued, but admittedly this is a question of fact that need not be reviewed by this Court.<br><br>Nonetheless, I maintain that even without need of ascertaining when exactly such interest income accrued, the compromise agreement in question is null and void in its entirety for being contrary to E.O. No. 44.<br><br>While PNB failed to submit any application for compromise, PNOC submitted two offers – not applications for compromise settlement.&nbsp; PNOC’s first proposal, contained in a letter dated 22 September 1986, offered to clear its basic<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> tax liability through a set-off thereof against the claim for tax refund/credit of the National Power Corporation (NPC), which amount was also supposedly a receivable of PNOC from NPC. This proposal was reiterated in another letter dated 14 October 1986. The operative portions of the first letter read:<br><blockquote>We would like to amicably settle this liability with the BIR. In this regard, we wish to invoke the authority vested by law in your office, particularly under Section 246 of the national Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the spirit underlying Executive Order No. 44 dated September 4, 1986. Consequently, we hereby request for a compromise settlement and submit our offer for a compromise of the matter. xxx<br><br>(2) That PNOC be permitted to set-off its foregoing mentioned tax liability of P304,419,396.83 against the tax refund/credit claims of the National Power Corporation (NPC) for specific taxes on fuel oil sold to NPC totaling P335,239,450.21, which tax refunds/credits are actually receivable accounts of our Company from NPC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>Section 1 of E.O. No. 44 is explicit in declaring that the compromise of a disputed assessment or delinquent account is accomplished through <b>payment</b> of an amount equal to thirty percent (30%) of the basic tax assessed, a generous sum if I may add. Payment, as defined in this jurisdiction, means the delivery of money or the performance of an obligation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>.&nbsp; It institutes a totally different mode of extinguishment of an obligation from compensation and/or confusion or merger<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>. PNOC invokes the concepts of compensation and/or confusion or merger as it seeks to have the NPC, which allegedly had outstanding payables due to PNOC, absorb PNOC’s tax liabilities with its own outstanding tax credit due from the BIR.<br><br>However, as noted by the BIR in its initial response to PNOC’s proposal, NPC’s claim was still under process. Hence, at the time PNOC offered its terms for compromise to the BIR, no extinguishment of PNOC’s tax liability could have taken place — whether by compensation, confusion or merger. There was no mutual creditor-debtor relationship between PNOC and the BIR – the existence of which is one of the requisites for compensation to take place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Also, neither was there an outstanding creditor-debtor relationship between the NPC and the BIR. Moreover, the “credit” which PNOC proposed to use for the purpose of offsetting emanated from a segregate obligation than that due the BIR from PNOC; hence, there could be no confusion or merger<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which could lead to payment.<br><br>In short, there was no legal basis for the NPC then to offset PNOC’s tax liabilities through its own “tax credit,” as the said “tax credit” had not, in the first place, yet ripened as an existing obligation.<br><br>For that reason, PNOC cannot be deemed as having made payment, or even a valid offer of payment through its first two letters, as there was no legal basis to effect its proposed mode of payment. In the meantime, the outstanding tax liability had accrued and eventually, the deadline set forth in RMO No. 39-86 passed.<br><br>So now, the prescribed period of availment and the effective duration of the special compromise tax measure.<br><br>RMO No. 39-86 pertains to “Guidelines for Implementation of Executive Order No. 44 re compromise settlement of (1) delinquent tax accounts; or (2) disputed tax assessments as of December 31, 1985”. Paragraph 2 thereof is explicit as to the period for availment of the compromise settlement:<br><blockquote><ol start="2"><li>Period for availment. – Filing of application for compromise settlement under the said law shall be <span style="font-weight: bold;">effective only until March 31, 1987</span>.&nbsp; Applications filed on or before this date shall be valid even if the payment or payments of the compromise amount shall be made after the said date, subject, however, to the provisions of Executive Order No. 44 and its implementing Revenue Regulations No. 17-86. (emphasis supplied)<br></li></ol></blockquote>The deadline was occasioned by Section 6 of E.O. No. 44, which itself provides for the term of effectivity of the period for compromise: <br><blockquote>Section 6. This Executive Order shall take effect immediately and shall remain effective until March 31, 1987.<br></blockquote>The plain meaning of paragraph (2), in relation to Section 6, E.O. No. 44, is that the deadline for the submission of an application for compromise settlement shall be effective only until 31 March 1987. As of that point, had PNOC submitted an application for compromise settlement within the contemplation of law?<br><br>Plainly, the two letters in 1986 of PNOC are not in the form of an “application for compromise settlement”.&nbsp; Though the Court need not be strict in demanding obeisance with the formal requisites, I would consider any valid form of an application for compromise should concede the liability for tax, and make a valid offer of payment. To require otherwise would render a mockery of the offer of tax compromise. Owing to the legal implausibility of the initial offer of PNOC to the BIR, I could not consider the first two letters as a valid application for compromise settlement. Moreover, the BIR expressly rejected this application, if it could be construed as such, as early as November of 1986. If there was indeed a <i>bona fide</i> intent on the part of PNOC to comply with E.O. No. 44 and its attendant revenue issuances, it should have exerted efforts to comply with this deadline set forth under RMO No. 39-86, in light of the BIR’s rejection of its earlier offer. Instead, the 31 March 1987 deadline passed without a word or renewed offer from the PNOC.<br><br>Instead, on 09 June 1987, <b>or two months after the deadline</b> had elapsed, PNOC made a second, different offer, proposing by way of compromise to pay thirty (30%) of its basic tax liability, specifically invoking Section 1 of E.O. 44.&nbsp; This new offer was subsequently accepted by the BIR.<br><br>The contrary view argues that owing to the administrative power of the tax commissioner, such subsequent acceptance can be deemed as an effective extension of the deadline set forth under RMO No. 39-86.&nbsp; However, E.O. No. 44 is explicit in declaring that its effectivity subsists only until 31 March 1987, a fact which is similarly demonstrated by paragraph (2) of RMO No. 39-86.<br><br>The dissent relies on the fact that E.O. No. 44, issued in the exercise of legislative powers then vested in President Aquino, is a special law of more specific application in this case than the Tax Code. Yet the delegation of authority to the tax commissioner to effect compromises is limited by the confines of E.O. No. 44, which is explicit in stating that its effectivity runs only until 31 March 1987. Hence, contrary to the dissenting view, the BIR Commissioner had no authority to extend the effectivity of E.O. No. 44, or the deadline prescribed thereupon. RMO No. 39-86 properly recognizes such limitation, and assuming that the subsequent acts of the tax commissioner contravene the deadline set by law and regulation, those acts should be deemed as beyond the ambit of delegated power, and thus void.&nbsp; <b>Under the circumstances, only Congress could have validly extended the effectivity of the special compromise tax measure.</b><br><br>Thus, the <i>ponencia</i> correctly concludes that the compromise agreement entered into on 22 June 1987 is void. It was entered into after the lapse of the authority of BIR Commissioner to effect such compromise agreement, owing to the prescribed effectivity of E.O. No. 44, from which such authority was derived. Needless to say, much trouble would have been saved had the PNOC been timely in seeking a compromise agreement with the BIR, and prudent enough in proposing one that had basis under law. It cannot rely upon its status as a component of the government as basis for relief.<br><br>We should not discount the damage inflicted by the void compromise agreement on the informer, Tirso Savellano.&nbsp; The financial remuneration to be obtained by the informer is designed to alleviate whatever socio-political stigma that may attach as a result of the information that is divulged. The informer’s right is predicated on the amount actually paid, and if the amount paid is less than what is due as a result of an unauthorized compromise, then the informer indubitably has an interest to assail the said compromise.<br><br>Finally, the dissent raises the argument that prescription had run to bar the annulment of the compromise agreement. Notably, this issue was not raised before any of the fora involved, by the Court of Tax Appeals, the Court of Appeals, or this Court. Neither was it discussed in any of the assailed rulings.<br><br>The proper taxes due in this case have actually been paid to the government. Petitioners unfortunately seek the refund of what has been already collected, despite the fact that they have all along conceded, not denying at all, the basis for their tax liability. The Court should not be privy to the divestiture of the huge tax payment already remitted to the cash-strapped government if there is no unequivocal basis for the return thereof. More so, should it not be a party to the forfeiture of the informer’s reward to which the private respondent has a vested right as a matter of law and equity.<br><br>I vote to DENY the petitions.<br><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade">[1]</sup> REVENUE MEMORANDUM CIRCULAR No. 31-86, 12 September 1986: x x x [U]nder Executive Order No. 44, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his duly authorized representatives shall accept compromise payments by taxpayers with outstanding delinquent accounts and disputed assessments (except withholding taxes whether final or creditable) pending as of December 31, 1985.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> REVENUE REGULATION No. 17-86, 08 October1986:<br><br>SECTION 2.

The tax liability is created by operation of law, even in the absence of an investigation and assessment by the BIR.&nbsp; The subsequent BIR investigation and assessment is for the purpose of collecting a past due tax, and not for the purpose of creating the tax liability.&nbsp; Of course, the computation by the taxpayer of his tax liability under a self-assessed tax is not conclusive on the BIR.&nbsp; After investigation or audit, the BIR can issue an assessment for any <b>deficiency</b> tax still due from the taxpayer.<br><br>In <b><i>Tupaz v.

To remove from the coverage of EO No. 44 delinquent accounts that became the subject of subsequent investigation and assessment would severely limit the coverage of EO No. 44, a limitation that is not found in the language or intent of EO No. 44.&nbsp; Indeed, such a limitation would defeat the avowed purpose of EO No. 44 to clear the tax dockets of the BIR.&nbsp; The big delinquent accounts, such as PNOC's tax liability, which normally go through subsequent investigation and assessment, would not qualify for the general tax compromise program, preventing EO No. 44 from attaining its objectives.<br><br><b>Clearly, PNOC’s tax liability is a delinquent account within the coverage of EO No. 44 because it is a self-assessed tax unpaid as of 31 December 1985.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> There can be no dispute that the final withholding tax on interest payments by PNB on PNOC's money market placements does not require the intervention of the BIR for its assessment and remittance to the BIR.<br><br>Thus, the compromise agreement between PNOC and BIR falls within the coverage of EO No. 44 and its implementing rules.&nbsp; The non-payment of the final withholding tax has resulted in a delinquent tax account of PNOC.&nbsp; In addition, the failure of PNB to withhold the tax falls within the coverage of RMO No. 39-86.<br><br>However, the majority opinion insists that PNOC's withholding tax liability is outside the coverage of EO 44 because <b>there is no proof that PNOC or PNB filed the tax return in compliance with the self-assessment system</b>.&nbsp; The majority opinion states:<br><blockquote><b>Neither PNOC nor PNB, the taxpayer and the withholding agent, respectively, complied with the system and conducted self-assessment in this case.</b> There is no showing that in the absence of tax assessment issued by the BIR against them, that PNOC and/or PNB would have voluntarily admitted their tax liabilities, already amounting to P385,961,580.82, as of 15 November 1986, and would have offered to compromise the same.&nbsp; In fact, both PNOC and PNB were conspicuously silent about their tax liabilities until they were assessed thereon.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>The majority opinion conveniently forgets that the tax compromise under EO 44 and its implementing rules covers "<b>a self-assessed tax, <u>whether or not a return was filed</u></b>."&nbsp;

The BIR could not have required the thousands of taxpayers who availed of the tax compromise under EO No. 44 to show proof that they filed their tax returns.&nbsp; There is no such requirement in EO No. 44 or in its implementing rules.&nbsp; On the contrary, Revenue Regulations No. 17-86 expressly states "<b>whether or not a return was filed</b>" – which means that the filing of a tax return is not a condition for the availment of the tax compromise.&nbsp; The BIR never required the thousands of taxpayers who availed of EO No. 44 to prove that they filed their tax returns.&nbsp; For the majority opinion to require now PNOC and PNB to prove that they filed the tax returns would constitute denial of equal protection of the law.<br><br>The tax compromise under EO No. 44 and its implementing rules applies to self-assessed taxes, <b>whether or not the corresponding tax returns were filed</b>.&nbsp;

There is absolutely no legal basis in requiring PNOC or PNB to show proof that they filed the proper tax returns before they could avail of the tax compromise.&nbsp; The majority opinion is patently wrong in holding that PNOC and PNB must prove that they filed the tax returns before they can avail of the tax compromise.<br><br>The majority opinion also insists that PNOC's withholding tax liability is outside the coverage of EO No. 44 because the <b>BIR subsequently investigated and assessed PNOC for the withholding tax liability</b>.&nbsp; The majority opinion states:<br><blockquote>It is important to remember that, in this case, any attempt by PNOC and PNB to assess and declare by themselves their tax liabilities had already been overtaken by the BIR's conduct of its audit and investigation and subsequent issuance of the assessments, dated 8 August 1986 and 8 October 1986, against PNOC and PNB, respectively.&nbsp; <b>The said tax assessments, uncontested and undisputed, already presented the results of the BIR audit and investigation and the computation of the total amount of tax liabilities of PNOC and PNB, and should be controlling in this case.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; They should not be so easily and conveniently ignored and set aside. &nbsp;<b>It would be a contradiction to claim that the tax liabilities of PNOC and PNB are self-assessed and, at the same time, BIR-assessed;</b> when it is clear and simple that it had been the BIR that conducted the assessment and determined the tax liabilities of PNOC and PNB.<br></blockquote>The majority opinion theorizes that a taxpayer with a delinquent account consisting of a self-assessed tax cannot avail of EO No. 44 if the BIR issued an assessment against the taxpayer <b>because the BIR assessment is allegedly controlling</b>.<br><br>The majority opinion's theory that a subsequent BIR assessment removes a delinquent account from the coverage of EO No. 44 <b>collides directly</b> with Revenue Memorandum Order No. 39-86<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which implements EO No. 44.&nbsp; Revenue Memorandum Order No. 39-86 <b>expressly recognizes</b> that the delinquent accounts subject to compromise under EO No. 44 may be "<b>covered by a letter of demand and assessment notice</b>" by the BIR.&nbsp; Revenue Memorandum Order No. 39-86 provides:<br><blockquote>x x x<br><ol start="6"><li>Base of the compromise settlement rate. - The compromise settlement rate shall be applied against the basic tax assessed referred to under paragraph 5.1 hereof.

This notwithstanding, plaintiff-appellant argues that during the pendency of the criminal cases, it was prohibited from instituting the civil action for the collection of the deficiency taxes. This contention is untenable. The present complaint against the defendant-appellee is not for the recovery of civil liability arising from the offense of falsification; it is for the collection of deficiency income tax. The provisions of Section 1, Rule 107 (supra) that "after a criminal action has been commenced, no civil action arising from the same offense can be prosecuted", is not applicable.

Savellano, who is not the taxpayer, originally filed this petition against the BIR Commissioner only, and later on impleaded PNOC and PNB.&nbsp; This Court has applied Section 223 of the Tax Code suspending the running of the prescriptive period in cases where the <b>taxpayer sued the BIR Commissioner to prevent the collection of a tax</b>, as when the taxpayer disputed the validity or amount of the assessment before the Court of Tax Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> This is not the situation in the present case since PNOC and PNB have not sued the BIR Commissioner to prevent the collection of the tax, and they do not dispute the validity or amount of the assessment issued against them.<br><br>Nothing legally prevented the BIR from collecting the tax, administratively or judicially, from PNOC or PNB at any time before 7 October 1989.&nbsp; Thus, the BIR cannot invoke Section 223 of the Tax Code to claim the suspension of the running of the prescriptive period during the pendency of the present case in the courts.<br><br><b><i>Conclusion</i></b><br><br>To conclude, the compromise agreement between the BIR and PNOC falls within the coverage of EO No. No. 44 and its implementing rules.&nbsp; The compromise agreement is not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Thus, the compromise agreement is valid,&nbsp; and has the effect of <b><i>res judicata</i></b> on the BIR and PNOC.&nbsp; In any event, the collection of the foregone tax is <b>barred by prescription</b>.<br><br>Accordingly, I dissent from the majority opinion. I vote to grant the petition, to declare valid the 22 June 1987 tax compromise between PNOC and the BIR, and to deny the claim of private respondent Tirso B. Savellano for an additional informer's reward of P43,800,915.25.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Executive Order No. 44 covers the tax liability from 1984 to 31 December 1985, while Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 31-86 covers the tax liability from 1 January 1986 to 21 August 1986.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Araneta v.
