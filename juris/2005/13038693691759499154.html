				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for review assails the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Decision</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> dated July 30, 2002 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 60144, affirming the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Decision</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 dated May 3, 2000 of the Insurance Commission in I.C. Adm. Case No. 
RD-277.&nbsp; Both decisions held that there was no violation of the 
Insurance Code and the respondents do not need license as insurer and 
insurance agent/broker.<br><div align="justify"><br>The facts are undisputed.<br><br>White 
Gold Marine Services, Inc. (White Gold) procured a protection and 
indemnity coverage for its vessels from The Steamship Mutual 
Underwriting Association (Bermuda) Limited (Steamship Mutual) through 
Pioneer Insurance and Surety Corporation (Pioneer).&nbsp; Subsequently, White
 Gold was issued a Certificate of Entry and Acceptance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 Pioneer also issued receipts evidencing payments for the coverage.&nbsp; 
When White Gold failed to fully pay its accounts, Steamship Mutual 
refused to renew the coverage.<br><br>Steamship Mutual thereafter filed a
 case against White Gold for collection of sum of money to recover the 
latter’s unpaid balance.&nbsp; White Gold on the other hand, filed a 
complaint before the Insurance Commission claiming that Steamship Mutual
 violated Sections 186<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and 187<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> of the Insurance Code, while Pioneer&nbsp; violated&nbsp; Sections&nbsp; 299,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 300<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and 301<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> in relation to Sections 302 and 303, thereof.<br><br>The
 Insurance Commission dismissed the complaint.&nbsp; It said that there was 
no need for Steamship Mutual to secure a license because it was not 
engaged in the insurance business.&nbsp; It explained that Steamship Mutual 
was a Protection and Indemnity Club (P &amp; I Club).&nbsp; Likewise, Pioneer
 need not obtain another license as insurance agent and/or a broker for 
Steamship Mutual because Steamship Mutual was not engaged in the 
insurance business.&nbsp; Moreover, Pioneer was already licensed, hence, a 
separate license solely as agent/broker of Steamship Mutual was already 
superfluous.<br><br>The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the 
Insurance Commissioner.&nbsp; In its decision, the appellate court 
distinguished between P &amp; I Clubs vis-à-vis conventional insurance.&nbsp;
 The appellate court also held that Pioneer merely acted as a collection
 agent of Steamship Mutual.<br><br>In this petition, petitioner assigns the following errors allegedly committed by the appellate court,<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote>FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR<br></blockquote></div>THE
 COURT A QUO ERRED WHEN IT RULED THAT RESPONDENT STEAMSHIP IS NOT DOING 
BUSINESS IN THE PHILIPPINES ON THE GROUND THAT IT COURSED . . . ITS

 COURT A QUO ERRED IN NOT REVOKING THE LICENSE OF RESPONDENT PIONEER AND
 [IN NOT REMOVING] THE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF RESPONDENT PIONEER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]<br><br></sup>Simply,
 the basic issues before us are (1) Is Steamship Mutual, a P &amp; I 
Club, engaged in the insurance business in the Philippines? (2) Does 
Pioneer need a license as an insurance agent/broker for Steamship 
Mutual?<br><br>The parties admit that Steamship Mutual is a P &amp; I 
Club.&nbsp; Steamship Mutual admits it does not have a license to do business
 in the Philippines although Pioneer is its resident agent.&nbsp; This 
relationship is reflected in the certifications issued by the Insurance 
Commission.<br><br>Petitioner insists that Steamship Mutual as a P &amp;
 I Club is engaged in the insurance business.&nbsp; To buttress its 
assertion, it cites the definition of a P &amp; I Club in <span style="font-style: italic;">Hyopsung Maritime Co., Ltd. v. Court of Appeals</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 as “an association composed of shipowners in general who band together 
for the specific purpose of providing insurance cover on a mutual basis 
against liabilities incidental to shipowning that the members incur in 
favor of third parties.”&nbsp; It stresses that as a P &amp; I Club, 
Steamship Mutual’s primary purpose is to solicit and provide protection 
and indemnity coverage and for this purpose, it has engaged the services
 of Pioneer to act as its agent.<br><br>Respondents contend that 
although Steamship Mutual is a P &amp; I Club, it is not engaged in the 
insurance business in the Philippines.&nbsp; It is merely an association of 
vessel owners who have come together to provide mutual protection 
against liabilities incidental to shipowning.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Respondents aver <span style="font-style: italic;">Hyopsung</span> is inapplicable in this case because the issue in Hyopsung was the jurisdiction of the court over<span style="font-style: italic;"> Hyopsung.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br>Is Steamship Mutual engaged in the insurance business?<br><br>Section
 2(2) of the Insurance Code enumerates what constitutes “doing an 
insurance business” or “transacting an insurance business”.&nbsp; These are:<br><blockquote>(a) making or proposing to make, as insurer, any insurance contract;<br><br>(b)
 making, or proposing to make, as surety, any contract of suretyship as a
 vocation and not as merely incidental to any other legitimate business 
or activity of the surety;<br><br>(c) doing any kind of business, 
including a reinsurance business, specifically recognized as 
constituting the doing of an insurance business within the meaning of 
this Code;<br><br>(d) doing or proposing to do any business in substance
 equivalent to any of the foregoing in a manner designed to evade the 
provisions of this Code.<br>.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .<br></blockquote>The same provision 
also provides, the fact that no profit is derived from the making of 
insurance contracts, agreements or transactions, or that no separate or 
direct consideration is received therefor, shall not preclude the 
existence of an insurance business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The
 test to determine if a contract is an insurance contract or not, 
depends on the nature of the promise, the act required to be performed, 
and the exact nature of the agreement in the light of the occurrence, 
contingency, or circumstances under which the performance becomes 
requisite.&nbsp; It is not by what it is called.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Basically,
 an insurance contract is a contract of indemnity.&nbsp; In it, one 
undertakes for a consideration to indemnify another against loss, damage
 or liability arising from an unknown or contingent event.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In
 particular, a marine insurance undertakes to indemnify the assured 
against marine losses, such as the losses incident to a marine 
adventure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Section 99<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the Insurance Code enumerates the coverage of marine insurance.<br><br>Relatedly,
 a mutual insurance company is a cooperative enterprise where the 
members are both the insurer and insured.&nbsp; In it, the members all 
contribute, by a system of premiums or assessments, to the creation of a
 fund from which all losses and liabilities are paid, and where the 
profits are divided among themselves, in proportion to their interest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 Additionally, mutual insurance associations, or clubs, provide three 
types of coverage, namely, protection and indemnity, war risks, and 
defense costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>A P &amp; I Club is “a <span style="font-weight: bold;">form of insurance</span> against third party liability, where the third party is anyone other than the P &amp; I Club and the members.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 By definition then, Steamship Mutual as a P &amp; I Club is a mutual 
insurance association engaged in the marine insurance business.<br><br>The
 records reveal Steamship Mutual is doing business in the country albeit
 without the requisite certificate of authority mandated by Section 187<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
 of the Insurance Code.&nbsp; It maintains a resident agent in the 
Philippines to solicit insurance and to collect payments in its behalf.&nbsp;
 We note that Steamship Mutual even renewed its P &amp; I Club cover 
until it was cancelled due to non-payment of the calls.&nbsp; Thus, to 
continue doing business here, Steamship Mutual or through its agent 
Pioneer, must secure a license from the Insurance Commission.<br><br>Since
 a contract of insurance involves public interest, regulation by the 
State is necessary.&nbsp; Thus, no insurer or insurance company is allowed to
 engage in the insurance business without a license or a certificate of 
authority from the Insurance Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Does Pioneer, as agent/broker of Steamship Mutual, need a special license?<br><br>Pioneer is the resident agent of Steamship Mutual as evidenced by the certificate of registration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>
 issued by the Insurance Commission.&nbsp; It has been licensed to do or 
transact insurance business by virtue of the certificate of authority<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
 issued by the same agency.&nbsp; However, a Certification from the 
Commission states that Pioneer does not have a separate license to be an
 agent/broker of Steamship Mutual.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>Although
 Pioneer is already licensed as an insurance company, it needs a 
separate license to act as insurance agent for Steamship Mutual.&nbsp; 
Section 299 of the Insurance Code clearly states:<br><blockquote>SEC. 299 . . .<br><br>No
 person shall act as an insurance agent or as an insurance broker in the
 solicitation or procurement of applications for insurance, or receive 
for services in obtaining insurance, any commission or other 
compensation from any insurance company doing business in the 
Philippines or any agent thereof, without first procuring a license so 
to act from the Commissioner, which must be renewed annually on the 
first day of January, or within six months thereafter. . .<br></blockquote>Finally,
 White Gold seeks revocation of Pioneer’s certificate of authority and 
removal of its directors and officers.&nbsp; Regrettably, we are not the 
forum for these issues.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>,
 the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED.&nbsp; The Decision dated July 30, 2002 of
 the Court of Appeals affirming the Decision dated May 3, 2000 of the 
Insurance Commission is hereby REVERSED AND SET ASIDE. The Steamship 
Mutual Underwriting Association (Bermuda) Ltd., and Pioneer Insurance 
and Surety Corporation are ORDERED to obtain licenses and to secure
