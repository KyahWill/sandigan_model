				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Constituting a serious transgression of the Code of Professional Responsibility was the malevolent act of respondent, who filled up the blank checks entrusted to him as security for a loan by writing on those checks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amounts that had not been agreed upon at all, despite his full knowledge that the loan they were meant to secure had already been paid.<br><br><center><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></center><br>Before us is a verified Petition<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> for the disbarment of Atty. Victor V. Deciembre, filed by Spouses Franklin and Lourdes Olbes with the Office of the Bar Confidant of this Court.&nbsp; Petitioners charged respondent with willful and deliberate acts of dishonesty, falsification and conduct unbecoming a member of the Bar.&nbsp; After he had filed his Comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> on the Petition, the Court referred the case to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.<br><br>The IBP’s Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD), through Commissioner Caesar R. Dulay, held several hearings.&nbsp; During those hearings, the last of which was held on May 12, 2003,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the parties were able to present their respective witnesses and documentary evidence.&nbsp; After the filing of the parties’ respective formal offers of evidence, as well as petitioners’ Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> the case was considered submitted for resolution.&nbsp; Subsequently, the commissioner rendered his Report and Recommendation dated January 30, 2004, which was later adopted and approved by the IBP Board of Governors in its Resolution No. XV-2003-177 dated July 30, 2004.<br><br><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></center><br>In their Petition, Spouses Olbes allege that they were government employees working at the Central Post Office, Manila; and that Franklin was a letter carrier receiving a monthly salary of P6,700, and Lourdes, a mail sorter, P6,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Through respondent, Lourdes renewed on July 1, 1999 her application for a loan from Rodela Loans, Inc., in the amount of P10,000.&nbsp; As security for the loan, she issued and delivered to respondent five Philippine National Bank (PNB) blank checks (Nos. 0046241-45), which served as collateral for the approved loan as well as any other loans that might be obtained in the future.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On August 31, 1999, Lourdes paid respondent the amount of P14,874.37 corresponding to the loan plus surcharges, penalties and interests, for which the latter issued a receipt,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> herein quoted as follows:<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “August 31, 1999Received the amount of P14,874.37 as payment of the loan of <u>P10,000.00</u> taken earlier by Lourdes Olbes.<br><br><center>(Sgd.)

DECIEMBRE:<br><br>Your Honor, may I object because what is the materiality of the question?<br><br>ATTY. PUNZALAN:<br><br>That is very material.&nbsp; I am trying to test your credibility because according to you these checks have been issued in Pasig in the place of your client on a retainer.&nbsp; That’s why I am asking your client…<br><br>COMM. DULAY:<br><br>The name of the client is not material I think.&nbsp; It is enough that he said it was issued here in Pasig.&nbsp; What building?<br><br>ATTY. DECIEMBRE:<br><br>AIC Corporate Center, Your Honor.<br><br>COMM. DULAY:<br><br>What is the materiality of knowing the name of his client’s office?<br><br>ATTY. PUNZALAN:<br><br>Because, Your Honor, the materiality is to find out whether he is telling the truth.&nbsp; The place, Your Honor, according to the respondent is his client.&nbsp; Now I am asking who is that client?<br><br>COMM. DULAY:<br><br>Your answer.<br><br>ATTY.

His was a brazen act of falsification of a commercial document, resorted to for his material gain.<br><br>And he did not stop there.&nbsp; Because the checks were dishonored upon presentment, respondent had the temerity to initiate unfounded criminal suits against petitioners, thereby exhibiting his vile intent to have them punished and deprived of liberty for frustrating the criminal duplicity he had wanted to foist on them.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, one of the petitioners (Franklin) was detained for three months<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> because of the Complaints.&nbsp; Respondent is clearly guilty of serious dishonesty and professional misconduct.&nbsp; He committed an act indicative of moral depravity not expected from, and highly unbecoming, a member of the bar.<br><br>Good moral character is an essential qualification for the privilege to enter into the practice of law.&nbsp; It is equally essential to observe this norm meticulously during the continuance of the practice and the exercise of the privilege.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Good moral character includes at least common honesty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> No moral qualification for bar membership is more important than truthfulness and candor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The rigorous ethics of the profession places a premium on honesty and condemns duplicitous behavior.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp; Lawyers must be ministers of truth.&nbsp; Hence, they must not mislead the court or allow it to be misled by any artifice.&nbsp; In all their dealings, they are expected to act in good faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>Deception and other fraudulent acts are not merely unacceptable practices that are disgraceful and dishonorable;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> they reveal a basic moral flaw.&nbsp; The standards of the legal profession are not satisfied by conduct that merely enables one to escape the penalties of criminal laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Considering the depravity of the offense committed by respondent, we find the penalty recommended by the IBP of suspension for two years from the practice of law to be too mild.&nbsp; His propensity for employing deceit and misrepresentation is reprehensible.&nbsp; His misuse of the filled-up checks that led to the detention of one petitioner is loathsome.<br><br>In <i><u>Eustaquio v.
