				<BR><BR><div align="justify">These consolidated petitions for review assail, in G.R. No. 162335, the February 24, 2004 Amended Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Third Division of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 66642, ordering the Register of Deeds of Quezon City to cancel petitioners' TCT No. RT-22481 and directing the Land Registration Authority (LRA) to reconstitute respondents' TCT No. 210177; and in G.R. No. 162605, the November 7, 2003 Amended Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Special Division of Five of the Former Second Division in CA-G.R. SP No. 66700 directing the Register of Deeds of Quezon City to cancel petitioners' TCT No. RT-22481, and the LRA to reconstitute respondents' TCT No. T-210177 and the March 12, 2004 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> denying the motion for reconsideration.<br><br>The facts as found by the Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> are as follows:<br><blockquote>Petitioners, (respondents herein) as the surviving heirs of the late Homer Barque, filed a petition with the LRA for administrative reconstitution of the original copy of TCT No. 210177 issued in the name of Homer L. Barque, which was destroyed in the fire that gutted the Quezon City Hall, including the Office of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City, sometime in 1988. In support of the petition, petitioners submitted the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 210177, real estate tax receipts, tax declarations and the Plan FLS 3168 D covering the property.<br><br>Upon being notified of the petition for administrative reconstitution, private respondents (petitioners herein) filed their opposition thereto claiming that the lot covered by the title under reconstitution forms part of the land covered by their reconstituted title TCT No. RT-22481, and alleging that TCT No. 210177 in the name of petitioners' predecessors-in-interest is spurious.</blockquote>On June 30, 1997, Atty. Benjamin M. Bustos, as reconstituting officer, denied the reconstitution of TCT No. 210177<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> on grounds that:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> Lots 823-A and 823-B, Fls-3168-D, containing areas of 171,473 Sq. Mtrs. and 171,472 Sq. Mtrs., respectively, covered by TCT No. 210177, appear to duplicate Lot 823 Piedad Estate, containing an area of 342,945 Sq. Mtrs., covered by TCT No. 372302 registered in the name of Severino M. Manotok, et. al., reconstituted under Adm. Reconstitution No. Q-213 dated February 01, 1991;<br><br></li><li> The submitted plan Fls-3168-D is a spurious document as categorically stated by Engr. Privadi J.G. Dalire, Chief, Geodetic Surveys Division, Land Management Bureau, in his letter dated February 19, 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Respondents' motion for reconsideration was denied in an order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> dated February 10, 1998 hence they appealed to the LRA.<br><br>The LRA ruled that the reconstituting officer should not have required the submission of documents other than the owner's duplicate certificate of title as bases in denying the petition and should have confined himself with the owner's duplicate certificate of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The LRA further declared:<br><blockquote>Based on the documents presented, petitioners have established by clear and convincing evidence that TCT NO. 210177 was, at the time of the destruction thereof, valid, genuine, authentic and effective. Petitioners duly presented the original of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 210177 .... The logbook of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City lists TCT No. 210177 as among the titles lost .... The Register of Deeds of Quezon City himself acknowledged the existence and authenticity of TCT No. 210177 when he issued a certification to the effect that TCT No. 210177 was one of the titles destroyed and not salvaged from the fire that gutted the Quezon City Hall on 11 June 1988 ....<br><br>It is likewise noteworthy that the technical description and boundaries of the lot reflected in TCT No. 210177 absolutely conform to the technical description and boundaries of Lot 823 Piedad Estate ... as indicated in the B. L. Form No. 28-37-R dated 11-8-94 and B. L. Form No. 31-10 duly issued by the Bureau of Lands ....<br><br>It therefore becomes evident that the existence, validity, authenticity and effectivity of TCT No. 210177 was established indubitably and irrefutably by the petitioners. Under such circumstances, the reconstitution thereof should be given due course and the same is mandatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>....<br><br>It would be necessary to underscore that the certified copy of Plan FLS 3168 D was duly issued by the office of Engr. Ernesto Erive, Chief, Surveys Division LMS-DENR-NCR whose office is the lawful repository of survey plans for lots situated within the National Capital Region including the property in question. Said plan was duly signed by the custodian thereof, Carmelito Soriano, Chief Technical Records and Statistics Section, DENR-NCR. Said plan is likewise duly supported by Republic of the Philippines Official Receipt No. 2513818 Q dated 9-23-96 .... Engr. Erive in his letter dated 28 November 1996 addressed to Atty. Bustos .... confirmed that a microfilm copy of Plan FLS 3168D is on file in the Technical Records and Statistics Section of his office. Engr. Dalire, in his letter dated 2 January 1997 addressed to Atty. Bustos even confirmed the existence and authenticity of said plan. ...<br><br>....<br><br>The claim of Engr. Dalire in his letter dated 19 February 1997 that his office has no records or information about Plan FLS 3168-D is belied by the certified copy of the computer print-out duly issued by the Bureau of Lands indicating therein that FLS 3168D is duly entered into the microfilm records of the Bureau of Lands and has been assigned Accession Number 410436 appearing on Page 79, Preliminary Report No. 1, List of Locator Cards and Box Number 0400 and said computer print-out is duly supported by an Offical Receipt ....<br><br>The said Plan FLS 3168D is indeed authentic and valid coming as it does from the legal repository and duly signed by the custodian thereof. The documentary evidence presented is much too overwhelming to be simply brushed aside and be defeated by the fabricated statements and concoctions made by Engr. Dalire in his 19 February 1997 letter. ...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></blockquote>Nevertheless, notwithstanding its conclusion that petitioners' title was fraudulently reconstituted, the LRA noted that it is only the Regional Trial Court (RTC) which can declare that the same was indeed fraudulently reconstituted. It thus opined that respondents' title may only be reconstituted after a judicial declaration that petitioners' title was void and should therefore be cancelled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the LRA's decision reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, it is hereby ordered that reconstitution of TCT No. 210177 in the name of Homer L. Barque, Sr. shall be given due course after cancellation of TCT No. RT-22481 (372302) in the name of Manotoks upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>Petitioners' filed a motion for reconsideration which was opposed by respondents with a prayer that reconstitution be ordered immediately.<br><br>On June 14, 2001, petitioners' motion for reconsideration and respondents' prayer for immediate reconstitution were denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>From the foregoing, respondents filed a petition for review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> with the Court of Appeals docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 66700 and praying that the LRA be directed to immediately reconstitute TCT No. 210177 without being subjected to the condition that petitioners' TCT No. RT-22481 [372302] should first be cancelled by a court of competent jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Petitioners likewise filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 66642.<br><br>In CA-G.R. SP No. 66700, the Second Division of the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> on September 13, 2002, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the foregoing premises considered the assailed Resolution of the LRA dated June 24, 1998 is AFFIRMED in <span style="font-style: italic;">toto</span> and the petition for review is ordered DISMISSED. No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>Respondents moved for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> On November 7, 2003, the Special Division of Five of the Former Second Division rendered an Amended Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 66700, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, our decision dated 13 September 2002 is hereby reconsidered. Accordingly, the Register of Deeds of Quezon City is hereby directed to cancel TCT No. RT-22481 of private respondents and the LRA is hereby directed to reconstitute forthwith petitioners' valid, genuine and existing Certificate of Title No. T-210177.<br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></blockquote>Petitioners' motion for reconsideration of the amended decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 66700 was denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> hence, this petition docketed as G.R. No. 162605.<br><br>Meanwhile, in CA-G.R. SP No. 66642, the Third Division of the Court of Appeals rendered a Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> on October 29, 2003, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED. The Resolution of the LRA dated 24 June 1998 is hereby AFFIRMED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></blockquote>In so ruling, the Third Division of the Court of Appeals declared that the LRA correctly deferred in giving due course to the petition for reconstitution since there is yet no final judgment upholding or annulling respondents' title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Respondents' motion for reconsideration was granted by the Third Division of the Court of Appeals on February 24, 2004, thus:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby GRANTED. The Decision of this Court dated 29 October 2003 is RECONSIDERED and a new one is entered ordering the Register of Deeds of Quezon City to cancel petitioners' TCT No. RT-22481 and directing the LRA to reconstitute forthwith respondents' TCT No. T-210177.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></blockquote>From the foregoing decisions of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 66700 and CA-G.R. SP No. 66642, petitioners filed separate petitions for review before this Court docketed as G.R. No. 162605 and G.R. No. 162335, respectively.<br><br>In G.R. No. 162605, petitioners argue that:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><blockquote>THE MAJORITY JUSTICES ACTED WITHOUT JURISDICTION IN ORDERING THE CANCELLATION OF PETITIONERS' EXISTING TITLE, CONSIDERING THAT:<br><ol type="a"><li> THEY ORDERED THE CANCELLATION OF TITLE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SAME IS NOT PART OF THE RELIEF SOUGHT IN A RECONSTITUTION PROCEEDINGS.<br><br></li><li> THEY ALLOWED A COLLATERAL ATTACK ON A TORRENS CERTIFICATE OF TITLE; and<br><br></li><li> THE COURT OF APPEALS, IN RESOLVING AN APPEAL OF THE DECISION OF THE LAND REGISTRATION AUTHORITY, DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION TO ORDER THE CANCELLATION OF TITLE, SINCE ONLY A PROPER REGIONAL TRIAL COURT CAN ORDER THE ANNULMENT/CANCELLATION OF A TORRENS TITLE. BY ALLOWING A "SHORT CUT", THE MAJORITY JUSTICES DEPRIVED THE PETITIONERS OF THEIR PROPERTY AND THEIR CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW.</li></ol></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><blockquote>THE MAJORITY JUSTICES GRAVELY MISAPPLIED THE RULING OF THIS HONORABLE COURT IN <span style="font-style: italic;">ORTIGAS V.

IN THE INSTANT CASE, THERE ARE NO SUCH DECISIONS IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENTS WHICH WOULD JUSTIFY THE CANCELLATION OF THE TITLE OF PETITIONERS WITHOUT ANY HEARING.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>In G.R. No. 162335, petitioners raise the following issues:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li> THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS (THIRD DIVISION) COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND GROSS IGNORANCE OF THE LAW IN ORDERING THE LAND REGISTRATION AUTHORITY TO CANCEL TCT NO. RT-22481 OF PETITIONERS MANOTOK NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT SAID COURT WAS FULLY COGNIZANT THAT IT HAS NO JURISDICTION TO EXERCISE SUCH AUTHORITY AND POWER AND THE LAND REGISTRATION AUTHORITY IS EQUALLY DEVOID OF JURISDICTION ON THE MATTER BECAUSE UNDER THE JUDICIARY REORGANIZATION ACT OF 1980 SPECIFICALLY SECTION 19 (2) THEREOF, ONLY THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURTS HAVE EXCLUSIVE ORIGINAL JURISDICTION OVER CIVIL ACTIONS WHICH INVOLVES TITLE TO, OR POSSESSION OF, REAL PROPERTY, OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN.<br><br></li><li> THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS (THIRD DIVISION) COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND GROSS IGNORANCE OF THE LAW IN INVOKING EQUITABLE CONSIDERATION TO JUSTIFY ITS CHALLENGED AMENDED DECISION DATED FEBRUARY 24, 2004 DIRECTING LRA TO CANCEL PETITIONERS MANOTOK'S TITLE NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT, AS STATED, THE LAW EXPLICITLY VESTS EXCLUSIVE ORIGINAL JURISDICTION TO THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURTS OVER CIVIL ACTIONS WHICH INVOLVES TITLE TO, OR POSSESSION OF, REAL PROPERTY, OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN.<br><br></li><li> THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN FAILING TO ORDER THE SETTING ASIDE OF THE CHALLENGED RESOLUTION DATED JUNE 24, 1998 OF RESPONDENT LAND REGISTRATION AUTHORITY IN LRC ADMIN.

SUBJECT ONLY TO THE CONDITION THAT THE TITLE OF PETITIONERS MANOTOK SHOULD FIRST BE ORDERED CANCELLED BY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN THE FACE OF THE GLARING FACTS THAT SAID TITLE IS HIGHLY SUSPECT AND BEARS BADGES OF FABRICATION AND FALSIFICATION AND THEREFORE NO OTHER LOGICAL AND CREDIBLE CONCLUSION CAN BE DRAWN EXCEPT THAT IT IS A FAKE AND SPURIOUS TITLE.<br><br></li><li> THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN ALLOWING RESPONDENTS' MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION WHICH WAS CLEARLY FILED OUT OF TIME.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>On August 2, 2004, the petition in G.R. No. 162605 was consolidated with the petition in G.R. No. 162335.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In sum, petitioners contend that (a) the LRA has no authority to annul their title; (b) the reconstitution of respondents' Torrens title would be a collateral attack on petitioners' existing title; (c) they were not given the opportunity to be heard, specifically the chance to defend the validity of their Torrens title; (d) the Court of Appeals, in resolving the appeal from the LRA, has no jurisdiction to order the cancellation of petitioners' title; and (e) the ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ortigas</span> &nbsp;was misapplied.<br><br>The petitions must be denied.<br><br>The LRA properly ruled that the reconstituting officer should have confined himself to the owner's duplicate certificate of title prior to the reconstitution. Section 3 of Republic Act (RA) No. 26<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> clearly provides:<br><blockquote>Section 3. Transfer certificates of title shall be reconstituted from such of the sources hereunder enumerated as may be available,<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> in the following order:</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">(a) The owner's duplicate of the certificate of title;</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">....</span></blockquote>When respondents filed the petition for reconstitution, they submitted in support thereof the owner's duplicate certificate of title, real estate tax receipts and tax declaration. Plainly, the same should have more than sufficed as sources for the reconstitution pursuant to Section 3 of RA No. 26 which explicitly mandates that the reconstitution shall be made following the <span style="font-weight: bold;">hierarchy of sources</span> as enumerated by law. In addition, Section 12 of the same law requires that the petition shall be accompanied with a plan and technical description of the property <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> if the source of the reconstitution is Section 3(f) of RA No. 26. Thus:<br><blockquote>Section 12. ... Provided, That in case the reconstitution is to be made <span style="font-weight: bold;">exclusively </span>from sources enumerated in section 2(f) or 3(f) of this Act, the petition shall further be accompanied with a plan and technical description of the property duly approved by the Chief of the General Land Registration Office, or with a certified copy of the description taken from a prior certificate of title covering the same property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></blockquote>Since respondents' source of reconstitution is the owner's duplicate certificate of title, there is no need for the reconstituting officer to require the submission of the plan, much less deny the petition on the ground that the submitted plan appears to be spurious. By enumerating the hierarchy of sources to be used for the reconstitution, it is the intent of the law to give more weight and preference to the owner's duplicate certificate of title over the other enumerated sources.<br><br>The factual finding of the LRA that respondents' title is authentic, genuine, valid, and existing, while petitioners' title is sham and spurious, as affirmed by the two divisions of the Court of Appeals, is conclusive before this Court. It should remain undisturbed since only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>Findings of fact of administrative bodies are accorded respect, even finality by this Court and, when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are no longer reviewable except only for very compelling reasons. Basic is the rule that factual findings of agencies exercising quasi-judicial functions ... are accorded not only respect but even finality, aside from the consideration that this Court is essentially not a trier of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Such questions as whether certain items of evidence should be accorded probative value or weight, or rejected as feeble or spurious, or whether or not the proofs on one side or the other are clear and convincing and adequate to establish a proposition in issue, are without doubt questions of fact. Whether or not the body of proofs presented by a party, weighed and analyzed in relation to contrary evidence submitted by adverse party, may be said to be strong, clear and convincing; whether or not certain documents presented by one side should be accorded full faith and credit in the face of protests as to their spurious character by the other side; whether or not inconsistencies in the body of proofs of a party are of such gravity as to justify refusing to give said proofs weight – all these are issues of fact. Questions like these are not reviewable by this court which, as a rule, confines its review of cases decided by the Court of Appeals only to questions of law raised in the petition and therein distinctly set forth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> A petition for review should only cover questions of law. Questions of fact are not reviewable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Dolfo v. Register of Deeds for the Province of Cavite,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> this Court categorically declared:<br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals made a factual finding that petitioner's title to the land is of doubtful authenticity. <br><br>Having jurisdiction only to resolve questions of law, this Court is bound by the factual findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals....<br></blockquote>In view of the foregoing, it is no longer necessary to remand the case to the RTC for the determination of which title, petitioners' or respondents', is valid or spurious. This has been ruled upon by the LRA and duly affirmed by the two divisions of the Court of Appeals.<br><br>The LRA has the jurisdiction to act on petitions for administrative reconstitution. It has the authority to review, revise, reverse, modify or affirm on appeal the decision of the reconstituting officer. The function is adjudicatory in nature – it can properly deliberate on the validity of the titles submitted for reconstitution. Logically, it can declare a title as sham or spurious, or valid on its face. Otherwise, if it cannot make such declaration, then there would be no basis for its decision to grant or deny the reconstitution. The findings of fact of the LRA, when supported by substantial evidence, as in this case, shall be binding on the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>In the reconstitution proceedings, the LRA is bound to determine from the evidence submitted which between or among the titles is genuine and existing to enable it to decide whether to deny or approve the petition. Without such authority, the LRA would be a mere robotic agency clothed only with mechanical powers.<br><br>The Court of Appeals also properly exercised its appellate jurisdiction over the judgment of the LRA. Under Sections 1 and 3, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, the appellate court has jurisdiction on appeals from judgments or final orders of the LRA, whether the appeal involves questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law.<br><br>Indeed, it would be needlessly circuitous to remand the case to the RTC to determine anew which of the two titles is sham or spurious and thereafter appeal the trial court's ruling to the Court of Appeals. After all, the LRA and the two divisions of the appellate court have already declared that petitioners' title is forged. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Mendoza v. Court of Appeals,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> we ruled that:<br><blockquote>Now, technically, the revocation and cancellation of the deed of sale and the title issued in virtue thereof in de los Santos' favor should be had in appropriate proceedings to be initiated at the instance of the Government. <span style="font-weight: bold;">However, since all the facts are now before this Court, and it is not within de los Santos' power in any case to alter those facts at any other proceeding, or the verdict made inevitable by said facts, for this Court to direct at this time that cancellation proceedings be yet filed to nullify the sale to de los Santos and his title, would be needlessly circuitous and would unnecessarily delay the termination of the controversy at bar, .... This Court will therefore make the adjudication entailed by the facts here and now, without further proceedings, as it has done in other cases in similar premises.</span></blockquote>No useful purpose will be served if a case or the determination of an issue in a case is remanded to the trial court only to have its decision raised again to the Court of Appeals and then to the Supreme Court. The remand of the case or of an issue to the lower court for further reception of evidence is not necessary where the Court is in position to resolve the dispute based on the records before it and particularly where the ends of justice would not be subserved by the remand thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The Register of Deeds, the LRA and the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction to act on the petition for administrative reconstitution. The doctrine laid down in <span style="font-style: italic;">Alabang Dev. Corp., et al. v. Hon. Valenzuela, etc., et al.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> does not apply in the instant case. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Alabang,</span> the Court stressed that:<br><blockquote>... [L]ands already covered by <span style="font-weight: bold;">duly issued existing Torrens Titles</span> ... cannot be the subject of petitions for <span style="font-style: italic;">reconstitution</span> of allegedly lost or destroyed titles filed by<span style="font-style: italic;"> third parties without first </span>securing by final judgment the <span style="font-style: italic;">cancellation</span> of such existing titles. ... The courts simply have <span style="font-style: italic;">no jurisdiction</span> over petitions by such <span style="font-style: italic;">third parties</span> for <span style="font-style: italic;">reconstitution</span> of allegedly lost or destroyed titles over lands that are <span style="font-style: italic;">already covered by duly issued subsisting titles</span> in the names of their duly registered owners. The very concept of <span style="font-style: italic;">stability and indefeasibility</span> of titles covered under the Torrens System of registration rules out as anathema the issuance of two certificates of title over the same land to two different holders thereof. ...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></blockquote>The <span style="font-style: italic;">Alabang</span> ruling was premised on the fact that the existing Torrens title was <span style="font-weight: bold;">duly</span> issued and that there is only one title subsisting at the time the petition for reconstitution was filed. In the instant case, it cannot be said that petitioners' title was <span style="font-weight: bold;">duly</span> issued much less could it be presumed valid considering the findings of the LRA and the Court of Appeals that the same is sham and spurious.<br><br>The Court of Appeals properly applied the doctrine laid down in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ortigas</span> in refusing to remand the case to the trial court. As expressly declared in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ortigas &amp; Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><blockquote>Ordinarily, the relief indicated by the material facts would be the remand of the reconstitution case (LRC No. Q-5405) to the Court of origin with instructions that Ortigas' and the Solicitor General's appeals from the judgment rendered therein, which were wrongly disallowed, be given due course and the records forthwith transmitted to the appellate tribunal. This, in fact, is a relief alternatively prayed for by petitioner Ortigas. Considering however the fatal infirmities afflicting Molina's theory or cause of action, evident from the records before this Court, such a remand and subsequent appeal proceedings would be pointless and unduly circuitous. Upon the facts, it is not possible for Molina's cause to prosper. To defer adjudication thereon would be unwarranted and unjust.</blockquote>The same rationale should apply in the instant case. As already discussed, the validity of respondents' and petitioners' title have been squarely passed upon by the LRA and reviewed and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, which factual findings are no longer reviewable by this Court.<br><br>A careful examination of the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Spouses Cayetano, et al. v. CA, et al.,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> where this Court, as claimed by petitioners, have affirmed their title over the disputed property, would reveal that the sole issue resolved therein is whether or not a tenancy relationship exists between the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> There was no adjudication on ownership. In fact, it cannot even be discerned if the property subject of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Spouses Cayetano</span> case refers to the property subject of the instant controversy.<br><br>There is no basis in the allegation that petitioners were deprived of "their property" without due process of law when the Court of Appeals ordered the cancellation of their Torrens title, even without a direct proceeding in the RTC. As already discussed, there is no need to remand the case to the RTC for a re-determination on the validity of the titles of respondents and petitioners as the same has been squarely passed upon by the LRA and affirmed by the appellate court. By opposing the petition for reconstitution and submitting their administratively reconstituted title, petitioners acquiesced to the authority and jurisdiction of the reconstituting officer, the LRA and the Court of Appeals, and recognized their authority to pass judgment on their title. All the evidence presented was duly considered by these tribunals. There is thus no basis to petitioners' claim that they were deprived of their right to be heard and present evidence, which is the essence of due process.<br><br>As held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Yusingco v. Ong Hing Lian:</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><blockquote>Therefore, it appearing from the records that in the previous petition for reconstitution of certificates of title, the parties acquiesced in submitting the issue of ownership for determination in the said petition, and they were given the full opportunity to present their respective sides of the issues and evidence in support thereof, and that the evidence presented was sufficient and adequate for rendering a proper decision upon the issue, the adjudication of the issue of ownership was valid and binding.</blockquote>The reconstitution would not constitute a collateral attack on petitioners' title which was irregularly and illegally issued in the first place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> As pertinently held in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dolfo v. Register of Deeds for the Province of Cavite:</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><blockquote>The rule that a title issued under the Torrens System is presumed valid and, hence, is the best proof of ownership of a piece of land does not apply where the certificate itself is faulty as to its purported origin.<br><br>In this case, petitioner anchors her arguments on the premise that her title to the subject property is indefeasible because of the presumption that her certificate of title is authentic. However, this presumption is overcome by the evidence presented, consisting of the LRA report ... that TCT No. T-320601 was issued without legal basis...<br><br>....<br><br>Thus, petitioner cannot invoke the indefeasibility of her certificate of title. It bears emphasis that the Torrens system does not create or vest title but only confirms and records one already existing and vested. Thus, while it may be true, as petitioner argues, that a land registration court has no jurisdiction over parcels of land already covered by a certificate of title, it is equally true that this rule applies only where there exists no serious controversy as to the authenticity of the certificate.</blockquote>Under similar circumstances, this Court has ruled that wrongly reconstituted certificates of title secured through fraud and misrepresentation cannot be the source of legitimate rights and benefits.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> the petitions are <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED.</span> In <span style="font-weight: bold;">G.R.

Likewise, on January 5, 1997, we made a follow-up, reiterating that we have no records (sic) of Fls-3168-D and requesting them to forward the plan for our evaluation and comment. It is regretted, they did not respond.<br><br>Upon examination of the copy of Fls-3168-D allegedly issued by DENR-NCR, it is certain that the source of the copy is a spurious plan which may have been inserted in the file. We requested for the copy in their file last 05 December 1996 and 05 January 1997 but until this writing, NCR has not sent us the copy for authentication as required by DENR Administrative Order. We are sure that the copy did not come from this Office.

Certainly this is not true. This is the handiwork of forgers. How can this be when NCR has never given us the alleged copy in their file for validation. The forwarding of the copy to us is mandatory under DAO No. 49 for our validation. This is the subject of our letters to NCR dated 05 December 1996, 03 January 1997 and 06 February 1997 (copies attached). Definitely this letter was never prepared and issued by this Office.

Bustos denied the motion for lack of merit.<br><br>The Heirs of Barque filed an appeal with the LRA, docketed as Admin. Recons. No. Q-547-A <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup>.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Ruling of the Land Registration Authority</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>In a Resolution dated 24 June 1998,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the LRA gave due course to the appeal. The LRA ruled that under LRA Circular No. 13,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> only the owner's or co-owner's duplicate of an original or transfer certificate of title could be used as a source of administrative reconstitution. Hence, the LRA ruled that Atty. Bustos erred in requiring the submission of documents other than the owner's duplicate of the TCT. The LRA further ruled that Engr. Dalire failed to deny or question the genuineness of his signature in the letter of&nbsp; 2 January 1997. The LRA held that the 2 January 1997 letter is an official communication from Engr. Dalire. Finally, the LRA ruled that Manotok, et al.'s TCT No. RT-22481 [372302] is sham and spurious, thus:<br><blockquote>It is undisputed that Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate, the property in question, is located at Barrio Matandang Balara, Quezon City. Several documents submitted by oppositors particularly the several Deeds of Sale and Unilateral Deed of Conveyance including the real estate tax receipts would show that Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate is located at Barrio Payong, and/or Barrio Culiat [Annexes "2" to "77" inclusive "79", "84" and "85" of Opposition] which is grossly inaccurate. The map of Quezon City [Annex "N" of Petitioners' Position Paper] would show that there is no such barrio as Payong. It must likewise be noted that there is a Barrio Culiat but the same is separate and distinct from Barrio Matandang Balara and they do not adjoin each other. Quite perplexing though is the fact that the real estate tax receipts for payments made after the Quezon City Hall was gutted by fire on 11 June 1988 would show that the property covered thereby is already situated at Barrio Matandang Balara [Annexes "91" to "104" inclusive of Opposition], while in other tax payment receipts [Annexes "103" to "114" inclusive of Opposition], Barrio Capitol is indicated as the location of the property in question. This is highly questionable and likewise highly irregular. The said real estate tax receipts also reflect the tax declarations of the property covered thereby. It is highly irregular that the tax declaration numbers indicated therein would vary and those tax declarations which appear to have been canceled would again be revived.<br><br>The claim of the oppositors that the property in question per TCT No. RT-22481 [372302] covers only one <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[1]</span> lot is also inaccurate and without any basis. Plan FLS 3168D shows that the property in question indeed consists of two <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[2]</span> lots, Lot 823-A and Lot 823-B. The same is being buttressed and corroborated by the certified copy of the tax map over the property in question issued by the Quezon City Assessor's Office [Annex "H" of Petitioners' Position Paper]. Said tax map shows that similar to TCT No. 210177 and Plan FLS 3168D, the property in question covers two <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[2]</span> lots, Lot 823-A and Lot 823-B. Granting arguendo that Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate has not yet been subdivided into two <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">[2]</span> lots from the date of original survey in 1907, it is highly irregular that TCT No. RT-22481 [372302] would have Lot 822-A Psd 2498, Lot 818-A and Lot 818-C Psd 2507 as boundaries when at the time of the original survey, there were no such Psd's yet.<br><br>Examination of the technical decription and boundaries appearing in TCT No. RT-22481 [372302] would show that the same do not, in all respects, conform to the certified technical description and boundaries of Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate [property in question] which are the B. L. Form No. 28-37-R and B. L. Form No. 31-10 issued by the Bureau of Lands [Annexes "I" and "J" of Petitioners' Position Paper]. There was never any mention of Payatas Estate nor Tuazon Estate as the boundaries of the lot in question. The lot in question does not at all adjoin the Payatas Estate which was surveyed only on January 12, 1923 as per certification issued by the LMS-DENR-NCR [Annex "L" Petitioners' Position Paper]. As correctly pointed out by petitioners, Lot 822 was mentioned as one of the boundaries of TCT No. RT-22481 [372302]. It was not, however, indicated whether or not it was Lot 822 of the Piedad Estate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></blockquote>However, the LRA ruled that TCT No. 210177 could only be reconstituted after a court of competent jurisdiction has cancelled TCT&nbsp; No. RT-22481 [372302]. The dispositive portion of the LRA Resolution reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, it is hereby ordered that reconstitution of TCT No. 210177 in the name of Homer L.

Otherwise, he shall deny the petition, stating his reasons therefor. The Register of Deeds concerned and the petitioner shall be furnished with copies of the order. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>When Atty. Bustos requested Engr. Dalire to furnish his office with a copy of Fls-3168-D, it was part of the verification process prior to reconstitution of the title. Considering the numerous petitions for reconstitution due to the destruction of the Quezon City Hall, Atty. Bustos was merely exercising caution to avoid the reconstitution of spurious titles. Atty. Bustos conducted a verification of TCT No. 210177 pursuant to paragraph 8 of LRA Circular No. 13. Hence, the LRA erred in ruling that Atty. Bustos should have confined himself to the owner's duplicate of TCT No. 210177.<br><br>Section 3<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> of Republic Act No. 26<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> ("RA 26") enumerates the sources for reconstitution of transfer certificates of title. For administrative reconstitution of title, the only source documents are the owner's duplicate of the certificate of title and the co-owner's, mortgagee's, or lessee's duplicate of the certificate of title. Section 12<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> of RA 26 does not apply in the present cases since Section 12 refers to judicial reconstitution of title.<br><br>The reconstitution of a certificate of title is far from being a ministerial act. In an administrative reconstitution, the petitioner must submit the owner's or co-owner's duplicate of the certificate of title as required by Section 3 of RA 26 and paragraph 4 of LRA Circular No. 13.<br><br>However, the submission of the source documents does not mean that the reconstituting officer must forthwith grant the petition for reconstitution. It does not also mean that the reconstituting officer must confine himself with the owner's or co-owner's duplicate of the certificate of title. In accordance with paragraph 8 of LRA Circular No. 13, the reconstituting officer or the Register of Deeds shall issue an order of reconstitution only after appropriate verification which means that he must be convinced that the certificate of title is genuine and not spurious. Thus, the reconstituting officer must go beyond the owner's or co-owner's duplicate certificate of title to determine whether the title is genuine. The process of verification allows the reconstituting officer to countercheck with other government agencies to determine the validity of the title to be reconstituted.<br><br>When Atty. Bustos requested for a copy of Fls-3168-D, he was not only exercising caution but more importantly, it was part of the verification process under paragraph 8 of LRA Circular No. 13. The Heirs of Barque filed the petition for reconstitution only in 1996, eight years after the alleged destruction of the original TCT in 1988. The reconstituting officer should not be blamed for verifying if he should grant the petition for reconstitution. Paragraph 8 of LRA Circular No. 13 mandates that Atty.

However, it is not within its powers and functions to declare a title void. Under Section 19 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129&nbsp; ("BP Blg. 129"), "Regional Trial Courts shall exercise <span style="font-weight: bold;">exclusive original jurisdiction</span> xxx in all civil actions, which involve the title to, or possession of, real property, or any interest therein."&nbsp; The LRA, in its 24 June 1998 Resolution, recognized that only the Regional Trial Court ("RTC") could declare a title fraudulently reconstituted. The LRA declared:<br><blockquote>Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is noted that although TCT&nbsp; No. RT-22481 (372302) in the name of the Manotoks is alleged to cover a property with an "expanded area" and that the same was fraudulently reconstituted, the same is existing as a reconstituted title at the Office of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City. It is thus presumed valid until ordered declared null and void by a court of competent jurisdiction. A title issued under the Torrens system enjoys the presumption of validity (Ramos vs. Rodriguez, 244 SCRA 418). Although it is now being claimed that the title of the Manotoks was wrongly reconstituted, it is only the Regional Trial Court which can declare that the same was fraudulently reconstituted. Well-settled is the rule that a certificate of title cannot be altered, modified or cancelled except in a direct proceeding in accordance with law (Section 48, P.D. 1529; Calalang vs. Register of Deeds of Quezon City, 231 SCRA 88, 106). xxx<br><br>xxx<br><br>It must likewise be stressed that questions affecting title to real property fall within the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Courts as expressly provided for under B.P. Blg. 129, particularly Section 19(2) thereof xxx.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></blockquote>Clearly, LRA's jurisdiction to act on petitions for administrative reconstitution does not include the power to declare a title sham or spurious or to order the cancellation of a certificate of title.<br><br>The settled rule is a certificate of title cannot be subject to collateral attack.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> A certificate of title may only be altered, modified or cancelled in a direct proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> Section 48 of PD 1529 provides:<br><blockquote>Section 48. <span style="font-style: italic;">Certificate not Subject to Collateral attack</span>. — A certificate of title shall not be subject to collateral attack. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It cannot be altered, modified, or cancelled except in a direct proceeding in accordance with law. </span>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>To allow the cancellation of Manotok, et al.'s title in an administrative reconstitution proceeding will permit an indirect attack on the certificate of title in violation of Section 48 of PD 1529.<br><br>The LRA exceeded its jurisdiction when it declared that Manotok, et al.'s title is sham and spurious. The LRA itself acknowledged that only the RTC could declare a title fraudulently reconstituted. By ruling on the validity of Manotok, et al.'s title, the LRA assumed the function of the RTC. The LRA also preempted whatever decision the RTC may render on the matter.<br><br>The Register of Deeds, the LRA and the Court of Appeals have <span style="font-weight: bold;">no jurisdiction</span> to act on the petition for reconstitution filed by the Heirs of Barque in view of the existing Torrens title of Manotok, et al. No court, much less an administrative body, can entertain a petition for reconstitution of lost or destroyed title if the land is already covered by a Torrens title in the name of another party, unless there is a final judgment first cancelling such Torrens title. The only exception is when the Torrens title has been issued for less than one year,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup> which is not the situation in the present cases.<br><br>To allow such reconstitution is to allow a collateral attack on the existing Torrens title in violation of Section 48 of PD 1529. Such reconstitution will result in an anomalous situation where two Torrens title in the name of two different owners cover one property, a situation anathema to the very concept of stability and indefeasibility of a Torrens title. In <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Alabang Development Corporation v. Valenzuela</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> the Court ruled:<br><blockquote>The Court stresses once more that lands already covered by duly issued existing Torrens Titles (which become incontrovertible upon the expiration of one year from their issuance under Section 38 of the Land Registration Act) cannot be the subject of petitions for reconstitution of allegedly lost or destroyed titles filed by third parties without first securing by final judgment the cancellation of such existing titles. x x x <span style="font-weight: bold;">The courts simply have no jurisdiction over petitions by such third parties for reconstitution of allegedly lost or destroyed titles over lands that are already covered by duly issued subsisting titles in the names of their duly registered owners</span>. The very concept of stability and indefeasibility of titles covered under the Torrens System of registration rules out as anathema the issuance of two certificates of title over the same land to two different holders thereof. A fortiori, such proceedings for "reconstitution" without actual notice to the duly registered owners and holders of Torrens Titles to the land are null and void. Applicants, land officials and judges who disregard these basic and fundamental principles will be held duly accountable therefor. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>The Court has<span style="font-weight: bold;"> repeatedly</span> reiterated this ruling in subsequent cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>By cancelling the TCT of Manotok, et al., and upholding the TCT of the Heirs of Barque, the Court of Appeals resolved in the administrative reconstitution case the issue of ownership over the property in dispute. This is grave error because ownership is never in issue in a petition for reconstitution of title. As this Court ruled in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Alonso v. Cebu Country Club, Inc.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>:<br><blockquote>Respondent relies solely on its reconstituted title which, by itself, does not determine or resolve the ownership of the land covered by the lost or destroyed title. <span style="font-style: italic;">The reconstitution of a title is simply the re-issuance of a lost duplicate certificate of title &nbsp;in its original form and condition. It does not determine or resolve the ownership of the land covered by the lost or destroyed title. A reconstituted title , like the original certificate of title, by itself does not vest ownership of the land or estate covered thereby. </span>(Emphasis in original)</blockquote>In a petition for reconstitution of title, the only relief sought is the issuance of a reconstituted title because the reconstituting officer's power is limited to granting or denying a reconstituted title. The reconstituting officer has no power to decide questions of ownership. A Torrens title, even a reconstituted title, is "evidence of an indefeasible title to the property in favor of the person whose name appears therein."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> Certainly, the reconstituting officer in an administrative proceeding has no authority to deprive a third party of his property by cancelling his Torrens title to the property. In a petition for reconstitution, such third party is not even required to be impleaded as a respondent.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Equity Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals</span><br><br>In its original Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 66642, the Court of Appeals held that Manotok, et al.'s title is presumed valid until annulled by a court of competent jurisdiction. In CA-G.R. SP No. 66700, the Court of Appeals originally ruled that the LRA is without jurisdiction and cannot determine which of the two titles is valid.<br><br>Yet, in the two Amended Decisions, the Court of Appeals sustained as conclusive the LRA's finding that the title of the Heirs of Barque is the genuine and authentic title. Moreover, in the Amended Decisions, the Court of Appeals ordered the Register of Deeds to cancel Manotok, et al.'s TCT No. RT-22481 even without a direct proceeding before the proper RTC as mandated by Section 48 of PD 1529 and Section 19 of BP Blg. 129. Clearly, the Court of Appeals deprived Manotok, et al. of their property without due process of law.<br><br>In reversing itself, the Court of Appeals insists that it may decide the cases on the merits based on the records before it "in the pursuit of expeditious administration of justice." In other words, the Court of Appeals assumed equity jurisdiction over the cases.<br><br>Equity jurisdiction aims to attain complete justice in cases where a court of law is unable to render judgment to meet the special circumstances of a case because of the limitations of its statutory jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> However, equity follows the law, and courts exercising equity jurisdiction must still apply the law and have no discretion to disregard the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Where the law prescribes a particular remedy with fixed and limited boundaries, the court cannot, by exercising equity jurisdiction, extend the boundaries further than the law allows.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> Thus, the Court ruled:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">As for equity,</span> which has been aptly described as "a justice outside legality," <span style="font-weight: bold;">this is applied only in the absence of, and never against, statutory law or, as in this case, judicial rules of procedure.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Aequetas nunguam contravenit legis.</span> The pertinent positive rules being present here, they should pre-empt and prevail over all abstract arguments based only on equity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>Hence, the Court of Appeals may not extend jurisdiction to the LRA where the law has not granted such jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals may not also allow a collateral attack on a Torrens title, either before the LRA or before itself, in gross violation of Section 48 of PD 1529. The present cases involve a vast tract of land in a prime district. The property in question contains an area of 342,945 square meters. At a conservative estimate of P5,000 per square meter, the value of the property amounts to P1,714,725,000. The documents submitted by the parties are conflicting. The parties question the authenticity of each other's documents. Manotok, et al. claim that they and their predecessors-in-interest have been in possession of the property since 1919 while the Heirs of Barque allegedly have never set foot on the property.<br><br>The determination of the authenticity of the documents and veracity of the claims of both parties requires a trial on the merits. The LRA exceeded its jurisdiction when it made a conclusive finding on the validity of the titles of the parties. Such function falls under the "exclusive original jurisdiction" of the RTC under Section 19 of BP Blg. 129. The Court of Appeals should not have resolved the factual issues by adopting as its own the LRA's finding. This Court accords respect, if not finality, to factual findings of an administrative body. However, this rule does not apply when the administrative body has no jurisdiction to make a conclusive factual finding particularly when the findings might conflict with findings of the tribunal or agency which has jurisdiction on the matter.<br><br>Respondents claim that there is no Barrio Payong in Quezon City. Respondents point to the 24 June 1998 Resolution of the LRA stating that Barrio Payong is non-existent. However, the Decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations, the court of origin in <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Spouses Tiongson, et al. v. Court Appeals and Macaya,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> shows that Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate is located at Barrio Payong, Old Balara, Quezon City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup> Indeed, the Court of Agrarian Relations made an ocular inspection of the property, thus:<br><blockquote>On June 20, 1978, the Court issued an Order directing the Clerk of Court to conduct an ocular inspection of the landholding in question, which is as follows: <br><blockquote>"Conformably with 'Urgent Motion For An Ocular Inspection' filed with this Court on even date and as stated in paragraph 2 thereof, the Clerk of Court is hereby direct to conduct an ocular inspection of the landholding in question situated at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Payong, Quezon City, </span>which as agreed upon between them is set on June 23, 1978 at 8:30 o'clock A.M.

Perpetua Bocanegra, with an area of more or less one hectare;<br><br>(f) Portions burned by the plaintiff." <br><br> Upon accomplishment thereof, said Clerk of Court is hereby directed to submit his report as well as his sketch plan for further disposition of the Court.</blockquote>On June 27, 1977, the Clerk of Court submitted his "REPORT", which is as follows: <br><blockquote>"In compliance with the Order of the Honorable Court dated June 20, 1978, undersigned together with Mr. Victor Flores of this Branch, proceeded to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Barrio Payong, Quezon City </span>on June 23, 1978, to conduct an ocular inspection of the landholding involved in this case. xxx"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote></blockquote>The findings of the LRA that Barrio Payong does not exist is based merely on LRA's evaluation of the documents. In contrast, the findings of the Court of Agrarian Relations that the property of the Spouses Tiongson is located in Barrio Payong, Quezon City, is based on ocular inspection. The majority opinion adopts the findings of the LRA.

In <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ortigas,</span> the Court ruled that a remand of the case would be pointless and unduly circuitous, and that to defer adjudication on the matter would be unwarranted and unjust. This is because the records showed that Ortigas' titles had already been upheld and affirmed in three other cases, involving either the original registration or direct attacks on the titles, decided in 1906, 1985 and 1987.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> The Court ruled that Ortigas' documents of ownership have been passed upon, sanctioned and sustained by the Court more than once.

(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>This is the specific ruling in <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Ortigas</span> that applies to the present cases.<br><br>In summary, the Heirs of Barque filed before the Register of Deeds an administrative petition to reconstitute their allegedly destroyed TCT. The Register of Deeds, as reconstituting officer, denied the petition of the Heirs of Barque because, based on official records, the property involved is already registered under the Torrens system in the name of Manotok, et al. The LRA affirmed the Register of Deeds, stating that only the proper trial court could cancel the TCT of Manotok, et al. although the LRA believed that the TCT of Manotok, et al. was a sham. The LRA recognized that in an administrative reconstitution, the decision of the reconstituting body is either to deny or approve the reconstitution of the applicant's title, never to cancel the Torrens title of a third party. However, on appeal, the Court of Appeals declared the TCT of Manotok, et al. void and the TCT of the Heirs of Barque valid. Clearly, the Court of Appeals deprived Manotok, et al. of their property without due process of law. The Court of Appeals blatantly disregarded Section 48 of PD 1529 and Section 19 of BP Blg. 129 which confer on the proper trial court exclusive original jurisdiction to cancel a Torrens title in an action directly attacking the validity of the Torrens title.

In addition, the Tiongson case did not mention the TCT number of the property although petitioners in the present cases are also the petitioners in the Tiongson case. However, the Tiongson case also involves a 34-hectare lot located in Payong, Old Balara, Quezon City which is the same general area involved in the present cases. A reading of the Decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations, the court of origin, shows that the property in the Tiongson case involves Lot 823 of the Piedad Estate, containing an area of 34 hectares, located at Barrio Payong, Old Balara, Quezon City.
