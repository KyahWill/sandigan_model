				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Business companies registered in and operating from the Special Economic Zone in Naga, Cebu -- like herein respondent -- are <i>entities</i> exempt from all internal revenue taxes and the implementing rules relevant thereto, including the value-added taxes or VAT. Although export sales are not deemed exempt <i>transactions</i>, they are nonetheless zero-rated. Hence, in the present case, the distinction between exempt <i>entities</i> and exempt <i>transactions</i> has little significance, because the net result is that the taxpayer is not liable for the VAT. Respondent, a VAT-registered enterprise, has complied with all requisites for claiming a tax refund of or credit for the input VAT it paid on capital goods it purchased. Thus, the Court of Tax Appeals and the Court of Appeals did not err in ruling that it is entitled to such refund or credit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, seeking to set aside the May 27, 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 66093. The decretal portion of the Decision reads as follows:<br><blockquote>“WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, the petition for review is DENIED for lack of merit.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></div><br>The CA quoted the facts narrated by the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), as follows:<br><blockquote>“As jointly stipulated by the parties, the pertinent facts x x x involved in this case are as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<ol type="1"><li> [Respondent] is a resident foreign corporation duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to do business in the Philippines, with principal office address at the new Cebu Township One, Special Economic Zone, Barangay Cantao-an, Naga, Cebu;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> [Petitioner] is sued in his official capacity, having been duly appointed and empowered to perform the duties of his office, including, among others, the duty to act and approve claims for refund or tax credit;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> [Respondent] is registered with the Philippine Export Zone Authority (PEZA) and has been issued PEZA Certificate No. 97-044 pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 66, as amended, to engage in the manufacture of recording components primarily used in computers for export. Such registration was made on 6 June 1997;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> [Respondent] is VAT [(Value Added Tax)]-registered entity as evidenced by VAT Registration Certification No. 97-083-000600-V issued on 2 April 1997;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> VAT returns for the period 1 April 1998 to 30 June 1999 have been filed by [respondent];<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> An administrative claim for refund of VAT input taxes in the amount of P28,369,226.38 with supporting documents (inclusive of the P12,267,981.04 VAT input taxes subject of this Petition for Review), was filed on 4 October 1999 with Revenue District Office No. 83, Talisay Cebu;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> No final action has been received by [respondent] from [petitioner] on [respondent’s] claim for VAT refund.<br></li></ol>“The administrative claim for refund by the [respondent] on October 4, 1999 was not acted upon by the [petitioner] prompting the [respondent] to elevate the case to [the CTA] on July 21, 2000 by way of Petition for Review in order to toll the running of the two-year prescriptive period.<br><br>“For his part, [petitioner] x x x raised the following Special and Affirmative Defenses, to wit:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<ol type="1"><li> [Respondent’s] alleged claim for tax refund/credit is subject to administrative routinary investigation/examination by [petitioner’s] Bureau;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> Since ‘taxes are presumed to have been collected in accordance with laws and regulations,’ the [respondent] has the burden of proof that the taxes sought to be refunded were erroneously or illegally collected x x x;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> <i>In Citibank, N.A. vs. Court of Appeals</i>, 280 SCRA 459 (1997), the Supreme Court ruled that:<br><blockquote>“A claimant has the burden of proof to establish the factual basis of his or her claim for tax credit/refund.”<br></blockquote></li><li> Claims for tax refund/tax credit are construed in ‘strictissimi juris’ against the taxpayer. This is due to the fact that claims for refund/credit [partake of] the nature of an exemption from tax. Thus, it is incumbent upon the [respondent] to prove that it is indeed entitled to the refund/credit sought. Failure on the part of the [respondent] to prove the same is fatal to its claim for tax credit. He who claims exemption must be able to justify his claim by the clearest grant of organic or statutory law. An exemption from the common burden cannot be permitted to exist upon vague implications;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> Granting, without admitting, that [respondent] is a Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) registered Ecozone Enterprise, then its business is not subject to VAT pursuant to Section 24 of Republic Act No. ([RA]) 7916 in relation to Section 103 of the Tax Code, as amended. As [respondent’s] business is not subject to VAT, the capital goods and services it alleged to have purchased are considered not used in VAT taxable business. As such, [respondent] is not entitled to refund of input taxes on such capital goods pursuant to Section 4.106.1 of Revenue Regulations No. ([RR])7-95, and of input taxes on services pursuant to Section 4.103 of said regulations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li> [Respondent] must show compliance with the provisions of Section 204 (C) and 229 of the 1997 Tax Code on filing of a written claim for refund within two (2) years from the date of payment of tax.’<br></li></ol>“On July 19, 2001, the Tax Court rendered a decision granting the claim for refund.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u></b><br></div><br>The CA affirmed the Decision of the CTA granting the claim for refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate (TCC) in favor of respondent in the reduced amount of P12,122,922.66. This sum represented the unutilized but substantiated input VAT paid on capital goods purchased for the period covering April 1, 1998 to June 30, 1999.<br><br>The appellate court reasoned that respondent had availed itself only of the fiscal incentives under Executive Order No. (EO) 226 (otherwise known as the Omnibus Investment Code of 1987), not of those under both Presidential Decree No. (PD) 66, as amended, and Section 24 of RA 7916. Respondent was, therefore, considered exempt only from the payment of income tax when it opted for the income tax holiday in lieu of the 5 percent preferential tax on gross income earned. As a VAT-registered entity, though, it was still subject to the payment of other national internal revenue taxes, like the VAT.<br><br>Moreover, the CA held that neither Section 109 of the Tax Code nor Sections 4.106-1 and 4.103-1 of RR 7-95 were applicable. Having paid the input VAT on the capital goods it purchased, respondent correctly filed the administrative and judicial claims for its refund within the two-year prescriptive period. Such payments were -- to the extent of the refundable value -- duly supported by VAT invoices or official receipts, and were not yet offset against any output VAT liability.<br><br>Hence this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Sole Issue</b></u><br></div><br>Petitioner submits this sole issue for our consideration:<br><blockquote>“Whether or not respondent is entitled to the refund or issuance of Tax Credit Certificate in the amount of P12,122,922.66 representing alleged unutilized input VAT paid on capital goods purchased for the period April 1, 1998 to June 30, 1999.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b><br></div><br>The Petition is unmeritorious.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Sole Issue:</b></u><br><u><b><i>Entitlement of a VAT-Registered PEZA Enterprise to</i></b></u><br><u><b><i>a Refund of or Credit for Input VAT</i></b></u><br></div><br>No doubt, as a PEZA-registered enterprise within a special economic zone,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> respondent is entitled to the fiscal incentives and benefits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> provided for in either PD 66<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> or EO 226.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> It shall, moreover, enjoy all privileges, benefits, advantages or exemptions under both Republic Act Nos.

The seller who charges zero output tax on such <i>transactions</i> can also claim a refund of or a tax credit certificate for the VAT previously charged by suppliers.<br><br><i style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Zero Rating and<br>Exemption</b></i><br><br>In terms of the VAT <i>computation</i>, zero rating and exemption are the same, but the <i>extent of relief</i> that results from either one of them is not.<br><br>Applying the <i>destination principle</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> to the exportation of goods, automatic zero rating<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> is primarily intended to be enjoyed by the seller who is directly and legally liable for the VAT, making such seller internationally competitive by allowing the refund or credit of input taxes that are attributable to export sales.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> Effective zero rating, on the contrary, is intended to benefit the purchaser who, not being directly and legally liable for the payment of the VAT, will ultimately bear the burden of the tax shifted by the suppliers.<br><br>In both instances of zero rating, there is <i>total relief</i> for the purchaser from the burden of the tax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup> But in an exemption there is only <i>partial relief</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> because the purchaser is not allowed any tax refund of or credit for input taxes paid.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br><i style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Exempt Transaction<br>and Exempt Party</b></i><br><br>The object of exemption from the VAT may either be the transaction itself or any of the parties to the transaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>An <i>exempt transaction</i>, on the one hand, involves goods or services which, by their nature, are specifically listed in and expressly exempted from the VAT under the Tax Code, without regard to the tax status --VAT-exempt or not -- of the party to the transaction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Indeed, such <i>transaction</i> is not subject to the VAT, but the seller is not allowed any tax refund of or credit for any input taxes paid.<br><br>An <i>exempt party</i>, on the other hand, is a person or entity granted VAT exemption under the Tax Code, a special law or an international agreement to which the Philippines is a signatory, and by virtue of which its taxable transactions become exempt from the VAT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup> Such <i>party</i> is also not subject to the VAT, but may be allowed a tax refund of or credit for input taxes paid, depending on its registration as a VAT or non-VAT taxpayer.<br><br>As mentioned earlier, the VAT is a tax on consumption, the amount of which may be shifted or passed on by the seller to the purchaser of the goods, properties or services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> While the <i>liability</i> is imposed on one person, the <i>burden</i> may be passed on to another. Therefore, if a special law merely exempts a party as a <i>seller from its direct liability</i> for payment of the VAT, but does not relieve the same party as a <i>purchaser from its indirect burden</i> of the VAT shifted to it by its VAT-registered suppliers, the purchase <i>transaction</i> is not exempt. Applying this principle to the case at bar, the purchase <i>transactions</i> entered into by respondent are not VAT-exempt.<br><br>Special laws may certainly exempt transactions from the VAT.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup> However, the Tax Code provides that those falling under PD 66 are not. PD 66 is the precursor of RA 7916 -- the special law under which respondent was registered. The purchase <i>transactions</i> it entered into are, therefore, not VAT-exempt. These are subject to the VAT; respondent is required to register.<br><br>Its sales transactions, however, will either be zero-rated or taxed at the standard rate of 10 percent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup> depending again on the application of the <i>destination principle</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup><br><br>If respondent enters into such sales <i>transactions</i> with a purchaser -- usually in a foreign country -- for use or consumption outside the Philippines, these shall be subject to 0 percent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup> If entered into with a purchaser for use or consumption in the Philippines, then these shall be subject to 10 percent,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup> unless the purchaser is exempt from the indirect burden of the VAT, in which case it shall also be zero-rated.<br><br>Since the purchases of respondent are not exempt from the VAT, the rate to be applied is zero. Its exemption under both PD 66 and RA 7916 effectively subjects such <i>transactions</i> to a zero rate,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup> because the ecozone within which it is registered is managed and operated by the PEZA as a <i>separate customs territory</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup> This means that in such zone is created the legal fiction of foreign territory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup> Under the <i>cross-border principle</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup> of the VAT system being enforced by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup> no VAT shall be imposed to form part of the cost of goods destined for consumption outside of the territorial border of the taxing authority. If exports of goods and services from the Philippines to a foreign country are free of the VAT,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> then the same rule holds for such exports from the national territory -- except specifically declared areas -- to an ecozone.<br><br>Sales made by a VAT-registered person in the customs territory to a PEZA-registered entity are considered exports to a foreign country; conversely, sales by a PEZA-registered entity to a VAT-registered person in the customs territory are deemed imports from a foreign country.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> An ecozone -- indubitably a geographical territory of the Philippines -- is, however, regarded in law as foreign soil.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> This legal fiction is necessary to give meaningful effect to the policies of the special law creating the zone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup> If respondent is located in an export processing zone<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup> within that ecozone, sales to the export processing zone, even without being actually exported, shall in fact be viewed as <i>constructively exported</i> under EO 226.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup> Considered as export sales,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup> such purchase <i>transactions</i> by respondent would indeed be subject to a zero rate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup><br><br><b><i><u>Tax Exemptions<br>Broad and Express</u></i></b><br><br>Applying the special laws we have earlier discussed, respondent as an entity is exempt from internal revenue laws and regulations.<br><br>This exemption covers <i>both</i> direct and indirect taxes, stemming from the very nature of the VAT as a tax on consumption, for which the direct <i>liability</i> is imposed on one person but the indirect <i>burden</i> is passed on to another. Respondent, as an exempt entity, can neither be directly charged for the VAT on its sales nor indirectly made to bear, as added cost to such sales, the equivalent VAT on its purchases. <i>Ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguere debemus</i>. Where the law does not distinguish, we ought not to distinguish.<br><br>Moreover, the exemption is both express and pervasive for the following reasons:<br><br><i>First</i>, RA 7916 states that “no taxes, local and national, shall be imposed on business establishments operating within the ecozone.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup> Since this law does not exclude the VAT from the prohibition, it is deemed included. <i>Exceptio firmat regulam in casibus non exceptis</i>. An exception confirms the rule in cases not excepted; that is, a thing not being excepted must be regarded as coming within the purview of the general rule.<br><br>Moreover, even though the VAT is not imposed on the entity but on the transaction, it may still be passed on and, therefore, indirectly imposed on the same entity -- a patent circumvention of the law.

One can, therefore, counterargue that such provision merely exempts respondent from taxes imposed on business. To repeat, the VAT is a tax imposed on consumption, not on business. Although respondent as an entity is exempt, the <i>transactions</i> it enters into are not necessarily so.
