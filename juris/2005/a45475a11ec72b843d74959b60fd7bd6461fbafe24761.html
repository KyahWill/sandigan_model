It acts as the investment manager of both Philippine Fund, Inc. (PFI) and Philam Bond Fund, Inc. (PBFI), which are open-end investment companies[,] in the sale of their shares of stocks and in the investment of the proceeds of these sales into a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities. Being an investment manager, [p]etitioner provides management and technical services to PFI and PBFI. Petitioner is, likewise, PFI's and PBFI's principal distributor which takes charge of the sales of said companies' shares to prospective investors. Pursuant to the separate [m]anagement and [d]istribution agreements between the [p]etitioner and PFI and PBFI, both PFI and PBFI [agree] to pay the [p]etitioner, by way of compensation for the latter's services and facilities, a monthly management fee from which PFI and PBFI withhold the amount equivalent to [a] five percent (5%) creditable tax[,] pursuant to the Expanded Withholding Tax Regulations.<br><br>"On April 3, 1998, [p]etitioner filed its [a]nnual [c]orporate [i]ncome [t]ax [r]eturn for the taxable year 1997 representing a net loss of P2,689,242.00. Consequently, it failed to utilize the creditable tax withheld in the amount of Five Hundred Twenty-Two Thousand Ninety-Two Pesos (P522,092.00) representing [the] tax withheld by [p]etitioner's withholding agents, PFI and PBFI[,] on professional fees.<br><br>"The creditable tax withheld by PFI and PBFI in the amount of P522,092.00 is broken down as follows: <br><br><table ï¿½="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="75%"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: right;">PFI&nbsp; <br></td><td style="text-align: right;">P496,702.05</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: right;">PBFI</td><td style="text-align: right; text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp; &nbsp; 25,389.66</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: right;">Total</td><td style="text-align: right;">P522,091.71</td></tr></tbody></table><br>"On September 11, 1998, [p]etitioner filed an administrative claim for refund with the [Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)] -- Appellate Division in the amount of P522,092.00 representing unutilized excess tax credits for calendar year 1997. Thereafter, on July 28, 1999, a written request was filed with the same division for the early resolution of [p]etitioner's claim for refund.<br><br>"Respondent did not act on [p]etitioner's claim for refund[;] hence, a Petition for Review was filed with this Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> on November 29, 1999 to toll the running of the two-year prescriptive period."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>On October 9, 2001, the CTA rendered a Decision denying petitioner's Petition for Review. Its Motion for Reconsideration was likewise denied in a Resolution dated January 29, 2002.<br><br>In GR No. 162004, the antecedents are narrated by the CA in this wise:<br><blockquote>"On April 13, 1999, [petitioner] filed its Annual Income Tax Return with the [BIR] for the taxable year 1998 declaring a net loss of P1,504,951.00. Thus, there was no tax due against [petitioner] for the taxable year 1998. Likewise, [petitioner] had an unapplied creditable withholding tax in the amount of P459,756.07, which amount had been previously withheld in that year by petitioner's withholding agents[,] namely x x x [PFI], x x x [PBFI], and Philam Strategic Growth Fund, Inc. (PSGFI).<br><br>"In the next succeeding year, [petitioner] had a tax due in the amount of P80,042.00, and a creditable withholding tax in the amount of P915,995.00. [Petitioner] likewise declared in its 1999 tax return the amount of P459,756.07, which represents its prior excess credit for taxable year 1998.<br><br>"Thereafter, on November 14, 2000, [petitioner] filed with the Revenue District Office No. 50, Revenue Region No. 8, a written administrative claim for refund with respect to the unapplied creditable withholding tax of P459,756.07. According to [petitioner,] the amount of P80,042.00, representing the tax due for the taxable year 1999 has been credited from its P915,995.00 creditable withholding tax for taxable year 1999, thus leaving its 1998 creditable withholding tax in the amount of P459,756.07 still unapplied.<br><br>"The claim for refund yielded no action on the part of the BIR. [Petitioner] then filed a Petition for Review before the CTA on December 26, 2000, asserting that it is entitled [to] the refund [of P459,756.07,] since said amount has not been applied against its tax liabilities in the taxable year 1998.<br><br>"On May 2, 2002, the CTA rendered [a] x x x decision denying [petitioner's] Petition for Review. x x x."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ruling of the Court of Appeals</span><br></div><br>The CA denied the claim of petitioner for a refund of the latter's excess creditable taxes withheld for the years 1997 and 1998, despite compliance with the basic requirements of Revenue Regulations (RR) No. 12-94. The appellate court pointed out that, in the respective Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for both years, petitioner did not indicate its option to have the amounts either refunded or carried over and applied to the succeeding year. It was held that to request for either a refund or a credit of income tax paid, a corporation must signify its intention by marking the corresponding option box on its annual corporate adjustment return.<br><br>The CA further held in GR No. 156637 that the failure to present the 1998 ITR was fatal to the claim for a refund, because there was no way to verify if the tax credit for 1997 could not have been applied against the 1998 tax liabilities of petitioner.<br><br>In GR No. 162004, however, the subsequent acts of petitioner demonstrated its option to carry over its tax credit for 1998, even if it again failed to tick the appropriate box for that option in its 1998 ITR. Under RR 12-94, its failure to indicate that option resulted in the automatic carry-over of any excess tax credit for the prior year. The appellate court said that the government would not be unjustly enriched by denying a refund, because there would be no forfeiture of the amount in its favor. The amount claimed as a refund would remain in the account of the taxpayer until utilized in succeeding taxable years.<br><br>Hence, these Petitions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Issues</span><br></div><blockquote>Petitioner raises two issues in GR No. 156637 for the Court's consideration:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"A.<br></div><br>"Whether or not the failure of the [p]etitioner to indicate in its [a]nnual [i]ncome [t]ax [r]eturn the option to refund its creditable withholding tax is fatal to its claim for refund.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"B.<br></div><br>"Whether or not the presentation in evidence of the [p]etitioner's [a]nnual [i]ncome [t]ax [r]eturn for the succeeding calendar year is a legal requisite in a claim for refund of unapplied creditable withholding tax."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In GR No. 162004, petitioner raises one question only:<br><br>"Whether or not the petitioner is entitled to the refund of its unutilized creditable withholding tax in the taxable year 1998 in the amount of P459,756.07."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>In both cases, a simple issue needs to be resolved: whether petitioner is entitled to a refund of its creditable taxes withheld for taxable years 1997 and 1998.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Court's Ruling</span><br></div><br>The Petition in GR No. 156637 is meritorious, but that in GR No. 162004 is not.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Main Issue:</span><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Entitlement to Refund</span><br></div><br>The provision on the final adjustment return (FAR) was originally found in Section 69 of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1158, otherwise known as the "National Internal Revenue Code of 1977."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On August 1, 1980, this provision was restated as Section 86<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> in PD 1705.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On November 5, 1985, all prior amendments and those introduced by PD 1994<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> &nbsp;were codified<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> into the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1985, as a result of which Section 86 was renumbered<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> as Section 79.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>On July 31, 1986, Section 24 of Executive Order (EO) No. 37 changed all "net income" phrases appearing in Title II of the NIRC of 1977 to "taxable income."

Differently numbered in 1977 but similarly worded 20 years later (1997), Section 76 offers two options to a taxable corporation whose total quarterly income tax payments in a given taxable year exceeds its total income tax due. These options are (1) filing for a <span style="font-style: italic;">tax refund </span>or (2) availing of a <span style="font-style: italic;">tax credit</span>.<br><br>The first option is relatively simple. Any tax on income that is paid in excess of the amount due the government may be refunded, provided that a taxpayer properly applies for the refund.<br><br>The second option works by applying the refundable amount, as shown on the FAR of a given taxable year, against the estimated quarterly income tax liabilities of the succeeding taxable year.<br><br>These two options under Section 76 are alternative in nature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The choice of one precludes the other. Indeed, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Philippine Bank of Communications v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> the Court ruled that a corporation must signify its intention -- whether to request a <span style="font-style: italic;">tax refund</span> or claim a <span style="font-style: italic;">tax credit</span> -- by marking the corresponding option box provided in the FAR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> While a taxpayer is required to mark its choice in the form provided by the BIR, this requirement is only for the purpose of facilitating tax collection.<br><br>One cannot get a <span style="font-style: italic;">tax refund</span> and a <span style="font-style: italic;">tax credit</span> at the same time for the same excess income taxes paid. Failure to signify one's intention in the FAR does not mean outright barring of a valid request for a refund, should one still choose this option later on. A tax credit should be construed merely as an alternative remedy to a tax refund under Section 76, subject to prior verification and approval by respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The reason for requiring that a choice be made in the FAR upon its filing is to ease tax administration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> particularly the self-assessment and collection aspects. A taxpayer that makes a choice expresses certainty or preference and thus demonstrates clear diligence. Conversely, a taxpayer that makes no choice expresses uncertainty or lack of preference and hence shows simple negligence or plain oversight.<br><br>In the present case, respondent denied the claim of petitioner for a refund of excess taxes withheld in 1997, because the latter (1) had not indicated in its ITR for that year whether it was opting for a credit or a refund; and (2) had not submitted as evidence its 1998 ITR, which could have been the basis for determining whether its claimed 1997 tax credit had not been applied against its 1998 tax liabilities.<br><br>Requiring that the ITR or the FAR of the <span style="font-style: italic;">succeeding </span>year be presented to the BIR in requesting a <span style="font-style: italic;">tax refund</span> has no basis in law and jurisprudence.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">First,</span> Section 76 of the Tax Code does not mandate it. The law merely requires the filing of the FAR for the <span style="font-style: italic;">preceding</span> -- not the succeeding -- taxable year. Indeed, any refundable amount indicated in the FAR of the preceding taxable year may be credited against the estimated income tax liabilities for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable year. However, nowhere is there even a tinge of a hint in any of the provisions of the Tax Code that the FAR of the taxable year following the period to which the <span style="font-style: italic;">tax credits</span> are originally being applied should also be presented to the BIR.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Second,</span> Section 5<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> of RR 12-94, amending Section 10(a) of RR 6-85, merely provides that claims for the refund of income taxes deducted and withheld from income payments shall be given due course only (1) when it is shown on the ITR that the income payment received is being declared part of the taxpayer's gross income; and (2) when the fact of withholding is established by a copy of the withholding tax statement, duly issued by the payor to the payee, showing the amount paid and the income tax withheld from that amount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Undisputedly, the records do not show that the income payments received by petitioner have not been declared as part of its gross income, or that the fact of withholding has not been established. According to the CTA, "[p]etitioner substantially complied with the x x x requirements" of RR 12-94 "[t]hat the fact of withholding is established by a copy of a statement duly issued by the payor (withholding agent) to the payee, showing the amount paid and the amount of tax withheld therefrom; and x x x [t]hat the income upon which the taxes were withheld were included in the return of the recipient."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The established procedure is that a taxpayer that wants a cash refund shall make a written request for it, and the ITR showing the excess expanded withholding tax credits shall then be examined by the BIR. For the grant of refund, RRs 12-94 and 6-85 state that all pertinent accounting records should be submitted by the taxpayer. These records, however, actually refer only to (1) the withholding tax statements; (2) the ITR of the present quarter to which the excess withholding tax credits are being applied; and (3) the ITR of the quarter for the previous taxable year in which the excess credits arose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> To stress, these regulations implementing the law do not require the proffer of the FAR for the taxable year following the period to which the <span style="font-style: italic;">tax credits</span> are being applied.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Third</span>, there is no automatic grant of a <span style="font-style: italic;">tax refund</span>. As a matter of procedure, the BIR should be given the opportunity "to investigate and confirm the veracity"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of a taxpayer's claim, before it grants the refund. Exercising the option for a tax refund or a tax credit does not <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto </span>confer upon a taxpayer the right to an immediate availment of the choice made. Neither does it impose a duty on the government to allow tax collection to be at the sole control of a taxpayer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Fourth,</span> the BIR ought to have on file its own copies of petitioner's FAR for the succeeding year, on the basis of which it could rebut the assertion that there was a subsequent credit of the excess income tax payments for the previous year. Its failure to present this vital document to support its contention against the grant of a tax refund to petitioner is certainly fatal.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Fifth,</span> the CTA should have taken judicial notice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> of the fact of filing and the pendency of petitioner's subsequent claim for a refund of excess creditable taxes withheld for 1998. The existence of the claim ought to be known by reason of its judicial functions. Furthermore, it is decisive to and will easily resolve the material issue in this case. If only judicial notice were taken earlier, the fact that there was no carry-over of the excess creditable taxes withheld for 1997 would have already been crystal clear.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sixth,</span> the Tax Code allows the refund of taxes to a taxpayer that claims it in writing within two years after payment of the taxes erroneously received by the BIR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Despite the failure of petitioner to make the appropriate marking in the BIR form, the filing of its written claim effectively serves as an expression of its choice to request a<span style="font-style: italic;"> tax refund</span>, instead of a<span style="font-style: italic;"> tax credit</span>. To assert that any future claim for a<span style="font-style: italic;"> tax refund</span> will be instantly hindered by a failure to signify one's intention in the FAR is to render nugatory the clear provision that allows for a two-year prescriptive period.<br><br>In fact, in <span style="font-style: italic;">BPI-Family Savings Bank v. CA,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> this Court even ordered the refund of a taxpayer's excess creditable taxes, despite the express declaration in the FAR to apply the excess to the succeeding year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> When circumstances show that a choice of tax credit has been made, it should be respected. But when indubitable circumstances clearly show that another choice -- a tax refund -- is in order, it should be granted. "Technicalities and legalisms, however exalted, should not be misused by the government to keep money not belonging to it and thereby enrich itself at the expense of its law-abiding citizens."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In the present case, although petitioner did not mark the refund box in its 1997 FAR, neither did it perform any act indicating that it chose a tax credit. On the contrary, it filed on September 11, 1998, an administrative claim for the refund of its excess taxes withheld in 1997. In none of its quarterly returns for 1998 did it apply the excess creditable taxes. Under these circumstances, petitioner is entitled to a <span style="font-style: italic;">tax refund</span> of its 1997 excess tax credits in the amount of P522,092.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">GR No. 162004</span><br><br>As to the second case, Section 76 also applies. Amended by Republic Act (RA) No. 8424, otherwise known as the "Tax Reform Act of 1997," it now states:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 76. <span style="font-style: italic;">Final Adjustment Return.</span> -- Every corporation liable to tax under Section 27 shall file a final adjustment return covering the total taxable income for the preceding calendar or fiscal year. If the sum of the quarterly tax payments made during the said taxable year is not equal to the total tax due on the entire taxable income of that year, the corporation shall either:<br><br>(A) Pay the balance of tax still due; or<br><br>(B) Carry over the excess credit; or<br><br>(C) Be credited or refunded with the excess amount paid, as the case may be.<br><br>"In case the corporation is entitled to a tax credit or refund of the excess estimated quarterly income taxes paid, the excess amount shown on its final adjustment return may be carried over and credited against the estimated quarterly income tax liabilities for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years. Once the option to carry-over and apply the excess quarterly income tax against income tax due for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable years has been made, such option shall be considered irrevocable for that taxable period and no application for cash refund or issuance of a tax credit certificate shall be allowed therefor."</blockquote>The carry-over option under Section 76 is permissive. A corporation that is entitled to a <span style="font-style: italic;">tax refund</span> or a<span style="font-style: italic;"> tax credit</span> for excess payment of quarterly income taxes may carry over and credit the excess income taxes paid in a given taxable year against the estimated income tax liabilities of the succeeding quarters. Once chosen, the carry-over option shall be considered irrevocable<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> for that taxable period, and no application for a <span style="font-style: italic;">tax refund</span> or issuance of a <span style="font-style: italic;">tax credit certificate</span> shall then be allowed.<br><br>According to petitioner, it neither chose nor marked the carry-over option box in its 1998 FAR.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> As this option was not chosen, it seems that there is nothing that can be considered irrevocable. In other words, petitioner argues that it is still entitled to a refund of its 1998 excess income tax payments.<br><br>This argument does not hold water. The subsequent acts of petitioner reveal that it has <span style="font-style: italic;">effectively chosen</span> the carry-over option.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">First,</span> the fact that it filled out the portion "Prior Year's Excess Credits" in its 1999 FAR means that it categorically availed itself of the carry-over option. In fact, the line that precedes that phrase in the BIR form clearly states "Less: Tax Credits/Payments." The contention that it merely filled out that portion because it was a requirement -- and that to have done otherwise would have been tantamount to falsifying the FAR -- is a long shot.<br><br>The FAR is the most reliable firsthand evidence of corporate acts pertaining to income taxes. In it are found the itemization and summary of additions to and deductions from income taxes due. These entries are not without rhyme or reason. They are required, because they facilitate the tax administration process.<br><br>Failure to indicate the amount of "prior year's excess credits" does not mean falsification by a taxpayer of its current year's FAR. On the contrary, if an application for a tax refund has been -- or will be -- filed, then that portion of the BIR form should necessarily be blank, even if the FAR of the previous taxable year already shows an overpayment in taxes.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Second,</span> the resulting redundancy in the claim of petitioner for a<span style="font-style: italic;"> refund</span> of its 1998 excess tax credits on November 14, 2000<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> cannot be countenanced.
