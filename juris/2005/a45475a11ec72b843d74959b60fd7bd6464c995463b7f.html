Decree No. 704 which provides in Sec. 24:<br><blockquote>‘Lease of fishponds-Public lands available for fishpond development including those earmarked for family-size fishponds and not yet leased prior to November 9, 1972 shall be leased only to qualified persons, associations, cooperatives or corporations, subject to the following conditions.<br><br>‘1.

XII of the 1987 Constitution</span>) states:<br><blockquote>‘Sec. 2 - All lands of the public domain, waters, minerals, coal, petroleum and other mineral oils, all forces of potential energy, fisheries, forests, or timber, wild life, flora and fauna and other natural resources are owned by the state.<br><br>‘Sec. 3 - Lands of the public domain are classified into agricultural, forest or timber, mineral lands and national parks.&nbsp; Agricultural lands of the public domain may be further classified by law according to the uses to which they may be devoted.&nbsp; Alienable lands of the public domain shall be limited to agricultural lands x x x.’<br></blockquote>“As a consequence of these provisions, and the declared public policy of the State under the Regalian Doctrine, the lease contract between Florentino Teves, Jr. and Juan Menchavez Sr. and his family is a patent nullity.&nbsp; Being a patent nullity, [petitioners] could not give any rights to Florentino Teves, Jr. under the principle: ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEMO DAT QUOD NON HABET</span>’ - meaning ONE CANNOT GIVE WHAT HE DOES NOT HAVE, considering that this property in litigation belongs to the State and not to [petitioners].&nbsp; Therefore, the first issue is resolved in the negative, as the court declares the contract of lease as&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;invalid and void ab-initio.<br><br>“On the issue of whether [respondent] and [petitioners] are guilty of mutual fraud, the court rules that the [respondent] and [petitioners] are<span style="font-style: italic;"> in pari-delicto</span>.&nbsp; As a consequence of this, the court must leave them where they are found. x x x.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>“x x x.

Menchavez.<br><br>“After the court has ruled that the contract of lease is null and void ab-initio, there is no right of the [respondent] to protect and therefore[,] there is no basis for questioning the Sheriff’s authority to demolish the dikes in order to restore the prevailing party, under the principle <span style="text-decoration: underline;">VIDETUR NEMO QUISQUAM ID CAPERE QUOD EI NECESSE EST ALII RESTITUERE</span> - He will not be considered as using force who exercise his rights and proceeds by the force of law.<br><br>“WHEREFORE, in view of all foregoing [evidence] and considerations, this court hereby renders judgment as follows:<br><br>“1.

The 1987 Constitution specifically declares that all lands of the public domain, waters, <span style="font-style: italic;">fisheries</span> and other natural resources belong to the State.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Included here are fishponds, which may not be alienated but only leased.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Possession thereof, no matter how long, cannot ripen into ownership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Being merely applicants for the lease of the fishponds, petitioners had no transferable right over them.&nbsp; And even if the State were to grant their application, the law expressly disallowed sublease of the fishponds to respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp; Void are all contracts in which the cause, object or purpose is contrary to law, public order or public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>A void contract is equivalent to nothing; it produces no civil effect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> It does not create, modify or extinguish a juridical relation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Parties to a void agreement cannot expect the aid of the law; the courts leave them as they are, because they are deemed <span style="font-style: italic;">in pari delicto</span> or “in equal fault.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> To this rule, however, there are exceptions that permit the return of that which may have been given under a void contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> One of the exceptions is found in Article 1412 of the Civil Code, which states:<br><blockquote>“Art. 1412.&nbsp; If the act in which the unlawful or forbidden cause consists does not constitute a criminal offense, the following rules shall be observed:<br><br>“(1) When the fault is on the part of both contracting parties, neither may recover what he has given by virtue of the contract, or demand the performance of the other’s undertaking;<br><br>“(2) When only one of the contracting parties is at fault, he cannot recover what he has given by reason of the contract, or ask for the fulfillment of what has been promised him.&nbsp; The other, who is not at fault, may demand the return of what he has given without any obligation to comply with his promise.”<br></blockquote>On this premise, respondent contends that he can recover from petitioners, because he is an innocent party to the Contract of Lease.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Petitioners allegedly induced him to enter into it through serious misrepresentation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;

text-decoration: underline;">A Question of Fact</span><br><br>The issue of whether respondent was at fault or whether the parties were<span style="font-style: italic;"> in pari delicto</span> is a question of fact not normally taken up in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> The present case, however, falls under two recognized exceptions to this rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> This Court is compelled to review the facts, since the CA’s factual findings are (1) contrary to those of the trial court;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> and (2) premised on an absence of evidence, a presumption that is contradicted by the evidence on record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>Unquestionably, petitioners leased out a property that did not belong to them, one that they had no authority to sublease.&nbsp; The trial court correctly observed that petitioners still had a pending lease application with the State at the time they entered into the Contract with respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Respondent, on the other hand, claims that petitioners misled him into executing the Contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> He insists that he relied on their assertions regarding their ownership of the property.&nbsp; His own evidence, however, rebuts his contention that he did not know that they lacked ownership.&nbsp; At the very least, he had notice of their doubtful ownership of the fishpond.<br><br>Respondent himself admitted that he was aware that the petitioners’ lease application for the fishpond had not yet been approved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Thus, he knowingly entered into the Contract with the risk that the application might be disapproved.&nbsp; Noteworthy is the fact that the existence of a fishpond lease application necessarily contradicts a claim of ownership.&nbsp; That respondent did not know of petitioners’ lack of ownership is therefore incredible.<br><br>The evidence of respondent himself shows that he negotiated the lease of the fishpond with both Juan Menchavez Sr. and Juan Menchavez Jr. in the office of his lawyer, Atty. Jorge Esparagoza.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> His counsel’s presence during the negotiations, prior to the parties’ meeting of minds, further debunks his claim of lack of knowledge.&nbsp; Lawyers are expected to know that fishponds belong to the State and are inalienable.&nbsp; It was reasonably expected of the counsel herein to advise his client regarding the matter of ownership.<br><br>Indeed, the evidence presented by respondent demonstrates the contradictory claims of petitioners regarding their alleged ownership of the fishpond.&nbsp; On the one hand, they claimed ownership and, on the other, they assured him that their fishpond lease application would be approved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> This circumstance should have been sufficient to place him on notice.&nbsp; It should have compelled him to determine their right over the fishpond, including their right to lease it.<br><br>The Contract itself stated that the area was still covered by a fishpond application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> Nonetheless, although petitioners declared in the Contract that they co-owned the property, their erroneous declaration should not be used against them.&nbsp; A cursory examination of the Contract suggests that it was drafted to favor the lessee.&nbsp; It can readily be presumed that it was he or his counsel who prepared it -- a matter supported by petitioners’ evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The ambiguity should therefore be resolved against him, being the one who primarily caused it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>The CA erred in finding that petitioners had failed to prove actual knowledge of respondent of the ownership status of the property that had been leased to him.&nbsp; On the contrary, as the party alleging the fact, it was he who had the burden of proving – through a preponderance of evidence<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> -- that they misled him regarding the ownership of the fishpond.&nbsp; His evidence fails to support this contention.&nbsp; Instead, it reveals his fault in entering into a void Contract.&nbsp; As both parties are equally at fault, neither may recover against the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Liquidated Damages</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Not Proper</span><br><br>The CA erred in awarding liquidated damages, notwithstanding its finding that the Contract of Lease was void.&nbsp; Even if it was assumed that respondent was entitled to reimbursement as provided under paragraph 1 of Article 1412 of the Civil Code, the award of liquidated damages was contrary to established legal principles.<br><br>Liquidated damages are those agreed upon by the parties to a contract, to be paid in case of a breach thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> Liquidated damages are identical to penalty insofar as legal results are concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Intended to ensure the performance of the principal obligation, such damages are accessory and subsidiary obligations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> In the present case, it was stipulated that the party responsible for the violation of the terms, conditions and warranties of the Contract would pay not less than P50,000 as liquidated damages.&nbsp; Since the principal obligation was void, there was no contract that could have been breached by petitioners; thus, the stipulation on liquidated damages was inexistent.&nbsp; The nullity of the principal obligation carried with it the nullity of the accessory obligation of liquidated damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>As explained earlier, the applicable law in the present factual milieu is Article 1412 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; This law merely allows innocent parties to recover what they have given without any obligation to comply with their prestation.&nbsp; No damages may be recovered on the basis of a void contract; being nonexistent, the agreement produces no juridical tie between the parties involved.&nbsp; Since there is no contract, the injured party may only recover through other sources of obligations such as a law or a quasi-contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> A party recovering through these other sources of obligations may not claim liquidated damages, which is an obligation arising from a contract.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;
