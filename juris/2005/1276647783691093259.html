On this score alone, the petition is dismissible.<br><br>Respecting the finding by the CA of a "discrepancy between the registry receipts evidencing proof of mailing of the petition upon respondents," in light of petitioner's explanation therefor in his Motion for Reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of the CA Resolution of December 22, 2000, he may be given the benefit of the doubt.<br><br>As for the CA's observation about the "illegibility" of the challenged DARAB Decision and Resolution, a scrutiny of the CA <i>Rollo</i> shows that the copies, attached to petitioner's petition, of the challenged DARAB Decision and Resolution as well as the other attachments, except the three Transfer Certificates of Title, are legible alright but all are mere photocopies which are uncertified. Petitioner did not thus comply with the injunction of Section 69(c) of Rule 43 reading:<br><blockquote>SECTION 6. Contents of petition.—The petition for review shall (a) state the full names of the parties to the case, without impleading the court or agencies either as petitioners or respondents; (b) contain a concise statement if the facts and issues involved and the grounds relied upon for the review; <b>(c) be accompanied by a clearly legible duplicate original or a certified true copy of the award, judgment, final order or resolution appealed from, together with certified true copies of such material portions of the records referred to therein and other supporting papers; </b>and<b> </b>(d) contain a sworn certification against forum shopping as provided in the last paragraph of section 2, Rule 42. The petition shall state the specific material dates showing that it was filed within the period fixed herein. (Emphasis supplied).<br></blockquote>On this score, petitioner's present petition is dismissible too.<br><br>Petitioner's procedural lapses notwithstanding, this Court shall give due course to his petition, in the interest of justice since substantive rights far outweigh the lapses, and treat it as one for review albeit it was filed late for the purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>As basis of her claim to be the bona fide successor to her father, respondent, as the eldest child of Dionisio de Tumol, invokes Ministry of Agrarian Reform Memorandum Circular No. 19, Series of 1978<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> the pertinent provisions of which read:<br><blockquote>Pursuant to the provisions of the Presidential Decree No. 27, and the Policy of the Government laid down in the Code of Agrarian Reforms to establish owner-cultivatorship and the economic family size farm as the basis of agricultural development of the country, the following rules and regulations shall be observed <u>in the event of death of a tenant-beneficiary</u>:<br><br>1. Succession to the farmholding covered by Operation Land Transfer, shall be <u>governed by the pertinent provisions of the New Civil Code</u> of the Philippines <u>subject to the following limitations</u>:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>2. For the purpose of determining who among the heirs shall be the sole owner-cultivator, the following rules shall apply:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>b. Where there are several heirs, and in the absence of extra-judicial settlement or waiver of rights in favor of one heir who shall be the sole owner and cultivator, the heirs shall within one month from death of the tenant-beneficiary be free to choose from among themselves one who shall have sole ownership and cultivation of the land, subject to Paragraph 1(b) and (c) hereof: <b>Provided, however, That the surviving spouse shall be given first preference; <u>otherwise, in the absence or due to the permanent incapacity of the surviving spouse, priority shall be determined among their heirs according to age</u>.</b><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></div></blockquote>Following Article 1141 of the Civil Code which provides:<br><blockquote>ARTICLE 1141. <b>Real actions over immovables <u>prescribe after thirty years</u>.</b><br><br>This provision is without prejudice to what is established for the acquisition of ownership and other real rights by prescription. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied),<br></blockquote>real actions over immovable property, like respondent's petition to enforce her claim as successor to her father's farmholding, prescribe after 30 years.<br><br>Since respondent's cause of action accrued from her father's death in 1979, she had until 2009 to institute her claim as rightful successor to his father's farmholding.<br><br>In 1988, however, the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) which provides suppletory application of the provisions of the CODE OF AGRARIAN REFORM not inconsistent with it, was passed. The relevant provision of said Code which is not inconsistent reads:<br><blockquote>SECTION 38. Statute of Limitations.—An action to enforce any cause of action under this Code shall be barred if <b><u>not commenced within three years after such cause of action accrued</u>.</b> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Since respondent's petition before the DARAB Regional Office was filed on December 29, 1992, it is covered by the above-quoted CODE OF AGRARIAN REFORM provision on prescription. The 3-year prescriptive period should thus be reckoned, not from petitioner's and respondent's father's death in 1979, but from the time CARL took effect which was <u>on June 15, 1988</u>. Hence, <u>respondent had until June 15, 1991 to file her case</u>.<br><br>When respondent filed her petition-DARAB Case No. 2125 NE'92 before the DARAB Regional Office on December 29, 1992, although it was therein alleged that she had referred the case to the BARC, the acronym for Barangay Agrarian Reform Council which, by her claim, was reluctant to entertain it, there is no showing that the referral was made before June 15, 1991 when her cause of action was to prescribe. For purposes of determining therefore of whether respondent's said petition was filed within the period of prescription, its date of filing with the DARAB on December 29, 1992 is controlling.<br><br>When respondent filed on December 29, 1992 her petition, more than three years had elapsed from the effectivity of the CARL on June 15, 1988. Her petition should, therefore, have been dismissed on the ground of prescription.<br><br>At all events, several considerations weigh against the merits of respondent's claims.<br><br>First, respondent initially filed in <u>November 1992</u> a petition in behalf of her mother whom she claimed was the rightful successor of her father. Her mother, however, moved for and <u>the DARAB Regional Office granted the dismissal of the case on December 9, 1992</u>. Twenty days later or on December 29, 1992, she filed her own petition-DARAB Case No. 2125 NE'92 now the subject of the present case, alleging that her mother was too old and incapacitated, hence, she (respondent) is the rightful successor.<br><br>Second, by asserting her rights 13 years after her father's death, estoppel by laches had set in.<br><br>Third, petitioner's claim that respondent had been given her share of her father's estate, a claim confirmed by their mother, but which share she sold to Francisco Magsakay who corroborated such sale to him, has not been controverted.<br><br>Lastly, the regularity in the performance of official duty is presumed in favor of the DAR Regional Director when he issued on <u>September 30, 1985</u> the Order naming petitioner as the successor to his father's farmholding on the basis of documentary evidence showing that respondent and her other siblings had waived their rights and interests thereon, which Order had become final and executory, not to mention that such documentary evidence had not been repudiated or declared a forgery.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in light of the foregoing discussions, the petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.
