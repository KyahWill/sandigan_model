As extended, the installation was finished on or about February 28, 1989, but MEGA-WAFF was, in accordance with its agreement with DMPI, penalized for the delay, albeit at a reduced amount.<br><br>Aragones, having in the meantime gotten wind of MEGA-WAFF &amp; DMPI’s “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Agreement</span>,” more particularly the imposition of a penalty by DMPI for the delay in the completion of the installation of the warehouse pavement, appealed to DMPI, by letter of March 4, 1989,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> for leniency in the imposition of the penalty which “would affect [him] also although [he] was not a direct party to the contract,” he inviting attention to the “intricacy and enormity of the job involved.”<br><br>Aragones later failed to collect from MEGA-WAFF the full payment of the concrete blocks.&nbsp; He thus sent DMPI a letter dated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 10, 1989</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> received by the latter on March 13, 1989,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> advising it of MEGA-WAFF’s unpaid obligation and requesting it to earmark and withhold the amount of P188,652.65 “from [MEGA-WAFF’s] billing” to be paid directly to him “[l]est Garcia collects and fails to pay [him].”<br><br>DMPI, in the meantime, verbally advised Aragones to secure a court order directing it to withhold payment of the amount due MEGA-WAFF for, in the absence of such court order, DMPI was under its agreement with MEGA- WAFF obliged to release full payment within 30 days from acceptance of the completed work.<br><br>It appears that Aragones reiterated his request to DMPI for direct payment to him, by letter of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 28, 1989</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> This was followed by another letter dated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">April 6, 1989</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> which was received on April 8, 1989<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> by DMPI, copy of which it referred to Garcia, by letter of April 27, 1989,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> for his comment.<br><br>By letter of May 3, 1989<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> addressed to DMPI, Garcia, commenting on Aragones’ April 6, 1989 letter, stated:<br><br>x x x<br><blockquote>If there is somebody who have (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) justifiable ground to complain, it is MEGA-WAFF against Atty.

However, the following shall not prejudice the laborers, employees and furnishers of materials:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) Payments made by the owner of the contractor before they are due;<br></div><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(2) Renunciation by the contractor of any amount due him from the owner.<br></div><br>This article is subject to the provisions of special laws (1597a)<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">(Article 1729, New Civil Code</span>, [emphasis supplied]).<br><br>In interpreting the foregoing provision, the Supreme Court made the following pertinent pronouncement:<br><br>“Article 1729 is promulgated <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to protect the laborers and the materialmen from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous contractors and from possible connivance between owners and contractors.”</span>&nbsp; (Velasco vs. C.A. 95 Phils. (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) (616-641).<br><br>“The legal issue that arises is whether or not GSIS is liable to the petitioners for the cost of the materials and labor furnished by them in construction of the 63 houses now owned by the GSIS and for the construction of which no payment has been made on the balance due to petitioners.&nbsp; Our considered view is and we so hold that even in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">equity</span> alone</span>, GSIS should pay the petitioners, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">without prejudice to its securing indemnity from Laigo Realty Corp.”</span> (Velaso vs. C.A., 95 Phils. (<span style="font-style: italic;">sic</span>) 616-641 [emphasis and underscoring supplied]).<br><br>Moreover, anent this matter another decisional rule, says:<br><br>“Although there was no privity of contract between plaintiff and defendant Joven, Inc., there is sufficient evidence showing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that he had really supplied stones and sands to said defendant and also removed dirt and soil from its construction site</span>.&nbsp; And it is this main point which calls for resolution in the light of the provisions of Art. 1729 of the New Civil Code, to determine whether or not defendant corporation is liable for materials supplied and services rendered by the plaintiff.&nbsp; It is quite clear that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the owner of the building, Joven Inc. is liable for materials and labor furnished to the contractor </span>“up to the amount owing from the latter to the contractor” and to enforce such liability, <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">the law allows the person furnishing labor or materials to bring his right of action directly against the owner</span>.”&nbsp; (Flores vs. Ruelo, CA 52 OG 850, [emphasis and underscoring supplied]).<br><br>Of course, while defendant DMPI is indeed directly liable to pay plaintiff the cost of the construction material (modular paving blocks) sought to be collected, this defendant has also a right of recourse against cross defendant Garcia/MEGA-WAFF for reimbursement of whatever amount it will be required here to pay plaintiff, otherwise it would result in making defendant Garcia/MEGA-WAFF enrich itself at the expense of defendant DMPI. Additionally since the evidence on record shows that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">plaintiff was compelled to litigate this matter</span> if only to collect a just and demandable obligation, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the refusal of these defendants to pay their obligation upon demand</span> could not be justified in law, thus both defendants should be condemned to pay exemplary damages in the amount of P20,000.00 each and attorney’s fees in the amount of P10,000.00 each, including the cost of this suit.&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></blockquote>The trial court accordingly rendered judgment in favor of Aragones by decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> of September 11, 1992, the dispositive portion of which reads:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, the <span style="font-style: italic;">foregoing</span> premises considered, the Court finds that there is ample reason in law and preponderant evidence on record to sustain the cause of action of plaintiff asserted against both defendants, thus judgment is now rendered granting the following relief:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">a. That the defendants Garcia/MEGA-WAFF and DMPI shall be liable to jointly and severally pay plaintiff the unpaid cost of the modular paving blocks construction material which he delivered to defendant DMPI priced at P188,652.65 and in the event that defendant DMPI will be made to pay the full amount of this particular obligation, the defendant Garcia MEGA-WAFF must reimburse said defendant such amount;<br><br>b.

The distinction between a contract of sale and one for work, labor and materials is tested by inquiry whether the thing transferred is one not in existence and which never would have existed but for the order of the party desiring to acquire it, or a thing which would have existed but has been the subject of sale to some other persons even if the order had not been given.&nbsp; If the article ordered by the purchaser is exactly such as the seller makes and keeps on hand for sale to anyone, and no change or modification of it is made at purchaser’s request, it is a contract of sale even though it may be entirely made after, and in consequence of the purchaser’s order for it.

No. L-47544, January 28, 1980]<br><br>As a matter of fact, insofar as the laborers are concerned, by a special law, Act no. 3959, otherwise known as “<span style="font-style: italic;">An Act making it obligatory for any person, company, firm or corporation owning any work of any kind executed by contract to require the contractor to furnish a bond guaranteeing the payment of the laborers.</span>” they are given added protection by requiring contractors to file bonds guaranteeing payment to them.<br><br>It is true that defendant-appellant had already fully paid its obligation to defendant Garcia however, the former’s payment to the latter does not extinguish its legal obligation to plaintiff-appellee because such payment was irregular.&nbsp; The former should have taken care not to pay to such contractor the full amount which he is entitled to receive by virtue of the contract, until he shall have shown that he first paid the wages of the laborer employed in said work, by means of an affidavit made and subscribed by said contractor before a notary public or other officer authorized by law to administer oaths.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There is no showing that defendant appellant DMPI, as owner of the building, complied with this requirement paid down in Act No. 3959.&nbsp; Hence, under Section 2 of said law, said defendant-appellant is responsible, jointly and severally with the general contractor</span>, for the payment to plaintiff- appellee as sub-contractor.<br><br>In this connection, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">while, indeed, Article 1729 refers to the laborers and materialmen themselves, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, it is but fair and just that plaintiff-appellee be deemed as suing for the reimbursement of what they have already paid the laborers and materialmen</span>, as otherwise he would be unduly prejudiced while either defendant-appellant DMPI or defendant Garcia would enrich themselves at plaintiff- appellee’s expense.<br><br>Be that as it may, We so hold that plaintiff-appellee has a lawful claim against defendant-appellant DMPI, owner of the constructed warehouse since it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">disregarded the notice of claim of plaintiff-appellee, at a time when the amounts owing from defendant-appellant DMPI to defendant GARCIA were more than sufficient to pay for plaintiff- appellee’s claim</span>.&nbsp; The least that defendant-appellant should have done was to withhold payment of the balance still owing to defendant Garcia as until the claim of plaintiff-appellee was clarified.&nbsp; (Italics in the original; emphasis and underscoring supplied).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br></blockquote>Its Motion for Reconsideration having been denied by the CA, DMPI (hereinafter referred to as petitioner) lodged the present Petition for Review on Certiorari, faulting the CA:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">I.<br></div><blockquote>. . . IN FINDING THAT DMPI WAS LIABLE TO RESPONDENT ARAGONES FOR THE UNPAID PRICE OF THE CONCRETE PAVING BLOCKS OWED BY MEGA-WAFF TO THE LATTER.<br><br>A. …IN FINDING THAT THE CONTRACT FOR THE SUPPLY OF THE CONCRETE PAVING BLOCKS WAS NOT A SALE BUT ONE FOR A PIECE OF WORK.<br><br>B. …IN HOLDING DMPI LIABLE BASED UPON THE PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE 1729 OF THE CIVIL CODE AND ACT 3959, WHICH ARE INAPPLICABLE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>. . .

MEGA-WAFF <span style="text-decoration: underline;">did not appeal.&nbsp; The decision as to it then is final and executory.</span><br><br>Petitioner, in the main, contends that while the CA correctly stated the test in determining whether a transfer is a sale or one for a piece of work, it failed to properly apply the same.<br><br>Applying the “nature of the object” test, petitioner insists that the concrete block to be produced by Aragones under the “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Supply Agreement</span>” represented by Garcia clearly shows that the contract was one of sale, advancing the following reasons:<br><blockquote>1.4.1&nbsp; First, the concrete paving blocks were . . . capable of being mass-produced<br><br>1.4.2&nbsp; Second, save for the shape, there was here no consideration of any special needs or requirements of DMPI taken into account in the design or manufacture of the concrete paving blocks.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner cites the following ruling in <span style="font-style: italic;">Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Arnoldus Carpentry Shop, Inc.</span>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x As can be clearly seen from the wordings of Art. 1467, what determines whether the contract is one of work or of sale is <span style="font-style: italic;">whether the thing has been “manufactured specially for the customer and upon his special order</span>.” Thus, if the thing is specially done on the order of another, this is a contract for a piece of work.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> If,</span> on the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the thing is manufactured or procured <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for the general market in the ordinary course of one’s business</span></span>, it is a contract of sale.” (Italics and emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br></blockquote>and argues that “given habituality of business and the ability to mass-produce the article ordered, that customers requires (sic) certain specifications is of no moment, the transaction remains one of sale.”<br><br>Petitioner further cites, among other authorities, the following ruling in Celestino Co. v. Collector of Internal Revenue:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><blockquote>x x x <span style="font-weight: bold;">The important thing to remember is that Celestino &amp; Co. habitually makes sash, windows and doors, as it has represented in its stationery and advertisements to the public.</span>&nbsp; That it “manufactures” the same is practically admitted by appellant itself.&nbsp; The fact that windows and doors are made by it only when customers place their orders, does not alter the nature of the establishment of such materials-moulding, frames, panels – as it ordinarily manufactured or was in a position habitually to manufacture.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">That the doors and windows must meet desired specifications is neither here nor there.</span> &nbsp;If these specifications do not happen to be of the kind habitually manufactured by appellant – special forms of sash, mouldings, panels – it would not accept the order – and no sale is made.&nbsp; If they do, the transaction would be no different from purchaser of manufactured goods held in stock for sale; they are bought because they meet specifications desired by the purchaser.<br><br>Nobody will say that when a sawmill cuts lumber in accordance with the peculiar specifications of a customer – sizes not previously held in stock for sale to the public – it thereby becomes an employee or servant of the customer, not the seller of lumber.&nbsp; The same consideration applies to this sash manufacturer.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Oriental Sash Factory does nothing more than sell the goods that it mass-produces or habitually makes </span>– sash, panels, mouldings, frames – <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">cutting them to such sizes and combining them in such forms as its customers may desire.</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>x x x <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Such new form does not divest the Oriental Sash Factory of its character as manufacturer.&nbsp; Neither does it take the transaction out of the category of sales under Article 1467</span> above quoted, because although the Factory does not, in the ordinary course of its business, manufacture and keep on stock doors of the kind sold to Teodoro, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it could and/or probably had in stock</span> the sash, mouldings and panels it used therefor (some of them at least). </span>(Emphasis in the original; underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>Petitioner concludes that as the “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Supply Agreement</span>” between Aragones and MEGA-WAFF was one of sale to which it (petitioner) was not privy, it cannot be held liable for any obligation arising therefrom.<br><br>Dodging liability for the damages (“exemplary and . . . attorney’s fees including the cost of this suit”) awarded to Aragones, petitioner claims that it was in fact the one which was injured by Aragones’ filing in bad faith of a complaint bereft of cause of action and “at best, [one] <span style="text-decoration: underline;">barred by full payment of the amount due to MEGA- WAFF</span>,” on account of which it is entitled to moral damages in the amount of P50,000.00 pursuant to Article 2217 of the Civil Code, and to attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation in the amount of at least P30,000.00 plus P2,500.00 per hearing pursuant to Article 2208 of the Civil Code.<br><br>The petition fails.<br><br>The authorities petitioner cited in fact show that the nature of the “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Supply Agreement</span>” between Aragones and MEGA-WAFF was one for a piece of work.<br><br>Contrary to petitioner’s claim that “save for the shape, there was no consideration of any special needs or requirements of DMPI taken into account in the design or manufacture of the concrete paving blocks,” the “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Supply Agreement</span>” is replete with specifications, terms or conditions showing that it was one for a piece of work.<br><br>As reflected in the highlighted and underscored above-quoted provisions of the “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Supply Agreement</span>,” as well as other evidence on record, the machines Aragones was obliged to fabricate were those for casting the concrete blocks specified by Garcia. Aragones did not have those kind of machines in his usual business, hence, the special order.<br><br>While initially Garcia specified that the machines to be fabricated should be for hexagon shaped blocks, he later asked Aragones to instead fabricate machines for casting S shaped blocks.<br><br>In accordance with the “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Supply Agreement</span>,” Garcia furnished the cement and aggregates for the fabrication of the blocks and Aragones fabricated three (3) machines for S shaped blocks which were delivered at the casting site on different dates.&nbsp; And the “entire plant/casting machines and . . . . accessories” were, as dictated under the “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Supply Agreement</span>,” devoted by Aragones “for [MEGA-WAFF]’s exclusive use.<br><br>There can be no gainsaying that the specifications/conditions in the “Supply Agreement” and the admitted subsequent directive of Garcia for Aragones to fabricate machines for casting S shaped, instead of hexagon shaped blocks, show that the concrete blocks were “manufactured specifically for, and upon the special order” of Garcia.<br><br>That Garcia supplied the cement and aggregates and that the entire made-to-order casting machines and accessories used in the manufacture of those unusual shaped blocks were agreed upon to be devoted only “for the exclusive use” of MEGA-WAFF should belie petitioner’s contention that the concrete blocks were mass-produced and catered to the general market in the ordinary&nbsp; course of Aragones’ business.<br><br>Under Art. 1467 then of the Civil Code which provides:<br><blockquote>ART. 1467.&nbsp; A contract for the delivery at a certain price of an article which the vendor in the ordinary course of his business manufactures or procures for the general market, whether the same is on hand at the time or not, is a contract of sale, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if the goods are to be manufactured <span style="font-weight: bold;">specially</span> for the customer and <span style="font-weight: bold;">upon his special order</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> for the general market, it is a contract for a piece of work.&nbsp;</span> (Emphasis and underscoring supplied),<br><br>the “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Supply Agreement</span>” was decidedly a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contract for a piece of work.</span><br><br>Following Art. 1729 of the Civil Code which provides:<br><blockquote>ART. 1729.&nbsp; Those who put their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">labor</span> upon or furnish materials for a piece of work undertaken by the contractor have an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">action against the owner</span> up to the amount owing from the latter to the contractor <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at the time the claim is made</span>. x x x<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x (Underscoring supplied),<br></div></blockquote></blockquote></div>Aragones having specially fabricated three casting machines and furnished some materials for the production of the concrete blocks specially ordered and specified by MEGA-WAFF which were to be and indeed they were for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exclusive use</span> of MEGA-WAFF, he has a cause of action upon petitioner up to the amount it owed MEGA-WAFF at the time Aragones made his claim to petitioner.<br><br>As <span style="font-style: italic;">Velasco v. CA</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> explains, the intention of Art. 1729 is<br><blockquote>to protect the laborers and materialmen from being taken advantage of by unscrupulous contractors and from possible connivance between owners and contractors.&nbsp; Thus, a constructive vinculum or contractual privity is created by this provision, by way of exception to the principle underlying Article 1311 between the owner, on the one hand, and those who furnish labor and/or materials, on the other.<br></blockquote>In fine, a constructive vinculum or contractual privity was created between petitioner and Aragones.<br><br>Respecting petitioner’s disclaimer of liability for damages and its claim for moral damages, attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation, the trial court’s disposition thereof, to wit:<br><blockquote>. . . since the evidence on record shows that [Aragones] was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">compelled to litigate</span> this matter if only to collect a just and demandable obligation, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">refusal of [DMPI and MEGA-WAFF] to pay their obligation upon demand could not be justified by&nbsp; law</span>, thus both… should be condemned to pay exemplary damages in the amount of P20,000.00 each and attorney’s fees in the amount of P10,000.00 each including… costs of this suit” (underscoring supplied),<br></blockquote>merits this Court’s approval.<br><br>Why should not petitioner be liable for damages.&nbsp; Aragones’ request, based on a provision of law, to petitioner for it to pay directly to him his account receivable from MEGA-WAFF/Garcia out of petitioner’s account payable to MEGA-WAFF was made before petitioner’s obligation to it was due.&nbsp; Yet petitioner settled such obligation to MEGA-WAFF on or about April 6, 1989 when it released to it its check-payment.&nbsp; For petitioner to harp on its undertaking under its “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Agreement</span>” with MEGA-WAFF to pay its full obligation thereunder within 30 days from complete installation of the pavement by MEGA-WAFF unless a court injunction could be produced by Aragones is too shallow, under the facts and circumstances surrounding the case, to merit consideration.<br><br>Petitioner’s referral for comment of Garcia, by letter of April 27, 1989, on Aragones’ April 6, 1989 reiterative letter for the withholding of the release of so much amount to MEGA-WAFF even after it (petitioner) had already released on or about April 6, 1989 its check-full payment to MEGA-WAFF reflects a futile attempt to cover-up the apparent “connivance” between it and contractor MEGA-WAFF to the prejudice of Aragones, leaving him no option but to litigate.<br><br>As for the assailed citation by the appellate court of Act No. 3959 (which requires a person or firm owning any work of any kind executed by contract to put up a bond guaranteeing the payment of the laborers) as additional justification to hold petitioner liable to Aragones, indeed, said Act had been repealed in 1974 by P.D.
