				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A restrictive stipulation on the venue of actions contained in a promissory note applies to the surety agreement supporting it, because the nature of the two contracts and the factual circumstances surrounding their execution are intertwined or interconnected.  The surety agreement is merely an accessory to the principal loan agreement embodied in the promissory note.  Hence, the enforcement of the former depends upon the latter.<br><center><br><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></center><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the April 29, 2003 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 69786.  The challenged Decision disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>"<b>WHEREFORE</b>, based on the foregoing, the instant petition is hereby <b>GRANTED</b>.  The assailed Orders dated June 9, 2000 and January 9, 2002 are hereby <b>ANNULED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.  Civil Case No. 99-94976 is hereby ordered <b>DISMISSED</b> without prejudice to the filing thereof in the venue exclusively stipulated by the parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br></blockquote><center><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></center><br>The facts are related by the CA as follows:<br><blockquote>"On September 3, 1999, the Philippine Bank of Communications (hereinafter '[petitioner']) filed a complaint against [Respondents Elena Lim, Ramon Calderon and Tri-Oro International Trading &amp; Manufacturing Corporation ("Tri-Oro" for brevity)] with the Regional Trial Court of Manila for the collection of a deficiency amounting to P4,014,297.23 exclusive of interest.  [Petitioner] alleged therein that [respondents] obtained a loan from it and executed a continuing surety agreement dated November 16, 1995 in favor of [petitioner] for all loans, credits, etc., that were extended or may be extended in the future to [respondents].  [Petitioner] granted a renewal of said loan upon [respondent's] request, the most recent being on January 21, 1998 as evidenced by Promissory Note Renewal BD-Variable No. 8298021001 in the amount of P3,000,000.00.  It was expressly stipulated therein that the venue for any legal action that may arise out of said promissory note shall be Makati City, "to the exclusion of all other courts" x x x.  [Respondents allegedly] failed to pay said obligation upon maturity.  Thus, [petitioner] foreclosed the real estate mortgage executed by [respondents] valued at P1,081,600.00 leaving a deficiency balance of P4,014,297.23 as of August 31, 1999.<br><br>"[Respondents] moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of improper venue, invoking the stipulation contained in the last paragraph of the promissory note with respect to the restrictive/exclusive venue.  [The trial court] denied said motion asseverating that [petitioner] ha[d] separate causes of action arising from the promissory note and the continuing surety agreement.  Thus, [under] Rule 4, Section 2, of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, x x x venue was properly laid in Manila.  [The trial court] supported [its] order with cases where venue was held to be merely permissive.  A motion for reconsideration of said order was likewise denied."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br></blockquote><center><b><u>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u></b><br></center><br>On appeal, the CA ruled that respondents' alleged debt was based on the Promissory Note, which had provided an exclusionary stipulation on venue "to the exclusion of all other courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The parties' Surety Agreement, though silent as to venue, was an accessory contract that should have been interpreted in consonance with the Promissory Note.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]<br><br></sup><center><b><u>The Issue</u></b><br></center><br>Petitioner raises the following issue for our consideration:<br><blockquote>"Whether or not the Honorable Court of Appeals had decided the issue of venue in a way not in accord with law and applicable decisions of this Honorable Court and had thereby departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, as to call for this Honorable Supreme Court's power of supervision and appellate review."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote><center><b><u>The Court's Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>The Petition is unmeritorious.<br><center><br><b><u>Sole Issue:<br><i>Venue</i></u></b><br></center><br>At the outset, this Court observes that petitioner took liberties with the stipulated facts to suit its allegations in the present Petition.  In its Complaint, petitioner bank averred that respondents had entered into the Surety Agreement (SA) to guarantee existing and future credit facilities, and that they had executed the Promissory Note (PN) to document their loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Now, the bank is claiming that Tri-Oro issued the PN on which the other respondents should be made liable as sureties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>This strategy is obviously intended to disconnect the SA from the PN and to support the claim of petitioner that the stipulation on venue does not apply to the SA.  However, as will be discussed below, the cause of action to recover on the basis of the SA is inseparable from that which is based on the PN.<br><br><i><b><u>Rule on Venue</u></b></i><br><br>Section 2 of Rule 4 of the Rules of Court provides that personal actions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> must be commenced and tried (1) in the place where the plaintiff resides, or (2) where the defendant resides, or (3) in case of non-resident defendants, where they may be found, at the choice of the plaintiff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> This rule on venue does not apply when the law specifically provides otherwise, or when -- before the filing of the action -- the contracting parties agree in writing on the exclusive venue thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  Venue is not jurisdictional and may be waived by the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>A stipulation as to venue does not preclude the filing of the action in other places, unless qualifying or restrictive words are used in the agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, the stipulation on the exclusivity of the venue as stated in the PN is not at issue.  What petitioner claims is that there was no restriction on the venue, because none was stipulated in the SA on which petitioner had allegedly based its suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Accordingly, the action on the SA may be filed in Manila, petitioner's place of residence.<br><br>Petitioner adds that its Complaint filed in the trial court had two causes of action: the first was founded on a breach of the PN; and the second, on a violation of the SA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Consequently, it was allegedly correct to join the causes of action and to file the case in Manila, per Section 5 of Rule 2 of the Rules of Court, which reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><blockquote>"Section 5. <i>Joinder of Causes of Action</i>. -A party may in one pleading assert, in the alternative or otherwise, as many causes of action as he may have against an opposing party, subject to the following conditions:<br><center><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;                            x x x&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;                             x x x<br></center><br>(c) Where the causes of action are between the same parties but pertain to different venue or jurisdictions, the joinder may be allowed in the Regional Trial Court provided one of the causes of action falls within the jurisdiction of the said court and venue lies therein."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote><b><i><u>Surety Agreement</u></i></b><br><br>Suretyship arises upon the solidary binding of a person -- deemed the surety -- with the principal debtor, for the purpose of fulfilling an obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The prestation is not an original and direct obligation for the performance of the surety's own act, but merely accessory or collateral to the obligation contracted by the principal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> Although the surety contract is secondary to the principal obligation, the surety assumes liability as a regular party to the undertaking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>In enforcing a surety contract, the "complementary-contracts-construed-together" doctrine finds application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> According to this principle, an accessory contract must be read in its entirety <i>and</i> together with the principal agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> This principle is used in construing contractual stipulations in order to arrive at their true meaning; certain stipulations cannot be segregated and then made to control.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> This no-segregation principle is based on Article 1374 of the Civil Code, which we quote:<br><blockquote>"Art. 1374. The various stipulations of a contract shall be interpreted together, attributing to the doubtful ones that sense which may result from all of them taken jointly."<br></blockquote>The aforementioned doctrine is applicable to the present case. Incapable of standing by itself, the SA can be enforced only in conjunction with the PN.  The latter documents the debt that is sought to be collected in the action against the sureties.<br><br>The factual milieu of the present case shows that the SA was entered into to facilitate existing and future loan agreements.  Petitioner approved the loan covered by the PN, partly because of the SA that assured the payment of the principal obligation.  The circumstances that related to the issuance of the PN and the SA are so intertwined that neither one could be separated from the other.  It makes no sense to argue that the parties to the SA were not bound by the stipulations in the PN.<br><br>Notably, the PN was a contract of adhesion that petitioner required the principal debtor to execute as a condition of the approval of the loan.  It was made in the form and language prepared by the bank.  By inserting the provision that Makati City would be "the venue for any legal action [that] may arise out of [the] Promissory Note,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> petitioner also restricted the venue of actions against the sureties.  The legal action against the sureties arose not only from the SA, but also from the PN.<br><br><b><i><u>Cause of Action</u></i></b><br><br>Petitioner correctly argues that there are two causes of action contained in its Complaint.  A cause of action is a party's act or omission that violates the rights of the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Only one suit may be commenced for a single cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> If two or more suits are instituted on the basis of the same cause of action, only one case should remain and the others must be dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>As against Tri-Oro International Trading &amp; Manufacturing Corporation, petitioner's cause of action is the alleged failure to pay the debt in violation of the PN; as against Elena Lim and Ramon Calderon, in violation of the SA.<br><br>Because of the variance between the causes of action, petitioner could have filed separate actions against respondents to recover the debt, on condition that it could not recover twice from the same cause.  It could have proceeded against only one or all of them,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> as full payment by any one of them would have extinguished the obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> By the same token, respondents could have been joined as defendants in one suit, because petitioner's alleged right of relief arose from the same transaction or series of transactions that had common questions of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> To avoid a multiplicity of suits, joinder of parties is encouraged by the law.<br><br>The cause of action, however, does not affect the venue of the action.  The vital issue in the present case is whether the action against the sureties is covered by the restriction on venue stipulated in the PN.  As earlier stated, the answer is in the affirmative.  Since the cases pertaining to both causes of action are restricted to Makati City as the proper venue, petitioner cannot rely on Section 5 of Rule 2 of the Rules of Court.<br><br><b><i><u>Liberal Construction</u></i></b><br><br>Petitioner's final plea for liberality in applying the rules on venue must be rejected.  As earlier discussed, the PN was a contract of adhesion.  Ambiguities therein are to be construed against the party that prepared the contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> On the same principle, petitioner can no longer disavow the stipulation on venue, considering that it drafted the Surety Agreement.  Besides, this alleged technicality caused no miscarriage of substantial justice, as petitioner may refile the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> The inconveniences brought about by its failure to observe the rules on venue sprang from its own acts.  Hence, it cannot blame the courts or anyone else for the resulting delay in the adjudication of the merits of its cause.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is <b><i>DENIED</i></b> and the assailed Decision <b><i>AFFIRMED</i></b>.<br><br>Costs against petitioner.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br> <i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona, Carpio Morales,</i> and <i>Garcia, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 15-25.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id., pp. 32-36.
