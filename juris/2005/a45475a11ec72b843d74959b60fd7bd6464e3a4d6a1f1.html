Lucia Realty and Development, Inc. (“Sta. Lucia”) and Guaranteed Homes, Inc. entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> for the purpose of developing a resort complex in Cabituagan, Zambales. &nbsp;&nbsp;The JVA included a parcel of land covered by TCT No. 11391<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> which was allegedly registered in the name of Guaranteed Hotels, Inc.<br><br>On August 28, 2001, the Testate Estate of Eugenio S. Baltao represented by Mariano Alejandro L. Baltao, Eugenio L. Baltao III and Urma Chiongbian, and Guaranteed Hotels, Inc., represented by Urma Chiongbian, in her capacity as a stockholder, filed before the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City a derivative suit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> (“OLONGAPO CASE”) against Sta.

SP No. 74154.<br><br>On February 13, 2003, the Seventh Division of the Court of Appeals, upon motion of respondents, temporarily restrained the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 46 from taking further proceedings on the MANILA CASE&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;until pending issues on the petitioners’, the respondents herein, special and affirmative defenses are resolved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Finding petitioner guilty of violating the rules on forum shopping, the Court of Appeals, in its decision dated April 6, 2004, reversed and set aside the September 23, 2002 Order and February 17, 2004 Partial Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 46 and dismissed Civil Case No. 02-102705.<br><br>The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals’ decision stated:<br><blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE,</span> premises considered, the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">GRANTED</span> and the assailed September 23, 2002 Order and February 17, 2004 Partial Decision are hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">REVERSED, SET ASIDE.&nbsp; FINDING</span> willful and deliberate forum shopping by private respondent, Civil Case No. 02102705, the <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">second</span> derivative suit</span>, in the Regional Trial Court of Manila Branch 46, is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED</span> pursuant to Section 5, Rule 7 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSAL</span> of Civil Case No. 406-0-2001, the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">first</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">derivative suit</span>, in the Regional Trial Court of Olongapo City Branch 74, has become <span style="font-weight: bold;">MOOT</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">ACADEMIC</span>, the same having been <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISMISSED</span> at the instance of herein private respondent’s counsel who filed a Notice of Dismissal for its dismissal.<br><br>Costs against private respondent.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner moved for reconsideration but the same was denied.<br><br>In the instant petition, petitioner maintains that it did not engage in forum shopping since there is no identity of parties or causes of action between the OLONGAPO CASE and MANILA CASE.<br><br>We are not persuaded.<br><br>Forum shopping consists of filing multiple suits involving the same parties for the same cause of action, either simultaneously or successively, for the purpose of obtaining a favorable judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>There is forum shopping where there exist: (a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions; (b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and (c) the identity of the two preceding particulars is such that any judgment rendered in the pending case, regardless of which party is successful would amount to<span style="font-style: italic;"> res judicata</span> in the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The case of Buan v. Lopez<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> laid down the test for determining whether there has been a violation of the rule against forum shopping.&nbsp; Thus, forum shopping exists where the elements of <span style="font-style: italic;">litis pendentia</span> are present or where a final judgment in one case will&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;amount to <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> in the other.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Litis pendentia</span> as a ground for the dismissal of a civil action refers to that situation wherein another action is pending between the same parties for the same cause of action, such that the second action becomes unnecessary and vexatious.&nbsp; For <span style="font-style: italic;">litis pendentia</span> to be invoked, the concurrence of the following requisites is necessary:<br><blockquote>(a) identity of parties or at least such as represent the same interest in both actions;<br><br>(b) identity of rights asserted and reliefs prayed for, the reliefs being founded on the same facts; and<br><br>(c) the identity in the two cases should be such that the judgment that may be rendered in one would, regardless of which party is successful, amount to <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> in the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>The practice of forum shopping is proscribed because it unnecessarily burdens our courts with heavy caseloads, unduly taxes the manpower and financial resources of the judiciary and trifles with and mocks our judicial processes thereby affecting the efficient administration of justice. This condemnable conduct has prompted the issuance of circulars<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> penalizing violators with the dismissal of the case or cases without prejudice to the taking of appropriate action against the counsel or party concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Petitioner, in filing the OLONGAPO and MANILA cases engaged in forum shopping.&nbsp; The elements of <span style="font-style: italic;">litis pendentia</span> are present between the two derivative suits filed by petitioner.<br><br>Petitioner maintains that there is no identity of parties because in the OLONGAPO CASE, the plaintiffs are the Testate Estate of Eugenio S. Baltao, represented by Urma Chiongbian and the petitioner herein, also represented by Urma Chiongbian, while in the MANILA CASE, the plaintiff is Guaranteed Hotels, Inc. alone, represented by Urma Chiongbian.<br><br>In <span style="font-style: italic;">TF Ventures, et al. v. Yoshitsugu Matsuura, et al.,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> we reiterated the well settled rule that <span style="font-style: italic;">lis pendens</span> requires only substantial, and not absolute identity of parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; There is substantial identity of parties where there is a community of interest between a party in the first case and a party in the second case.&nbsp; Undeniably, the OLONGAPO and MANILA cases were purportedly filed to protect the interests of Guaranteed Hotels, Inc.&nbsp; Such constitutes a community of interest that makes the parties identical thereby making it within the purview of the first requisite of <span style="font-style: italic;">litis pendentia</span>.<br><br>We agree with the Court of Appeals in ruling that the rights being asserted and the reliefs prayed for in the two derivative suits are identical.<br><br>In the OLONGAPO CASE, petitioner sought the nullification of the JVA entered into by Guaranteed Homes, Inc. and Sta. Lucia insofar as the inclusion of TCT No. 11391 is concerned.&nbsp; On the other hand, the MANILA CASE sought for the annulment of the corporate acts of herein respondents including the resolution authorizing the execution of the JVA.<br><br>While the reliefs prayed for in the two derivative suits were not similarly worded, it cannot be denied that their objective is to bring about the annulment of the JVA.&nbsp; The OLONGAPO CASE directly attacked the JVA.&nbsp; Petitioner, however, adopted another mode in the MANILA CASE.&nbsp; It indirectly assailed the JVA by putting in issue the authority of the respondents to execute the same in the hope that, once established that the same is<span style="font-style: italic;"> ultra vires</span>, the nullification of the JVA would follow as a matter of course.&nbsp; Plainly, the identity of the two derivative suits is such that the judgment that may be rendered in one would amount to <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span> in the other.<br><br>We cannot allow the possibility of two regional trial courts ruling differently on the reliefs prayed for by the petitioner.&nbsp; Consider this:&nbsp; If the trial court in the OLONGAPO CASE uphold the validity of the JVA while the trial court in the MANILA CASE rules on the contrary, these two incompatible decisions will wreak havoc on our judicial system.<br><br>The grave evil sought to be avoided by the rule against forum shopping is the rendition by two competent tribunals of two separate, and contradictory decisions. Unscrupulous party litigants, taking advantage of a variety of competent tribunals, may repeatedly try their luck in several different fora until a favorable result is reached. To avoid the resultant confusion, we adhere strictly to the rules against forum shopping, and any violation of these rules results in the dismissal of a case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, premises considered, the instant petition for review on certiorari is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span> and the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated April 6, 2004 and its Resolution dated June 30, 2004 in CA-G.R.
