Navarro, finding respondent to have violated his oath as a member of the Bar to do no falsehood and misrepresentations, recommended his suspension from the practice of law for three (3) months, subject to the approval of the members of the Board of Governors.  Pertinent portions of the Report and Recommendation read:<br><blockquote>. . .

Rule 1.01 of the Code specifically enjoins him not to engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct. "Conduct," as used in this rule, is not limited to conduct exhibited in connection with the performance of professional duties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, as reflected above, complainant presented certifications from the DENR that the property is part of the public domain and not disposable as it is within the Bataan National Park. Indeed, by virtue of Proclamation No. 24<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> issued on December 1, 1945, all properties of the public domain therein designated as part of the Bataan National Park were withdrawn from sale, settlement or other disposition, subject to private rights.<br><br>On the other hand, respondent has utterly failed to substantiate his documented claim of having irrevocable rights and interests over the property which he could have conveyed to complainant.  <span style="font-style: italic;">E.g.</span>, he could have presented any document issued by the government conferring upon him and his alleged co-owners, or even upon his alleged predecessors-in-interest, with any such right or interest, but he presented none.  He merely presented a Deed of Absolute Sale purportedly executed by a certain Jose R. Monzon in his, Banzon's and Zabala's favor on July 25, 1995, a month shy of the execution on August 21, 1995 of the Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of complainant.<br><br>The tax declaration and receipt which respondent presented do not help his cause any as neither tax receipts nor realty tax declarations are sufficient evidence of the right of possession over realty unless supported by other effective proof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Them presentation of a tax declaration must indeed have been a "pretext," as observed by the PENR in its<br>earlier-quoted portion of its letter-directive to the Balanga Municipal Assessor "that the area occupied . . .

The transaction that complainant entered into with respondent did not require respondent to perform professional legal services for complainant nor did that transaction relate to the rendition of professional services by respondent to any other person.<br><br>As early as 1923, however, the Court laid down in <span style="font-style: italic;">In Re Vicente Pelaez</span> the principle that it can exercise its power to discipline lawyers for causes which do not involve the relationship of an attorney and client. x x x<br><br>"x x x [A]s a general rule, a court will not assume jurisdiction to discipline one of its officers for misconduct alleged to have been committed in his private capacity. <span style="font-style: italic;">But this is a general rule with many exceptions</span>.  The courts sometimes stress the point that <span style="font-style: italic;">the attorney has shown, through misconduct outside of his professional dealings, a want of such professional honesty as render him unworthy of public confidence, and an unfit and unsafe person to manage the legal business of others</span>.  The reason why such a distinction can be drawn is because it is the court which admits an attorney to the bar, and the court requires for such admission the possession of a good moral character.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x"<br></div><br>The rationale of the rule that misconduct, indicative of moral unfitness, whether relating to professional or non-professional matters, justifies suspension or disbarment, was expressed by Mr. ChiefmJustice Prentice in In Re Disbarment of Peck, with eloquence and restraint:<br><br>"As important as it is that an attorney be competent to deal with the oftentimes intricate matters which may be intrusted to him, <span style="font-style: italic;">it is infinitely more so that he be upright and trustworthy</span>.  Unfortunately, it is not easy to limit membership in the profession to those who satisfy the standard of test of fitness. But scant progress in that direction can be hoped for if, in the determination of the qualification of professional fitness, non-professional dishonor and dishonesty in whatsoever path of life is to be ignored.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Professional honesty and honor are not to be expected as the accompaniment of dishonesty and dishonor in other relations. x x x misconduct, indicative of moral unfitness for the profession, whether it be professional or non-professional, justifies dismission as well as exclusion from the bar.</span>"<br><br>The rule in this jurisdiction was stated by Mr. Justice Malcolm in <span style="font-style: italic;">Piatt v. Abordo</span> x x x:<br><br>"The courts are not curators of the morals of the bar.  At the same time the profession is not compelled to harbor all persons whatever their character, who are fortunate enough to keep out of prison. As good character is an essential qualification for admission of an attorney to practice, when the attorney's character is bad in such respects as to show that he is unsafe and unfit to be entrusted with the powers of an attorney, the courts retain the power to discipline him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup> (Italics in the original)<br></blockquote>This <span style="font-style: italic;">Lizaso</span> ruling was reiterated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Co v.

Had he exhibited a modicum of prudence before entering into the transaction with respondent, he would have spared himself from respondent's sham.<br><br>It is jurisprudentially established though that in a disbarment proceeding, it is immaterial that the complainant is not blameless or is <span style="font-style: italic;">in pari delicto</span> as this is not a proceeding to grant relief to the complainant, but one to purge the law profession of unworthy members to protect the public and the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup><br><br>The record does not disclose the status of the estafa case against respondent.  His conviction or acquittal is not, however, essential insofar as the present administrative case against him is concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup><br><blockquote>Administrative cases against lawyers belong to a class of their own.  They are distinct from and they may proceed independently of x x x criminal cases.<br><br>The burden of proof for these types of cases differ.  In a criminal case, proof beyond reasonable doubt is necessary; in an administrative case for disbarment or suspension, "clearly preponderant evidence" is all that is required.  Thus, a criminal prosecution will not constitute a prejudicial question even if the same facts and circumstances are attendant in the administrative proceedings.<br><br>It should be emphasized that a finding of guilt in the criminal case will not necessarily result in <span style="font-weight: bold;">a finding of liability in the administrative case.  Conversely, respondent's acquittal does not necessarily exculpate him administratively.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>It is not thus sound judicial policy to await the final resolution of a criminal case before a complaint against a lawyer may be acted upon; otherwise, this Court will be rendered helpless from vigorously applying the rules on admission to and continuing membership in the legal profession during the whole period that the criminal case is pending final disposition when the objectives of the two proceedings are vastly disparate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>While the facts and circumstances of the case do not warrant the imposition of so severe a penalty as disbarment, the inherent power of this Court to discipline an errant member of the Bar must, nonetheless, be exercised as it cannot be denied that respondent violated his solemn oath as a lawyer not to engage in unlawful, dishonest or deceitful conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>The penalty of suspension for three (3) months recommended by the IBP is not, however, commensurate tom the gravity of the wrong committed by respondent.
