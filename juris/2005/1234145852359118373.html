Its factual allegations read:<br><blockquote> . . . On March 15, 1993 at PNB Buendia Branch, Mr. Norman Y. Pike, together with a certain Joy Davasol went to see PNB AVP Mr. Lorenzo T. Val (sic), Jr. purposely to withdraw the amount of $2,000.00. Mr. Pike also informed AVP Val that he is leaving for abroad (Japan) and made verbal instruction to honor all withdrawals to be transmitted by his Talent Manager and Choreographer, Joy Davasol who shall present pre-signed withdrawal slips bearing his (Pike's) signature. . .<br><br>On April 19, 1993, a certain Josephine Balmaceda, who claimed to be plaintiff's sister executed an affidavit . . . . stating therein that they discovered today (April 19, 1993) the lost (sic) of her brother's passbook issued by PNB on account of robbery, committed in the residence/office of her brother, promptly reporting the matter to the police authorities and her brother cannot report the matter to the Bank because he was currently in Japan and therefore requesting the Bank to issue a hold-order on her brother's passbook.<br><br>But a copy of an alarm (Police) Report dated April 19, 1993. . . stated that plaintiff (who was the one who reported the matter) after one month in Japan, he (complainant) arrived yesterday. . .<br><br>On April 26, 1993, Atty. Nathaniel Ifurung who claims to be plaintiff's counsel sent a demand letter to VP Violeta T. Suquila (then VP and Manager of PNB Buendia Branch) demanding the bank to credit back the amount of US$7,500.00 which were withdrawn on March 31, 1993 and April 5, 1993, because his client's signatures were forged and the withdrawal made thereon were unauthorized. . .<br><br>On May 5, 1993, Mr. Norman Y. Pike executed an affidavit of loss (sic) Dollar Account Passbook ... and requested the PNB to replace the same and allow him to make withdrawals thereon. He stated that his passbook was stolen together with other valuables which he discovered only in the early morning of April 19, 1993. . .<br><br>On May 6, 1993, plaintiff Norman Y. Pike wrote a letter. . . addressed to the Manager of PNB, Buendia Branch the full contents of said letter hereto quoted as follows:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: right;"> May 6, 1993<br></div><br>The Manager<br>Philippine National Bank<br>Buendia Branch<br>Paseo de Roxas cor. Gil Puyat Street<br>Makati, Metro Manila<br><br>Sir:<br><br>In connection with the request of my sister, Mrs. Josephine P. Balmaceda for the hold-order on my dollar savings passbook No. 265-704591-0, I am now requesting your good office to lift the same so I can withdraw the remaining balance of my passbook which was reported lost sometime in March of this year.<br><br>I also promise not to hold responsible the bank and its officers for the withdrawal made on my dollar savings passbook on March 19 and April 5, 1993 respectively as a result of the lost (sic) of my passbook.<br><br><div style="text-align: right;">Sgd.

Pike was allowed by defendant bank to withdraw the remaining balance from his passbook ... .<br><br>A letter dated May 18, 1993 was sent to Plaintiff's counsel ... by PNB ... stating that the Bank regrets that it cannot accede to such request inasmuch as the Bank exercised due diligence of a good father to his family in the handling of transactions covering the deposit account of Mr. Pike ... .<br><br>On July 2, 1993, Plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to PNB Vice Pres. Suquila denying that his client made any such promise not to hold responsible the bank and its officers for the withdrawal made ... .<br><br>A letter dated July 29, 1993 ... was sent to Plaintiff's counsel by VP Suquila stating that plaintiff's withdrawal of the remaining balance of his account with the Bank effectively estops him from claiming on the alleged unauthorized withdrawals.<br></blockquote>The trial court, in its decision dated 10 January 1997, made the following findings of fact:<br><blockquote> . . . [T]hat the bank is responsible for such unauthorized withdrawals. The court is not impressed with the defense put up by the bank. Its contention that the withdrawals were authorized by the plaintiff because there was an arrangement between the bank represented by its Asst. Vice President Lorenzo Bal, Jr. and the depositor Norman Y. Pike to the effect that pre-signed withdrawal slips, that is, withdrawal slip signed by the depositor in the presence of Mr. Bal whereby it would be made to appear that it was the depositor himself who presented the same to the bank despite the fact that it was another person who presented the same should be honored by the bank cannot be sanctioned by the court. Firstly, the court is not satisfied that there was indeed such an arrangement. . . It is Mr. Bal's contention that such an arrangement although not ordinarily entered into is still a legal procedure of the bank and is resorted to accommodate the depositors' specially honored and valued depositor at that<i>.</i><br><br>. . .<br><br>The court compared the signatures in the questioned withdrawal slips with the known signatures of the depositor and is convinced that the signatures in the unauthorized withdrawal slips do not correspond to the true signatures of the depositor.<br><br>From the evidence that it received, the court is convinced that the bank was negligent in the performance of its duties such that unauthorized withdrawals were made in the deposit of plaintiff Norman Y. Pike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote>The dispositive portion of the trial court's decision reads:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE and considering the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant and ordering the defendant to pay the following: <ol> <li>US$7,500.00 plus interest thereon at the rate of 12% per annum until the full amount is paid;<br></li><li>P25,000.00 for and as attorney's fees;<br></li><li>P50,000.00 as moral damages and P50,000.00 as exemplary damages; and<br></li><li>Plus the costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></li></ol></blockquote>Defendant PNB's motion for reconsideration was subsequently denied by the court <i>a quo.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On appeal, the Court of Appeals issued the assailed decision dated 19 December 2002, affirming the findings of the RTC that indeed defendant-appellant PNB was negligent in exercising the diligence required of a business imbued with public interest such as that of the banking industry, however, it modified the rate of interest and award for damages, to wit:<br><blockquote> WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision dated January 10, 1997 issued by the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 7, in Civil Case No. 94-68821, is hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION, as follows: <ol> <li>Ordering appellant, the Philippine National Bank, Buendia Branch, to refund appellee the amount of $7,500.00 plus interest of 6% per annum to be computed from the date of the filing of the complaint which interest rate shall become 12% per annum from the time the judgment in this case becomes final and executory until its satisfaction;<br><br></li><li>The award for moral damages is reduced to P20,000.00; and<br><br></li><li>The award for exemplary damages is likewise reduced to P20,000.00. </li></ol> Costs against appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>The appellate court held that:<br><blockquote> Appellant claims that appellee personally talked to its officers to allow Joy Manuel Davasol to make withdrawals. Appellee even left pre-signed withdrawal slips before he went to Japan. However, appellant could have told appellee to authorize the withdrawal by a representative by indicating the same at the space provided at the back portion of the withdrawal slip. This operational flaw was observed by the trial court, when it ruled:<br><blockquote> The court cannot also understand why the bank did not require the correct, proper and the usual procedure of requiring a depositor who is withdrawing the money through a representative to fill up the back portion of the withdrawal slips, which form was issued by the bank itself.<br></blockquote>A perusal of the records discloses that appellee had previously authorized withdrawals by a representative. However, these withdrawals were properly accompanied by a "withdrawal by a representative" form aside from a handwritten request by appellee to allow such withdrawals by his representative, or a typewritten letter-request for withdrawal by a representative. Certainly, appellant lacked the due care and caution required of managers and employees of a firm engaged in so sensitive and demanding business as banking. ...<br><br>In its desire to be exonerated from liability, appellant advances the argument that, granting negligence on its part, appellee condoned this negligence as shown in his letter dated May 6, 1993, wherein appellee purportedly undertook, not to hold the bank and its officers responsible for the unauthorized withdrawals from his account.<br><br>We do not agree. It should be emphasized that while the appellee admitted signing the letter dated May 6, 1993, he, however, denied having undertook (sic) to exonerate the appellant from liability for the unauthorized withdrawals. Appellee questioned the second paragraph of the said letter as being superimposed so that his signature overlapped the text of the second paragraph of said letter. A waiver of right, in order to be valid, should be in a language that clearly manifests his desire to do so. ... In the instant case, appellee's filing of the instant action is inconsistent with appellant's contention that he had waived his right to question appellant's negligent act of allowing the unauthorized withdrawals from his account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>Defendant-appellant PNB filed a motion for reconsideration. In a Resolution dated 02 April 2003, the Court of Appeals denied said motion.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br>Petitioner PNB now seeks the review of the aforequoted decision and resolution of the Court of Appeals predicated on the following issues:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;"> I.<br></div><br>WHETHER OR NOT THE PRINCIPLE OF ESTOPPEL WAS NOT PROPERLY APPLIED IN THIS CASE;<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II.<br></div><br>WHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY PROVEN THAT THE SIGNATURES APPEARING ON THE TWO (2) QUESTIONED PRE-SIGNED WITHDRAWAL SLIP FORMS ARE ALL FORGERIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 22, RULE 132 OF THE REVISED RULES OF COURT; and<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III.<br></div><br>WHETHER OR NOT MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES CAN BE AWARDED AGAINST A PARTY IN GOOD FAITH.<br></blockquote>Petitioner PNB contends that due to the verbal instructions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of respondent Pike, a valued depositor, it allowed the withdrawal by another person. Plus, the fact that said respondent withdrew the remaining balance in his US Savings Account and executed a waiver releasing petitioner PNB from any liability due to the loss of the funds should rightly negate a finding of negligence on its part. Accordingly, petitioner PNB claims that the appellate court, as well as the trial court erred in holding that the withdrawals in question were unauthorized as the signatures appearing on the subject withdrawal slips were forgeries. Petitioner PNB, therefore, argues that it should not be held liable for the amount withdrawn from the account of respondent Pike in the sum of $7,500.00, as well as for moral and exemplary damages.<br><br><i>A priori</i>, it is quite evident that the petition is anchored on a plea to review or re-examine the factual conclusions reached by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, and for this Court to hold otherwise.&nbsp; Whether:<br><blockquote> 1) respondent Pike's signatures appearing on the pertinent withdrawal slips used by Joy Manuel Davasol<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> to withdraw the amount of $7,500.00, were forgeries, as found by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, or were authentic as claimed by petitioner bank; and<br><br>2) respondent Pike in fact executed a waiver absolving petitioner bank from any legal responsibility due to the unauthorized withdrawals, as maintained by petitioner bank, or the paragraph containing said waiver was intercalated by some other person, thus, amounting no waiver at all, as held by the courts <i>a quo</i>.<br></blockquote>are questions of fact and not of law.&nbsp; Inexorably, these issues call for an inquiry into the facts and evidence on record.&nbsp; This, as we have so often held, we cannot do.<br><br>Elementary is the rule that this Court is not the appropriate venue to consider anew the factual issues as it is not a trier of facts, and, it generally does not weigh anew the evidence already passed upon by the Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp; When this Court is tasked to go over once more the evidence presented by both parties, and analyze, assess and weigh them to ascertain if the trial court and the appellate court were correct in according superior credit to this or that piece of evidence of one party or the other, the Court cannot and will not do the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Such task is foreclosed by the rule enunciated under Section 1 of Rule 45<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of the Rules of Court:<br><blockquote> SECTION 1. <i>Filing of petition with Supreme </i>Court. - . . . The petition shall raise only questions of law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> which must be distinctly set forth.<br></blockquote>We have oft "ruled that factual findings of the Court of Appeals are conclusive on the parties and not reviewable by this Court - and they carry even more weight when the Court of Appeals affirms the factual findings of the trial court,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and in the absence of any showing that the findings complained of are totally devoid of support in the evidence on record, or that they are so glaringly erroneous as to constitute serious abuse of discretion, such findings must stand. The courts <i>a quo</i> are in a much better position to evaluate properly the evidence.<br><br>Finding no other alternative but to affirm their finding that petitioner PNB negligently allowed the unauthorized withdrawals subject of the case at bar, the instant petition for review must necessarily fail.<br><br>At this juncture, it bears emphasizing that negligence of banking institutions should never be countenanced. The negligence here lies in the lackadaisical attitude exhibited by employees of petitioner PNB in their treatment of respondent Pike's US Dollar Savings Account that resulted in the unauthorized withdrawal of $7,500.00. Nevertheless, though its employees may be the ones negligent, a bank's liability as an obligor is not merely vicarious but primary, as banks are expected to exercise the highest degree of diligence in the selection and supervision of their employees,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and having such obligation, this Court cannot ignore the circumstances surrounding the case at bar - how the employees of petitioner PNB turned their heads, nay, closed their eyes to the suspicious circumstances enfolding the two withdrawals subject of the case at bar. It may even be said that they went out of their ways to disregard standard operating procedures formulated to ensure the security of each and every account that they are handling. Petitioner PNB does not deny that the withdrawal slips used were in breach of standard operating procedures of banks in the ordinary and usual course of banking operations as testified to by one of its witnesses, Mr. Lorenzo T. Bal, Assistant Vice President of Petitioner PNB's Buendia branch, on cross-examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> he stated thus:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q:</td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"><i><u>Mr. Witness, when the original of Exhibit "B"</u></i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><i><u> was presented to you for approval, how many signatures of depositor appears thereon?</u></i></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: <i></i></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="justify"><i>Two (2) signatures appears (sic) on the face of the withdrawal slip.</i> </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">When it (sic) was (sic) presented to you immediately?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">Are you sure of that?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, sir.

Ordinarily, banks allow withdrawal by someone who is not the account holder so long as the account holder authorizes his representative to withdraw and receive from his account by signing on the space provided particularly for such transactions, usually found at the back of withdrawal slips. As fittingly found by the courts <i>a quo</i>, if indeed, respondent Pike signed the withdrawal slips in the presence of Mr. Lorenzo Bal, petitioner PNB's AVP at its Buendia branch, why did he not call respondent Pike's attention and refer him to the space provided for authorizing representatives to withdraw from and receive the proceeds of such withdrawal?

From the aforequoted, it appears that the witness, Lorenzo Bal, was not even reasonably familiar with respondent Pike, yet, he was ready, willing and able to accommodate the <i>verbal </i>request of said depositor. Worse still, the witness still approved the withdrawal transaction without asking for any proof of identification for the reason that: 1) Davasol was in possession of a pre-signed withdrawal slip; and 2) the witness "recognized" the signature of respondent Pike - even after admitting that he did not bother to counter check the signature on the slip with the specimen signature card of respondent Pike and that he&nbsp; met respondent Pike just once so that he cannot seem to recall what the latter looks like.&nbsp; The ensuing quoted testimony of the same witness will justify a finding of negligence amounting to bad faith, to wit:<br><blockquote> <table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q: </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">And you also met Joy Manuel Dabasol on March 15?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q:</td> <td> <div align="justify">And can you describe Joy Manuel Dabasol?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A:</td> <td> <div align="justify">I cannot recall his face but then he is a Talent manager, because there are so many depositors in the bank.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">. . .</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: </td> <td><div align="justify">Mr. witness, you are saying that Mr. Pike, the depositor gave you verbal authority to honor withdrawal by Joy Manuel Dabasol?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: </td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: <i></i></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="justify"><i>Why did you not require then that Mr. Pike instead sign the authorization portion and that the name of Joy Manuel Dabasol appear thereon with his signature?</i></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">. . .</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: <i></i></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="justify"><i>I required Mr. Norman Pike to sign the withdrawal slip on the face of the withdrawal slip.</i></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: <i></i></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="justify"><i>But not the authorization portion of the said withdrawal slip?</i></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify">. . .</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A: <i></i></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="justify"><i>No, because that is sufficient already.</i></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div><br></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q: <i></i></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;"><div align="justify"><i>And is this your normal procedure, Mr. witness?

Bal, an Assistant Vice President at that, was exceedingly careless in his treatment of respondent Pike's savings account.<br><br>From the foregoing, the evidence clearly showed that the petitioner bank did not exercise the degree of diligence that it ought to have exercised in dealing with their clients.<br><br>With banks, the degree of diligence required, contrary to the position of petitioner PNB, is <i>more than</i> that of a good father of a family considering that the business of banking is imbued with public interest due to the nature of their functions. The stability of banks largely depends on the confidence of the people in the honesty and efficiency of banks.&nbsp; Thus, the law imposes on banks a high degree of obligation to treat the accounts of its depositors with meticulous care, always having in mind the fiduciary nature of banking. Section 2 of Republic Act No. 8791,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> which took effect on 13 June 2000, makes a categorical declaration that the State recognizes the "fiduciary nature of banking that requires high standards of integrity and performance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Though passed long after the unauthorized withdrawals in this case, the aforequoted provision is a statutory affirmation of Supreme Court decisions already <i>in esse</i> at the time of such withdrawals.&nbsp; We elucidated in the 1990 case of <i>Simex International, Inc. v.

The fiduciary nature of banking requires banks to assume a degree of diligence higher than that of a good father of a family. Article 1172 of the New Civil Code states that the degree of diligence required of an obligor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> is that prescribed by law or contract, and absent such stipulation then the diligence of a family.
