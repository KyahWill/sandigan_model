				<BR><BR><div align="justify">A tax refund may be claimed even <i>beyond</i> the taxable year following that in which the tax credit arises.&nbsp; Hence, excess income taxes paid in 1995 that have not been applied to or used in 1996 may still be the subject of a tax refund in 1997, provided that the claim for such refund is filed with the internal revenue commissioner within two years after payment of said&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taxes.&nbsp; As a caveat, the Court stresses that the recognition of the entitlement to a tax refund does not necessarily mean the automatic payment of the sum claimed in the final adjustment return of the taxpayer.&nbsp; The amount of the claim must still be proven in the normal course.<br><br><center><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></center><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the January 10, 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR SP No. 58838.&nbsp; The assailed Decision disposed as follows:<blockquote><b>“IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the instant petition is <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">DISMISSED</span> and the assailed Decision and Resolution are <span style="font-style: italic;

Petitioner further alleged that due to its income/loss positions for the three quarters of 1996, it was unable to use the excess tax paid for and in its behalf by the withholding agents.<br><br>“Thus, an administrative claim was filed by the [p]etitioner on April 10, 1997 for the refund of P3,159,687.00 representing excess or unused creditable withholding taxes for the year 1995.&nbsp; The instant petition was subsequently filed on April 18, 1997.<br><br>“Respondent, in his Answer, averred, among others, that:<blockquote>‘1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Petitioner has no cause of action;<br><br>‘2)&nbsp; Petitioner failed to comply with the procedural requirements set out in Section 5 of Revenue Regulations No. [(RR)] 12-94;<br><br>‘3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is incumbent upon [p]etitioner to prove by competent and sufficient evidence that the tax refund or tax credit being sought is allowed under the National Internal Revenue Code and its implementing rules and regulations; and<br><br>‘4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Claims for tax refund or tax credit are construed strictly against the taxpayer as they partake the nature of tax exemption.</blockquote>“To buttress its claim, [p]etitioner presented documentary and testimonial evidence.&nbsp; Respondent, on the other hand, presented the [r]evenue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [o]fficer who conducted the examination of [p]etitioner’s claim and found petitioner liable for deficiency value added tax.&nbsp; Petitioner also presented rebuttal evidence.<br><br>“The sole issue submitted for [o]ur determination is whether or not [p]etitioner is entitled to the refund of P3,159,687.00 representing excess or overpaid income tax for the taxable year 1995.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><center><b><u>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</u></b><br></center><br>In denying petitioner’s refund, the CA reasoned out that no evidence other than that presented before the CTA was adduced to prove that excess tax payments had been made in 1995.&nbsp; From the inception of the case to the formal offer of its evidence, petitioner did not present its 1996 income tax return to disclose its total income tax liability, thus making it difficult to determine whether such excess tax payments were utilized in 1996.<br><br>Hence, this Petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]<br><br></sup><center><b><u>The Issue</u></b><br></center><br>Petitioner raises this sole issue for our consideration:<blockquote>“Whether the Court of Appeals gravely erred when, while purportedly requiring petitioner to submit its 1996 annual income tax return to support its&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; claim for refund, nonetheless ignored the existence of the tax return extant on the record the authenticity of which has not been denied or its admissibility opposed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br></blockquote><center><b><u>The Court’s Ruling</u></b><br></center><br>The Petition is partly meritorious.<br><br><center><b>Sole Issue:<br><i>Entitlement to Tax Refund</i></b><br></center><br>Section 69 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> provides:<blockquote>“Sec. 69.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Final adjustment return. -- Every corporation liable to tax under Section 24 shall file a final adjustment return covering the total taxable income for the preceding calendar or fiscal year. If the sum of the quarterly tax payments made during the said taxable year is not equal to the total tax due on the entire taxable net income of that year the corporation shall either:<blockquote>‘(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay the excess tax still due; or<br><br>‘(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be refunded the excess amount paid, as the case may be.</blockquote>“In case the corporation is entitled to a refund of the excess estimated quarterly income taxes paid, the refundable amount shown on its final adjustment return may be credited against the estimated quarterly income tax liabilities for the taxable quarters of the succeeding taxable year.”</blockquote><b><i><u>Tax Refund<br>Allowed by NIRC</u></i></b><br><br>A perusal of this provision shows that a <i>taxable corporation</i> is entitled to a <i>tax refund</i> when the sum of the quarterly <i>income taxes</i> it paid during a taxable year exceeds its total <i>income tax</i> due also for that year.&nbsp; Consequently, the refundable amount that is shown on its <i>final adjustment return</i> may be credited, at its option, against its quarterly <i>income tax liabilities</i> for the next taxable year.<br><br>Petitioner is a corporation liable to pay <i>income taxes</i> under Section 24 of the NIRC.&nbsp; Hence, it is a <i>taxable corporation</i>.&nbsp; In 1995, it reported that it had excess <i>income taxes</i> that had been paid for and on its behalf by its <i>withholding agents</i>; and that, applying the above-quoted Section 69, this excess should be credited against its <i>income tax liabilities</i> for 1996.&nbsp; However, it claimed in 1997 that it should get a refund, because it was still unable to use the excess income taxes paid in 1995 against its <i>tax liabilities</i> in 1996.&nbsp; Is this possible?&nbsp; Stating the argument otherwise, may excess <i>income taxes</i> paid in 1995 that could not be applied to taxes due in 1996 be refunded in 1997?<br><br>The answer is in the affirmative.&nbsp; Here are the reasons:<br><br><b><i><u>Claim of Tax Refund Beyond the<br>Succeeding Taxable Year</u></i></b><br><br><i>First, a tax refund</i> may be claimed even beyond the <i>taxable year</i> following that in which the tax credit arises.<br><br>No provision in our tax law limits the entitlement to such a refund, other than the requirement that the filing of the administrative claim&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it be made by the taxpayer within a two-year prescriptive period.&nbsp; Section 204(3) of the NIRC states that no refund of taxes “shall be allowed unless the taxpayer files in writing with the Commissioner [the] claim for x x x refund within two years after the payment of the tax.”<br><br>Applying the aforequoted legal provisions, if the excess <i>income taxes paid</i> in a given taxable year have not been entirely used by a <i>taxable corporation</i> against its quarterly income tax liabilities for the <i>next taxable year</i>, the unused amount of the excess may still be refunded, provided that the claim for such a refund is made within two years after payment of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the tax.&nbsp; Petitioner filed its claim in 1997 -- well within the two-year prescriptive period.&nbsp; Thus, its unused tax credits in 1995 may still be refunded.<br><br>Even the phrase “succeeding <i>taxable year</i>” in the second paragraph of the said Section 69 is a limitation that applies only to a <i>tax credit</i>, not a <i>tax refund</i>.&nbsp; Petitioner herein does not claim a <i>tax credit</i>, but a <i>tax refund.</i>&nbsp; Therefore, the statutory limitation does not apply.<br><br><b><i><u>Income Payments Merely<br>Declared Part of Gross Income</u></i></b><br><br><i>Second</i>, to be able to claim a <i>tax refund</i>, a taxpayer only needs to <i>declare</i> the income payments it received as part of its <i>gross income</i> and to <i>establish</i> the fact of withholding.<br><br>Section 5 of RR 12-94<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> states:<blockquote><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Claims for Tax Credit or Refund of income tax deducted and withheld on income payments shall be given due course only when it is shown on the return that the income payment received has been declared as part of the gross income and the fact of withholding is established by a copy of the Withholding Tax Statement duly issued by the payor to the payee showing the amount paid and the amount of tax withheld therefrom.<br><br>“(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excess Credits. -- A taxpayer's excess expanded withholding tax credits for the taxable quarter/taxable year shall automatically be allowed as a credit for purposes of filing his income tax return for the taxable quarter/taxable year immediately succeeding the taxable quarter/taxable year in which the aforesaid excess credit arose, provided, however, he submits with his income tax return a copy of his income tax return for the aforesaid previous taxable period showing the amount of his aforementioned excess withholding tax credits.<br><br>“If the taxpayer, in lieu of the aforesaid automatic application of his excess credit, wants a cash refund or a tax credit certificate for use in payment of his other national internal tax liabilities, he shall make a written request therefor. Upon filing of his request, the taxpayer's income tax return showing the excess expanded withholding tax credits shall be examined. The excess expanded withholding tax, if any, shall be determined and refunded/credited to the taxpayer-applicant. The refund/credit shall be made within a period of sixty (60) days from date of the taxpayer's request provided, however, that the taxpayer-applicant submitted for audit all his pertinent accounting records and that the aforesaid records established the veracity of his claim for a refund/credit of his excess expanded withholding tax credits.”</blockquote>That petitioner filed its amended 1995 <i>income tax return</i> in 1996 is uncontested.&nbsp; In addition, the resulting investigation by the BIR on August 15, 1997, reveals that the income accounts were “correctly declared based on the existing supporting documents.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; Therefore, there is no need for petitioner to show again the income payments it received in 1995 as part of its <i>gross income</i> in 1996.<br><br>That petitioner filed its 1996 final adjustment return in 1997 is the crux of the controversy.&nbsp; However, as will be demonstrated shortly, the lack of such a return will not defeat its entitlement to a refund.<br><br><b><i><u>Tax Refund Provisions:<br>Question of Law</u></i></b><br><br><i>Third</i>, it is a cardinal rule that “only legal issues may be raised”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> in petitions for review under Rule 45.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The proper interpretation of the provisions on <i>tax refund</i> is a <i>question of law</i> that “does not call for an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the parties-litigants.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Having been unable to use the excess income taxes paid in 1995 against its other <i>tax liabilities</i> in 1996, petitioner clearly deserves a refund.&nbsp; It cannot by any sweeping denial be deprived of what rightfully belongs to it.<br><br>The truth or falsity of the contents of or entries in the 1996 <i>final adjustment return</i>, which has not been formally offered in evidence and examined by respondent, involves, however, a <i>question of fact</i>.&nbsp; This Court is not a trier of facts.&nbsp; Neither is it a collection agency for the government.&nbsp; Although we rule that petitioner is entitled to a <i>tax refund</i>, the amount of that refund is a matter for the CTA to determine judiciously based on the records that include its own copy of petitioner’s 1996 final adjustment return.<br><br><b><i><u>Liberal Constructionof Rules</u></i></b><br><br><i>Fourth</i>, ordinary rules of procedure frown upon the submission of <i>final adjustment returns</i> after trial has been conducted.&nbsp; However, both the CTA law and jurisprudence mandate that the proceedings before the tax court “shall not be governed strictly by technical rules of evidence.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> As a rule, its findings of fact<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> (as well as that of the CA) are final, binding and conclusive<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> on the parties and upon this Court; however, as an exception, such findings may be reviewed or disturbed on appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> when they are not supported by evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Our Rules of Court apply “by analogy or in a suppletory<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> character and whenever practicable and convenient”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> and “shall be liberally construed in order to promote their objective of securing a just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> After all, “[t]he paramount consideration remains the ascertainment of truth.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the 1996 <i>final adjustment return</i> was attached as Annex A to the Reply to Comment filed by petitioner with the CA.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>&nbsp; The return shows a negative amount for its <i>taxable income</i> that year.&nbsp; Therefore, it could not have applied or used the excess tax credits of 1995 against its <i>tax liabilities</i> in 1996.<br><br><b><i><u>Judicial Notice<br>of Attached Return</u></i></b><br><br><i>Fifth</i>, the CA and CTA could have taken judicial notice of the 1996 <i>final adjustment return</i> which had been attached in CTA Case No. 5799.&nbsp; “Judicial notice takes the place of proof and is of equal force.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>As a general rule, courts are not authorized to take judicial notice of the contents of records in other cases tried or pending in the same court, even when those cases were heard or are actually pending before the same judge.&nbsp; However, this rule admits of exceptions, as when reference to such records is sufficiently made without objection from the opposing parties:<blockquote>‘“. . .

CA</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> (on which it rests its entire arguments) is not on all fours with the facts of this case.<br><br>While the petitioner in that case also filed a written claim for a <i>tax refund</i>, and likewise failed to present its 1990 corporate annual income <i>tax return</i>, it nonetheless offered in evidence its top-ranking official’s testimony and certification pertaining to only <i>two taxable years</i> (1989 and 1990).&nbsp; The said return was attached only to its Motion for Reconsideration before the CTA.<br><br>Petitioner in this case offered documentary and testimonial evidence that extended <b>beyond</b> <i>two taxable years</i>, because the excess credits in the first (1995) <i>taxable year</i> had not been used up during the second (1996) <i>taxable year</i>, and because the claim for the refund of those credits had been filed during the third (1997) <i>taxable year</i>.&nbsp; Its final adjustment return was instead attached to its Reply to Comment filed before the CA.<br><br>Moreover, in <i>BPI-Family Savings Bank</i>, petitioner was able to show “the undisputed fact: that petitioner had suffered a <i>net loss</i> in 1990 x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> In the instant case, there is no such “undisputed fact” as yet.&nbsp; The mere admission into the records of petitioner’s 1996 <i>final adjustment return</i> is not a sufficient proof of the truth of the contents of or entries in that return.<br><br>In addition, the BIR in <i>BPI-Family Savings Bank</i> did not controvert the veracity of the return or file an opposition to the Motion and the return.&nbsp; Despite the fact that the return was ignored by both the CA and the CTA, the latter even declared in another case (CTA Case No. 4897) that petitioner had suffered a <i>net loss</i> for <i>taxable year</i> 1990.&nbsp; When attached to the Petition for Review filed before this Court, that Decision was not at all claimed by the BIR to be fraudulent or nonexistent.&nbsp; The Bureau merely contended that this Court should not take judicial notice of the said Decision.<br><br>In this case, however, the BIR has not been given the chance to challenge the veracity of petitioner’s <i>final adjustment return</i>.&nbsp; Neither has the CTA decided any other case categorically declaring a <i>net loss</i> for petitioner in <i>taxable year</i> 1996.&nbsp; After this return was attached to petitioner’s Reply to Comment before the CA, the appellate court should have required the filing of other responsive pleadings from respondent, as was necessary and proper for it to rule upon the return.<br><br><b><i><u>Admissibility Versus Weight</u></i></b><br><br>Indeed, “[a]dmissibility x x x is one thing, weight is another.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> “To admit evidence and not to believe it are not incompatible with each other x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Mere allegations by petitioner of the figures in its 1996 <i>final adjustment return</i> are not a sufficient proof of the amount of its refund entitlement.&nbsp;

When petitioner purportedly filed its administrative claim for a <i>tax refund</i> on April 10, 1997, the deadline for filing the 1996 <i>final adjustment return</i> was not yet over.&nbsp; Hence, it could not have attached this return to its claim.<br><br>For reasons unknown even to this Court, petitioner failed to offer such return as evidence during the trial phase of this case.&nbsp; For its negligence, petitioner “cannot be allowed to seek refuge in a liberal application of the [r]ules”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> by giving it a blanket approval of the total refund it claims.&nbsp; “While in certain instances, we allow a relaxation in the application of the rules, we never intend to forge a weapon for erring litigants to violate the rules with impunity.&nbsp; The liberal interpretation and application of rules apply only in proper cases of demonstrable merit and under justifiable causes and circumstances.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup><br><br>It would not be proper to allow petitioner to simply prevail and compel a refund in the amount it claims, without affording the government a reasonable opportunity to contest the former’s allegations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> Negligence consisting of the unexplained failure to offer the exhibit should not be rewarded with undeserved leniency. &nbsp;Petitioner still bears the burden of proving the amount of its claim for tax refund.&nbsp;
