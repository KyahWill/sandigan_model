Pouring of mix concrete in the existing foundation and the replacement of the poor lumber used were also required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In its claim for payment, RAM Builders requested inspection and verification of the project.&nbsp; A Statement of Work Accomplished,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> dated April 4, 1990, was prepared containing the following certifications: (1)&nbsp; As contractor, RAM Builders certified that the amount stated were correct and the materials used in the project were paid; (2) As chief of the construction section, petitioner <b>Cruz</b> certified that all work items have been accomplished in accordance with the approved plans, specification and program of work; (3) As chief of the research and standard section, Engr. Gerardo A. Razo certified that the materials used in the project have been tested and have passed all requirements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Likewise, petitioner <b>Brucal</b> signed (1) the request for inspection and verification; (2) the certification dated April 4, 1990, to the effect that he had witnessed the payment of salaries and suppliers in connection with the Inaclagan project, that no claim for unpaid materials had been filed by local suppliers against RAM Builders, and that they had been paid; and (3) the certificate of clearance for equipment rental and other obligations which allowed RAM Builders to claim payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> <b>Brucal</b> also submitted and signed the Statement of Time Elapsed of Work Accomplished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>However, the OMB Task Force concluded after its investigation that,<br><blockquote>... <b>[T]</b>here were <b>major defects</b> in the construction of the school building as a direct result of the contractor's <b>improper methods and its use of substandard materials </b>(reinforcement steel bars and lumber).&nbsp; All these, if left unchecked, would have resulted in the construction of a school building which was far <b>weaker in strength</b> than that envisioned by the planners.&nbsp; Considering the degree of deviation from the approved plans and specifications, it could rightfully be concluded that the same had been <b>deliberate</b>.&nbsp; It must be added that there could be no truth to the claim that the contractor's employee had not afforded proper attention to the materials delivered for the project because RAM Builders is also a dealer/supplier of construction materials.&nbsp; From available records, RAM Builders has been a regular supplier of construction materials for projects implemented by the DPWH district office in Lucena City. In all probability, the undersize reinforcement steel bars and poor-quality lumber that were used in the Inaclagan school building project had been supplied by RAM builders itself; such that even before the delivery of said articles to the job site, the contractor (which was at the same time the supplier) already knew that they were not in accordance with the approved plans and specifications.&nbsp; Moreover, it must be presumed that the contractor's employees including its project engineer are knowledgeable about construction materials and methods used in the implementation of public works projects. This being the case, there could not have been an honest mistake in regard to the improper methods utilized and the substandard quality of the basic materials used.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, the contractor should have been compelled to undo what he had unlawfully done by ordering the demolition of what had been constructed so far to ensure strict compliance with the approved plans and specification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> [Emphasis supplied.]<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">. . .<br></div></blockquote>In a Resolution, dated August 4, 1998, the Administrative Adjudication Bureau of the OMB through Graft Investigation Officer II (GIO) Joselito P. Fangon found the petitioners administratively liable for dishonesty and gross neglect of duty.&nbsp; He recommended the dismissal of the petitioners with forfeiture of leave credits and retirement benefits and disqualification for reemployment in the government service, to wit:<br><blockquote><center><span style="font-weight: bold;">II</span><br></center><br>As to the charge of Falsification and/or Dishonesty, respondents were denounced for making it appear that the construction of the three (3) classroom buildings at the Inaclagan Barangay High School was in accordance with the plans and specifications, when in truth there were substantial deviations in terms of materials, quality of work and construction methods.<br><br>The improper construction and use of substandard materials [were] established by the end user particularly the Principal of Inaclagan High School, Mrs. AUREA D. QUISTO, after having made inquiries as to the materials delivered and the method of construction (p.0375, records).&nbsp; Moreover, it appears that the fact of improper construction and use of substandard materials by the contractor was affirmed by the DPWH Regional Director ALFREDO P. TORRES, as evidenced by his letter dated 26 September 1990 (p. 0318, records) addressed to the DPWH District Engineer, Quezon 2<sup>nd</sup> Engineering District.<br><br>Thus, on the basis of the foregoing, <b>it is apparent that substantial evidence exist to hold the following respondents administratively liable for Dishonesty</b>, viz:<br><ol type="a"><li>CESAR A. CRUZ, Chief, Construction Section who by reason of his duties was bound to ensure that the contractor complied with the proper method of construction, as evidenced by the fact that he signed the statement of work accomplished.&nbsp; Thus, <b>his act of signing the same, despite the fact that the proper methods of construction [were] not complied with, amounts to dishonesty.</b><br><br></li><li>FLORENTINO R. BRUCAL, Engineer III, who was duty bound to ensure that the contractor complies with the approved plans and specifications. Hence, <b>his act of signing the statement of time elapsed and statement of work accomplished constitutes fraud and dishonesty vis-à-vis the contractor's obligation relative to the plans and specifications.</b><br></li></ol><center>. . .<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">III</span><br><br></center>Respondents have been charged with complicity in the irregular construction of three (3) classroom buildings at Inaclagan Barangay High School.&nbsp; It was alleged that the contractor used substandard materials and employed improper construction methods in the construction of the Barangay High School Building in Inaclagan Gumaca, Quezon.<br><br>It appears that with regard to the project in question, respondent PANGANIBAN, as District Engineer; respondent MERCADO, as Chief of the Planning and Design Section; respondent CRUZ, as Chief of the DPWH Construction Section; and respondent BRUCAL, as Project Engineer, [have] established that undersized reinforcement steel bars and poor quality lumber were used by the contractor in the Inaclagan School Building.&nbsp; Thus, it is apparent that respondents PANGANIBAN, <b>CRUZ, and BRUCAL [cannot] escape administrative liability for Gross Neglect of Duty for their serious lapses and gross negligence relative to their official responsibility in the matter of adherence to the approved plans and specifications and accepted engineering methods.</b><br><br>It is important to consider herein that the claim of respondents CRUZ and BRUCAL that corrective measures were undertaken vis-à-vis the Inaclagan project does not serve to rebut their clear administrative liability.&nbsp; Verily, their culpability in connection with the Inaclagan project had already arisen before the so-called corrective measures were undertaken.<br><center><br>. . .<br></center><br>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, this Office finds:<br><ol><li> Respondents CESAR A.

Contrary to petitioners' claim, they are being charged based on their respective duties.&nbsp; As Project Engineer, the nature of Brucal's official duties obligated him, together with Cruz, as Chief, to oversee the implementation of the project and determine if the contractor of the project was complying with the approved plans and specifications by the DPWH.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> On the other hand, as Chief of the Quezon Second Engineering District Construction Section, Cruz's primary duty was to ensure that RAM Builders complied with standards and specifications of the DPWH.<br><br>While we agree with public respondent that factual matters are beyond the province of this Court, a recognized exception to this rule is when there is misapprehension of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> It must be stressed that petitioners were held liable for falsification and/or dishonesty for allegedly making it appear that the construction of the three-classroom building at the Inaclagan <i>Barangay</i> High School was in accordance with the plans and specifications, although there were substantial deviations in terms of materials, quality of work and construction methods.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> For petitioner Cruz, signing the Statement of Work Accomplished, despite the fact that the proper methods of construction were not complied with, amounts to dishonesty.&nbsp; On Brucal's part, signing the Statement of Time Elapsed constitutes fraud and dishonesty <i>vis-à-vis</i> the contractor's obligation relative to the plans and specifications as it allowed payment to RAM Builders.&nbsp; Clearly, the petitioners' factual averment that the said statements were signed after corrections were made need to be ascertained to determine their liability on the charge for dishonesty.&nbsp; As defined, dishonesty is intentionally making a false statement in any material fact, or practicing or attempting to practice any deception or fraud in securing his examination, registration, appointment or promotion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Dishonesty is understood to imply a disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; untrustworthiness; lack of integrity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>A careful perusal of the records reveals that after the award of the Inaclagan project to RAM Builders on February 5, 1990, construction commenced on February 26, 1990.&nbsp; Despite the interruption in the construction due to defects, as reported by the oversight committee in its letters to District Engineer Medardo R. Panganiban, the corrective measures were undertaken by RAM Builders upon resumption of its construction on March 28, 1990.&nbsp; By the first week of April, the project was completed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Claim for payment was thereafter processed on April 4, 1990.&nbsp; Clearly, when the petitioners signed their respective statements which allowed payment to RAM Builders, the construction of the project was already finished in accordance with the approved plans and specification.&nbsp; Such did not amount to dishonesty as they made no false statement.&nbsp; No deliberate intent to mislead, deceive or defraud can be read from the cited circumstances of this case.<br><br>Anent the charge of gross neglect, we are in accord with the findings of the OMB Adjudication Bureau, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, finding herein petitioners liable for gross neglect of duty.&nbsp; <b>Gross negligence</b> refers to negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but wilfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to consequences in so far as other persons may be affected.&nbsp; It is the omission of that care which even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to take on their own property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In cases involving public officials, there is gross negligence when a breach of duty is flagrant and palpable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>As found by the OMB Task Force, the construction of the school building suffered from major defects, resulting in an edifice far weaker in strength as a direct result of the contractor's improper methods and use of substandard materials.&nbsp; As a corrective measure, additional reinforcement steel bars had to be added, inferior lumber removed and pouring of concrete cement over the existing foundation made.<br><br>We find that petitioners were unable to satisfactorily explain their failure to oversee the project in its critical stages.&nbsp; Their defense that corrections were nevertheless employed and that they handled other projects do not negate their administrative liability. Instead, it is indicative of a conscious design to delegate the vital task incumbent upon them as engineers whose appointment to such position is by reason of their academic preparation and work experience to conceptualize, plan, implement and manage a development project of the government.<br><br>The responsibility of overseeing the implementation of the Inaclagan project is lodged with the petitioners.&nbsp; They were to ensure adherence by the contractor to the approved plans, specifications, and accepted engineering methods.&nbsp; In fact, as project engineer,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> Brucal's tasks, as spelled out in the Manual on Infrastructure Projects, include monitoring slippages<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> and non-compliance of the contractor with approved plans and specifications.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>Evidently, they failed to timely perform their assigned duties with dedication, efficiency, and utmost responsibility, ideals which men and women in public service ought to cherish and dutifully observe.&nbsp; On the whole, petitioners as construction engineers in charge of the Inaclagan project, should be fully cognizant not only of the professional nature and responsibilities of the task but its impact as well on the efficiency of public service.&nbsp; As public servants, petitioners are expected to exhibit the highest degree of dedication in deference to their foremost duty of accountability to the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> No less than the Constitution sanctifies the principle that public office is a public trust, and enjoins all public officers and employees to serve with the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Pursuant to Section 23,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><sup> </sup>Rule XIV of the Omnibus Rules Implementing Book V of Executive Order No. 292, gross negligence in the performance of duty is classified as a grave offense for which the penalty of dismissal is imposed.&nbsp; Section 9 of the said Rule likewise provides that the penalty of dismissal shall carry with it cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of leave credits and retirement benefits and the disqualification for re-employment in the government service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Fortunately, the construction defects were remedied seasonably and the project at Inaclagan High School was completed without further mishaps.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is <span style="font-weight: bold;">DENIED</span>.&nbsp; The assailed Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated June 22, 2001 and November 20, 2001, respectively, finding Engr.
