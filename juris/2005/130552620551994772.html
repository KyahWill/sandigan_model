				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Common carriers are bound to observe extraordinary 
diligence in their vigilance over the goods entrusted to them, as 
required by the nature of their business and for reasons of public 
policy.&nbsp; Consequently, the law presumes that common carriers are at 
fault or negligent for any loss or damage to the goods that they 
transport.&nbsp; In the present case, the evidence submitted by petitioner to
 overcome this presumption was sorely insufficient.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Case</u></b><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the October 9, 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the December 29, 2003 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 66028.&nbsp; The challenged Decision disposed as follows: <blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appeal is <b>GRANTED</b>.&nbsp; The December 7, 1999 decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 42 in Civil Case No. 92-63159 is hereby <b>REVERSED</b> and <b>SET ASIDE</b>.&nbsp;
 [Petitioner] is ordered to pay the [herein respondent] the value of the
 lost cargo in the amount of P565,000.00.&nbsp; Costs against the [herein 
petitioner]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </blockquote> The assailed Resolution denied reconsideration.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Facts</u></b><br></div><br>Ilian
 Silica Mining entered into a contract of carriage with Lea Mer 
Industries, Inc., for the shipment of 900 metric tons of silica sand 
valued at P565,000.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; 
Consigned to Vulcan Industrial and Mining Corporation, the cargo was to 
be transported from Palawan to Manila.&nbsp; On October 25, 1991, the silica 
sand was placed on board <i>Judy VII</i>, a barge leased by Lea Mer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; During the voyage, the vessel sank, resulting in the loss of the cargo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Malayan Insurance Co., Inc., as insurer, paid Vulcan the value of the lost cargo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>&nbsp;
 To recover the amount paid and in the exercise of its right of 
subrogation, Malayan demanded reimbursement from Lea Mer, which refused 
to comply.&nbsp; Consequently, Malayan instituted a Complaint with the 
Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila on September 4, 1992, for the 
collection of P565,000 representing the amount that respondent had paid 
Vulcan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On October 7, 1999, the trial court dismissed the Complaint, upon finding that the cause of the loss was a fortuitous event.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp;
 The RTC noted that the vessel had sunk because of the bad weather 
condition brought about by Typhoon Trining.&nbsp; The court ruled that 
petitioner had no advance knowledge of the incoming typhoon, and that 
the vessel had been cleared by the Philippine Coast Guard to travel from
 Palawan to Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Ruling of the Court of Appeals</b></u><br></div><br>Reversing
 the trial court, the CA held that the vessel was not seaworthy when it 
sailed for Manila.&nbsp; Thus, the loss of the cargo was occasioned by 
petitioner's fault, not by a fortuitous event.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Hence, this recourse.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>The Issues</u></b><br></div><br>Petitioner states the issues in this wise: <blockquote>"A.
 Whether or not the survey report of the cargo surveyor, Jesus Cortez, 
who had not been presented as a witness of the said report during the 
trial of this case before the lower court can be admitted in evidence to
 prove the alleged facts cited in the said report.<br><br>"B. Whether or
 not the respondent, Court of Appeals, had validly or legally reversed 
the finding of fact of the Regional Trial Court which clearly and 
unequivocally held that the loss of the cargo subject of this case was 
caused by fortuitous event for which herein petitioner could not be held
 liable.<br><br>"C. Whether or not the respondent, Court of Appeals, had
 committed serious error and grave abuse of discretion in disregarding 
the testimony of the witness from the MARINA, Engr. Jacinto Lazo y 
Villegal, to the effect that the vessel 'Judy VII' was seaworthy at the 
time of incident and further in disregarding the testimony of the 
PAG-ASA weather specialist, Ms. Rosa Barba y Saliente, to the effect 
that typhoon 'Trining' did not hit Metro Manila or Palawan."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </blockquote>
 In the main, the issues are as follows: (1) whether petitioner is 
liable for the loss of the cargo, and (2) whether the survey report of 
Jesus Cortez is admissible in evidence.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>The Court's Ruling</b></u><br></div><br>The Petition has no merit.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>First Issue:</u> </b><br><b><u><i>Liability for Loss of Cargo</i></u></b><br></div><b><u><br><i>Question of Fact</i></u></b><br><br>The
 resolution of the present case hinges on whether the loss of the cargo 
was due to a fortuitous event.&nbsp; This issue involves primarily a question
 of fact, notwithstanding petitioner's claim that it pertains only to a 
question of law.&nbsp; As a general rule, questions of fact may not be raised
 in a petition for review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; The present case serves as an exception to this rule, because the factual findings of the appellate and the trial courts vary.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>&nbsp; This Court meticulously reviewed the records, but found no reason to reverse the CA.<br><br><i><u><b>Rule on Common Carriers</b></u></i><br><br>Common
 carriers are persons, corporations, firms or associations engaged in 
the business of carrying or transporting passengers or goods, or both --
 by land, water, or air -- when this service is offered to the public 
for compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; 
Petitioner is clearly a common carrier, because it offers to the public 
its business of transporting goods through its vessels.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>Thus, the Court corrects the trial court's finding that petitioner became a private carrier when Vulcan chartered it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>&nbsp; Charter parties are classified as contracts of demise (or bareboat) and affreightment, which are distinguished as follows: <blockquote>"Under
 the demise or bareboat charter of the vessel, the charterer will 
generally be considered as owner for the voyage or service stipulated.&nbsp; 
The charterer mans the vessel with his own people and becomes, in 
effect, the owner<span style="font-style: italic;"> pro hac vice</span>,
 subject to liability to others for damages caused by negligence.&nbsp; To 
create a demise, the owner of a vessel must completely and exclusively 
relinquish possession, command and navigation thereof to the charterer; 
anything short of such a complete transfer is a contract of 
affreightment (time or voyage charter party) or not a charter party at 
all."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </blockquote> The distinction is significant, because a demise or bareboat charter indicates a business undertaking that is <span style="font-style: italic;">private</span> in character. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>&nbsp;
 Consequently, the rights and obligations of the parties to a contract 
of private carriage are governed principally by their stipulations, not 
by the law on common carriers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>The
 Contract in the present case was one of affreightment, as shown by the 
fact that it was petitioner's crew that manned the tugboat <i>M/V Ayalit</i> and controlled the barge <i>Judy VII</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>&nbsp; Necessarily, petitioner was a common carrier, and the pertinent law governs the present factual circumstances.<br><br><u><i><b>Extraordinary Diligence Required</b></i></u><br><br>Common carriers are bound to observe <i>extraordinary</i>
 diligence in their vigilance over the goods and the safety of the 
passengers they transport, as required by the nature of their business 
and for reasons of public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp;
 Extraordinary diligence requires rendering service with the greatest 
skill and foresight to avoid damage and destruction to the goods 
entrusted for carriage and delivery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Common
 carriers are presumed to have been at fault or to have acted 
negligently for loss or damage to the goods that they have transported.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>&nbsp;
 This presumption can be rebutted only by proof that they observed 
extraordinary diligence, or that the loss or damage was occasioned by 
any of the following causes:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> <blockquote>"(1) Flood, storm, earthquake, lightning, or other natural disaster or calamity;<br><br>"(2) Act of the public enemy in war, whether international or civil;<br><br>"(3) Act or omission of the shipper or owner of the goods;<br><br>"(4) The character of the goods or defects in the packing or in the containers;<br><br>"(5) Order or act of competent public authority."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> </blockquote> <u><i><b>Rule on Fortuitous Events</b></i></u><br><br>Article
 1174 of the Civil Code provides that "no person shall be responsible 
for a fortuitous event which could not be foreseen, or which, though 
foreseen, was inevitable."&nbsp; Thus, if the loss or damage was due to such 
an event, a common carrier is exempted from liability.<br><br>Jurisprudence
 defines the elements of a "fortuitous event" as follows:&nbsp; (a) the cause
 of the unforeseen and unexpected occurrence, or the failure of the 
debtors to comply with their obligations, must have been independent of 
human will; (b) the event that constituted the <i>caso fortuito</i> must
 have been impossible to foresee or, if foreseeable, impossible to 
avoid; (c)&nbsp; the occurrence must have been such as to render it 
impossible for the debtors to fulfill their obligation in a normal 
manner; and (d) the obligor must have been free from any participation 
in the aggravation of the resulting injury to the creditor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>To
 excuse the common carrier fully of any liability, the fortuitous event 
must have been the proximate and only cause of the loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>&nbsp;
 Moreover, it should have exercised due diligence to prevent or minimize
 the loss before, during and after the occurrence of the fortuitous 
event.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br><i><u><b>Loss in the Instant Case</b></u></i><br><br>There
 is no controversy regarding the loss of the cargo in the present case.&nbsp;
 As the common carrier, petitioner bore the burden of proving that it 
had exercised extraordinary diligence to avoid the loss, or that the 
loss had been occasioned by a fortuitous event -- an exempting 
circumstance.<br><br>It was precisely this circumstance that petitioner 
cited to escape liability.&nbsp; Lea Mer claimed that the loss of the cargo 
was due to the bad weather condition brought about by Typhoon Trining.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp;
 Evidence was presented to show that petitioner had not been informed of
 the incoming typhoon, and that the Philippine Coast Guard had given it 
clearance to begin the voyage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp;
 On October 25, 1991, the date on which the voyage commenced and the 
barge sank, Typhoon Trining was allegedly far from Palawan, where the 
storm warning was only "Signal No. 1."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>The
 evidence presented by petitioner in support of its defense of 
fortuitous event was sorely insufficient.&nbsp; As required by the pertinent 
law, it was not enough for the common carrier to show that there was an 
unforeseen or unexpected occurrence.&nbsp; It had to show that it was free 
from any fault -- a fact it miserably failed to prove.<br><br><i>First,</i>
 petitioner presented no evidence that it had attempted to minimize or 
prevent the loss before, during or after the alleged fortuitous event.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp;
 Its witness, Joey A. Draper, testified that he could no longer remember
 whether anything had been done to minimize loss when water started 
entering the barge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; This fact was confirmed during his cross-examination, as shown by the following brief exchange: <blockquote>"Atty. Baldovino, Jr.:<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Other
 than be[a]ching the barge Judy VII, were there other precautionary

 the alleged fortuitous event was not the sole and proximate cause of 
the loss.&nbsp; There is a preponderance of evidence that the barge was not 
seaworthy when it sailed for Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>&nbsp;
 Respondent was able to prove that, in the hull of the barge, there were
 holes that might have caused or aggravated the sinking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>&nbsp;
 Because the presumption of negligence or fault applied to petitioner, 
it was incumbent upon it to show that there were no holes; or, if there 
were, that they did not aggravate the sinking.<br><br>Petitioner offered
 no evidence to rebut the existence of the holes.&nbsp; Its witness, Domingo 
A. Luna, testified that the barge was in "tip-top" or excellent 
condition,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> but that he had not personally inspected it when it left Palawan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup><br><br>The submission of the Philippine Coast Guard's Certificate of Inspection of <i>Judy VII</i>, dated July 31, 1991, did not conclusively prove that the barge was seaworthy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>&nbsp; The regularity of the issuance of the Certificate is disputably presumed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp;
 It could be contradicted by competent evidence, which respondent 
offered.&nbsp; Moreover, this evidence did not necessarily take into account 
the actual condition of the vessel at the time of the commencement of 
the voyage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><b><u>Second Issue:<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></u></b><br><b><u><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><i>Admissibility of the Survey Report</i></u></b><br></div><br>Petitioner claims that the Survey Report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup>
 prepared by Jesus Cortez, the cargo surveyor, should not have been 
admitted in evidence.&nbsp; The Court partly agrees.&nbsp; Because he did not 
testify during the trial,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> 
then the Report that he had prepared was hearsay and therefore 
inadmissible for the purpose of proving the truth of its contents.<br><br><i><b><u>The Survey Report Not the Sole Evidence</u></b></i><br><br>The
 facts reveal that Cortez's Survey Report was used in the testimonies of
 respondent's witnesses -- Charlie M. Soriano; and Federico S. Manlapig,
 a cargo marine surveyor and the vice-president of Toplis and Harding 
Company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup>&nbsp; Soriano testified that the Survey Report had been used in preparing the final Adjustment Report conducted by their company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup>&nbsp;
 The final Report showed that the barge was not seaworthy because of the
 existence of the holes.&nbsp; Manlapig testified that he had prepared that 
Report after taking into account the findings of the surveyor, as well 
as the pictures and the sketches of the place where the sinking 
occurred.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup>&nbsp; Evidently, the existence of the holes was proved by the testimonies of the witnesses, not merely by Cortez' Survey Report.<br><br><b><u><i>Rule on Independently<br>Relevant Statement</i></u></b><br><br>That witnesses must be examined and presented during the trial,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> and that their testimonies must be confined to personal knowledge is required by the rules on evidence, from which we quote: <blockquote>"Section 36.&nbsp; <i>Testimony generally confined to personal knowledge; hearsay excluded.</i>&nbsp;
 –A witness can testify only to those facts which he knows of his 
personal knowledge; that is, which are derived from his own perception, 
except as otherwise provided in these rules."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> </blockquote> On this basis, the trial court correctly refused to admit Jesus Cortez's Affidavit, which respondent had offered as evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>&nbsp; Well-settled is the rule that, unless the affiant is presented as a witness, an affidavit is considered hearsay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>An
 exception to the foregoing rule is that on "independently relevant 
statements."&nbsp; A report made by a person is admissible if it is intended 
to prove the tenor, not the truth, of the statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp;
 Independent of the truth or the falsity of the statement given in the 
report, the fact that it has been made is relevant.&nbsp; Here, the hearsay 
rule does not apply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>In
 the instant case, the challenged Survey Report prepared by Cortez was 
admitted only as part of the testimonies of respondent's witnesses.&nbsp; The
 referral to Cortez's Report was in relation to Manlapig's final 
Adjustment Report.&nbsp; Evidently, it was the existence of the Survey Report
 that was testified to.&nbsp; The admissibility of that Report as part of the
 testimonies of the witnesses was correctly ruled upon by the trial 
court.<br><br>At any rate, even without the Survey Report, petitioner 
has already failed to overcome the presumption of fault that applies to 
common carriers.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is <i><b>DENIED</b></i> and the assailed Decision and Resolution are <i><b>AFFIRMED</b></i>.&nbsp; Costs against petitioner.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Sandoval-Gutierrez, Corona, Carpio Morales,</i> and <i>Garcia, JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> *</sup>

Barba, weather specialist of Philippine Atmosphere (PAGASA), was summarized by the RTC as follows: <blockquote>"In
 May 1993, upon the request of [petitioner's] counsel, she issued a 
weather bureau report or certification, an official record of Pagasa, 
which weather report is based on their weather station at Puerto 
Princesa, Palawan. x x x The report on the weather condition on October 
21, 1991 at around 11:00 am to 2:00 pm was weathercast sky.&nbsp; The bad 
weather condition on October 25, 26, and 27, 1991 was caused by typhoon 
'Trining' but said typhoon then was far from Palawan, which was only 
signal No. 1.&nbsp; Tropical storm 'Trining' entered the Philippine area of 
responsibility on October 24.&nbsp; Pagasa did issue a warning that said 
storm was approaching the Philippines.&nbsp; Storm 'Trining' was classified, 
as super typhoon with a maximum of 185 kilometer[s] per hour and the 
coverage was big.&nbsp; On October 24, 1991, typhoon 'Trining' hit Batangas, 
the Ilocos Provinces, Isabela, but not Metro Manila or Palawan.&nbsp; Maybe 
Palawan was affected but if ever it was affected it was only minimal."&nbsp;

Draper, the quarter master in charge of steering the tugboat, was summarized by the RTC as follows: <blockquote>"On
 October 25, 1991, he was assigned in the tugboat 'M/T Ayalit.' x x x 
[The tugboat] was towing the barge 'Judy VII' which was carrying silica 
sand. x x x He was an ordinary seaman in 1991 and it was his first year 
as a seaman, although he made several trips to Palawan and Manila. x x x
 He does not know the qualification[s] of a seaman but he was then a 
second year high school [student] and though he did not take any 
examination, he knew about navigation.&nbsp; When the incident happened in 
1991[,] he had no seaman book as it was not yet strict at the time and 
the seaman book can be dispensed with.&nbsp; He was only 18 years and has an 
actual training of the work when he boarded the tugboat.&nbsp; Even if he has
 no formal schooling, the master allowed him to handle the wheel of the 
tugboat.&nbsp; When they left San Vicente, Palawan for Manila on said date at
 around 4:00 pm, the weather was fair.&nbsp; When they passed by Linapakan 
Island, the waves were quite big and the wind was a little bit strong.&nbsp; 
At that point in time, the barge patrol of 'Judy VII' wave[d] his hand 
[at] them.&nbsp; Their captain decided to approach the barge.&nbsp; They noticed 
that [there was] water already inside the barge.&nbsp; About two (2) days 
later, their captain decided to beach the barge.&nbsp; The said barge then 
sank and only the barge's house at the back portion of the barge ('the 
puppa') was above water.&nbsp; He could only remember that they save[d] the 
bargemen and proceeded to El Nido, Palawan where they secured themselves
 to save the tugboat.&nbsp; But he could no longer remember how long a time 
they stayed thereat nor if they went back to the barge 'Judy VII.'"&nbsp; RTC
