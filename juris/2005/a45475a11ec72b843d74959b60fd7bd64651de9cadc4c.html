Under the credit card system, the credit card company extends credit accommodations to its card holders for the purchase of goods and services from its member establishments, to be reimbursed by them later on upon proper billing.&nbsp;

The card holder is, therefore, given “the power to obtain present control of goods or service on a promise to pay for them in the future.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Business establishments may extend credit sales through the use of the credit card facilities of a non-bank credit card company to avoid the risk of uncollectible accounts from their customers.&nbsp; Under this system, the establishments do not deposit in their bank accounts the credit card drafts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> that arise from the credit sales.&nbsp; Instead, they merely record their receivables from the credit card company and periodically send the drafts evidencing those receivables to the latter.<br><br>The credit card company, in turn, sends checks as payment to these business establishments, but it does not redeem the drafts at full price.&nbsp; The agreement between them usually provides for discounts to be taken by the company upon its redemption of the drafts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; At the end of each month, it then bills its credit card holders for their respective drafts redeemed during the previous month.&nbsp; If the holders fail to pay the amounts owed, the company sustains the loss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In the present case, respondent’s role in the consumer credit<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> process described above primarily consists of gathering the bills and credit card drafts of different service establishments located in the Philippines and forwarding them to the ROCs outside the country.&nbsp; Servicing the bill is not the same as billing.&nbsp; For the former type of service alone, respondent already gets paid.<br><br>The parent company -- to which the ROCs and respondent belong -- takes charge not only of redeeming the drafts from the ROCs and sending the checks to the service establishments, but also of billing the credit card holders for their respective drafts that it has redeemed.&nbsp;

Reciprocal accounts are reconciled or eliminated, because they lose all significance when the branches and home office are viewed as a single entity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; In like manner, intra-company profits or losses must be offset against each other for accounting purposes.<br><br>Contrary to petitioner’s assertion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> respondent can sell its services to another branch of the same parent company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; In fact, the business concept of a transfer price allows goods and services to be sold between and among intra-company units at cost or above cost.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; A branch may be operated as a revenue center, cost center, profit center or investment center, depending upon the policies and accounting system of its parent company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp;

Goods and services are taxed only in the country where they are consumed.&nbsp; Thus, exports are zero-rated, while imports are taxed.<br><br>Confusion in zero rating arises because petitioner equates the <span style="font-style: italic;">performance</span> of a particular type of service with the <span style="font-style: italic;">consumption</span> of its output abroad.&nbsp; In the present case, the <span style="font-style: italic;">facilitation of the collection</span> of receivables is different from the <span style="font-style: italic;">utilization or consumption of the outcome</span> of such service.&nbsp;

The <span style="font-style: italic;">consumption </span>contemplated by law, contrary to petitioner’s administrative interpretation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> does not imply that the service be done abroad in order to be zero-rated.<br><br>Consumption is “the use of a thing in a way that thereby exhausts it.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup>&nbsp; Applied to services, the term means the performance or “successful completion of a contractual duty, usually resulting in the performer’s release from any past or future liability x x x.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup>&nbsp; The services rendered by respondent are performed or successfully completed upon its sending to its foreign client the drafts and bills it has gathered from service establishments here.&nbsp; Its services, having been performed in the Philippines, are therefore also consumed in the Philippines.<br><br>Unlike goods, services cannot be physically used in or bound for a specific place when their destination is determined.&nbsp;

Respondent’s facilitation service has no physical existence, yet takes place upon rendition, and therefore upon consumption, in the Philippines.&nbsp; Under the destination principle, as petitioner asserts, such service is subject to VAT at the rate of 10 percent.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;

Its facilitation service is performed in the Philippines.&nbsp; It falls under the second category found in Section 102(b) of the Tax Code, because it is a service other than “processing, manufacturing or repacking of goods” as mentioned in the provision.&nbsp; Undisputed is the fact that such service meets the statutory condition that it be paid in acceptable foreign currency duly accounted for in accordance with BSP rules.&nbsp; Thus, it should be zero-rated.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;

The law neither imposes such requirement nor associates services with exported goods.&nbsp; It simply states that the services performed by VAT-registered persons in the Philippines -- services other than the processing, manufacturing or repacking of goods for persons doing business outside this country -- if paid in acceptable foreign currency and accounted for in accordance with the rules and regulations of the BSP, are zero-rated.&nbsp;

These three enumerations under Section 102 are zero-rated provided that these conditions indicated in these three paragraphs are also complied with.&nbsp; If they are not complied with, then they are not entitled to the zero ratings.&nbsp; Just like in the export of minerals, if these are not exported, then they cannot qualify under this provision of zero rating.<br><br>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">Senator Maceda:</span>&nbsp; Mr. President, just one small item so we can leave this.&nbsp; Under the proviso, it is required that the following services be performed in the Philippines.<br><br>“Under No. 2, services other than those mentioned above includes, let us say, manufacturing computers and computer chips or repacking goods for persons doing business outside the Philippines.&nbsp; Meaning to say, we ship the goods to them in Chicago or Washington and they send the payment inwardly to the Philippines in foreign currency, and that is, of course, zero-rated.<br><br>“Now, when we say ‘services other than those mentioned in the preceding subsection[,’] may I have some examples of these?<br><br>“<span style="font-weight: bold;">Senator Herrera:</span>&nbsp;
