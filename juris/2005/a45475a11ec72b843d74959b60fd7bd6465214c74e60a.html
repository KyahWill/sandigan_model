				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a complaint filed before the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) Regional Office at Cebu City by Enrique V. Gonzales (Gonzales) against Toribio Rodil (Rodil) and Salud Young for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preservation of Tenancy Status</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Gonzales claimed to be a tenant on a portion of a five (5)-hectare landholding situated at Upper Bulacao, Pardo, Cebu City which Rodil formerly owned but which he sold to Salud Young.<br><br>In a separate complaint/petition filed also before the same DAR Regional Office by Danilo Esparagera, Gonzales’ brother-in-law, together with the former’s wife, also against Rodil and Young, along with Rodulfo Amancia, and J.

Act 1199, as amended; Caballes vs. Department of Agrarian Reform, et al., G.R. No. 78214, December 5, 1988; Gabriel vs. Pangilinan, G.R. No. 27797, August 26, 1974)<br></blockquote>As can be gleaned from the records of this case, l<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ate before 1948, there were already few coconut trees strategically planted</span> along the boundary line of the land in question identified as Lot 5391 nestled at Pardo, Cebu City. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Late thereafter, whole area was fully planted with coconut by former landowner, the late Eugenio Rodil assisted by Gil Rodil, Toribio Rodil, a certain Cleto and few hired laborers</span>.&nbsp; (Exhibits “1” and “2”, par. 4 and TSN dated Feb. 26, 1990, p. 16); <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Complainants Danilo Esparagera and Enrique Gonzales who are related by affinity being brother-in-laws entered the subject landholding <span style="font-weight: bold;">by tolerance</span></span> sometime 1960 and 1955, respectively.&nbsp; (Exhibits “H”, par. 3 and “A”, par. 1) That they were able to plant coconuts, corn and bananas and shared the produced thereof to the landowner through the acknowledged overseers Semiona and Alfonsa Cabaltera.&nbsp; (TSN dated Jan. 23, 1990; p. 5) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">These averments, however, are sternly denied and controverted no less than by Alfonsa Cabaltera herself who succinctly testified during the hearing in this wise</span>:<br><br><blockquote>9) Nga si Enrique Gonzales wala magabantay sa lubi wala siya mananum ug karon na lang naburoka na nga siya miuma sa yuta nga akong gibantayan ug gibantayan ni Juliana Castañares;<br><br>10) Nga nakaila usab ako kang Danilo Esparagera nga igo lamang nga nagpuyo sa yuta apan dili siya saop ug karon na lang siya magtanumtanum ug saging ug mais aron ingnon&nbsp; siya nga saop sa diha na nga naburoka ang yuta.<br></blockquote>In English translation means:<br><blockquote>9) That Enrique Gonzales has never watched the coconut trees and never planted them and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it was only during the pendency of this case that he cultivated the land I’[m] watching jointly with Juliana Castañares</span>;<br><br>10) That I also know <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Danilo Esparagera who merely stayed on the land but not as tenant</span> and he started planting bananas and corn just recently so as to be called tenant in the pendency of this case involving this land.”&nbsp; (Exhibit “9” and TSN dated August 20, 1990, pp. 4-15)<br></blockquote>Besides, it is highly inconceivable and ludicrous to believe that farming is the main source of livelihood of complainant <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gonzales who admittedly testified that he is a taxi driver and a Gospel Minister-Preacher who earned a net and better income of P40.00 to P50.00 a day in driving compared to P3.00 or little bit more in farming for every three (3) months</span>. (TSN dated November 6, 1989, pp. 18-19; TSN dated February 26, 1990, p. 7)&nbsp; While complainant <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Esparagera derived a minimal income from farming compared to furniture making</span> out of rattan whose lucrative income and viability is even known for export.&nbsp; This is patently shown in the cash advance receipt dated February 25, 1989 signed by Diega Esparagera, wife of the aforenamed complainant.&nbsp; (TSN dated September 14, 1990, pp. 16-17; TSN dated December 10, 1990, pp. 16-18)<br><br>Viewed from the foregoing perspective, it is irresistible to conclude that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">complainants herein are not bona-fide tenant-farmers</span> on the land under controversy especially so that that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no scintilla of hard and persuasive evidence has been adduced by complainants except their bare testimonies</span> which fall short of the required “substantial evidence” inevitably necessary to sutain a valid cause of action in agrarian cases or controversies.&nbsp; (Hernandez vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, et. al., G.R. 74323, September 21, 1990)<br><br>On the <span style="font-weight: bold;">second issue</span>, the opposing claims of the parties are&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;obvious that while complainants averred that the parcel in question is agricultural, respondents also contended that it is residential in nature.<br><br>A judicious perusal on the records of this case, complainants argued that based on the actual use of the subject land, it is agricultural while <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respondents alleged that it is residential and in support thereof</span> is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Certification</span> dated March 9, 1989 signed by Mr. Ignacio P. Salgado, Jr. of the Department of Planning and Development, Cebu City (Exhibit “4”), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Copy of Resolution No. 2003 approving the Rezonification Plan of Cebu City</span> as approved by the City Planning&nbsp; Board, series of 1966 (Exhibit “5”), Copy of the Zoning and Planning Ordinance of Cebu City adopted by the City Planning Board and approved by the National Urban Planning Commission pursuant to Executive Order No. 98 dated March 11, 1946 (Exhibit “6”), with the subject landholding situated at Pardo, Cebu City, clearly classified as residential (Exhibit “6-a”) and, finally, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">copy of the Zonal Valuation of Real Properties in Cebu City</span> issued by the Department of Finance through the Bureau of Internal Revenue (Exhibit “8”) showing the assessment level/valuation of the subject landholding.<br><br>While in the ocular inspection conducted by this Board last June 17, 1991 with due notice to all the parties, it can be readily observed that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">while there are remaining coconut trees and newly planted bananas</span> existing thereon, the land in question is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">predominantly surrounded with residential houses</span>, the Cabingki subdivision, the Aznar Realty Development Corporation and the adjacent Catholic Cemetery vastly occupying the adjacent area.&nbsp; (Ocular Inspection Report dated June 27, 1991)<br><br>Plainly, therefore, it is not farfetched to believe that the subject landholding is residential in nature. The Honorable Supreme Court categorically ruled that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">where a piece of land is officially classified as residential by proper authorities, the same cannot be considered agricultural, nor can the fact that a caretaker planted palay thereon convert the land</span>, in the heart of a metropolitan area, to agricultural land.&nbsp; (Tiongson vs. Court of Appeals, 130 SCRA 482)&nbsp; It Is significant to note that this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reclassification to residential land under the Zoning Ordinance dating back <span style="font-weight: bold;">1946</span> as approved by the then National Urban Planning Commission does not need any DAR Clearance</span> as the said “legal requirement in cases of land use from agricultural to non-agricultural uses to conversion made on or after June 15, 1988, the date of the agrarian reform law’s effectivity.&nbsp; Prior thereto the power of the HLURB and the Department of Finance to recategorize lands were exclusive.” (LRA Circular No. 22 dated February 14, 1990 signed by then Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon).<br><br>Further still, the foregoing conclusion appears to be clearly consistent with the judicial norm established by the Honorable Court in parallel case of “Ouano, et al. v. Ercide, et al.,” CA-G.R. No SP-08573-CAR, involving a landholding situated at Banilad, Mandaue City, adjacent to Cebu City.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In upholding the lower court which declared as residential the land subject matter in said Ouano Case, the Appellate Court ruled</span>:<br><br>In the said Peregrino Case, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the change came about due to the overt act of the government of the City of Davao; the change in the instant case is due to progress of the times.&nbsp; The passing of time made the change from agricultural to residential/commercial.&nbsp; The change is due to immutable law of nature</span>. Progress must go on; no one cannot arrest it.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Take the case of the City of Cebu. Time was when the lands in the heart of the City were agricultural.&nbsp; But as time went on the City shed the agricultural vestures of its lands, not by law of decree, but due to the inevitable change concomitant with the progress of the times</span>. So is the case at bar. The finding of the Planning Board and the Assessor’s Office did not convert these parcels of land from agricultural to residential/industrial.&nbsp; The acts of the said Officials are merely reiterations of the fact already in existence . . . a fact that resulted from the progress of the place and the passing of the time.”. . .<br><br>There can be no further room for doubt as to the subject parcel being residential in nature because the incumbent DAR Secretary, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Honorable Benjamin T. Leong</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in a very recent Order dated August 6, 1990 declared the landholding involved in Civil Case No. R-226</span> entitled “Lope Tuttud, et al. vs. Ernesto Oporto,” as residential. And said landholding is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">located in Tamban, Cebu City which is generally a rural community of about 15 kilometers from Cebu City compared to Pardo, Cebu City, the location of the subject property</span> which is barely about 5 kilometers, a stonethrow from “booming” Cebu City.

Act 386 as amended).”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The PARAD thus disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, in the light of all the foregoing considerations, Decision is hereby rendered as follows:<br><blockquote>1) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dismissing the instant cases</span> (DARAB Cases Nos. CEB-VII-45-89 and CEB-VII-97-89) for lack of merit;<br><br>2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Declaring respondents to be entitled and to receive/accept the deposited amounts tendered by complainant, Danilo Esparagera</span> as evidenced by Official Receipts Nos. 4742045 – P843.75; 4742080 – P240.00 and 4742111 – P300.00 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and from complainant Enrique Gonzales</span> as evidenced by Official Receipt No. 4742042 – P2,266.35 dated January 18, 1990;<br><br>3) No pronouncement as to costs and damages.&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br></blockquote></blockquote>The complainants appealed the PARAD’s decision to the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB), assigning as errors the following:<br><blockquote>(1) THE PARAD OF CEBU <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ERRED IN FINDING AND CONCLUDING THAT ENRIQUE GONZALES AND DANILO ESPARAGERA ARE NOT AGRICULTURAL TENANTS</span> ON THEIR RESPECTIVE TILLAGES INSIDE THE SUBJECT LAND, AS THE SAME FINDING AND CONCLUSION ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD; AND<br><br>(2) THE PARAD OF CEBU <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ERRED IN NOT DIRECTING THE PRESENT OR ACTUAL OWNER OF THE SUBJECT LAND TO EXECUTE A LEASEHOLD CONTRACT</span> WITH ENRIQUE GONZALES; AND IN NOT ISSUING AN INJUNCTION AGAINST RESPONDENTS; (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br></blockquote>In resolving the issue of whether the landholding in question is agricultural, the DARAB dwelt at length on the second and fifth essential requisites for the existence of landholder-tenant relationship reflected in the above-quoted portions of the PARAD’s decision, to wit: the subject is agricultural landholding, and there is personal cultivation by the tenant.<br><br>Citing Administrative Order No. 1, Series of 1990, issued by the DAR Secretary on March 22, 1990 which defines agricultural land as follows:<br><blockquote>Agricultural land refers to those devoted to agricultural activity as defined in RA 6657 and not classified as mineral or forest by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and its predecessors agencies, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not classified in town plans and zoning ordinances as approved by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) and its preceding competent authorities prior to 15 June 1988 for residential, commercial or industrial use</span>.&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br></blockquote>the DARAB “formulate[d] the essential requisites to be satisfied with in order that a parcel or piece of agricultural land has ceased to be agricultural and has been converted or classified as non-agricultural land” as follows:<br><blockquote>(1) . . . the land is no longer devoted to agricultural activity; (2) the land is not classified as mineral or forest by the DENR and its predecessors agencies; (3) . . . the land is not classified in town plans or zoning ordinances for residential, commercial or industrial use; and (4) said town plan or zoning ordinance was approved prior to June 15, 1988 by the HLURB and its preceding competent authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>Additionally, the DARAB noted the provision of Section 36(1) of Republic Act No. 3844, as amended by Republic Act No. 6389, which reads:<br><blockquote>SEC. 36. Possession of Landholding; Exceptions. – Notwithstanding any agreement as to the period or future surrender of the land, an agricultural lessee shall continue in the enjoyment and possession of his landholding except when his dispossession has been authorized by the Court in a judgment that is final and executory if after due hearing it is shown that:<br><br>(1) The landholding is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">declared by the Department head upon recommendation of the National Planning Commission to be suited for residential</span>, commercial, industrial or some other urban use; Provided, That the agricultural lessee shall be entitled to disturbance compensation equivalent to five times the average of the gross harvests on his landholding during the last five preceding calendar years.&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br></blockquote>Furthermore, the DARAB noted the photographs presented by complainant Gonzales as showing that the landholding “is devoted principally to coconuts” to thereby corroborate the complainants’ claim that “no less than . . . 915 coconut trees [we]re . . . found in the entire . . . 5-hectare landholding in November 1988,” and that the Tax Declaration of Rodil categorized the landholding as corn land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Passing on the Zoning Ordinance of Cebu which classified as residential the landholding in question, the DARAB noted that no conclusive evidence was presented by Rodil et al. that the ordinance was duly approved prior to June 15, 1988 by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB) or its preceding competent authorities. Hence, the DARAB “logically and conclusively concluded” that the landholding was and has remained “agricultural in nature, in use and classification.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Respecting the fifth requisite, the DARAB, crediting the separate testimonies of the complainants that they are farmers by occupation whose “agricultural activities” include either planting or cultivating coconuts and bananas, weeding out the grass on the land, and gathering coconuts, discredited the claim that complainant Gonzales remained a taxi driver, and observed that while Esparagera occasionally served as a driver for fellow born again Christians in evangelistic missions and engaged in handicraft work, he was not shown to have been remiss in his obligation as a tenant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the DARAB reversed and set aside the PARAD’s Order and disposed as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding reversible errors in the assailed decision, the same is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and judgment is hereby rendered:<br><ol type="1"><li>Declaring the appellants Danilo Esparagera and Enrique Gonzales to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bona-fide and de jure agricultural tenant-tillers</span> of their respective one-hectare agricultural farmholdings in the five (5)-hectare former Rodil landholding, situated in Pardo, Cebu City;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the appellees and any and all other persons proceeding from them to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">respect the appellants and their farm household in their tenurial rights thereon</span>, and to maintain them in the peaceful possession and cultivation of their respective farmholdings;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the appellee <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Salud Young or her corporation to desist and cease from cutting down the coconut trees</span> on the respective farmholdings of the appellants, and to respect and secure them in their tenancy rights therein;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Provincial Agrarian Reform Officer</span> of Cebu and the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer of Pardo, Cebu City <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to cause the execution of leasehold instruments</span> on the respective farmholdings of the appellants in relation to the appellee landowner;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">appellees to pay exemplary damages</span> in the amount of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00) and to pay the costs of the suit;

Petitioner argues that for “x x x ignoring the settlement by the parties, the DARAB had inadvertently encourage multiplicity of suits x x x” (Petition, p. 4).<br><br>2.1.3. Respondent DARAB disagrees. For disregarding the alleged settlement, contained in a certification executed by private respondents, in resolving the agrarian dispute raised herein, respondent DARAB, it is respectfully submitted, should not be faulted. Firstly, DARAB is not privy thereto; and, secondly, subject settlement/agreement of the parties contemplated of matters beyond the legal capacity of the parties.<br><br>2.1.2.1. Referred to is the stipulation that the disputed landholding is not agricultural.&nbsp; (Petition, p. 3). <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This cannot be subject of a private settlement since classification of land is a prerogative of the law-making body</span>, either by direct legislation or by delegation of power (Comm.
