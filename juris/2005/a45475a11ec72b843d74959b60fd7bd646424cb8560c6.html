				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Only questions of law may be brought before and ruled upon by the Supreme Court in petitions for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; This principle holds true, particularly for regional trial court decisions brought directly to this Court.&nbsp; If a review of factual questions is sought, the petition should be elevated to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; For failing to observe this basic doctrine, herein petitioner should not expect this Court to pass upon the question of whether he was a mortgagee in good faith and for value.&nbsp; This factual question was already ruled upon by the trial court, whose findings are thus deemed conclusive and binding on the present proceedings.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The Case</span><br></div><br>Before us is a Petition for Review<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, assailing the November 19, 2002 Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig City (Branch 167) in Civil Case No. 67131, as well as its January 24, 2003 Resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration.&nbsp; The assailed Decision disposed thus:<br><blockquote>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEREFORE</span>, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the [respondents] and against [Petitioner] Jose T.

It was the first time respondents learned of any actual mortgage involving their property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>&nbsp; After seeking legal advice,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> they filed an adverse claim on their own title<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and for the first time met with petitioner to settle the matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; While he insisted that they settle the mortgage,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> they manifested their intention to sue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, respondents filed with the Regional Trial Court of Pasig City (assigned to Branch 167) on November 18, 1998, a Complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> against petitioner and Gemma de la Cruz for annulment and cancellation of mortgage.&nbsp; They likewise filed with the Metropolitan Trial Court of Pasig City (assigned to Branch 71) a criminal case against her for falsification of public document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In his Answer, petitioner countered that respondents had connived with De la Cruz to swindle him of his hard-earned savings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> He testified that he had met her and a couple posing as the Guimba spouses ("Guimbas") for the first time in March 1997.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; The Guimbas allegedly asked him for a loan and presented their duplicate copy of TCT No. PT-80617 as collateral.&nbsp; He claimed that he accepted the mortgage only after verifying the authenticity of the Certificate with the Register of Deeds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>During the trial, petitioner admitted that the couple to whom he had given the loan of P335,000 were not herein respondents, whom he met only in December 1997 to discuss the matter of the telegram.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The principal issue presented before the trial court was whether Abad was a mortgagee for value and in good faith.&nbsp; The RTC opined that this question was determinative of the validity of the Deed of Mortgage.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ruling of the Regional Trial Court</span><br></div><br>Assessing the evidence, the trial court found the testimonies offered by petitioner to be conflicting and concocted.&nbsp; It determined that he had never met a couple posing as respondent spouses.&nbsp; Rather, he had dealt solely with De la Cruz over a property that manifestly belonged to the Guimba spouses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>&nbsp; By entering into the mortgage without making the necessary inquiries as to the identity and the authority of the person he was dealing with, he could not be considered a mortgagee in good faith and for value.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Having determined that respondents, as registered owners, had never executed the Deed of Mortgage in favor of petitioner, the trial court held that the instrument was a forgery and, hence, an absolute nullity.&nbsp; Consequently, it ordered the cancellation of the annotation on the TCT of respondents.<br><br>As for petitioner's defense of laches, the lower court ruled that Vivian Guimba could not be belabored for negligence, considering that she had taken the necessary steps to recover her title from De la Cruz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Unsubstantiated by evidence, petitioner's claim of connivance and conspiracy between respondents and De la Cruz was dismissed by the RTC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Denying the Motion for Reconsideration filed by petitioner,&nbsp; the trial court ruled that although the Certificate was admittedly clean on its face, he was not a mortgagee in good faith, because he had not made the necessary inquiries about the true identity of the persons introduced as owners of the subject property.&nbsp; Moreover, he had not presented convincing proof of the negotiation and execution of the mortgage Contract.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>Skipping the Court of Appeals, petitioner lodged his Petition for Review directly with this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]<br></sup><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;

font-weight: bold;">First and Second Issues:</span><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Applicability of PD 1529</span><br></div><br>Petitioner insists on the application of Sections 52<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> and 53<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> of PD 1529 to protect his interest as an <span style="font-style: italic;">innocent</span> holder for value.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether he is, indeed, is at the outset the most crucial question to be resolved in this case.<br><br><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Only Questions of <br>Law Raised in a <br>Rule 45 Petition</span><br></div><br>Preliminarily, we should stress that the remedy of appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court contemplates only questions of law, not of fact.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>&nbsp; Therefore, a party who files a Rule 45 petition waives the opportunity to inquire into the findings of fact of the lower court.<br><br>A question of law exists when there is doubt or controversy as to what the law is on a certain state of facts.&nbsp; There is a question of fact when doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the statement of facts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>&nbsp; The resolution of a question of fact necessarily involves a calibration of the evidence, the credibility of the witnesses, the existence and the relevance of surrounding circumstances, and the probability of specific situations.&nbsp; It is for this reason that this Court defers to the factual findings of a trial judge, who has had the distinct advantage of directly observing the witnesses on the stand and determining from their demeanor whether they were speaking or distorting the truth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>Coming to the present case, the paramount question regarding the good faith of petitioner is obviously one of fact<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> on which the RTC already had the following findings:<br><blockquote>"All told, as mortgagee of a real property, [Petitioner] Abad <span style="font-style: italic;">neglected</span> to make the necessary inquiries and closed his eyes to facts which should put a reasonable man on guard as to the value of the property being presented as collateral and of any flaw in the title of the mortgagor and of the identity of persons being introduced to him as the owners of the property being mortgaged.&nbsp; By merely relying on his belief that there was no defect in the title of the property being presented as collateral and on the identity of the prospective mortgagors being introduced to him without undertaking further investigation, [Petitioner] Abad <span style="font-style: italic;">cannot</span> be considered a mortgagee in good faith and for value."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> [Emphasis supplied]<br></blockquote>If petitioner wanted to assail the correctness of these findings of fact, he should have brought his appeal before the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; He shot himself in the foot, so to speak, by resorting to the wrong remedy and filing his petition in the wrong forum.&nbsp; By his error, or by his deliberate choice of remedy and forum, he must now accept the consequences: the conclusiveness of the factual finding of the trial court that he was a mortgagee in bad faith.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">A Mortgagee in Bad <br>Faith Not Protected <br></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">by PD 1529</span><br><br>The main purpose of land registration, covered by PD 1529, is to facilitate transactions relative to real estate by giving the public the right to rely upon the face of the Torrens certificate of title.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup>&nbsp; Therefore, as a rule, the purchaser is not required to explore further than what the Certificate indicates on its face.&nbsp; This rule, however, applies <span style="font-style: italic;">only to</span> innocent purchasers for value and in good faith; it excludes a purchaser who has knowledge of a defect in the title of the vendor, or of facts sufficient to induce a reasonably prudent man to inquire into the status of the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>&nbsp; Under Section 32 of PD 1529,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> an innocent purchaser for value is deemed to include an innocent mortgagee for value.<br><br>By insisting on the application of PD 1529 in his favor, petitioner begs the question.&nbsp; He invokes Sections 52 and 53 of the law, which protects <span style="font-style: italic;">innocent</span> mortgagees for value, but which the RTC has already determined he was <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>.&nbsp; As already discussed, such factual determination by the trial court is conclusive, because he did not question it in the proper forum.&nbsp; The logical consequence, therefore, is the inapplicability of the said law to his factual situation.<br><br>To be sure, there are exceptions to the rule.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>&nbsp; Petitioner, however, has not given us adequate reasons to apply any of these exceptions; verily, we find no ground to reverse or modify the factual findings of the RTC.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">RTC Decision <br>Consistent With <br>Jurisprudence</span><br><br>Upon the other hand, the RTC's legal conclusions are in accordance with jurisprudence.&nbsp; A person who deals with registered land through someone who is<span style="font-style: italic;"> not</span> the registered owner is expected to look behind the certificate of title and examine <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> factual circumstances, in order to determine if the mortgagor/vendee has the capacity to transfer any interest in the land.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>&nbsp; One has the duty to ascertain the identity of the person with whom one is dealing, as well as the latter's legal authority to convey.<br><br>The law "requires a higher degree of prudence from one who buys from a person who is not the registered owner, although the land object of the transaction is registered.&nbsp; While one who buys from the registered owner does not need to look behind the certificate of title, one who buys from one who is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> the registered owner is expected to examine not only the certificate of title but <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> factual circumstances necessary for [one] to determine if there are any flaws in the title of the transferor, or in [the] capacity to transfer the land."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; Although the instant case does not involve a sale but only a mortgage, the same rule applies inasmuch as the law itself includes a mortgagee in the term "purchaser."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's contention of due diligence and good faith in verifying the authenticity of the Transfer Certificate of Title and finding it clean on its face<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> is beside the point.&nbsp; He was not a mortgagee in good faith, not because he neglected to ascertain the authenticity of the title, but because he did not check if the person he was dealing with had any authority to mortgage the property.&nbsp; There is no allegation whatsoever that Gemma de la Cruz presented a special power of attorney to deal with the property of the Guimbas; and even if we accept the story of petitioner that he was duped by a woman posing as Vivian Guimba, his negligence lies in not verifying her identity before accepting the mortgage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Third Issue:</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">Laches</span><br></div><br>Petitioner likewise contends that respondents were guilty of laches when they neglected to register their adverse claim <span style="font-style: italic;">immediately</span>. Again, he attempts to attack the RTC's factual determination that they had taken the necessary steps to protect their rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup>&nbsp; Seeking its review, he resorted to the wrong remedy in the wrong forum.&nbsp; We repeat, petitions under Rule 45 are limited to the determination of pure questions of law.<br><br>In any case, petitioner's theory that respondents are guilty of laches for belatedly registering an adverse claim is untenable.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">First</span>,&nbsp; the law does not compel them to file an adverse claim.&nbsp; The purpose of that claim is to give notice to third persons of the existence of an interest <span style="font-style: italic;">adverse</span> to that of the registered owner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> In the instant case, respondents <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> the registered owners.&nbsp; The fact that their names appear on the title as absolute owners should already notify third persons, such as petitioner, that they have a clear legal interest in the property.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Second</span>, there is no equitable basis for the application of laches, considering that (1) only nine months had elapsed from the loss of the title to the registration of an adverse claim, (2) no prejudice was caused an innocent purchaser for value, and (3) there was a factual determination by the trial court that respondents had taken the appropriate steps to protect their interests.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Third</span>, even if we assume <span style="font-style: italic;">arguendo</span> that respondents were negligent, petitioner still cannot claim a superior right, considering that he too was negligent; he cannot feign innocence as regards their existing interests as the registered owners.&nbsp; Simply put, their alleged negligence did not prejudice petitioner, who was perfectly aware all the time that the property belonged to them, not to De la Cruz.<br><br>Laches is a doctrine in equity and may not be invoked to resist the enforcement of a legal right.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>&nbsp; Thus, the assertion of laches to thwart the claim of respondents is foreclosed by the finding that petitioner, as a mortgagee in bad faith, is not entitled to the protection of our registration laws.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">DENIED</span> and the assailed Decision and Resolution <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">AFFIRMED</span>.&nbsp; Costs against petitioner.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sandoval-Gutierrez, Carpio-Morales,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Garcia, JJ., </span>concur.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Corona, J., </span>on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="60%" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 3-17.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Id., pp. 18-23.&nbsp; Penned by Judge Alfredo C.
